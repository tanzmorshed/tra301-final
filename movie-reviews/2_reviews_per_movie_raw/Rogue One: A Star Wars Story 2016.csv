"Rusticcrayon","8","353","398","30 December 2018"," What Star Wars should be.
","Yes this review is 2 years after the film's release, but it has to be said that this film is what I hoped all the new Star Wars films would be like. Rouge One to me is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy. The pace and scripting of the movie are great, The story provide just enough time in each of the characters so that you feel invested in what happens to them, and the script is well written compared to any of the recent Star Wars movies, we even get a droid that gives CP3O a run for his money, providing just enough funny quips to keep the movie light in what to me is one of the darkest Star Wars films since the Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards has done the Star Wars universe proud, which sadly can't be said for the current mess that Disney has been releasing.<br/><br/>If you haven't managed to catch Rouge One yet, then give it ago as it will take you back to the fun and action of the originals, and also make you believe that the Star Wars franchise can produce something good when placed in the hands of someone who understood what Star Wars means to its loyal fans.<br/><br/>Is it perfect no, but it's dam close for me, so much so that this is the only Star Wars movie i have bought since the original trilogy."

","What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars."
"aarongnr","10","57","62","31 October 2019"," My personal favourite Star Wars movie.
","Granted, I haven't seen the original trilogy in some time, but as of right now this is the best of ALL Star Wars movies for me.<br/><br/>I will not go into plotpoints because many other reviews on here do that excellently, but I will rather point out why I love this one so much.<br/><br/>And that is because in this movie you can FEEL the stakes. In this one we SEE characters we love die. We see what it took to take down the empire.<br/><br/>Our main hero Jyn doesn't get to live. She is a part of the giant picture and a part of what ultimately ends in the emperors demise.<br/><br/>Basically all main characters of this movie die.<br/><br/>An this is why this movie is so good."
"switchboard85","8","99","111","24 November 2019"," The Best Of The Disney-Era Star Wars Films
","Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.<br/><br/>The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.<br/><br/>The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.<br/><br/>One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.<br/><br/>On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.<br/><br/>If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try."
"dcesar13","9","160","188","27 February 2019"," Back to the roots
","Rogue One is the movie we didn't asked for - but what we got was beyond any expectation. Excellent pacing of the movie. As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>CGI on the past main character seemed odd. But worked well on pilots and scoundrels. Many Easter eggs trough the whole movie are appreciated. Humor from Alan Tudyk's K-2SO was spot on.<br/><br/>Empire Strikes Back is still king of the hill as the best SW movie till date. But Rogue One comes damn close near it."

","This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you."

","This is almost perfect Star Wars. By far the best Star Wars of the new era (including the prequels). Hard to find any fault with it. If only Abrams, Johnson and other took more note of this it might have saved us from some of the faults in those other movies."
"pdrseuss","9","60","74","1 January 2019"," A Surprise Addition to the Classic Trilogy
","This is probably my 2nd favorite Star Wars movie. (My favorite will be revealed shortly.) The team that wrote, directed, and scored this film should do all of the future movies. Not since The Phantom Menace have I seen a movie worthy to be called a Star Wars film. (The other 2 prequel movies were cool, but I consider them Palpatine's story. And rightly so, as Palpatine is probably one of cinema's greatest villains.) Rogue One could have been a true fiasco by riding on the strands of story about the capturing of the Death Star plans, and if it was made any later, it would have been probably considered ""yet another Death Star film"". But Rogue One had character, characters, heart, dialogue, grit, and pacing just as much as the original/classic trilogy had, and I feel is a welcome addition to be embraced. It truly made you cheer for the rebel alliance, and weep for their sacrifices against the fearsome Empire.<br/><br/>My favorite Star Wars film is The Empire Strikes Back."

"joowanpark","9","512","723","16 December 2016"," Beats JJ Abram's Farce Awakens
","Just like the thousands of Star Wars fans out there in the world, I was absolutely giddy when I heard that J.J. Abrams was taking the director's helm for the seventh installment of George Lucas's beloved space opera. After I saw the Force Awakens, I was not sure how I felt about the movie. It has gotten so many rave reviews and I desperately wanted to feel the same way. After some time since its release and the adrenaline rush has worn out, I can honestly say that it was a big disappointment for me as a Star Wars fan. I will not get into the reasons as to why that is since the top reviews of Force Awakens do a superb job pointing out the flaws of that monstrosity.<br/><br/>So anyhow, I went to see this film with low expectations because of my previous disappointment with the recent addition of the Star Wars franchise. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards puts the WARS in Star Wars unlike I've seen AND felt in the previous films. The dark and serious tone of the film makes you feel the rebel's fear of gruesome warfare as they fight against the more well- equipped and ruthless Empire. At one point, the film was reminiscent of WWII films due to its excellent portrayal of battle scenes. <br/><br/>The acting and dialogue was for the most part well done, and the comic reliefs in the film did not feel as forced as *ahem FORCED Awakens.<br/><br/>The director also does an excellent job connecting the prequels and the original series together. If a viewer sees the series in the numbered order with this film, the story line will play out seamlessly.<br/><br/>And lastly, Darth Vader's scenes in the film definitely adds a terrifying legacy to his name. I will not spoil the scenes for you, but he portrays ruthlessness here that was not seen in the other films. The viewer will have a better grasp as to why he is such a feared character in the universe.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams diminished my love for Star Wars. This film has brought back hope in me for the franchise once more as Jyn Erso has done with the rebels."

Thank you Garth Edwards, you have given back the fun where others have failed.
Johnson's 'Last Jedi' was just awfully bad."
"praveenjha-77481","8","40","51","9 January 2019"," Rogue One is what the Star Wars saga can boast of itself
","Well after a long time I finally got my hands on first Star Wars anthology film that is Rogue One. Being a cinephile I simply couldn't control my excitement to begin with all those teaser-trailer stuff and jumped onto the Star Wars saga and what I saw can be summarised in a single word that is ""amazing"". Yes you heard it right, ""amazing"" is the term which is best suited for Rogue One. Finally after a long time I can confidently state that this movie is a well crafted peice of art to find its way under Star Wars belt. Gareth Edwards has done an impressive job by directing this film and in my opinion he should have been given a Star Wars trilogy of his own to direct. Rogue One like every great movie has its own sets of strengths and flaws which are discussed below.
First lets begin with the strength:
1. Story- Rogue One being an anthology film is something that perfectly fills in the void between the Revenge of Sith and A New Hope. It brilliantly bridges the gap between these two movies. Story is engaging, interesting and on the same hand has strong essence of emotion that creates a lasting impact on your mind. Infact it is one of those trademark star wars film in which emotional part takes the upper hand.
2. Screenplay- as I have stated earlier Gareth Edwards has done an amazing job which can be seen here.
3. Characters - a lot of people have stated the lack of character development as weakness of this movie. But in my opinion the lack of character development is more overshadowed by some really great characters that are introduced in this film and have the calibre to be remembered for a long time in the entire Star Wars Saga. Characters like chirrut imuwe, cassian, bodhi and K-2SO are simply among the best characters of star wars till date.
4. BGM - background music of movie as usual is good and syncs well with the situation. Infact the signature soundtrack of star wars can leave your heart brimming up with emotions during and after the film.
5. Visuals - visuals and CGI are one of the best part of the film. Though some people criticized the use of CGI to create General Tarkin and Leia Organa but according to me if you see it in another way that shows the hardwork done by the director and his efforts to make this film a treat for star wars audience. The film consists of some of the best war scenes between Rebel alliance and Empire along with the bunch of believers that strive to make this rebellion a success.
Now lets come to the flaws:
1. Opening Crawl - this is the first star wars film till date that has no opening crawl in the beginning along with trademark music of John Williams that used to grab the attention of audience from the very first scene reminding them of the tension brewing in galaxy (which I think is the most important as we come to know that what actually happened after the last star wars film ended and what is the situation in galaxy now)and that they are watching no ordinary scene but a Star Wars film.
2. Another problem is with the potrayal of Darth Vader. The scene in which the Vader is introduced in the film, he seemed to be a bit off from the Vader we are used to see in the previous star wars movie. Though the light saber battle involving Vader on spaceship during climax is one of the best Vader scenes I have seen till date (trust me it is intense), still the potrayal of Vader in his introduction scene is a bit weak which I think is a injustice done to the character of one of the most dangerous villains of galaxy.
3. Another thing that I would regard as downpoint is that the character of Galen Erso and Saw Garrera should have been given more screen time. They were killed off soon without some significant contribution to the story. Though Galen Erso builds a flaw in Death Star which enables rebels to destroy it still his character was off-screen the entire time and on-screen he died sooner he made his appearance in front of general. Saw garrera's character should also have been given more of screen presence as it was played by a prominent actor and his death was not an essential requirement of story.
4. This is first star war film in years where there is no jedi and no trademark light saber battles between dark force and bright side. Though it was important for the story but conflict of jedis is something I always look towards in a star wars film. Though there is light sabee batter involving Vader but it is a small scene against rebel soldiers and not some light saber wielding jedi.
In the end after pondering over all the strengths and weakness in the film I will conclude the Rogue One is one of the best star wars film ever made after original trilogy and had the capability to be the best one if some flaws were eradicated. But still I will regard it as an amazing star wars saga in years a film that has completely worthy of its inclusion in your must watch films list and my favourite star wars film after the original trilogy in star wars cinematic universe."

"BiiivAL","9","244","353","2 June 2018"," What the VII episode didnt become
","Long ago, when I had a poor understanding of the cinematographic universe, when the plot of films was deeply indifferent to me, I saw a wonderful film in which the hero escaped in the belly of a dead unknown beast, and giant metal elephant-turtles walked along the snow-covered planet. And, I did not think that these feelings can be repeated in adulthood.<br/><br/>Unexpected discovery: Rogue One, one woke a child in me, although the plot was clear, and there was no infantile desire to jump into tact with gunfights and fights. It was just great. It was just a classic trilogy, elevated to the absolute. It's just the same as many years ago. And, what is very important, without any hidden pathos, without an obsessive director's ""wink"" in the style of ""well, you realized that this character returned and everyone giggles and applauds.""<br/><br/>So, Rogue One, of course, is a fresh look. This is another camera work. These are other perspectives and, as was rightly noted in trailer analyzes, this is an amazing work with scales. The director and the cameraman made things that you believe in. You believe in the size of the Death Star. Believe in the size of the Star Destroyer. And, okay, it would be one thing: launched a comparative infographics, and finished on that one. No, here all objects of space are constantly involved in some kind of action. The Death Star moves, the Destroyers engage in battle, the transport workers, fighter jets and bombers are fighting alongside. This is a ""wow"", this is ""super"", this is the star thriller we wanted. The fighter in which the fighters actually shoot down the enemy, and the bombers cause point torpedo strikes, where the technique creates a real cover, and not just ""hanging around for the crowd"", as in the Awakening of the Force. And, yes, this is the very setting of the fights that was in the original trilogy. I am delighted. This is a new operator's view of the old scale of star battles.<br/><br/>The next moment is the preservation of the style of Lucas. Here everything pleases not less. This is a city similar both to Naboo I episode and Tatooine IV episode. This is nature, similar to what we saw in the second part (during the rapprochement of Anakin with Amidala), or on Kashyyyk with its battles in the woods. Everything looks natural and beautiful. There are no eared adherents of the dark side, wading through unnatural winter forests, built on an old 3D engine. The whole environment looks beautiful, relevant, familiar in the atmosphere. It seems that this is called landscape design.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is not snotty, does not shine with pathos. Everything happens naturally. Heroes look vital, at first glance, there is no logic. The actors also played very well. Emotions want to believe, the motivation is clear.<br/><br/>VII episode of the Star Wars exported at the expense of the name. If you remove the name, you will receive a parody of the IV part with comical physics and a trash story. But Rogue One is a terrific epic saga. One of the best films in the universe of Star Wars."

The second half of this movie was brilliant and was on the edge of my seat to the very end. I respect Gareth Edwards for some of the choices made in the end of the movie which mainly landed. One of the bigger issues with this movie is the pacing of the movie as I have said that the first half of this movie is very slow but eventually gets going and thats why really I really it up to and 8/10 for me. So I would definitely recommend it, and check it out immediately."
"azanti0029","10","880","1445","13 December 2016"," Gareth Edwards has done it - The prequel story that Star Wars deserved.
","With all the rumours flying about that Disney had interfered with the creative process on this one, just as when Alderaan blew up - I feared the worse. Fortunately my fears were unfounded. <br/><br/>Rogue one is as engrossing as it is seamless and while its not perfect it had everything required to make a great movie. I guess everyone has different expectations of Star Wars. The plot which I will only briefly describe involves a group of rebels attempting to secure the plans to the Death Star, the designer of which, having a morale conscience, built the deliberate flaw (The exhaust port which Stewie Darth Vader asked about in Family Guy) so that it could be easily destroyed as long as the information fell into the right hands. This information is contained in an archive and it falls to the daughter of the designer, Jyn Erso, to not only restore her fathers name but get the designs to the rebels who are just itching to get on with events in Episode Four (New Hope) and blow the thing up.<br/><br/>So does it hold up? Well, yes, not only does it hold up I would put this film on par with Empire and also Episode IV and this coming from someone who saw the first film on the silver screen in 1977. Gareth Edwards is a director who understands all the combined elements that make a Star Wars Film great. First a good script with the right mix of drama, action, pathos and humour and above all a story that actually makes sense, secondly good well written, rounded, characters that are interesting, diverse and unique, third great visuals - there's so many memorable shots in this film and so many of them are the shots you always wanted to see, fourth well directed action that looks and feels real, that is tense and that you can follow, fifth - tension, this film has it in spades, Sixth nods and references to the original trilogy - they come in abundance, some are comedic, some pure nostalgia while others are entirely appropriate and work so well within the story. Seventh - real sets, please give me a London Underground station redressed over bland CGI sterile sets any day of the week. Here the technology enhances the story and the tension and at no time tries to substitute for either. It is the perfect mix of live action & CG effects. I have not seen them so well combined since Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>This is a man who clearly understands his craft of what makes for a great film. I was highly critical of the prequel movies, which really are a masterclass in how not to make a film, here the total opposite is true. I am not a die hard Star Wars fan in any sense and was fully prepared to be very critical of this film, but find it hard to find fault in it anywhere. The supporting cast were especially good here, everyone from Riz Ahmed to Forest Whitaker giving it their all. The new villain of the piece is brilliantly played by Ben Mendelson (Hard to believe this is the kid from The Big Steal!) Donnie Yen's character was beautifully written, I could have watched another movie just about him alone. The cast feels truly international, as any universe should. Many British actors really make their mark in smaller roles including Duncan Pow & Ben Daniels as Rebel Foot Solider and General Pilot respectively while the likes of Sharon Duncan-Brewster & Jonathon Aris as Rebel Senators argue the merits of the attack in a tense conference debate - gone are the boring council meetings of the prequels. Strong drama is the key ingredient of the day. Here the Rebellion is shown as a far more tangible real faction, not everyone agrees with each other, things get messy and sometimes the wrong people are killed - the film even begs to ask the question, how better really are they than the Empire??? - we know of course, but its great to see such shades rather than just plain good and bad guys.<br/><br/>The film contains so many pure Star Wars moments. I have no doubt the Droid (Voiced with skill by Alan Tudky) will become a favourite of many and new aliens and ship designs are not thin on the ground.<br/><br/>Chiefly in the acting credits, plaudits must go to Felicity Jones who plays Jyn with real conviction while Diego Luna avoids a Han Solo portrayal of Cassian, her would be ally and sometimes adversary. The appearances of Vader and Tarkin (Incredible) are entirely warranted and in proportion with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>One or two of the subplot characters are a little underwritten (perhaps deleted scenes and a longer cut will reveal them to be less so) but that really is nit picking, I had no issue with this at all. To juggle so many major and minor characters in a single narrative in a tight running time, for any director is no mean feat and Edwards manages it extremely well. <br/><br/>I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story - Whatever were his obstacles, he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class."

Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. <br/><br/>Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it."
"gareth-mattison-887-252489","5","653","1113","16 December 2016"," Ultimately Underwhelming
","I've been an avid Star Wars fan since 1977. I've seen all the live action films multiple times and even sat through the Holiday Special and the Ewok spin-offs. I was looking forward to Rogue One and booked tickets well in advance for the first show of the first day.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find the cinema mostly deserted - especially after the full houses I experienced during the first couple of weeks of The Force Awakens' run. <br/><br/>Having watched all the trailers, TV spots and clips, I had a good idea what to expect and, as the film began, those expectations were justified. This was a more 'grown-up' Star Wars: darker, more violent and morally ambiguous. I was loving it and thinking it might well turn out to be my new favourite Star Wars film.<br/><br/>But... it began to feel very rushed. The action sequences and special effects were superb and there was no doubt this was a film set in the Star Wars universe but characters were being introduced and killed-off at such a pace it was hard to keep up and even harder to care about them. We were whizzed at breakneck pace from planet to planet (complete with some slightly jarring captions to tell us where we were) and then it suddenly began to sag. <br/><br/>As the hastily assembled Rebel crew went on their mission to find Galen I began to lose interest and even found myself nodding off. It was all a bit boring.<br/><br/>The pace soon picked up and I got back into it but I was disappointed with Vader's first appearance and completely distracted by the CGI Tarkin. Vader seemed too small physically, the voice sounded off and the dialogue (especially the final quip) seemed out of character. Resurrecting Peter Cushing in digital form was a brave move but the technology is still not quite there and I began to feel more detached from the plot and characters as I analysed the strangeness of his appearance. <br/><br/>As the film moved to its final act, I was wowed by the visuals but, by now, I had no real interest in the characters and their deaths just came and went with no emotional impact. In fact, my mind was wandering as I noticed more and more how much of the previously released footage wasn't in the final cut of the film - including some of the most spectacular shots such as the TIE fighter looming in front of Jyn on the gantry and the beautiful shot of Krennic striding towards the shore surrounded by the floating bodies of his troops. Rogue One had lost me and was beginning to disappoint.<br/><br/>As Vader made his final appearance I was, at last, feeling some excitement. It was a great scene but... that final shot of CGI Leia was a real 'What? Why? No!' moment. Terrible. Less in this case would definitely have been more.<br/><br/>As the film ended, there was no applause and everybody got up and left immediately, leaving me to watch the credits alone feeling more than a little underwhelmed. It is not a bad film. The design and special effects (CGI human faces not withstanding) are superb. The cast are interesting and do a good job with very limited characterisation. But Rogue One ultimately failed to involve me emotionally in the story or characters and, in the end, it kind of felt like watching somebody else play a beautiful video game."

"Movie_Riggs","8","94","153","17 December 2016"," Star Wars: Episode 3.5 - The Best Entry Since the Original Trilogy
","First, I have to get out of the way: I am a huge fan of 'Star Wars', and have been since I was five. I love all six movies, but was very disappointed by 'The Force Awakens' and don't include it in my own personal canon. With Disney's takeover of the franchise and the announcement that a new film would be released each year, and the underwhelming trailers for this movie, I was convinced I could look down the path and see 'Star Wars' becoming nothing more than another Marvel-ized blockbuster franchise existing only for making money.<br/><br/>Maybe that is still Disney's intention, but at least all hope is not lost. 'Rogue One' was amazing. I'll admit, it took about 20 minutes for me to get sucked into the story, but as I became more and more invested in it, this started to represent more than just a spin off, and it acted as more than an extended episode of 'Rebels'. This became official canon to me. The characters are not nearly as compelling as anything we've seen before; even Felicity Jones lacks the charisma that Daisy Ridley had as Rey. But it's the story that drives this film forward; it turns out that there is a lot to tell about the days before Luke Skywalker was drawn into the Rebellion. And when it all comes down in the final act...it just blew me away. I do have to acknowledge that all the main heroes die. I was worried that this would not happen, because Disney would not have the balls to do it. Fortunately they realized that it would make no sense for Jyn Erso to survive this film and not appear in the OT, so I have to praise this movie for the same reason I praised 'The Magnificent Seven' a few months ago. When the final scene of this movie comes, and we know it is mere hours before C-3PO and R2-D2 escape Tantive IV with the Rebel plans, all is paid off. <br/><br/>Finally I must talk spoilers. I can't help myself. Grand Moff Tarkin was brought back to life extraordinarily, much better than Dain in 'The Hobbit'. Darth Vader's brief appearances are all I could have asked for; one of the final scenes includes him slaughtering an entire squad of rebel troops. Cameos include the two roughs from the Cantina that try to pick a fight with Luke, R2 and 3PO themselves, and they even reused footage from 'A New Hope' so that Red Leader and Gold Leader could make appearances in the space battle! Red Five is shot down in action, telling us why Luke gets that callsign later on. They did everything they could have possibly done with this movie and then some! <br/><br/>The final shot of the film is a young Princess Leia, telling her men that now, they have been given hope. And just when I thought 'Star Wars' was doomed, that's what this movie gave me: hope. And a chance to rate the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'Return of the Jedi' an unexpected and pleasing 9/10 stars."

","Having grown up with the original trilogy being the Christmas movies on UK terrestrial television (80s) and a life long star wars fan, I can safely say this film is the best of them all.<br/><br/>A bold statement some may say, prior to this it was the Empire Strikes Back (don't get me wrong it's still right up there next to this) but Rogue One pinches it marginally.<br/><br/>It has everything, the best droid, the best battle scenes, the best Darth Vader fight scene (albeit short), the best death star scenes, great soundtrack, decent characters and a fantastic somber ending.<br/><br/>The more I watch it on repeat the better it gets, I'm sure many will disagree with me, I don't care, this film ticks all the boxes. If you liked the original trilogy and maybe disliked the Jar Jar joke fest, give this a shot, you won't be disappointed."

","I wish we could erase Disney's disgraceful new trilogy and replace it with spin-offs like this. Rogue One is a literal war drama and the prequel to Episode IV. It's more serious than ever, darker then ever and this should have been the direction for all current Star Wars projects. I was blown by how great it was. The actors were amazing, the story was thrilling, the visuals left me speechless. It's a joke that The Force Awakens is on a higher score than this. Rogue One is superior in every way."

","I've just returned from the midnight showing of Rogue One here in the UK. I was slightly sceptical after watching Force Awakens, while enjoyed FA it did lack teeth and flesh.<br/><br/>Rogue one was a great prequel to New Hope.<br/><br/>We know that Princess Leigh had the death star plans but how did she get them ??.<br/><br/>Well now we know.<br/><br/>A few minutes into the film I felt disappointed that there was no Star Wars theme or rolling credits. Once I got past this the film started coming to life and put you right into the star wars universe. <br/><br/>There were nudges to the originals everywhere, old characters from New Hope were brought to live to return to the big screen.<br/><br/>There was plenty of visual eye candy here and a climactic ending that was truly stunning. I want to watch it again to see all the little details.<br/><br/>This is a dark and emotional film compared to others but it has its light hearted moments also.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away we follow a rag tag bunch fighting against the Empire and Lord Vader. A lost girl, a rebel agent, a defector, a novice trainee of the force, a hot shot gunner and a reprogrammed imperial robot. Alongside the rebel alliance they discover the existence of the Empires latest super weapon and must a find a way to destroy it. <br/><br/>The Bad - <br/><br/>1.Some of the dialogue is wooden but this goes for all Star Wars film. <br/><br/>2. There is a lull in action about midway through and the dark scenes at this point may bore some people.<br/><br/>3. No Jedi<br/><br/>The Good - <br/><br/>1.

","I personally am a big Star Wars fan, hearing rumours throughout the year of the reshooting and worry within Disney had me cautious about this movie, hoping rather than expecting it to be a great one. I brought my pop (who tends to be very critical of movies) along this time who had never seen a Star Wars movie and never has wanted to watch one. I felt as if this was a great opportunity to bring him along because of it being a standalone movie that has a start and end. The director did an absolutely brilliant job, helped give us a good understanding of the characters whilst moving the story along the way at an appropriate pace to a massive climax, the actor behind the blind monk was the star of the film for me and I definitely think Felicity Jones did a great job as the lead actress of the film The acting cast did a great job to capture the emotion of the movie without overdoing it which was incredibly pleasing to see. For me, it sits just behind Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars film and as for pop, came out of the film not saying anything just grinning as much as I've ever seen him until he was dropped off home, where he got out with a wink and said 'Thanks for inviting me, loved every minute of it'"
"armandoslaviero","6","286","509","15 December 2016"," OK But Far From Great
","I went into this movie with an open mind to a Star Wars story as distinct from the Star Wars series of movies. I left feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of very good things in this movie but the script was very, very ordinary. Endless dialogue that was quiet frankly boring and pointless at times. Being a huge SW fan most of my life, i really wanted to love another SW movie but not this one. I can see why they reshot scenes and were worried about this film.<br/><br/>Pros: Last 40 mins of film was great - awesome battle; Good special effects; Likable main characters; Great new vehicles - i can see the toys coming; Lots of nods and references for die hard fans.<br/><br/>Cons: Incoherent and boring script; Numerous mentions of ""the force"" but with no heart to them; Planets/worlds could have been developed with more imagination; Stormtroopers are killed so easily in this film- just have to look at them; Too long. More editing required to move it along faster; Some characters were pointless or not developed properly.<br/><br/>I am feeling very nervous about Star Wars VIII now!"
"richarddyer-84753","8","19","27","11 January 2019"," Hits the spot which The Force Awakens missed
","Not only is this film good in itself and fully respecting the the lore of everything before it, it ties into Episode 4 literally seamlessly and actually fixes plot holes (or at least open questions) from Episode 4 - i.e. Why the Death Star had a design flaw and why there was only one copy of the Death Star plans. This is really where TFA misses the mark...and where TLJ turned up to the wrong archery tournament two weeks late with a set of golf clubs.<br/><br/>The characters and acting are great, the story line makes sense and the tension is held at the right level all the way through the film.<br/><br/>The fact that it ends up being a suicide mission, has drier sense of humour than we're used to and the rebellion is portrayed as being ruthless when necessary means that it's not so suitable for younger viewers, but that's no complaint.<br/><br/>I would say an 8 is a bit high for this as a stand-alone film, but fitting any new film into the existing Star Wars universe introduces constraints, and when those constraints are handled this well, it deserves some credit.<br/><br/>All in all, if Disney could churn one of these out each year or two, the fans would keep coming, and I would die a happy man."
"dormesher-21565","9","4","4","15 December 2019"," Fantastic Movie
","Rogue One A Star Wars Story. A fantastic story in the Star Wars series that adds alot to A New Hope telling story of how the Death Star Plans where stolen.<br/><br/>The characters introduced are great Jyn Erso is an amazing character to bring into the Star Wars Universe.
I also really like what this adds to the Star Wars Universe even answering questions like why the Death Star has that weakness it was her father who put it in on purpose to give the rebels a chance.<br/><br/>The effects are amazing and the technology used to bring back Tarkin and Leia look amazing and seeing Tarkin in Star Wars again was really nostalgic for me.
Krennic was an interesting character and played a decent villain.<br/><br/>Darth Vader has some really great moments in this one and definitely one of the best moments in Star Wars with him killing the Rebels at the end such great scene.
I also really like the moment on Mustafa and Vader on that planet again ties in the Prequels really well and the fact they got James Earl Jones back was genious.<br/><br/>My only real problem with this movie is we don't really get a chance to bound with the characters it's more about the mission rather then the characters.
However there are still some emotional moments like when Jyns find out her father died but its more about mission and what that mission does for the big picture in Star Wars.
And the journey this film takes us on is awesome.<br/><br/>The space battle on Scariff was amazing and definitely the best in Star Wars it was Phenomenonal to watch and the effects where amazing and its definitely my favourite moment in this film the whole third act up to seeing Leia is just pure Star Wars.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.8/10 a fantastic Star Wars movie with a great action and great new characters it also adds alot to A New Hope and answers alot of questions about the Death Star and how the rebels stole the plans. Some wicked Vader moments aswell and the final act is just pure Star Wars."

"alexarag","7","311","565","15 December 2016"," An Amazing Addition to the Star Wars Saga—5/5 For Star Wars (Spoiler Free)
","Gareth Edwards and his crew accomplished something I never thought would be possible: they contributed a great Star Wars film to the Star Wars saga and canon.<br/><br/>This movie was great as far as Star Wars is concerned. It truly *felt* like a real Star Wars movie, and not a cheap fan service attempt like the Force Awakens was (although the Force Awakens was very fun, it felt like it didn't take Star Wars itself seriously enough).<br/><br/>So what worked with this one? Here's the list:<br/><br/>1)The story. <br/><br/>It felt like a totally believable space fantasy story, and furthermore a totally believable Star Wars story. It clearly was Gareth Edwards doing his own thing with Star Wars but also paying total respect to the path George Lucas originally paved with a New Hope.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this story is a GOOD Star Wars story and it feels like it can be placed alongside the original trilogy in story quality.<br/><br/>2)Not only the story, but the fact it was taken seriously.<br/><br/>Whether you like the Force Awakens or not, you got to admit, it felt a bit cartoony. It didn't feel like a *serious* addition to the Star Wars saga. It felt as if that the people involved certainly liked Star Wars, but in a very fan-servicy sort of way. Everything felt very ""fun"" in the Force Awakens, but not serious. Rogue One doesn't fall into this trap. It was an amusing and fun ride surely, but the story was clearly priority here.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the story elements and movie went *dark* when it needed to and didn't hold back. If the story needed death, that's what we saw. If it needed to show slaughter and killing, we saw it.<br/><br/>3)No element of Star Wars was abused.<br/><br/>There was no over abuse of lighstabers, the Force, or any old Star Wars characters. Wherever there was any fan service in this movie, it was done VERY tastefully. A respectful nod to the previous movies, but it never went ""HEY LOOK HOW COOL THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GUYS LOVE, RIGHT?""<br/><br/>4)The characters and the actors that played them.<br/><br/>Star Wars is never going to be known as a movie with ""great acting"", but full credit should go to the actors in this edition of Star Wars. They did a great job of bringing life to these characters— enough for us to care about them and the action occurring on screen, but not so much that it distracted from the ensemble story.<br/><br/>5)The pacing. This movie was perfect Star Wars pacing. And by perfect Star Wars pacing, I refer to Empire Strikes Back. This was not an overly speedy movie that gave you no time to think, and yet it was not an overly slow and drawn out movie.<br/><br/>6)The tie-in with the original trilogy.<br/><br/>This story takes place before A New Hope. And as much as Rogue One completely does it's own thing and takes its own direction as a standalone film, it *beautifully* ties in with the original series. As I said above, I completely believe and accept this story as great Star Wars material as much as I do George Lucas' original stories.<br/><br/>Overall, this Star Wars film is a 5/5 Star Wars film. I only rate it 7/10 on IMDb because, well, Star Wars is Star Wars and not the Godfather :D. As far as Rogue One stands in movie history, it's a great action movie. But as a Star Wars film it now has a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>My personal new Star Wars top 3 ranking goes as follows: 1)Empire Strikes Back 2)A New Hope 3)Rogue One"
"j_forbesy","9","472","872","14 December 2016"," Rogue One Review
","Rogue One is the first Star Wars film to be set outside the Episodic Sagas. With that, there was a lot of pressure on it to perform and launch this new series of Star Wars films.<br/><br/>By far, this is the least kid friendly film. This was at it's core, a war film, something we have never really gotten in the Star Wars universe. With the war theme we got an overall darker tone than we are use to, and it really suited the story they were telling. We never have experienced the war side of Star Wars because the stories have always been focused on a force user rather than the events around them. Because there are no jedi, we got to see more of the Rebellion and the Empire and the battle that is taking place during the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Offsetting the darker tone of the film, I thought this was perhaps the funniest Star Wars film. There are so many one liners and comedic moments that brings a lighter tone to the darker moments. I think much of the comedic moments came from the droid character K2SO. For the most part, he was the comedic relief and because of that, you are drawn to his character and is a stand out.<br/><br/>While still on the cast and characters, I thought they were near perfect. While the characters themselves aren't as fleshed out as we get during the saga films, for the role themselves, they served their purpose. Apart from K2SO, I thought Donnie Yen's character, Chirrut was a close second standout. I really enjoyed his character because of his connection into the Star Wars law.<br/><br/>How much you enjoy Rogue One is, for the most part, going to depend how deep you invested you are into the world of Star Wars. As someone who read Cataylst in the lead up to Rogue One, I felt as though my experience during this film was enhanced so much. There were so many moments that was so much meaningful and heartfelt because I knew the backstory to some of these events and characters. There is also a lot fan service in Rogue One that on paper, it seems like it's too much. But what stood out was that not one of the fan services felt shoed in. All of it felt like it had a place in the movie and should of been there regardless of if it was a fan service moment or not.<br/><br/>Walking out of this film, you are going to be on a high and that is because of the fantastic third act this film has. Rogue One has a third act that will rival that of Return of the Jedi. This is one of the best space battle I have ever seen. While I love the one in Return of the Jedi, personally I rank the opening battle from Revenge of the Sith above it. However, the space battle in Rogue One beats them all. It had the feel that Return of the Jedi brought in their space battle but with the action and visual effects the space battle in Revenge of the Sith.<br/><br/>Stepping back from the space battle, the third act has a terrific ground level fight. This was where the war tone was heavily present. This was a scene we see in a WWII war film but with a Star Wars skin. There's no better way to describe it, and that is a good thing. What really enhanced the war toned ground fight was how well it was edited between the action happening on the ground and the spectacle of a space battle happening above them.<br/><br/>I have to mention Vader. While he isn't in it all that much, when he is, his presence is felt. Without giving so much away, his final scene is perhaps one of my favourite scenes I have ever seen. The short scene alone rivals the Airport scene in Captain America: Civil War for me. It is so exciting that it has the capability to make any major Star Wars fans cry with happiness.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this movie. This did what it need to do and prove that they can make Star Wars films that isn't all lightsabers and Skywalkers. But what this film does the best is enhance A New Hope. As soon as I walked out the cinema I wanted to go and watch A New Hope. Personally, I really struggle with watching A New Hope but with Rogue One it makes me excited to go back and watch the original Star Wars.<br/><br/>9/10"
"beylie","8","249","458","14 December 2016"," Better than I thought
","I didn't have any expectations for this. I thought it was well handled, even some of the controversial characters (I think one character specifically is going to split the SW community in two). The action sequences were great! Ground combat, space combat, melee, all done beautifully. I actually felt tired at the end of the movie because of the amount of things that were going on. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is too short for us to get to know the back stories of some of the more interesting characters. I'd recommend this too any SW fan. It's great to see a movie dedicated to the people that made helped the rebels take on the empire.<br/><br/>I think I might even like this more than SW VII. Either way, you're bound to enjoy it. It's a great chapter in the SW universe."

","Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful.

"Kevin-42","Null","391","745","13 December 2016"," star WARS
","The strange thing about this movie is that it is more of a war drama than the sci-fi adventure one might expect from a Star Wars story. It is dark, it is gritty and the main characters are traumatized and made homeless by a brutal civil war waged by an oppressive Empire. Consequently, the main characters don't start out as heroes but turn into heroes by the choices they make. It is in many ways the most realistic description ever shown in a Star Wars movie of how ordinary people become warriors because there isn't much of an alternative but fight. ""The time to fight is NOW!"" and the actors do a great job of conveying that feeling to the audience. Sprinkled in is a fair bit of humor and comedic relief. We get good creature designs, ample special effects and a lot of fighting: Ground battle, urban combat, space engages, close quarter fighting; you name it, they give it to us. And don't think those fights are Disney squeaky clean. To a degree you get war in all its nasty brutality. The final result is a good action movie set in the Star Wars universe. Somewhat lacking in the light saber and Force aspects a true fan might wish for but still well worth the money you spend on it.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"mungflesh","9","112","201","28 December 2016"," At last - a decent, new Stars Wars movie
","What a return to form for Star Wars! I've seen this twice already and the second time was pretty much as exhilarating at the first. It's not just 'not crap' - it's actually great, and the first time in a while I didn't want a movie to end.<br/><br/>I won't go into the story details. Star Wars fans should know what this is about and those who aren't fans are a bit hopeful by this point in time if they think watching the latest one will change their minds. Those who are somewhere in between are more likely to enjoy this than the prequels.<br/><br/>Episode 7 had promise but Abrams' movie fell short. He fixed the issues that everyone had been griping about since the prequels, except that he brought a bunch of new ones instead (like too much pop culture and forced attempts at comic relief).<br/><br/>Rogue 1 is really well written. There's such a huge difference between this and the prequels, or Episode 7. The story manages to stay interesting and coherent throughout, without glaring contradictions to itself or the rest of the franchise. The characters become interesting quickly, and you do end up giving a damn about them by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Like kids in candy stores, Lucas and Abrams both made these movies with too much new technology at their disposals and too many potential ideas flying around; restraint was required on both their parts. Gareth Edwards, on the other hand has managed to get the ingredients right and, dare I say it, takes the franchise to a few new places.<br/><br/>Rogue 1 is not the powerhouse of a movie that The Empire Strikes Back is but it does offer, ironically, A New Hope for the Star Wars universe."

","Not sure whether it posted or not, but I wrote a positive review a few days ago and watched Rogue One again since then and I respect it even more. RE watchability is a sign of a great work. Mediocre oeuvres almost always lose their shine after repeated experiences.
One negative remark then all positive. It's an epidemic in movies today that important lines or character introductions receive muddled and often muddied treatment. At home, one can repeat or use subtitles, but in the cinema if one doesn't understand a line because the actor raced through it or the sound guys added so much atmosphere noise that the viewer missed info. This combined with Star Wars tendency to cast guys with thick accents means the first time viewer may be wondering what's going on. The names are fanciful and unfamiliar and then the movie often lacks scenes firmly establishing identities. I know some hate when exposition is too obvious, but it's their job to find graceful ways to do it. Characters are talking about Cassian and I had no idea who he was until much later cuz I don't remember the ID scene. Maybe it's there and I'll see it the 3rd time. I saw Star Wars in 1977 and I understood what was going on, and I was an easily distracted kid. Very different with Rogue One: Riz Ahmed raced through his crucial lines about being an Imperial pilot defector with plans to hand over to Saw so fast, I had to rewind.
I don't watch nearly a many movies as most folks, but I see enough to know I'm sick of CGI. Rogue One had just the right amount and use. It was never annoying or excessive IMO. My first review stated I wish for a better score. The second time I listened more carefully realizing Michael Giacchino was responsible and I have great respect for him. I think he could have equaled or rivaled John Williams ,but I suspect he may have held back. Just a theory, No factual basis.
I miss the cast. I so wish they didn't have to die. I remember not giving a s--t whether Qui Gon? Liam Neeson died. I still don't care about Re or Kylo, but I hated to see this bunch of heros die. I like them a lot more than the people in the other Disney StarWars films.Their humor and lack of stiffness recalled the rapport entre les i.e. the rapport among the '77-'83 cast."

","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is directed by Gareth Edwards and takes place between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars series. This film is highly entertaining, as it contains some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series. At moments the CGI is jaw dropping. Visually this movie is great. Also the storyline is quite interesting, as explains unknown information which leads to what occurs in episode 4. The characters were likeable and well acted, although they were not given enough depth. The audience knows little to nothing about most characters and it really makes it hard to connect and feel for them at times. Also the score by Michael Giacchino sounds a little rushed at times as he was only given 4 weeks to write the music. I feel that there could have been more creative sounds based around the themes by John Williams. Overall I really enjoyed Rogue One. It's a film that really entertained me, particularly in the 3rd act. It's no where near the best Star Wars film, so therefore I give it a 7."

"darcontek","1","530","1031","16 December 2016"," This is a fan fiction film
","I saw this movie today and this was the first Star Wars film that I wanted to walk out on.<br/><br/>Here are my grips with the movie<br/><br/>1. NO OPENING CRAWL - It seems like the people who made this movie did not consider consistency to be important in the Star Wars franchise. This is the first movie in the franchise to not have an opening crawl and not having consistency really shows in the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>2. BAD PACING and TRANSITION - In the beginning of the movie you have the camera jump from random planets without any real explanation as to what is going on and this type of camera work goes on for the entire movie. It just feels like a bunch of random shots put together.<br/><br/>3. NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - You feel absolutely no emotion or bond towards any of the characters. All of them feel replaceable and there is no memorable chemistry between the characters in any way. I have no idea why Forrest Whittaker was even in the film because he serves no purpose. His character finds the main lead and then it entirely skips any sort of character development that could've happened between the two. I don't even remember the characters names because most of them were so unmemorable<br/><br/>4. THE ROBOT - As I said before consistency did not seem to be important to the makers of this movie. The reprogrammed imperial robot seemed TOO human. He moved too much like a human and talked too much like a human, which did not happen in any of the other star wars movies. The most human like droid was C-3p0 but even he did not MOVE like a human.<br/><br/>5. VADER - Something about this Vader seemed to be off. I can't point my finger as to what it is but his style of talking and also his suit seems to be different because I didn't see a chain around his neck. Also his lightsabre fighting style seemed too agile and more like the prequel rather than a hard hitting slow style like in the original trilogy. As I said before, consistency didn't seem important to the filmmakers and little things like this pulled me out of the movie.<br/><br/>6. Obvious SJW Agenda - I am Korean-American. When I watch a Star Wars film, I just want a good Star Wars film. I don't need a Star Wars filmed disguised with a SJW Agenda. Is it a coincidence that the Rebels has a woman, an arab, two Asian guys, a hispanic etc. and the Empire is all white? Why can't I just have a good Star Wars film?<br/><br/>I will say this. The only good part of the movie was at the end when the Death Star fires at the planet because that is the only time I actually felt emotion for the characters and saw a little bit of character development.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this was a terrible movie. You will only watch it just because it is Star Wars."
"speider-1","9","411","793","14 December 2016"," Whoever didn't love episode 7 for any reason. This is your movie.
","What a ride. This review will be filled with hyperbole, but I won't apologize. <br/><br/>I saw and enjoyed Star Wars: Episode 7 a lot. It wasn't perfect, but it was good, and got me back into Star Wars mode again. Rogue One, however, surprised me in probably being the best Star Wars movie produced in this millennia, and I'm being serious. <br/><br/>First of all, manage your expectations. Rogue One isn't a new type of cinema experience, or unique. It's also a prequel, so the story has somewhere specific it has to end up. <br/><br/>With that in mind, Gareth Edward's movie is pretty close to an instant classic, in my opinion. It doesn't rush along, but give us ample time to get some sense of characters and locations. It doesn't dwell on exposition, other through character, and actual plot. <br/><br/>This is the story about how the rebel alliance acquired the plans for the death star, and it manages to give the plot and characters in A New Hope more meaning, and gravitas. <br/><br/>It's hard to tell why it's so good without spoiling a story that was such a delight to experience unspoiled, so I'll sum it up really, really short: <br/><br/>The only negative things I have to say about Rogue One, is that two CGI characters were 99% perfect instead of 100%. That's actually the reason I withhold my last star out of 10. It'll make sense after you've seen the movie. Other than that, this is everything I hoped for, and then some."

","OK so I had A lot to say about ""The Force Awakens"" and mostly I pointed out all the plot holes that I could drive a semi trailer through. But after seeing Rogue One I appreciate TFA a lot more because at least it was entertaining and engaging.<br/><br/>Rogue One is boring. Boring, boring, boring, boring and boring. I can appreciate where it sits within the timeline and was actually interested in how to the Death Star plans got into R2D2. However the story is so ludicrously unimaginative that I wish I could unlearn the official story and go back to making up something myself.<br/><br/>The fundamental problem is that the writers forgot this was a Star Wars movie until about 75% of the way in and then went ""Oh crap there's supposed to be space battles in this thing."" And here begins the rant: spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>Let's start with the main character Jyn. Firstly, I said this in my review of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and I will say it here, killing a main characters parents when they are a small child is not enough to make me give a crap about what happens to them. So she was orphaned when her mother was killed and her father chose to go back to the Empire.. just like millions of other children effected by the war. Secondly this character is so unimpressive and has basically no skills that are helpful to the Rebellion other than the fact that she's the daughter of the genius scientist behind the Death Star. Sure she can fire a phaser but that's pretty much as helpful as she gets. Why a group of committed Rebellion fighters would follow this girl into battle confounds me.<br/><br/>Cassian the rebel fighter assigned to help Jyn is just as unimpressive. We're supposed to feel for him because he lost his family and has been forced to kill people for the Rebellion and feels bad about it but in the end you feel nothing.<br/><br/>K-2SO - ah the generic and expected robot comedy relief that brings a few chuckles but nothing much else (which is no reflection on Alan Tudyk who I love but they didn't give him much to work with) And whilst it was nice to see Darth Vader back in all his glory (and in the voice of James Earl Jones) his cameo was blink-and-you'd-miss-it and really doesn't add to the story in any way.<br/><br/>And then basically all the other characters were so unimpressive that I don't remember any of them and therefore have nothing to say about them.<br/><br/>The 2 stars I've given to this review are purely for the CGI in the final 45 mins of this movie which is pretty bloody spectacular. But once it got to that point I'd stopped caring a while ago. The exception being the CGI young Princess Leia which was just CREEPY.<br/><br/>So to summarise: Boring and unimaginative shouldn't have been made in the first place."

But look closely at the film itself and there is not a lot on offer.<br/><br/>It starts out with this awfully paced run of throwaway scenes to showcase the main characters in the story - they go far to quick to feel any emotional connection with them later on in the film.<br/><br/>Two large chunks of the film are worthless dialog (that sound like video game instructions) and this 'epic' beach siege at the end that clearly looks like the Atlantis hotel resort in Dubai. Once you see it in your head - you can't take what is going on seriously. <br/><br/>The cast are also not well put together, the main character Jyn Erso is unlikable - half her lines are rushed and predictable and her acting made me cringe. On the other hand the characters - Chirrut Îmwe (blind fighter), Saw Gerrera (dying extremist) and Orson Krennic (Empire deathstar leader) offer some great nuggets of depth but aren't in it enough to justify their full potential.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!: I did enjoy however the stunning cgi restoration of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, but when a young cgi of Princess Leia appeared at the end of the film acting as the lead into 'A New Hope' - felt cheap and reinstated the fact that this was a cash-in film and i was stupid enough to fall for it and go see it!!<br/><br/>Rant over! x"
"Pocket_Scout","4","222","419","26 December 2016"," Nothing special (Contains spoilers)
","I've been a fan of Star Wars for a majority of my life, and this was a major let down. The story is mediocre at best, with clichés and useless characters riddled about. The story is nothing more than a fickle teen running around with her pals trying to get the plans for the Death Star. It has a few bright moments with their reprogrammed droid, K- 2SO, being the only good character out of the whole movie. The action scenes fall short, and are more inclined to have something explode rather than show the tide of a battle drastically change within a second. As for the Death Star, well, it honestly only needed to be used once. But no, go ahead and destroy a key base which has all of your plans, most of which most likely don't have any back ups. I'm sure the Emperor won't mind losing key military schematics. Then the movie fails to even get the menacing Lord Vader's look right. Episode 3 did it well enough, you can do it too Disney. This movie was an eye opener, critics had nothing but praise for this movie, yet all I see is a big step in the wrong direction."

I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews, except a lot of people want Star Wars movies to be good so badly that they make them good in their heads or something. I'm a Huge Star Wars fan, and my disappointment runs deep on this one.<br/><br/>Another issue may be that people who don't like this film really don't want to spend the time typing 10 lines about how horrible and boring it is. The characters weren't likable or even memorable. I enjoyed more the ghosts of Star Wars' past (Leia aside - she was so poorly done that I can't bear to think about it) than I did with the new characters, but even that was just replays of old tapes."
"zkonedog","8","11","15","27 February 2017"," First ""Star Wars Story"" A Rousing Success
","When the Star Wars franchise was turned over to Disney from George Lucas, many worried that it would be ""commodified"" too much, to the point that their would be an over-saturation and dilution of the material. ""Rogue One"", the first ""Star Wars Story"" (not featuring the canon roman numerals or opening scrawl), would be the initial test to see how the material would be handled. By almost all accounts, it was a tremendous success!<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary (only minor spoilers), ""Rogue One"" tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance steals the plans for the Imperial Death Star weapon, which sets up the events of Episode IV: A New Hope. The film focuses on Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), daughter of the Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) forced to work for the Empire on the Death Star itself. When of age to join the Rebel cause, Jyn meets the mysterious Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and then is sent on a dangerous mission with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). On the ""Dark Side"" of things, Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is tasked with making sure the Death Star is fully operational, overseen by Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry/CGI) and even Lord Vader himself.<br/><br/>When coming into this movie experience, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. Suffice it to say, it pretty much blew away even those ambiguous expectations. It doesn't try to do too much, yet at the same time it isn't too sparse and thus is filled with call-backs or ""easter eggs"" to ""A New Hope"". It really does find that perfect balance. One thing to be prepared for is a lot of material to be throw at you in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film. It jumps around to many different planets and puts a lot of balls in the air. To be honest, halfway through the film I was a bit worried that it was going to be ""just okay"". The final half or two-thirds, however, sees everything come together in a way that is just as impressive (both dramatically and visually) as any piece in the rest of the Star Wars canon.<br/><br/>It's amazing to me how a single scene from ""A New Hope"" (evaluating the stolen Death Star plans) could inspire an entire film, and I'm even more impressed that a really solid movie could be produced as a result! It would be very, very easy for Disney to start cranking these movies out (they are guaranteed money-makers right now) irregardless of quality, but fortunately the Mouse House seems (at least so far) to be taking the utmost care of the franchise. My brothers and I will be arguing for months over where to watch this movie in the grand scheme of things, and I consider perhaps the best compliment I can give a Star Wars film."
"roystephen-81252","10","113","206","17 December 2016"," See, J.J? It's not THAT hard
","Now, that is how you do a decent spin-off.<br/><br/>After last year's abomination (ie. The Force Awakens) I was very skeptical about Disney's ability to properly handle George Lucas's legacy, but Rogue One delivers in a major way. The story, the characters (K-2 rules!), the performances, the sets, the costumes etc. are all fine. They're fresh, they show variety and scope. But most importantly, Rogue One is NOT dumbed down to insulting imbecility as TFA was.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, alright. It's mostly underlit. It's slower and longer than it should be. Being deliberately and significantly different, it occasionally loses the Star Wars feel. All in all, it's a little rough around the edges (especially CGI Leia's edges), but it does show a LOT more creativity than TFA did, and pays respect to Lucas instead of trampling on everything he'd built up so meticulously.<br/><br/>It's proof that you CAN be original, you CAN be different, even break with established SW conventions (like the absence of the opening crawl), and still retain the REAL spirit of Star Wars.<br/><br/>Rogue One rarely reaches the epic quality of Lucas's six-part saga, but it's a more than acceptable side story. And the spectacular finale that combines the visual grandeur of classic battle scenes from Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi and the original Star Wars, is truly worthy of the Star Wars name.<br/><br/>I've been a major SW fan since 1979. I'm not anti-Disney, anti- Abrams or whatever, and I'm certainly not a 'hater'. TFA made me sad and angry, but this one, this 'rogue one', I CAN accept as a Star Wars movie. Much, much better than TFA in every way."

","First off, this movie is taking a totally different direction than The Force Awakens. It's way more serious and adult orientated, and I for one loved that it did that. <br/><br/>Parts of the movie are a bit slower during the newly introduced characters history / buildup but I did not mind that at all, and once the action gets going it looks amazing and is filmed and directed beautifully.<br/><br/>There is also some comedic release especially from one character in the movie that works absolutely every time. The acting overall I'd say is always good to great especially from the main characters and I feel like Felicity Jones did an amazing job as Jyn Erso.<br/><br/>Overall I'd probably give this a 9.25 / 10 and it's still behind Empire Strikes Back and a New Hope for me, but I'd say it's better than Force Awakens (which was another movie I loved) and I might even like it better than Return of the Jedi."
"karlharvey1972","1","369","718","16 December 2016"," Well, they did it again,.. another soulless Star Wars screw up..
","Review Context: I am a genuine Star Wars Fan. My ranking: 'Empire Strikes Back' 1st. 'A New Hope' 2nd, 'Return of the Jedi' 3rd. All the other Star Wars movies, including this one, right off the radar. <br/><br/>This one, Rogue One?: <br/><br/>Acting = 0 out of ten. 0.5 for the computer generated characters. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones = minus 1000 out of ten. Why on earth did they put her in it? Her acting is so bad she is simply unwatchable. <br/><br/>Forest Whitaker must have caught something from the other actors, because this was the worst I have seen him. What voice was that? Breathing like Vader? What??<br/><br/>Where is any of the Star Wars magic? None of the star wars movies outside of the original trilogy even touch the same soul, and spiritual mysticism, magic and excitement. This felt like a waste of time. I could have written a better story and script myself. This was so disjointed, no continuity, I squirmed and shuffled in my seat in agony. <br/><br/>One blind dude who can sort of use the Force? What a bore. His acting was almost as bad as Felicity Jones'. ""I am one with the force.. nuh, nuh, nerrr"" no you're not. <br/><br/>I couldn't understand Diego Luna's dialogue, nor many of the other actors. What was the point in the robot? Misfiring comedy was the final nail in the coffin of this tripe.<br/><br/>""I have a bad feeling about this.."".. again?! Really? How wincingly weak can you make it? <br/><br/>The dialogue between Darth Vader with Orson was inanely boring and erratic from the first line, I switch off and wondered if I'd left the heating on at home. They couldn't even get the electronic tone right. The original trilogy had you on the edge of your seat with every line Vader spoke. <br/><br/>Ben Mendelsohn as Orson, was terribly mis-cast, his voice, like many of the other characters was sharp and hysterical, with no conviction. <br/><br/>What happened to the music?! No love put into it, no excitement generated at ALL! Awful. Just keep the Star Wars theme until the end credits?! Why bother? <br/><br/>Action: the wobbly hand-held first person is way too old hat, and doesn't work. Whose firing on who and... why? Non-consequential blasting for the sake of it. <br/><br/>The last battle at the end had some hope, then it just threw in some Walkers, and some other things we might recognize, to help it sustain some resemblance to 'star wars. Some climbing, falling in a futuristic tunnel..<br/><br/>Then there was a sudden rush to tie in the ending with the start of 'A New Hope', which culminated with Disney animated Princess Leah taking the Death Star plans? She seemed so much more involved than to just pay such weak homage to her & just at the end? Why do that? How irritating, like the rest of the movie. Star Wars stupidly destroyed."

","In 1977 Star Wars: a New Hope entered our cultural conscious as a brilliant mythic coming of age tale. Alienated youth of our technological age were treated to a unique blending of chivalry/samurai code, western, and WW2 heroics couching a message very relevant to the cold war: destruction of planets can be defeated if we turn to our own human feelings. <br/><br/>The following two Star Wars films developed the wonderful characters, setting up the true hero who stands up to evil, and rather than betray his values faces death and continues with unwavering hope that the most corrupted can be turned back to the light. A young 10-year old watching the original trilogy could be pretty inspired and morally educated. <br/><br/>What do we have in Rogue One? We have covert field assassinations, an ostensibly good guy using mind torture, a friendly robot who casually murders stormtroopers for comic relief, a good guy who shoots a villain in the back, wounded enemies being finished off, urban ambushes by rebels with collateral damage. Absolutely inept character exposition. Action and war movie clichés. Fan service insertions. An utterly bizarre character backstory attempting to explain that the weakness in the Death Star was not a thematic element based in the fundamental truth about the weakness of technology and fallibility of human design, but actually a designed-in flaw by a saboteur under the most implausible of circumstances. <br/><br/>Not only is this a bad movie, it is culturally conservative. It tells us to lower ourselves to complete the task. If the message of 'A New Hope' was to have faith in humanity to bring down the military machine, the message of Rogue One is that in order to win you have to get your hands dirty and be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for your cause. If this is the sustenance for the youth of the next generation we should be ashamed and alarmed. <br/><br/>It is disappointing that Disney, the writers, producers, and a director could so completely miss what makes Star Wars Star Wars."

","Set after the rise of the Galactic Empire in Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and before the Battle of Yavin in Star Wars (1977) .
In a short time period right before the events of A New Hope , we find ourselves in the middle of a galactic war between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire .The synopsis of this film starts in the entire opening crawl with the traditional text from Star wars (1977) : A long time ago in a Galaxy far , far away . It is a period of civil war with rebel spaceships....but instantly leaps to the action . No long opening crawl . In fact , this film is set days before the events of Star wars . It follows the outcast Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and how she came to join the Rebel Alliance in a dangerous move to steal the Death Star plans . Her kidnapped dad Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) has built a terrifying super-weapon : The Death Star that contains kyber crystals and revealed to be used as fuel for it , it is a battle station capable of destroying an entire planet . With a desperate goal of saving her daddy from the Empire and retrieving the secret plans for the weapon of mass destruction : The Death Star, we follow a group of rebel spies (Felicity Jones , Diego Luna as Cassian Andor , Donnie Yen as Chirrut Îmwe , Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus , Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook) and including the ordinary robot : K-2SO (voice : Alan Tudyk) , an Imperial enforcer droid who's been re-purposed to work for the rebellion. All of them have hope to restore peace to the Galaxy , being commanded by the high staff (Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa , Fares Fares as Senator Vaspar , Alistair Petrie as General Draven , Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma , Ben Daniels as General Merrick , Ian McElhinney as General Dodonna) and to vanquish Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and other empire enemies as well as eliminate the destructive super-weapon or it will be too late . A risky rebellion built on hope . Save the Rebellion. Save the dream.<br/><br/>Delightful follow-up to the trilogy that George Lucas always said was intented to be for children . However , because of its imagination , scale , spectacularity , and style , it results to be a fabulous entertainment for all ; both , kiddies and adults . Interesting and engaging screenplay by Chris Weitz , Tony Gilroy from a story by John Knoll , and based on characters created by George Lucas . And being the first Stars Wars franchise to introduce location on-screen caption . Some marvellous new creations , especially state-of-art robots , and the unbeatable special effects more than make up for a slighly overlong movie . Although it is more a spin-off than a sequel , it is more different and original than its predecessors ; if it's no less enjoyable or uplifting . To wonder at the way in which heroes and heroines steer their aircrafts and fall off in high-speed against the large enemy crafts . And the breathtaking dogfighting and overwhelming piloting at the end restore it to the realm of super-spectacle to which it belongs . Felicity Jones is acceptable as Jyn Erso joining the Alliance, Jyn finds herself in the middle of the ultimate conflict between the Rebels and the Empire as well as to cripple a super-weapon . She is well accompanied by an enjoyable support cast , such as : Forest Whitaker , Riz Ahmed , Mads Mikkelsen , Jimmy Smits ,Genevieve O'Reilly and many others . Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing in Star wars is now played by Guy Henry with a CGI replica of Cushing's face superimposed over his . And special appearance by Darth Vader , voice: James Earl Jones, who is meticulously patterned after his look in the original ""Star Wars"". And Carrie Fisher-CGI Leia (Ingvild Deila, voice: Carrie Fisher) who is asked what the plans mean and she answers , ""Hope,"" signaling the start of the first Star Wars film... Star Wars (1977) . However , Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), and Drewe Henley (Red Leader) all passed away in 2016.<br/><br/>It displays an attractive production design , over-the-top scenarios , appropriate photography and adequate costuming , as costume designer David Crossman stated that some of the original costumes used in Star wars (1977), The empire strikes back (1980) and The return of the Jedi (1983) were reused here . It packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Greig Fraser And rousing musical score from Michael Giacchino , taking parts of original soundtrack by the classy John Williams ; Michael has composed every film directed by J.J. Abrams except Star wars episode VII , though composer Alexandre Desplat's original score was rejected . Michael Giacchino, his replacement, had only one month to write his musical score. The motion picture was well directed by Gareth Edwards who exposed their three of his influences for film-making are George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino. He has made succesful films , as the hit of ""Monsters"" resulted in Edwards getting offers from the major studios, especially Warner Bros., who tapped him to direct an English-language reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic ""Gojira"", being produced by Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures, directing the successful ""Godzilla¨ . Finally directed this ¨Rogue one¨, a tremendous box office hit smash , grossing a lot of money worldwide ."

Disney needs to have screenwriters and directors with commitment to the fans do these films, or destroy the myth. If you HAVE to see it, go to the early show at the $2 cinemas."

"simonvesuvius","1","156","311","4 January 2017"," Convoluted Nonsensical Garbage
","This movie should be called Starwars 3.9, A Convoluted Plot involving the Deathstar.<br/><br/>Here is the plot so you don't have to waste your money: The Deathstar project manager, clueless as ever, decides to employ a man as chief architect of the Deathstar despite knowing that he ardently against it and despite the fact they he just had his wife brutally killed in front of him.<br/><br/>So in the first 10 minutes we are given the premise 1) That Darth Vader would be happy about a potential saboteur designing the Deathstar 2) That this guy is the only person capable of building the Deathstar in the entire universe 3) That anyone in the Empire would believe this guy had had a change of mind after his wife had been brutally killed.<br/><br/>Fast forward a decade or two and we have an hour of irrelevant story involving Jyn and some rebel dude, who I have to say kills more people than Darth Vader. They all run around meeting (and often killing) irrelevant people, Forest Whitaker. They plot to kill Jyn's father, who we all know isn't really evil, but none of the characters know that. Since the Deathstar is already fully functional, the only purpose for this seems to be a good old revenge killing. It's nice of the rebels to leave Darth Vader alone.<br/><br/>After they achieve their goal, and with his croaky dying breath, Jyn's father reveals to Jyn that he only agreed to build the Deathstar so he could engineer in a secret weakness - because if he hadn't built it, someone else would have ... which destroys the entire premise (see above).<br/><br/>However, his secret engineered weakness is so secret that he decided not to tell anyone, and instead was relying on some rebels turning up so he could tell them before they killed him - the rebels do a lot of that. It was just luckily that he was only mostly dead and got to tell them before he was completely dead.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since Jyn was the only person to hear this croaky confession, no one will believe her. So she and a small group, the rebel rebels, head off to find the proof from planet archive. Meanwhile Peter Cushing has returned from the dead to do some acting that Keanu Reeves would be proud of thanks to CGI.<br/><br/>There is a big battle, they get the plans, no one cares because both sides seem as murderous as each other, Jyn and rebel dude kiss, everyone is killed, and Pricess Leah flies off with a Wifi version of the Deathstar plans. The end. And we don't even get any of the original Starwars music to enjoy.<br/><br/>Whoever wrote the story to this utterly boring film should be sacked!"
"zardoz-13","10","27","46","7 January 2017"," The Best ""Star Wars"" Saga Since ""The Empire Strikes Back!""
","Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" exemplifies this notion. Basically, ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards, ""Golden Compass"" scenarist Chris Weitz, and ""Bourne"" trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan ""Star Wars"" saga. No, the PG-13 rated ""Rogue One"" is neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I've read about this entry in the ""Star Wars"" universe emphasizes the word 'stand-alone' so you won't be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn't apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, ""Rogue One"" may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you've seen George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,"" then you know that the Death Star didn't survive that adventurous classic. ""Rogue One"" qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope."" Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn't know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in ""Rogue One"" occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of ""Frankenstein"" fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing's estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor's personage, and actor Guy Henry's impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they've accomplished, he'd be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney's audacious attempt to expand the ""Star Wars"" time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.<br/><br/>Since ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope"" came out back in the summer of 1977, fans have complained about the sweet spot in the Death Star that enabled the Alliance to blow it up. ""Rogue One"" relates the story about that sweet spot, and ""Star Wars"" aficionados can argue about other things—primarily the time-line between the two films—because Luke and Leia were born at the end of ""Episode III."" Nevertheless, who really cares about such things, when a movie like ""Rogue One"" fills the gap? Aside from Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, and Princess Leia, the primary characters in ""Rogue One"" are entirely new to the franchise. A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of ""Dr. Strange""), has been forced against his will to collaborate with the Empire to forge the ultimate weapon of devastation. The wicked Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn of ""Killing Them Softly"") has commandeered Galen for the project, and he intends to use Galen's wife Kyra (Valene Kane of ""Victor Frankenstein"") and his adolescent daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) as bargaining chips. Galen sends his daughter into hiding, and Kyra perishes trying to thwart Orson. Jyn grows up under the tutelage of an extreme radical, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker of ""Platoon""), and she becomes a notorious criminal who has been imprisoned when the Rebel Alliance rescues her. It seems that an Empire pilot, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") has defected and given himself up to Saw. Bodhi insists that he has an urgent message from Galen Erso about the Death Star. Naturally, nobody believes the Empire could have forged such an awesome weapon. The Rebel Alliance isn't prepared to be so casual about this booger bear. Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna of ""Blood Father"") and his reprogrammed Empire Droid K-2so (voice of Alan Tudyk of ""Serenity"") break Jyn (Felicity Jones of ""Brideshead Revisited"") out captivity when she is being transferred to a labor camp. Later, as Jyn explains to Saw, the Rebel Alliance is using her for safe passage into Saw's camp on the planetary moon Jedha where Bodhi is being held captive. Saw surprises Jyn with a holographic message from Galen intended for her. Galen explains that the Death Star has the equivalent of an Achilles' Heel that will render it vulnerable to the Rebels. No sooner has Jyn seen this message than the Grand Moff Tarkin brings the Death Star into orbit around Jedha and unleashes its formidable power on the city. During their rushed exit from Jedha, Cassian and Jyn pick up a pair of hitchhikers, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen of ""Iron Monkey 2"") and his sidekick Base Malbus (Wen Jiang of ""Let the Bullets Fly""), who become recruits for the cause. Chirrut is a blind martial arts warrior who wields a lethal staff and believes in the Force with all his heart.<br/><br/>""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" depicts the efforts of the underdog Rebel Alliance to triumph over the Empire. Basically, this exciting escapade works on the level of a Republic Serial from the 1940s with one cliffhanger scene after another ensuing in a grand finale on a scenic Caribbean-like island named Scarif where the star fleets of the both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire wage the battle to end all battles. Although it doesn't rely on the usual troika of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, ""Rogue One"" imitates ""Star Wars"" in virtually every respect except its ending with a Pyrrhic Victory. Felicity Jones makes a sympathetic heroine that you won't forget. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO compete as the ultimate scene stealers. The special effects are stellar stuff. Altogether, ""Rogue One"" qualifies as the best ""Star Wars"" epic since ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
"wisemantonofski","8","5","6","5 January 2020"," A Great Franchise is Built on Hope
","Through and through this is more grim and dirty war story than the whimsical sci-fi adventure we were expecting, and that darker tone serves the film's thematic onslaught against everything we've come to expect from a Star Wars movie. Every character grows and changes over the course of the story, saturated in such gritty realism and told from a perspective we've never seen before, making this one of the most deeply personal experiences in the Star Wars saga; so lovingly crafted on a cinematographic level and boasting some of the greatest land and space battle sequences since the Battles of Hoth and Coruscant before it."

","I agree with the review that says Rogue One is the end of an era, but  for another reason. Honestly, I have watched the original installments  and liked them so I was very disappointed with The Force Awakens  Episode Seven, but my disappointment here is for another reason. This  is the first Star Wars movie with no Jedi, light sabers or any real  force. I know the Asian dude keeps saying he has the force, but of  course it is a wish on his part. He is not Jedi or padavan and the  force does not surge within him. A Star Wars film without force, Jedi  or light saber is not really Star Wars is it. Some might say that with  what happened in Episode Seven maybe that is a good thing, but I prefer  to think there is certain elements that are a must for Star Wars. Also,  in case anyone didn't notice the film does not start with a rolling  storyboard.  I guess Disney needs the money, but honestly we are the ones giving it  to them."

It has excellent pacing and when the movie ended and we found out it was over 2 hours, we couldn't believe it.<br/><br/>The nods to the original trilogy are all there and done in such a subtle way I was yelping with joy in the cinema due to how well they were used.<br/><br/>The story though, it takes the cake.

","I just spent 2 hours trying to stay awake in the movie theater. Not only is this movie boring but it is a complete and total rehash of the original 1976 Star Wars. So much so that I recognized shots that were in the first movie (that were better in the first movie because Harrison Ford was in them!). I want to save people from wasting over 2 hours of their life like I just did. Just see the original and skip this completely. The original has interesting characters, humor, suspense and actors who can actually act. This was void of all of that. The characters were shallow and unbelievable as was the plot line (and lack there of). There was basically no story in the first hour and a half of this movie. And might I ask, who would adopt a child, raise it for 8 years only to abandon said child because they were afraid someone figured out who she was (they couldn't be that much of a threat if it took them 8 years to figure it out). I am now done with the Star Wars franchise. Chanting that you have the Force doesn't make it so. Spoiler, there is a Death Star but there is a way to destroy it (size may very depending on which Star Wars you are watching but otherwise that is the plot of all of the Star Wars movies). I'll just leave you with this, If you have the technology to build a planet sized spaceship that can distroy planets why do your schematics need to be on a floppy disk?"

","My impression - this movie is what it should have been. It totally lived up to my expectations and what I wanted to see. Really enjoyed everything: dark power of the Empire, constructing the ultimate weapon, Rebels, doing what they think must be done, ready to sacrifice themselves to give the Galaxy hope, lord Vader, whose power almost can't be defeated, heroic atmosphere... I liked that the Rebel Alliance and the Empire aren't shown as monolith organizations: there are frictions and even rivalry on both sides. Cool thing is that it is an independent movie, the plot does not repeat the previous movies (what we could see in the new ""Episode 7: The Force Awakens""). I don't see obvious plot holes. The ending of the movie fits perfectly to the beginning of the ""Episode 4: A New Hope"". Acting was good. Conclusion: really, really loved it. May the Force be with you!"
"Imaculata","6","151","312","14 December 2016"," Rogue One - Screen writing zero
","I wanted to like this movie so badly, but I just couldn't. I am a huge Star Wars fan, but the screen writing for this film is just terrible. That's not to say that there aren't things to like in this film. But it's the huge amount of fan service that kills it.<br/><br/>None of the characters, except the main character, get any development. The introduction of all the characters is disjointed and ham-fisted. And especially in the beginning the movie jumps all over the place hastily. It is as if they took very little time to write actual scenes.<br/><br/>The visual effects are really good. But unfortunately the movie relies very heavily on the inclusion of one completely CGI actor, who simply does not look convincing. They give him a lot of screen time and lines too, but it is just so distracting.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem is that it is just crammed full of fan service. The movie feels very strongly like a piece of fan fiction. There are also no surprises at all in the film. It is predictable from beginning to end. The movie keeps throwing references to the original trilogy, or to the Expanded Universe in your face, to the point where it becomes extremely cringe worthy.<br/><br/>The finale is spectacular, but by that point you still don't care about any of the characters or the plot... the movie fails to make the audience really care. A spectacular finale without emotion, is like a fireworks show without an audience: A lot of noise and wasted money."
"socalmaint","1","76","153","18 December 2016"," Flat, low energy, slow moving, nothing new story wise, weak character development and cgi was terrible in certain scenes
","It was still better than the last star wars but that's a very low bar. I'm afraid this franchise is still skidding off a ravine into a bottomless pit after this last movie. I don't see how the normal human being could be in love with a movie that lacked the charm of some of its predecessors. This one had the feel of a made for TV drama without the suspense, strong character development, action and excitement that we've come to expect from a star wars movie. You just can't get involved with these characters. They don't have that vulnerable side that is mixed in with their distinct strength that allows them to be relatable. Again, the movie was flat, low energy, slow moving, nothing new story wise, weak character development and cgi was terrible in certain scenes and characters looks like they came out of an old xbox game from the early 2000's. About halfway through this movie you'll look at the clock and realize, ""nothing has happened yet..."" What a shame and what a dud... Sorry. But I was hoping for more even though after the last SW movie my hopes weren't up at all. I now know not to expect anything at all from future SW's movies. It just how it is now. This has become about the studios marketing a brand instead of making great and exciting movies. What a disappointment!"

The characters in this movie were interchangeable and robotic, there was nothing unique about them. They were as flat as the characters that kids create when playing with Star Wars action figures.<br/><br/>Also I prefer a plot that is THREADED and not just episodic. Use foreshadowing and let events rise from the characters. Having events occur without leading up to them properly is just boring.<br/><br/>I literally fell asleep during this movie.

Well, if it were not for the cleverly sprinkled not so private jokes any dedicated fan will appreciate, the familiar universe, a quite good space and ground battle (but come on, Return of the Jedi anyone ? Déjà vu, déjà vu...), a surprisingly daring ending (I am not taking of the very last shots, one of which features a beloved returnee) leading to a nice relay to pass along the Death Star plans, this movie would be a complete waste of time. And really, you get to ""resurrect"" the greatest movie villain ever and you manage to botch it ?! Wrong walk, wrong moves, wrong shaped collar under the helmet, everything about this Vader is off, except James Earl Jones's voice ! This Vader is supposed to be the one we see entering the Tantive 4 with his stately, slightly heavy walk, not sauntering about like a young man ! He is not the youthful, strong Anakin Skywalker who duelled with Obi Wan, he is a 40something years old cripple who moves thanks to his armor ! Really, no one bothered to check how Vader moved in episode 4 ?! When I think how Episode 7 was dragged into the mud, how Abrams was charged with ""killing"" Star Wars, and now this boring mess is hailed as ""the Star Wars we were waiting for""... Boring, botched, and ultimately completely useless, the saga did not particularly need that story to be told. I'm going to go back to waiting for the real deal. Episode 8.

All pointless. I was waiting for the movie to be over. You know how Peter Jackson loves to release extended versions in which he shoves more and more unnecessary stuff just to fill up the time? It feels the same. This is a 90-min movie (at best) ""squeezed"" into 134 min. You saw EPISODE 3 and you saw EPISODE 4, so you already know what happened before and after - you can't spoil the plot and this movie just serves as an unnecessary filler that adds nothing.<br/><br/>And if you're waiting to see Darth Vader, you're in for a huge letdown. His appearance in this movie is less than 5 min and it's easily the worst Darth Vader costume I've seen. Actually, all the costumes looked pretty amateurish. The CGI was pretty good and some good one-liners here and there. That's it. A pointless movie just to grab more money and fill the gap between the main STAR WARS movies.<br/><br/>* MINOR SPOILERS - START *<br/><br/>What I liked about the plot is how the writers managed to find a good explanation (excuse) for the biggest plothole in STAR WARS (i.e.: Why would the Empire build a Death Star with a backdoor to blow it up) and the ending which, although expected, was nice for tying it with the beginning of STAR WARS 4. I also liked that they DIDN'T try to turn this into a feminist propaganda - the female lead was just there and they didn't make a big deal out of it. K-2SO was a nice sidekick.<br/><br/>* MINOR SPOILERS - END *<br/><br/>The audience pleasantly surprised me.

The idea of R1 was to ""fix"" a plot hole in EP4, but it only seems to create more plot holes. I checked spoilers but let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer and the movie poster: There is nothing left to spoil. The trailer tells you the plot and the movie poster tells you that everyone will die in the end: The cheapest and easiest way to get rid of a cast you don't need in the next movie (EP4). This movie could have been so much more and be the start of a fantastic spin-off that runs parallel to the original trilogy (like Enter the Matrix game did for the Matrix movies) but Disney chose for the easy way.<br/><br/>Basically: The movie is your standard Disney formula with standard plot line (only this time very thin), standard comical character for the humor, only the end is slightly different (but surely not better)<br/><br/>Even the soundtrack feels flat, forced and cheap and is at most places in the movie just cringey.

Okay, the story isn't that bad, but it's really terribly acted out and there are some parts that are so boring that you forget that you are watching star wars. Too many emotions and emotional speeches, I mean isn't 'May the Force be with you' the whole point of this movie, you don't need a speech if you are a so called rebel. To sum everything up, the main characters were awful the supporting characters were the ones who made everybody laugh so that they don't leave the cinema. Well hope number 9,10 and 11 aren't going to be as bad as this, who know maybe Han Solo made it and we will be seeing him in episode 16"

","After the heartbreaking disappointment that was episode 7, Rogue One does very little to get Star Wars back on track. Rogue One fails on every level with the exception of a few cool action scenes.<br/><br/>Just like how Force Awakens is a rehash of A New Hope and Legacy of the Force, with Rey and Kylo Ren acting as the replacements for Jacen and Jaina Solo, Rogue One is just a rehash of Dark Forces, with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna being replacements for Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors, just nowhere near as likable or endearing as the originals. In addition, the premise itself is predictable and uninspiring, and the movie doesn't add anything to the overall mythos.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor,and just don't watch this movie. It is not worth it. If anything, this movie is confirmation that no matter what we want, we are being given one thing, and that's what they're telling we want. This movie will leave you with this crushing sense of inevitability, like the fans don't matter. Because ultimately, with Disney in charge of Lucasfilm, they don't matter."
"ajlschenkel","1","58","116","26 December 2016"," It's well made. But the script is one big disaster. Laughable.
","Why this movie gets all the high ratings is beyond me. To me this movie is awful. It's one big box of clichés and it does not even try to hide it. I know for sure that every single line of the script can be traced back to another movie. It's one big copy-paste of movie one-liners. And not even the best ones. The line of actors is great and it's staggering to see these actors play in such a crappy movie. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: it's very well made, but the script is laughable. 'Predictable' doesn't ever cover it. I watched the movie in a big theatre with hundreds of other people. There was only one moment when there was a little bit of laughter audible.

"gameoverman49","8","23","41","17 December 2016"," Rogue One is a beautiful, epic Star Wars story with a few flaws
","After sitting with my thoughts and mulling over my feelings about Rogue One I have come up with a list of my general feelings about the movie.<br/><br/>Pros: Beautiful Cinematography- There are so many well composed shots in the movie. I kept thinking to myself while watching it ""That could be a poster."" Gareth Edwards did a great job of framing the action in Rogue One. He was able to capture the violence and darker tones of the film in a way that felt harrowing on a visceral level. He also did a great job on creating scale within the camera frame which made things like the AT-ATs on the beach feel truly menacing.<br/><br/>Decent CGI: Overall the CGI was pretty good, especially the CGI explosions both big and small. My one gripe was that there was one entirely CGI character that lingered in the uncanny valley to the point where it was distracting. That wouldn't have been an issue if the character was as prominently used.<br/><br/>Characters: A lot of the characters in Rogue One feel a little 2- Dimensional and under developed. That is not necessarily a bad thing in an ensemble action movie. I went into this movie expecting something akin to ""Saving Private Ryan"" but in the Star Wars universe; by this I mean I wasn't expecting the entire squadron to be fully formed well rounded characters because taking the time to do so would take away from the sprawling war epic motif that the film was going for. Jyn Erso certainly felt fleshed out and real but the movie left me wanting more depth of character from Cassian Andor and Commander Krennic. I wanted to like both but there just wasn't enough backstory and characterization present to allow me to emotionally connect with the characters.<br/><br/>Pacing: I have heard a lot of people complaining about the pacing of this movie but I personally enjoyed the slow escalating tension that moves the rebellion closer and closer to all out war with the empire. The film explores the early days of the rebellion where soldier were asked to be spies, saboteur er, and assassin in the name of a cause they believed in. They were working from the shadows because they lacked the resources, manpower and opportunity to directly confront the empire with any glimmer of a chance of winning. The film shows how the rebellion came out of the shadows and legitimized itself as a force that would stand against the Empire. I like how the film portrayed the escalation towards war with the third act serving as a beautiful crescendo of a battle.<br/><br/>In summation I really liked the film even though it had a few issues that stuck in my craw. As a die-hard fan of Star Wars, I went feeling like I had a good idea of what the plot structure was going to be and I wasn't disappointed by that. I was expecting an ensemble action movie that relay focused on the darker nature of war and the film delivered it. I wish that Andor and Krennic were more fleshed out in the movie instead of in the ""Rogue One: Catalyst"" novel which serves as a prologue to the movie but I understand that might have slow the pacing of this film further which I have heard other people complain about already. There were many jaw dropping, beautiful shots in the film that really contributed to that epic feeling we all associate with Star Wars. I enjoyed how most of the fan service references were fairly subtle as I have seen several movies be overly heavy-handed in their fan-service this year.<br/><br/>Even with my few quibbles I'd give Rogue One a ""B+"""
"parleon-thedon","10","12","19","18 December 2016"," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - review: My Ultimate Star Wars
","Gareth Edwards is a director I've never paid close attention to before, but after watching this movie, my eyes are now open.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of Edwards's Godzilla movie; However, I was quite impressed with how serious the man took on the challenge.<br/><br/>The Rogue One movie makes me believe that director Edwards will go on to even bigger things now.<br/><br/>Rouge One is a strikingly beautiful movie. Wait, let me rephrase, the cinematography is gorgeous, breathtakingly amazing work.<br/><br/>I haven't heard a musical score this good since hearing The Neon Demon - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (which is great by the way). I want the Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack playing on my music device right now. Rogue One's musical score is astonishing.<br/><br/>Guy Henry has a fairly particular part to play in this movie. Henry's character Grand Moff Tarkin will bring back memories to the definitive ""die-hard"" Star Wars fan. It's a shame that Henry probably won't receive recognition for his performance, but honestly, it's not about him, it's really about the character he's playing. Grand Moff Tarkin represents a technical aspect that will soak up all the attention from the actor. As far as I'm concerned, this groundbreaking piece of technology, it looks acceptable, but there's still much more work to be done.<br/><br/>There are quite a few characters in this movie. Not every character serves a purpose to the story, but their personalities hook you.<br/><br/>Cassian Andor played by actor Diego Luna is my favorite character in the movie. I acknowledged what Cassian was going through, and so I understood why he did the things he did. The movie didn't force some melodramatic archetype down my throat.<br/><br/>Alan Tudyk plays K-2SO, I like him, I think he's a very exciting character, and he has some of the best scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>Real life martial artist Donnie Yen portrays character Chirrut Îmwe (he's a blind man who believes he's ""one with the force""). Yen's performance was breathtaking. Every scene that Donnie Yen was in was a scene to remember. <br/><br/>Baze Malbus played by Wen Jiang functioned effectively in this movie. Wen Jiang's character didn't seem to serve a substantial amount to the story, but his character's purpose was of great importance. <br/><br/>Now, the man with the undeniable aspirations to achieve greatness, Orson Krennic played by Ben Mendelsohn. The introduction of the character reminded me of Christoph Waltz during the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds. I'm in awe of what Mendelsohn's character Orson Krennic did in this movie.<br/><br/>Galen Erso played by Mads Mikkelsen is a crucial character to the overall general importance of the story. Also, by the end, a lot of people who suffer from regret could relate to his story.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso. She was once rebellious, but now she's selfless. <br/><br/>Riz Ahmed plays Bodhi Rook. His character's effective, but I don't care, and I find him the least interesting.<br/><br/>Saw Gerrera played by Forest Whitaker, oh my god let me talk about this, I like Forest Whitaker, and his performance was good, but what was all that sh*t he was doing.<br/><br/>A classic character (Vader) makes a special appearance, he's not in the movie much, and you could claim his appearance was shoehorned in, but his scenes are necessary and crucial to the development of the story. The introduction and the ending to his character's presence will be everlasting.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely love this movie. I didn't believe that a Star Wars movie would be able to surprise me like this. I didn't like The Force Awakens or any of the prequels. My generation didn't get to see New Hope in the theater, and so I had to rest with the crappy prequels and The Force Awakens, but now I have Rogue One, and it's my definitive Star Wars movie. I haven't been this excited about a movie since The Dark Knight. I believe that Star Wars has made their ""Dark Knight"", it has happened, and it happened with Disney... Who would've thought of this sh*t?<br/><br/>Rogue One bridges perfectly between Episodes III and IV.<br/><br/>I know there may seem like a lot of clichés, but they're all justified, and believe me, they all makes sense. <br/><br/>Don't take your five- year-old son Timmy to see Rouge One because he might leave the theater weeping. This is not a kid-friendly Star Wars movie. This Star Wars movie is dark, realistic (from a Star Wars sense), filled with emotion, it has depth, and it's stacked to the brim with murder and violence. This is my kind of Star Wars movie. This is just the type of movie I've been waiting for.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A+"
"nathanbechhofer","5","76","156","17 December 2016"," Some of the best action scenes we've ever seen in a Star Wars film, but ultimately a thoroughly flawed effort.
","This could have been good. Amazing, even. Director Gareth Edwards delivers some of the best action scenes in any Star Wars movie. He shows us a side of the saga we haven't seen before: the ugly face of war. He shows us that the Rebels aren't all good, cannot be all good. That, in order to accomplish the things they need to win the war against the Empire, they must cross the line. It is a very refreshing take on a world that has become all too neatly divided into good and evil. Dark, dirty, gritty. All the buzzwords. We also get to see more of this vast galaxy as Edwards takes us to plenty of new planets and locales, from the ancient Jedi world of Jedha to the beautiful if deadly beaches of Scarif. Make no mistake, this is a very beautiful and sometimes breathtaking movie.<br/><br/>However, it falls flat in several respects, none of which are really Edwards' fault. Let's start with the most obvious one: the score. Michael Giacchino had the unenviable job of scoring the film in only four weeks after composer Alexandre Desplat had to leave the production due to scheduling issues. And it shows. The score is perfectly adequate, but nothing more. No one will leave the theater humming a specific tune from this flick. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if some started whistling ""Enterprising Young Men"", the theme Giacchino composed for 2009's Star Trek - he seems to have reused some of his old motifs.<br/><br/>The next problem is the film's lack of engaging characters. While it mixes things up by making the main droid not a cuddly candidate for a bestselling toy, but instead a cold-blooded (cold-wired?) strategic analysis bot with a fondness for zingy one-liners (K-2SO, voiced by Alan Tudyk), the rest of its ragtag band of heroes is an assortment of cardboard cut-outs and clichés. And in no character is that more obvious than in its nominal hero, Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones). Here's the thing: a girl who shoots things is not automatically a strong character. A character is someone who has agency, makes her own choices, and deals with the consequences of those choices. That is the foundation of any good story. But Erso is a hollow vessel, a ball that gets passed from one plot point to the next. At no point does she make a choice - that falls to the male characters, who naturally are there to tell her what to do. She just executes plans. All this, however, is at odds with how she is introduced: a tough survivor of Imperial terror who had to learn to survive on her own. It's a shame that the writers dropped the ball so badly when it came to characterizations, since on paper Erso and her squad of rogue rebels should have been a team to rival the Serenity. But from Diego Luna's Captain Andor to Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera, none amount to much more than simple plot devices.<br/><br/>The final - and worst - issue is probably one caused by studio intervention: trying to tie the movie back into the original trilogy. The movie, for all its faults, would have had the strength to stand on its own, but for some reason it was deemed necessary to include not only nods to the old films, but vigorous headbanging. It starts with Darth Vader, but it doesn't end there. Going into detail would spoil major surprises, but suffice it to say that each and every scene with Vader could be cut from the movie and it wouldn't make a narrative difference. There are many more instances of blatant and very costly fan service that don't really add anything beyond the slight ""aha, I know that guy!"" moment, and more often than not even detract from any enjoyment because they are just so badly done. And then there is Darth Vader's newly found love for puns. No, really.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that feels more like a fan-film with a generous budget than a proper entry in the Star Wars saga. Rogue One does a lot of things right but ultimately chokes on its own aspirations."
"dmcarey88","4","46","90","27 December 2016"," Bored One
","Rogue One, like Gareth Edward's previous film Godzilla, was over-hyped, completely underwhelming and very boring. I have to admit, I went to see this movie with a very optimistic attitude however 15-20 minutes in I started to drift off. It is especially difficult to appreciate any of the secondary characters here as they are killed off almost as quickly as they are introduced, making them feel inconsequential. In particular, I thought the character played by Forest Whitaker should have had a more significant role in the movie, plus I could barely understand what he was saying! It was good to see Vader but ultimately he is only a presence in a movie beyond rescue. The story had real promise but it did not deliver at all; it was another nose dive for the Star Wars franchise. Rogue One is disappointingly forgettable."

","I remember back in 1978 seeing the original and being blown away. Well this was as good. Forget the negative comments and go and see it. Too many of the bad comments focus on the ridiculous premise that the originals cannot be matched or beaten. The film is full of nice touches with Peter Cushing miraculously appearing on the screen! And the final scene is incredibly emotional especially with what has gone on recently....can't give that one away. Felicity Jones is great and it's a pity that it would appear her time with the franchise is over. The special effects are breathtaking and the whole thing knits together really well....enjoy!"
"Finfrosk86","5","21","37","29 July 2017"," Yawn. Pretty much sums it up. Nothing special at all.
","Sorry Star Wars fans, you're probably gonna hate this review. But you'll all admit in a couple of years, that this was one of the worst Star Wars movies. You just need time, I get it.<br/><br/>OK, so I'm no big Star Wars fan. But I did enjoy The Force Awakens. And as this is a huge movie with a big budget, big stuff, I was positive. I'm almost always positive when it comes to movies. And with all the stuff that is Star Wars, it kind of has to be at least pretty good, right? Well I thought so, but wrong. This movie commits the greatest sin a movie can: it's boring. It's just downright boring and dull. <br/><br/>The main characters, the guy and the girl, have no chemistry, super dull and not even charming in the slightest. Especially the guy, he's like anti-charming. To spare you the boring details, let me just say this, it was two characters I liked, one of them is Donnie Yen. But guess what, he criminally underused! He has like one fight scene, and that's it. He is such a cool character, what a damn shame. The other character I liked is that new robot. He's entertaining.<br/><br/>But yeah, this movie is just boring. Sure, for the ultra fans I guess there's a bunch of easter-eggs and connections, but for me, it was just dull. Even the huge action scenes really fail to entertain.<br/><br/>Alright alright alright, yes, there is a scene with a VERY famous character, and yes it's awesome. But every scene should be at least a little like that one. You can't have ONE awesome scene in a movie. I also liked the CGI-dude. It's ballsy to try something like that, and they almost pulled it off.<br/><br/>So, not saying the movie sucked, it was just really meh. It's visually alright, and has good parts, but all in all boring. Shame."
"wire-100","6","70","143","15 December 2016"," Fan service can kill your film
","I was really looking forward to this film, as I love Star Wars but am very interested in seeing stories that don't involve a Skywalker as a lead. But sadly I was let down, so where to start? <br/><br/>(SPOILERS INCLUDED) <br/><br/>Fan Service: When you make a reference by placing a known character in a scene that doesn't need to be there, then you've just ruined your scene. Example: The rebels are on their way to the battle and tensions are mounting, it's getting serious as we approach our climax! Oh wait here's R2 and C3-P0, remember them, right? Then continue on with the scene. What was the point other than to pander to the audience? Having them stops the natural flow of tension that was building.<br/><br/>The same with Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazan. Why were they in it? That city was then destroyed so they must of got out. They don't push the story forward in any way so it's wasted screen time, distracting too because it draws us away from our heroes mission, just to look at characters we know. <br/><br/>It's sad that Disney feels the need to jam pointless fan service in, as it makes the audience seem stupid, like that can't understand it's in the same universe without seeing R2-D2.<br/><br/>Darth Vader: Completely unnecessary, even if that lightsaber fight was fun. The first scene with him wasn't right, as he didn't look or sound the same. Plus he said a pun that was so bad I actually face palmed. When he shows up at the end of the film, once our leads have all died, he has an action scene? In a time that completely doesn't suit it. Before our actors die, yes, but not after as it overshadows their sacrifice. <br/><br/>Overall: This film is a bit messy, going to maybe 8 different planets/moons/locations which just feels all over the place. It never takes a breather and the pace is too fast and I feel it would have benefited for another 20 mins run time. I found Jin unlikeable and forced, no pun intended, and I wish she had an extra 5 minutes at the start of the film of her life, maybe a scene on why she was arrested, then we could spend time with her and get to know her? Rather then just here's Jin, now you have to care about her cause her dad is a pretty cool guy. <br/><br/>This film for me felt a bit emotionless, it lacked a real heart as nothing moved me, not even main character deaths, and that's a failure of the director. The only deaths that had any substance and weight to them were Chirrut and Baze'a deaths as they had such a tight bond and Chirruts faith, when facing his own death, gave Baze such strength.<br/><br/>Recommendation: If you love Star Wars and don't care about the quality of what you're watching, you'll eat this up"

The action sequences rock, Darth Vader was better then ever. The only problem was the Japanese samurai warrior and his bamboo stick. However as a whole this movie had a simple plot, like a the original Star Wars movies, the characters were very well crafted and lovable. And all the criticism about the CGI is crap, rouge couldn't of done without it. The film has all the right story elements which makes it not only a great Star Wars film, but a awesome movie. The film also should've at least been nominated for Best picture, but being that it's on the surface apolitical it couldn't be nominated. Instead Moonlight and fences are nominated, two crappy films with the same agenda. Well maybe Star Wars 8 will scrape a nomination. Anyways rouge one rocked, kicked the force awakens to f***n mustard, and can be placed on the same shelf as the original trilogy."

Who is taking the place of the fallen on both sides, who is now taking a stand against the empire who is going to make an effort to crush the rebels? Or is the evil now in the run are the Jedi's now rising in numbers, are of will they ever come back if so how etc. etc. etc....<br/><br/>At the very beginning of the movie, I was very disappointed and didn't recover form.

","After hearing many good reviews about this movie, besides planning to see it on the big screen, I had high expectations and oh boy, they were worth the wait. We were a bit disappointed by last year's The Force Awakens and Rogue One brought us a much needed breath of comeback in the Star Wars saga. Even from the beginning and till the end you never stop admiring the beauty that this movie is. Gareth Edwards managed to show us why we started to love the Star Wars universe in the first place and he did his best to raise the bar high. For myself, I loved this movie and I hope that every new one that will be launched in the future will be as great as this one. Probably my favourite scene was the ending where Vader goes mayhem, in an environment that might be familiar to us (the beginning of A New Hope)."
"prospectus_capricornium","10","28","52","16 December 2016"," Utterly moving, most powerful 'Star Wars' story since A New Hope
","A sequel to 'Revenge of the Sith', a prequel to 'A New Hope', 'Rogue One' is essentially a bridge that resembles to a colossal effort to accomplish three functions: explain the past, predict the future, create a tangible link between them, the last of which, this Gareth Edwards-helmed sci-fi giant is able to pull off with a brimming sense of nostalgic sentimentality. Often dark and brooding, there is an appealing force that emerges from its layers, continuously drawing us into the depths of 'Star Wars' cosmic saga that started to storm the box office, four decades ago. The 'force' persists in its riveting presence all throughout the film's visceral development, a monumental feat that itsTony Gilroy and Chris Weitz-written screenplay is able to preserve, even in the absence of the Jedi and Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks and the iconic opening crawl. In effect, the stand alone film manages to break down barriers, provide solutions to old puzzles, while practically presenting new ones that even non-religious spectators would be engaged to solve. That its motives is primarily enforced by the breathtaking visual renders of the film's explosive sequences, is out of the question, but the singular element that propels the film into action, is the story's protagonist, herself, and what she represents. <br/><br/>Driven by a female hero at its reins like last year's 'The Force Awakens', this 'Star Wars' story revolves around petty criminal Jyn (Felicity Jones) and the band of misfits she gathered- -one that includes rebel spy, Cassian (Diego Luna), a reprogrammed imperial droid named KS2O, who shares the biggest chunk of the film's comic effort, and a blind monk whose martial arts-adroitness seemingly dares to put Matt Murdock's echolocation expertise to shame--to steal the plans to the 'Death Star', a deadly weapon, so powerful it can obliterate an entire planet. The emotional weight of the narrative is gathered across the length of Jyn's ambitious mission, which the film's primal campaign itself, labeled as a 'rebellion built on hope', a screaming hint to the looming much bigger movement led by Princess Leia, that sets the whole course for the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Faithful to the tradition of female- centric narratives, Jyn's motivations is largely fueled by the traumatic childhood she endured: she saw her mother died at the mercy of an imperial superior, and the capture of his father who was forcefully recruited to engineer the empire's deadliest weapon--the Death Star. In the absence of an initiative, she courageously leads a highly-volatile expedition of recovering the plan to the Death Star, whose small but utterly significant flaw--one that could help the Rebel Alliance stop its cataclysmic power--is revealed by her father. <br/><br/>Save for Jyn's uninspiring fight- for-freedom speech, only because it sounds monotonous, the whole run of 'Rogue One', is a glaring testament of what a mere hope can muster in the wake of a ruling authoritarian regime. The film then becomes a picture of a political atmosphere, infested with injustice and oppression, that bears a striking recognition. 'Trust the force', says Jyn's mother, in a tone that almost makes us believe that a movement always remains smoldering, only waiting to be ignited by small but resilient flames in the hands of courageous beings, awakened to rise by the screaming social malignance and political malfunction around them. <br/><br/>The first of 'Star Wars' stand-alone films, 'Rogue One' is bold and moving with its lingering sense of humanity, nostalgic in its almost flawless integration with the saga's established structure, and ingeniously innovative in creating a whole new sci-fi space-war narrative that isn't devoid of the familiar 'the- force-is-with-me' sentiment. At its final moments, the film practically inserts a missing piece between the end and the beginning of the second and first trilogies, ending with a powerful one-second scene that can potentially make a voice in every spectator's head chant ""I am with the force; the force is with me""."

","As you are reading this, you are quite probably: 1) a likely viewer of this movie, 2) a recent viewer of this movie. Falling in the category 2) myself, I understand you are probably browsing reviews in order to take comfort you are not alone in thinking that most of the more acclaimed critical reviews are wrong, as what you just watched was a pretentious and unentertaining film. If you are in category 1) I reassure you I will not reveal any plot elements and I wish that my review will at least encourage you towards a critical viewing.<br/><br/>Rogue 1* is pretentious because the authors tried very hard to make the characters appear interesting and nuanced, instead they just come out as ambiguous, confusing and -worst of all- fake. An example can be found in the character of the spy/assassin of the Alliance, a character whose moral changes over the course of the movie according to...plot convenience; fortunately I have watched at least once all the previous SW installments, otherwise I wouldn't have known for half the movie who was I supposed to side for. Pretentious (and annoyingly so) is also the John Williamesque musical score, which is booming in almost every scene of the movie to remind us we are watching SW. And it's really too bad that when the imperial march comes on, it only succeeds to provide evidence that we are watching a parody of the original SW.<br/><br/>The back story of the main character is unoriginal and heartless, her words and rhetorics having such an uninspiring effect that she reminds me of a recent female candidate for the US presidency, who likewise was talking to an imaginative audience which had no correspondence to the real one. I do not think a female lead is, as such, a bad choice - I recall f.e. the empowering performance of Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise - but I am convinced, simply out of common sense, that although we might have unisex shirts, jackets and trousers there is no such thing as a unisex character/role. And even though I wouldn't ascribe myself in their ranks I believe that an heroine who behaves exactly as a hero is an insult to the true liberals and the true feminists that Disney is trying so hard to please. I am not going to argument further on this topic as I think I stated my point clearly enough. Quoting a common phrase in Italian: ""chi c'è c'è, chi non c'è non c'è"", who is here is here, who is not here is not here.<br/><br/>Rogue 1* is unentertaining because it is too complex and it has no heart. The plot in each of the original SW trilogy movies was linear and simple, the dialogues edging often to a ridiculous level of naivety, overall it was a script that could have been written by a kid in junior high. And yet it talked so deeply to our hearts, it possessed such powerful mythology that it became - and understandably so - an object of cult by many. That this movie has lost that naivety and simplicity can be observed already from the absence of a substantial opening crawl, which was fundamental in creating that bonfire-tale effect and in establishing a framework for the plot. Instead the viewer is thrown directly into the plot, a plot so contrived and badly narrated it becomes a pain-staking effort for the viewer to figure out who exactly the characters are and what are the reasons of their actions. In fact, as usual these days, we are served with minimal character development and maximal...Armageddon. How many cathartic scenes can there be in a good movie? 1 or 2, right? At which point of the movie are we supposed to expect such scenes? Towards the end, right? Well it seems that recently most authors (and/or most producers) for the big screen think they should cram as many cathartic moments as the length of the movie allows. And once this path is taken not even a Diane Keaton or an Al Pacino (let alone this new generation of actors, who are to older generations what production line workers are to experienced artisans) could help keeping character consistency from flying out the window. The result is that I found myself laughing sarcastically at scenes that could otherwise have kept me at the edge of my seat, simply because the empathy stakes were non-existent.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would like to add that this is my first and only review on IMDb, which I decided to write as I consider Rogue 1 to be a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood blockbuster movies nowadays, thus the title ""One for all, all for one""."

","Let's be clear, it is not up to the level of entertainment, and expectations, of the last installment of the revived franchise. Last year, there was trepidation at the thought of a new star wars movie. This episode goes back in time thus it is pretty well done as far as the times it describes but frankly, it was pretty boring. I do love my fair share of spaceship battles or ground fights, rebels against the evil forces of the Empire but this episode is not much fun or entertainment although I would not accuse it of being badly done. It is only its lack of ""soul"" if ever entertainment had one, or more precisely humour and relationships between the characters whom have just met and are engaged in a battle for their survival. So it is clear there was no time to build relationships or give much depth to the characters. Even the robot wasn't as cute as most of them in the franchise, and R2D2 is more fun to listen to, even though we don't understand a single word rather than the humorous lines of this one. So it was well done, professionally, but flat and, rather boring. I was particularly disappointed in the lack of ""scariness"" of #DarthVader, of all evil ! The magnificent voice is there but it's the allure, the frightening allure of the least human of all dark forces that did not match the usual way we see him. I felt I was being sold a video game (and I wanted to play with it to be honest) but I was not watching a great star wars film."

","I realize that movie makers are people too, and I don't wish to be negative in a cold way. All is fair in art criticism, especially when you review the majors. ""They have their reward,"" goes a famous saying about people who benefit in the hear and now. <br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that there is some kind of agenda in Hollywood, same as what happened with the reboot of Doctor Who in the UK, to make things more ominous and to make sci-fi more like a horror movie. At least this one wasn't too overtly creepy, but more like a idiotic CGI action film. There was a lot of violence in this film. It wasn't graphic violence, more like non stop roughing up of one character against another, and tons of death by laser blasts.<br/><br/>This film has absolutely nothing in common with the first several star wars except the high budget graphics and some of the space aesthetics. It seems a cheap trick that probably still amuses some of the mindless writers to exchange ""dark"" with talent. A darker Star Wars? More like an abusive waste of time. <br/><br/>I really hope the Star Wars franchise don't think they can get away with putting out more trash like this. It seems to try be everything the earlier movies were not -- like some kind of gritty Third World set violent string of cheap explosions instead of character and good-over- evil plot.<br/><br/>I would not doubt if one day these positive ratings were shown to be shills, kind of a Wikileaks of the movies exposing them as false. I think a lot of people are going to feel insulted by this movie."

You know how one has a pang for a Big Mac once in a while for no good reason other than addiction to what is bad and advertising? That is Rogue One! After watching it I knew I had been had, the film was mediocre and forced and my brain regretted it (at least I didn't have an unsettled stomach feeling like with a Big Mac).<br/><br/>The truth is one knows he or she is being manipulated into the price of a DVD by Disney. There is as much a need for this film as there is for Episode VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, the side story about Han, the side story about how Yoda got his ears, the movie about the day Chewbaca's second-born lost his hair (oh those Tabulian fleas!) and how Chewie fought to get the right medicine, the prequel about Luke's 'uncle' and the agricultural school he went to (although that blonde one in Irrigation 301 in the micro skirt was indeed very very hot - she may now get her own movie), the crossover movie in 2024 about how Darth Vader met Moana one time and let me tell you that was some steaming sex (although the general consensus is that the singing was bad), etc etc so on and so forth yadi yada yaa.<br/><br/>Disney will not stop until there is no one at the cinema... at which time it will be reboot time again.<br/><br/>Rogue One itself was quite dark and I kept increasing the TV's brightness. This was a fault I had found with the prequels as well. The story was convoluted and I found the human soldier domino chain aboard the getaway spaceship unnecessarily comical. The physics did not add up either. One second Darth is five steps away and the next the getaway second spaceship is already a kilometre out. The worst was the lack of Force and Jedi in this universe.<br/><br/>I believe I am cured of Star Wars. Well, that is not true I will repeatedly go back to episodes IV, V and VI as I have for years, but future Star Wars and me are probably like McDonalds and me. We best avoid each other."

The opening 20 minutes flits about trying to build a plot which is very weak but OK-ish (its hard to write without spoiling for others) how much can go wrong? the rest of the movie is spent where the heroes are bungling oafs and the baddies incompetent. Don't talk the hero to death, when you have the chance - shoot them and ask questions later! Another triumph for hype over quality. Not a patch on 4,5,6 or 7 but way better than 1,2 and 3.

With two exceptions (definitely NOT including the main female character)all of the characters in the movie made me want to kill them so there would be less screen time with them. It made me rooting for the Imperium since the first quarter part of the movie. Several of the special effects were so terrible it made me wince. The last special effect used in the movie in the last scene for a facelift (those people who watched the movie know what am I talking about, and I am saying this with absolutely no disrespect towards the actress in the scene) made over half of the theatre where I was watching the movie laugh out loud and comment on its poor quality.

"nathan-t-merrill","3","37","73","26 December 2016"," Generic Action Flick with Star Wars branding
","Rogue One is the story of the Rebels who fight to acquire the plans to the Death Star that Princess Leia has at the start of Episode IV. The cast includes a Rebel assassin, a wise-cracking robot, and a girl whose farming family is invaded by Stormtroopers and her mother killed while her father is drug off. Fifteen years later, she's back, trying to get the plans to the Death Star from her father so that the Rebellion can destroy the superweapon.<br/><br/>This is a generic modern action movie with the Star Wars branding on it. The first third or so is disjointed. While unlike The Force Awakens it feels like it is telling its own story, and it feels like it fits into the verse, it also feels like it is disconnected from it - a bunch of people fight and die, all to set up a plot point at the start of Episode 4.<br/><br/>There are two real problems:<br/><br/>1) The movie is poorly plotted. The start of the movie is disjointed; there's a bunch of scenes awkwardly stuck together that don't really end up feeling like they properly stick to each other. Later on, there's literally an entire planet that the group goes to in the middle of the film which serves no purpose whatsoever. It could have been cut and they wouldn't have had a problem – indeed, one of the characters in the movie even specifically suggests not going to that planet, instead suggesting first going to the final planet where the climax of the movie ultimately happens.<br/><br/>Even the final battle sequence doesn't feel particularly well tied- together. In the original Star Wars, every death in the final sequence felt like it was directed towards the goal of defeating the Death Star – and every death made it feel like the rebels were that much closer to failure. In the climactic battle at the end of this movie, however, many of the good guys who die are nearly faceless, and even the named characters' deaths feel like they're extraneous to the plot – simply being killed off after they complete some task, both obviously and arbitrarily. And frankly, one of them simply dies pointlessly, with no actual purpose to his death, while doing something that didn't matter at all to the climax of the movie.<br/><br/>This results in the ending of the movie feeling like it is kind of a generic action sequence where only a small portion of what we're seeing actually matters. Only one death there actually felt at all tragic, and that was the one character who was actually directly contributing to their success at the time of their death. There's little coherence to the final scene.<br/><br/>2) The characters aren't particularly memorable. K-2SO, the reprogrammed imperial droid, is amusing and is the most memorable character in the movie. Almost all of the movie's laugh lines are directed at him. Chirrut Imwe, the blind monk with faith in the force, has some memorability, and there's at least one good laugh line directed at him. Saw Gerra, the rebel extremist at the start of the movie, seems like he might be vaguely interesting, but ultimately very little is done with him before he is unceremoniously killed off towards the end of the first act.<br/><br/>Everyone else – including the two leading characters, were pretty non-memorable. I could barely even remember their names after I left the theater. And that's never a really good sign. Not caring about your main cast, and them feeling like they're kind of generic action movie heroes, just makes it hard to care about anything else in the movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this isn't really something you need to watch. There are better action movies and movies with better plots. There isn't even a light saber battle in this movie. In the end, it feels like a bunch of references to the original Star Wars trilogy, particularly A New Hope, all stuck together in an attempt to make Disney lots of money with the brand name.<br/><br/>It will work. But it shouldn't. There are better movies for you to spend your time and money on."

","Rogue One is an odd creature.<br/><br/>I saw it with a couple of friends not really expecting anything. I love Star Wars and I even partly enjoy the notorious prequel trilogy, but I forced myself to not have too high hopes coming into Rogue One and the result was... decent.<br/><br/>It's annoying that I couldn't really love this film because by all accounts I should. Rogue One offers the audience a more in-depth look into the Star Wars universe, it offers a glance behind the scenes and what happens with normal people, or at least more normal than Jedi and Sith Lords. Jyn Erso, the main character, isn't some 'chosen one' or powerful jedi, she's just a girl who's daddy worked and now works for the Empire.<br/><br/>In fact none of these characters are particularly special in that sense. The other members of Rogue One, although not all delicately expanded, are still relatable and most are good fun, most notably K- 2SO and the rebel member, Cassian. The villain, Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is also not someone particularly special, just an influential individual in the Empire. It's not the 'Vader Show', an easy trap to fall into.<br/><br/>But despite this there's something about this film that just doesn't do it for me. The character of Jyn Erso is far superior in terms of characterisation to last year's 'Rey' but there's still much left to be desired. These characters, although plentiful, are not all that interesting and when the film tries to make the audience see that in some respects the Rebllion is no better than the Empire I feel it focuses on the wrong aspects and misses the mark.<br/><br/>I feel Rogue One wanted to introduce a moral grey to the Star Wars universe, a sense that although the Empire is bad and Rebels good that the Rebellion doesn't exactly employ totally moral means to always achieve its aims, but I rarely ever felt that. By the end of the film it felt like the same old boring 'good vs bad' with an awfully predictable ending mainly due to the fact that 'A New Hope' exists. There's no tension regarding whether the Death Star plans will be recovered because everyone already knows they will be.<br/><br/>I was originally going to award this film 6 stars but the last five minutes of the film (anyone who's seen it will agree) is so well made I had to give it an extra. It's not as good as the originals in my book, probably not as good as 'Force Awakens' and maybe not even as good as 'Revenge of the Sith' but it's still a pretty fun show with some nice gems here and there. I just wished it could've gone the extra mile and kept the gems coming throughout."

But this one really came up short. As for the rest, well it is was typical of Star Wars in great cinematography but that shouldn't be the the ""only"" good factor in a film series with a long standing history. Nonetheless, try not to fall asleep during the first half because the second half picks up the pace with action finally, if you aren't confused by then. There are some good seasoned actors(Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen, Jiang Wen, and Forrest Whitaker) but were sort of hidden behind less notable actors in my opinion. In the end,I left with just the fact that I have seen every Star Wars motion picture to date at the box office."

I even did a marathon of all the films and I have to say that both originals and prequels felt in the same vein: a bit silly, over the top with ""the vision"" of Star Wars, with the technology that looks like in the 1960s if they had a lot more lights on every gadget and star travel, with the black and white battle and the balance of the force. Even the stupid J.J.Abrams version had something to be said about it.<br/><br/>Rogue One is clearly worse than any of the films mentioned. Forget the horrible CGI for Tarkin and princess Leia (I've seen better animation in PC games from 2000), forget the scenes that were in the trailer to get you in the cinema and then removed from the theatrical release, forget the scenes where dozens of extras in plastic plated pajamas ran right in the blaster fire and died, forget all of that and instead focus on the characters. The best actor in this movie is, by far, Alan Tudyk. You know who that is? The robot! <br/><br/>The young charismatic beautiful female (gender swap! yay!) lead character starts off as nobody, does a few inconsistent flips of behavior, is used as a pawn by just about everyone, and ends as nobody. The father and hero figures are just as unsure of which side they are on and just as uninteresting. The villain is a force-less bureaucrat that somehow ends up in all the scenes, even the action ones, bringing absolutely no charisma or element of intrigue. The Alliance is a joke. The references to the other films just thrown out there randomly, with no consequence whatsoever. I cared for NO character in this film. None! They might just as well been all bad CGI characters with a common backstory of forgotten computer animations that ended up in a movie. I. did. not. care.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Donnie Yen's character is a joke, but he is always entertaining when he moves. Alan Tudyk is great as the sarcastic robot. I even liked Riz Ahmed enough to care just a little bit about his character. The rest is utter boredom, waste of time and potential. Rogue One is the first film in the franchise that made me question the reason why I watch these turds. And that's saying a lot."

","Spoilers I was super excited about this new Star Wars movie, the epic story of stealing the Death Star's plans! That sounds awesome! Except that it wasn't. This is not "" just as good as The Empire Strikes Back.""! The characters were not compelling, the story was meh, and they rely to much on nostalgia.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie were incredibly boring. The main hero Jen, played by Felicity Jones, never had the hero aspect and never showed her true importance other then my dad died and he built the Death Star. Cassain Andor, played by Diego Luna, didn't have hero qualities either, he was really just there. The acting wasn't great either. It felt extremely forced and unconvincing.<br/><br/>The story line was thin, like if it was ice you would fall through. They changed the story to much from what the original story was. There wasn't supposed to be Jen. Why is Disney trying to make woman the hero now. It's not a problem, but they are putting them in extremely unconvincing roles. Putting Jen as the lead role didn't really allow the story to have full potential. The story was really just held together by large action scenes and costume design.<br/><br/>Lastly they are relying way way to much on nostalgia. They had these cameos in there like R2 D2 and C-3PO and the aliens form the Mos Eisly cantina. Many most have though that it was clever, but they were lazily placed cameos that served no purpose at all. Reusing iconic lines doesn't make for great dialogue, it came off as lazy. They aren't giving us new other than a few new troopers or ships, they are just using our love of the original to trick us into liking the movie.

","Watching Star Wars Rogue One reminded me how stubborn the entertainment industry is. They come up with a bad idea, which is often a move backwards, thinking it is creative and ignore public backlash against it. First we got that hand-held, shaky camera idea which hasn't gone away. The newest ""invention"" is making movies so dark, we may as well have a radio play instead. Visually, Rogue One is way too dark making one strain the eyes to see what is happening which has become the trend in Hollywood. It's like Hollywood has lost all confidence in its movies and insults the viewer by letting him not see the actors and what is going on. Beyond this, the brightness and contrast are out of whack, colour is drained out, and it looks all blurry. Rogue One looks just horrible. It's very ugly and unattractive.<br/><br/>The second annoyance I had was the dialogue which was delivered in a very wooden style and way too long in most scenes. Okay, we get it, let's move on. The director had the actors ramble on and on when this was supposed to be an action/war movie.<br/><br/>The previous Star Wars films worked because the dark evil spirit and the contrasting good/light spirit were delivered not by tinkering with the cinematography but allowing us to see the actors' faces and thus the emotions, motivations, and attitudes that protruded. We could see how they treated each other, how they felt about each other, something we can't see in Rogue One because of the fogged up murk.<br/><br/>The film's only saving graces were Donnie Yen and the final battle scene.

","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is not what I expected to see, especially after superb reviews, one of which even claimed it to be ""the best Star Wars movie of all eight"" -so far. They either have watched Star Trek films instead of Star Wars or were way too afraid of some fan backlash, I can't think of any other reasonable explanation. Anyway, never trust anyone who calls a ""film"" a ""movie"". This is not the best of all SW films, it probably is not the 7th best either -and yes, I mean you, JarJar Binks! Basically, it's a battlefront film (don't think Xbox, think more like Iraq or Afghanistan) based on the Star Wars universe with Bail and Leia Organa, Vader, Tarkin, and mention of a certain Wedge Antilles; and also some parts reminded me very heavily a certain 007's adventures in Cuba in ""Goldeneye"". Perhaps it is best to think of this as the ""3rd Moon of Endor"" sequence extended to over 2 hours. So, in a nutshell; was it a good film? Yes. Cinematography, CGI, acting (except F. Withaker), Lord Vader doing Vader-like things were all great. However, the film didn't appeal to me. It had no good vs. evil balance, no reason for the viewer to sympathize with the Rebels or the main characters, and, no ideology -in the G. Lucas sense of the concept-. At the end of the day, it was just a get-in-get-the-goods- get-out-or-die-trying kind of job. I don't know but I can count at least 5 films that followed the same routine and did it with one tenth of the budget and better, too. I for one, was mildly entertained but was not left flabbergasted by it. It was an alright film, I am not sorry I watched it. Yet, the major question is whether I or anyone else would part with their money to see it a second, third, or more times? I believe the answer is ""No"" and that is a problem, for sure. I hope they do a better job with Episode 8."

Tell the story of the rebels who stole the plans to the death star and gave Luke and friends a chance in the original. Tie this up seamlessly (literally!) with the original film and it works out pretty well.<br/><br/>Characters were a bit of a mix. The main hero and her companion make a good pair but the sidekicks are pretty much taken off the shelf which reads ""useful generic sidekicks"". The robot that tries to replace C3PO got the biggest laughs in our theater but it was all too predictable. It talked bad but turned out to have a big heart, just something we've seen all that often.<br/><br/>The film is literally just one big chase, where the heroes are never in a moments peace or rest. I liked the scene in the original when they travel in Millennium falcon and play that game of theirs and just talk. This doesn't have any of that, just explosions. Rogue one also tries to milk in on every possibility to awaken some sense emotion, but obviously so transparently that a critical movie goer will just feel embarrassed.<br/><br/>One thing of note is the VERY low level of CGI when they re-created some of the characters from the original movie. It was literally the same as watching a trailer of a new computer game, like Uncharted or something. Totally broke those scenes for me.

(And never do we get any. The main antagonist has more of a character arc.) In the meantime, there are a lot of choppy cuts to different places we know and care nothing about.<br/><br/>This movie was dull, dull, dull. I never cared about any of the characters, the plot, when not chopped to pieces, was a combination of cliché, predictable, and idiotic, the dialogue was extremely forced, and the comic relief character had plenty of hackneyed one liners but no actual personality to support them. (Actually, the comic relief character was basically a self-aware version of Guardians of the Galaxy's Drax. That self-awareness and deliberate comic timing made the character basically a stand-up comedian, and not a particularly good one, instead of an actual character.) Of the dozens of jokes told, maybe three got a slight chuckle out of me -- and none of them had any real value.<br/><br/>I will say this: the visuals were stunning. There was also a brief sequence near the end I quite enjoyed.

"watcher101","5","4","5","10 April 2020"," It was ""meh""
","While enjoyable for a movie, it falls way short of Star Wars standards. To be blunt, the movie was a pointless cash-grab. First, it was hard to even get invested in the characters, as it was obvious that none of them would survive since none were in any of the other movies. But perhaps the biggest issue the movie has is that it literally revolves around addressing a so-called plot-hole of A New Hope (something that isn't actually a plot hole if you think about it.)<br/><br/>So, yeah, we all know about the Death Star flaw in A New Hope. Shoot a rocket down a shaft until it reaches the core and the whole station goes boom. This is the apparent issue that so many people had a problem with that they even going so far as to call it a plot hole. Apparently, it was such a big deal that Disney made an entire movie centering around it, but to me, it was never a problem. The flaw, while having big consequences, was so small and so outlandishly impossible to use against the Death Star that it took a space wizard to pull it off. Think about it, a single exhaust port only two meters wide required a small ship to fly down a trench full of guns to fire a torpedo in such a way that it makes a perfect 90% angle at the exact right moment and then travel down a thin shaft in a perfectly straight line, all while a moon sized battle station is expelling gas and exhaust, which should have pushed the torpedoes out if anything, or at least disrupt their straight line course. This movie makes it so this design flaw was intentionally built into the system, but that's far from believable. The shot was literally impossible to pull off unless you were a Jedi, which makes the whole idea that the flaw was actually an intentional trap built into it completely ridiculous and even more outlandish. That's not a trap, it's bait to a slaughter. This just made the whole plot of Rogue One completely stupid and pointless to me.<br/><br/>However, this movie did give us that awesome Vader hallway scene. That alone made this entire movie worthwhile, even though it was a complete cash grab. Although that scene does now make the whole fight between Vader and Obi-Wan in A New hope seem that much sillier in comparison. I know this movie has gotten a lot of praise, but other than the Vader hallway scene, it was completely unnecessary, and I almost wish it didn't exist, as the trap rather than flaw in the Death Star's design is, quite frankly, really stupid."

","All I can say is that out of all the new Disney movies I have seen thus far, (solo, VII VIII and rogue 1) this was the best of them. This and The Mandalorian show are the best things to come out of Disney thus far. The fact that the Force Awakens has a better score than this movie is a testament to the mental capacity of our society. I don't feel like writing a long-winded review as most people do on here. The movie is well done and was a great prelude into the original Starwars trilogy. It had a good story, suspense a lot of action, great battle scenes and a compelling climax that leads perfectly into episode IV.. Including past characters from the old Trilogy throughout the movie was also a nice touch.. This was simply about a good story and movie without all the other crap.. The only progressive part they stuffed into this one was to make the radical rebels resemble Muslim Freedom fighters, but other than that it was just focused on the story..
In summary this was a more riveting and serious take on Starwars that felt authentic, yet less juvenile. ...Force Awakens in contrast had a very teen ""Disney"" feel throughout the movie with a cast you would expect from Disney..<br/><br/>If our society made sense, the ratings would be similar to

I was actually intrigued the first 15 minutes of the movie and after that we get a conglomeration of new characters and settings in which absolutely no backstory is given. There is no emotional attachment to the characters and way too much is happening at the same time. Apparently the second half of the movie gets a little better, but I would not know because I left the theater at that point. I am a Star Wars fan and this prequel is just as bad or worse as The Phantom Menace."

","Just like the title says I have never walked out of a movie in my life, until now, and I am 42 years old. I have seen a ton of movies in my life in the theaters. I have also never in my life asked for a refund for a movie, until now. I felt cheated, lied to, so I politely asked the manager for my money back and was given it. THIS IS NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE. This is a cash grab. I quickly came home popped in a REAL Star Wars movie and tried to forget the atrocity that I just walked out of. Disney you have ruined what was arguably the best movie franchise in history, and most likely you will continue to do so. This is THE LAST star wars movie I will see in the theater until you prove otherwise. At least we all have the real Star Wars movies, they can't take that away from us."
"Aldo2201","6","15","27","26 December 2016"," Almost as bad as the prequels
","If you are a true Star Wars fan (if your benchmarks are A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back), don't even bother going to see this one in the theatre. It's basically just a bunch of explosions and fight scenes, and of course, the end is a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>My biggest beef with Rogue One is that it lacks the ""mystery"" that we've come to expect from the really good Star Wars movies. Part of this is due to the fact that you already know what's going to happen. But part of it is also because the scriptwriters did a lousy job of keeping us guessing and entertained throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>As was shown in the previews, Rogue One features the return of Darth Vader. One detail about his appearance here made me angry. Disney did not use Darth Vader's original mask design from the early episodes. As fans will remember, Vader's mask originally had sharp angles and spikes that made him look somewhat alien. When Lucas did the prequels, he decided to change the mask design to give him more ""rounded"" features. The end result was that Lord Vader's face looked decidedly smaller.<br/><br/>After all the criticism that was directed at the prequels, the fact that Disney chose to use the new mask design just baffles me. For Star Wars to work, the audiences need to be scared when they see Lord Vader. I find he looks silly with the new face, and if Vader looks silly, then the whole premise of the movie just falls apart.<br/><br/>It's too bad, because the acting and the directing are stellar (no pun intended) in Rogue One. But my general feeling of emptiness when I left the theatre reminded me of how I felt after watching the prequels.<br/><br/>Hopefully the upcoming Episode VIII will bring the franchise back to its original greatness."

I can't overstate how tired I'm of people saying what a SW experience ought to be, that the fans will be pleased, which is just utter rubbish. I shan't waste my energy saying what others have already pointed, such as the fact that SW has become a juvenile franchise - the reason thereof is of no importance to evaluating the movie itself, so I don't care - other than pointing the pathetic portrait of the Empire, or of the Dark Side, really. <br/><br/>The greatest feat of this movie is to show how plenty of resources and direction of the movie itself can be used to get the worst, or just plain mediocrity, of the actors. No acting can be complimented; nothing is impressive or new. The plot is as dull as it can be. <br/><br/>G. Lucas is no Tolkien, let's be honest, but we all tended to forgive incoherencies and the sheer incompleteness and apparent laziness of the wonderful universe he brought to life. It holds still great potential. There's no sign that Disney will explore it. If anything can be said at all, is that one has to learn how be detached, lest one will be disappointed with such insulting pieces of garbage. <br/><br/>I heard some chatter before watching, such as one about the diversity of the cast, but I couldn't care less about that, it's 2017, this is getting old, who cares; I guess Disney should be more concerned with the making of actual good movies rather than ""shocking"" people.<br/><br/>I gave it a 5, because it provided decent entertainment. It's probably a fair, if harsh, a rating. With its pockets full, hopefully Disney will gradually make less horrid SW movies each time, this one is better than Force Awakens.

But this movie is a disgrace, its nothing but a cash cow for the Disney to pound on since the die hard fans will watch as along as it says star wars. The last three movies weren't the great, but still watchable. But this one is almost like a B grade Vietnam war movie. The director lacks the imagination at least of the anime series ""star wars Rebels"" and certainly not the creativity of the earlier movies. The star wars universe provide so much imagination and characters and star systems but the viewers are forced to watch a all human cast saving the day.

For a Disney cash grab. Because this is what it is. Good special effects, junky script, 0 character development, basically easy parts done right, hard parts botched, money made because it's Star Wars. Episode 7 was crap because it was a shameless ripoff of episodes 4,5 and 6. R1 is crap because it doesn't make you care even a tiny bit about any of the characters, some of which are quite annoying, monk being the prime example.

"TorsoDahlia","6","23","45","17 December 2016"," One Word: Underwhelming.
","A rather formulaic, dull epic that is a regular paint by numbers film as we have been here before countless times. Still, a couple of great cameos dating to previous Star Wars films are memorable and enjoyable. The only likable or interesting characters here are Director Orson Krennick played by the always effective Ben Mendelsohn, Galen Erso played by ""Hannibal"" star Mads Mikkelsen & a very sarcastic, dry imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk of ""Firefly"" fame. Personally I would have liked less dull action battles and some better written, more fleshed out characters, but at least we have Krennick even though he sadly is not given much to do. If you have seen the previous 7 films you will most likely be disappointed unless of a younger age, or know what will happen well before it happens. Sometimes it can be fun, but here it is often tedious and annoying. However, take what little enjoyable parts you can and enjoy the last minute, which is great. Could've been a lot better but is decent considering the fact there is not a ton to the plot, so make do with what you have."

","Does a Good movie need over the top hype? Does a Great movie deserve more hype? Is that how movies are to be judged now? So much hype - it's got to be good. <br/><br/>Real world doesn't work that way boys & girls. <br/><br/>This movie is an example. It's just another 'comic book' movie. 80% special effects, 10% plot, and the other 10% equals sleight of hand to make up for the first 90%. The good guys/girls, the bad guys, the machines, weird looking characters are all the same, always the same in SW movies. There is no innovative quality to this movie. It's ho-hum. And why is it ho-hum? Because Lucasfilm Ltd. and Disney know they will make MILLIONS, maybe billions, on anything released even close to being SW in nature. <br/><br/>This film doesn't have to be Great, let alone Good, because the production/money people know we clones will pay to see anything SW related. Love that IMAX 3D don't we!<br/><br/>I personally have always loved the SW music, but this movie even blew that. For the first time I can honestly say the score was too much. During the showing I caught on real quick to the fact the musical score wasn't complementing the action, the music was trying to LEAD the action and those scenes really fell flat. After a while, a musical pattern developed and I could tell a good scene had hit the cutting room floor and was replaced by over the top music. This time the music couldn't make up for the inherently bland movie.<br/><br/>Just LOVED the 'Princess Leia' hologram!"
"jordanhulett1996","3","29","59","19 December 2016"," Very bad execution by director.
","This movie had great ideas and great potential just like Godzilla. However also just like Godzilla the execution was done not terribly but pretty bad. I'm not going to spoil anything because the story line is one of the decent parts of the film. I'm also going to try and talk about real problems and subjective things that weren't to my taste. When I left the theater I thought the movie was alright, then I started thinking about everything I had just watched and realized a lot of it doesn't make any sense at all. This director is really bad at paying attention to little detail. This movie had terrible editing absolutely terrible editing. The amount of jump cuts in this film is compatible comparable sentence. At the beginning of the film inside a home with 3 characters in under 15 seconds it cuts to each character two times each in under 15 SECONDS... It hurt my eyes. There were also very many scenes where pointless 3 to 5 second clips of something that didn't need to be shown was there, which just added to the unnecessary amount of jump cuts. Other than the main character, no character had any real background. Since I'm on characters none of them had any real amount of character progression either. The main character has a personality jump out of nowhere that leads in to a generic ""I must give hope speech to convince people to fight with me"" right after the same people just did something that I'm sure would never be forgiven by anyone. Not within the time she did. Considering the stupid illogical characters in the story I would not trust any of them with my life. I'm trying hard not to go into detail so really this is all I can say. The characters were one of the weakest parts of the film. There were 3 that were likable but again they didn't have any background or character development. Them I guess the last thing I will complain about is the amount of small things that don't make any sense. Sure a couple is forgivable but in almost every scene something did not make sense. From denying logic to just characters doing very stupid things. This is a small complaint and it's a complaint about every star wars film but i do not like gun battles with the storm troopers. When the storm troopers are shot at, there is no entry or exit wound, no holes and they only take one hit to go down. However the human characters can take laser shots to clothing and flesh and still keep fighting... Yeah I""m sorry but no that's not okay. Also there was a scene where the force of a ship taking off rolled a character back off a platform but, corpses, other bodies and objects did not move an inch. I could go on and on about really stupid things that this film had going but I won't waste your time just know that really illogical things like those two examples I just gave happen throughout this entire film. I also think the main characters performance was very stale but again I think that's due to poor directing. Another quick little gripe and this is a little subjective is they felt the need to show a flashback of something that was just in a scene not even 10 minutes before the flashback. This is a personal gripe of mine but it makes me feel that the movie thinks I am incapable of following important story aspects. It makes me feel that the director thinks it's audience is retarded. Instead of a flashback why not just have a really strong emotional scene that has heavy impact on the viewers... I don't think it's the worse movie ever but it had terrible execution, bad editing, lots of continuity errors and generic story aspects and very, very stupid illogical characters. These are all the exact same problems I had with Godzilla and it sucks to see this director hasn't moved forward at all. I wanted to love this movie. If I had to actually have a positive for the film it would be the animation. There were a couple points where I didn't notice certain things were animated... Other than that everything else was just okay or poorly executed."

","Star Wars, Star Wars what have you become? You've always been there for me through the good (Revenge of the Sith), the bad (The Phantom Menace) the unintentional laughter (Attack of the Clones) and the highs (The Empire Strikes Back). But along the way something went wrong you're not the same franchise you used to be. Whilst never entirely reliable you were something I could rest easy with particularly when a certain George Lucas was not at the creative helm. But this is different, Lucas is out of the picture forever and now you present me with this garbage from the trash compactor? Why? Why now? Star Wars should be at new heights and The Force Awakens showed us what love, care and fan service (albeit too much) could do for a franchise that was thought to have had its day. Enter Gareth Edwards, that's no Director, that's a hack! <br/><br/>Rogue One is exactly how you would reasonably expect any Star Wars film to begin (minus the title crawl and John William's music) in Space! Jyn Erso is a rebel on a mission to grasp hold of the Death Star plans and bring the Empire crumbling down. Helpless and frail. It ends how we expect it to end, begins how we would assume it to begin. As for the middle, the plot beats can be neatly charted on a graph for sheer convenience, how kind of Edwards. It's certain that this is not your father's Star Wars, because well that would require a reasonable amount of thinking and thought processes to have taken place.<br/><br/>I will take this moment to bring up where this film excels. Don't worry this won't take me long. The music although it pales in comparison to John William's weakest scores is still admirable, although I do tend to think great things of Michael Giacchino and sadly this does not bolster his reputation so much as hinder it. The cinematography is gorgeous, not to the extent that the originals or Episode VII were, but better than the prequels all the same. Is that high praise? I doubt it. Mads Mikkelsen although given severely little to do is intriguing enough that we want to care about him, yet due to the scripts numerous shortcomings we never in fact do. Or feel any emotion for the main characters themselves, an irksome trend with Edwards's films to be sure. Remember 2014's Godzilla? Same treatment is given to the best characters here, they are put on a backseat whilst the endless CGI drivel is chucked at the screen hoping and praying that something does indeed stick with the audience to the very end. Here's a spoiler it doesn't.<br/><br/>That's the main gripe I have with Rogue One; not its story or its cringe inducing acting (minus the voice of James Earl Jones, thank the gods) but its characters. The group that Ersa becomes a part of is so ill defined that I thought George Lucas must have scrambled in, hijacked the script and completed rewrites. They don't even fit into specific character archetypes because quite simply they have ceased to be characters the moment they step on screen, utter some of the worst one liners in recent memory and stumble out of the frame, promptly leave the scene and try not to look too embarrassed or ashamed with themselves. At this point it's practically a panto. All glitz and glamour, forced heart and humour with no blood coursing through its veins, just dried up oil and a script that I would be surprised if they spent more than a good day on. Yeah, it's that much of a shambles. Because this is what Star Wars is under the watchful eye of the corporate giant that is Disney; manufactured by robots with fake emotion sprinkled throughout, the resemblance of some plot and a plethora of characters all of whom are the comic relief and serve one purpose. To sell more toys! This is what happens when you put the by-products of a film before the actual production itself. A mess, a disaster and something that even Yoda couldn't fix with his wide assortment of powers.<br/><br/>I'm not expecting for anyone to heed my advice and leave Rogue One to play out its life cycle in the cinema whilst you sit back at home and watch the originals in pristine high definition picture and quality. That would be the wisest thing to do, but believe me we both know that's never going to happen. So here's what to do, watch it as soon as possible so you can be spared further pain and then watch all the others minus I, II, III. (Delete where applicable). I'm saving you a world of pain. Who wants to try a Jedi Mind trick on Disney? Maybe we can stop them from causing this disaster that they so clearly want to make. Episode VIII is a mere zap away from becoming a reality and maybe this is the point of the sequel trilogy; to be our shining beacon of hope that will redeem the standalone projects when they inevitably fail and if we are lucky flop too. As for me I'm not holding my breath. You shouldn't either.<br/><br/>D+"

I remember standing in line in the summer heat for hours. No way would I have endured five minutes indoors with air conditioning to see this one.<br/><br/>So I understand Disney bought the franchise and it shows. Disney took an epic sci-fi series and made it less than mediocre and no more than a cliché for the pc lovers at Disney. Oh the special effects are there for sure. After all George Lucas's company handled that part of things but the rest?? Very little to attract the fan of the series. <br/><br/>No one with the force, no Jedi nada. Just very boring script and barely watchable acting. For me watching it was painful. Being stubborn and because I spent money to see it persisted to the end. Argh<br/><br/>So for this old fan - nothing to get excited about. I did notice it went right to Netflix which should tell you something. Perhaps as a standalone film with no Star Wars connection rated against other sci-fi films of the year I would have rated it higher, if for the special effects alone. But trying to tie is to the success of the Star Wars series and throwing a two hundred million dollar budget at it?? Sorry not for me."

","SPOILERS AT YOUR 12 <br/><br/>I give this movie 7.5 out of 10. It wins points for its freshness, introducing new elements to the Star Wars universe like new types of Stormtroopers and new vehicles, whilst teasing your nostalgic sensibilities. Classic characters from the original trilogy and prequels make cameos that build connections to both trilogies and the animated series. Even Aunt Beru's blue milk made an appearance.<br/><br/>I was personally delighted to see both Gold and Red Leaders from Episode IV and even a couple of familiar Cantina's thugs. The action pieces and production design are of high caliber - at once they fit within the Star Wars universe gritty and used looks, and at the same time they help heighten the war zone feel of the movie.<br/><br/>Like all the Star Wars movies, Rogue One takes its inspirations from classics like The Dirty Dozens and Saving Private Ryan. We have heard the story before, things are familiar and yet within the context of Star Wars - they feel bold and brave. Kudos to all the film crew and cast for pushing the envelope and stay close to the director's vision, despite I heard Disney's attempt at making it child-friendly.<br/><br/>And this is where the movie starts to lose points: although the narrative is solid and the story flow doesn't feel 'Forced', it is uneven at places. Especially every time they threw a joke in what should have been a somber or a tensed sequence. There are too many times this happens that I never feel truly immersed in the world. The jokes, admittedly funny, were too frequent and peppered throughout the movie that they diminish the weight of the situation and all the sacrifices that climax with the death of all the main characters.<br/><br/>Additionally, many of the powerful shots and sequences from the second trailer are not in the movie. I would have loved to see that rebel soldier running towards the AT-AT.<br/><br/>At times, it also felt they put in too many references to the original movies that Rogue One never quite spread its wings and be a truly independent vision from all its predecessors.<br/><br/>However, I am sill happy with the overall movie. It is better paced and told compared to Episode VII. It's got my childhood hero Donnie Yen and all the other cast and characters brought gravitas and quality to their performances. Unlike the cast of Episode VII who at times felt like they were so giddy to be in Star Wars and were there simply to stitch the set pieces together. In Rogue One, each character feels they belong with the story line.<br/><br/>Lastly, for a couple of minutes the end sequence made me feel like a boy again: I was five or six watching Episode IV for the first time on TV, terrorized by Darth Vader as he invaded Tantive V and walks through that smoky hallway amongst dead rebel soldiers. For those two glorious minutes I thank Gareth Edwards for finally delivering a Star Wars film worthy of the classic trilogy. <br/><br/>Rogue One never reaches the height of the original trilogy, but it is certainly a bold and fresh take on the Star Wars legacy that more than makes up for last year's recycled sequel from J.J. Abrams."

In particular, Forest Whitaker reprising his role from Battlefield Earth. But the biggest disappointment is the film does not have the striking visuals or sounds that George Lucas would have demanded be made for a Star Wars film. It's those scenes and sounds that made the first six Star Wars so marvelous to watch.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the last 30 minutes is very watchable and has less talking."
"christophechapuis","6","28","57","14 December 2016"," Open letter to Disney, Gareth Edwards and the next Star Wars Directors
","Dear Disney Company, and Dear Mr Edwards,<br/><br/>I just saw your last Star Wars movie ""Rogue One"" in France.<br/><br/>Rogue One is in my opinion a good step forward from Star Wars VII, but is still far from a great movie.<br/><br/>I understand that writing a Star Wars brand is complicated. How to create a story for the children and the parents ? For the newcomers and the religious fans ? And all this while keeping the studio and the investors happy ? Sometime I imagine the writers being checked in their creative process by countless industrial imperatives and I wonder what space is left for magic to appear. From an artistic point of view, my opinion is that Star Wars VII was a failure, and not even a film, but a marketing machine. It was a box-office success, but ""bigger"" doesn't mean better.<br/><br/>Rogue One had huge advantages over Star Wars VII. Less expectations, more freedom, a time-line close to the first movies, and even a good plot idea and a controversial point of view on rebellion. So what could go wrong ?<br/><br/>To sum it up : the story-telling. And in a way, the direction (by whoever had the final cut and I am not sure it is Mr Edwards here).<br/><br/>From the writing of drama lines and situations that have been seen and heard a million times before in generic movies, to the fan-service winks and cameos repeated ad nausea, this movie fails to be great and original and is sent back to the land of the Christmas's products. It will not be remembered, like most of the recent super heroes and action movies.<br/><br/>The acting, the animations, costumes, sets and SFX are good, but the film is not exceptional. Good ingredients don't guarantee a good dish.<br/><br/>So of course it's just a movie. The person with the final cut knows it and maybe his point of view is ""It's OK, there's tons of explosions and spaceships, the kids and the fans will love it, the story isn't that bad, and come on, it's just a movie"".<br/><br/>Well this is what Rogue One is : not art, not a vision, not something new, just an action sci-fi movie with Star Wars flavors.<br/><br/>If you like the Star Wars universe you can still see it, it's not bad, it just lacks magic.<br/><br/>----------------------------SPOILERS BELOW----------------------------<br/><br/>Like Star Wars VII, Rogue One was better when it didn't over-pretend to be a Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>But this movie didn't have the time to develop a very strong story line and to create a real empathy with characters. It is possible to do it, but you have to make some choices and find a good balance between quiet scenes and action scenes. And not put too much scenes as you have only 2 hours.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the total time for the characters to develop very short compared to the action scenes. <br/><br/>With so little time left the options are : bad introduction of characters with no clear background, cliché situation to go fast, strong and sad situations to pretend they have feelings.<br/><br/>But with no time for characters and the constant cuts from one scene to another, the viewer stops caring, even in case of danger of death :<br/><br/>The mother dying after 2 min on screen in a cliché situation ? The father dying after 5 min on screen, with the generic ""last-words scene"" ? And for the others : if they do not care about their life when gigantic rocks fall on their head how could we care ? <br/><br/>Is it a lack of imagination and talent from Hollywood writers, or is it because the cliché make it easier for kids, like if death was nothing and everybody was a kamikaze ?<br/><br/>Many other recent productions follow the same pattern, and it is becoming impossible to believe in the movie and to care for the characters.<br/><br/>Add to this the fan-service plague... From ""I have a bad feeling..."" to the copy-paste ""reference"" scenes (Tatooine-clone again, Tie pilot shooting scene, Yavin X-wing departure scene etc etc). <br/><br/>We already know we are in a Star Wars movie : it is written on the ticket. Please stop... we are not playing a fan contest in a Star Wars convention. Each time you do this over-reference you take the viewer away from the story.<br/><br/>So please, Mr or Mrs in charge at Disney, or Mr next Star Wars Director, try something fresh next time. Try a different pattern of storytelling and a different rhythm, because nothing good will come from this one. Money maybe, but nothing more.<br/><br/>And now for complete subjectivity :<br/><br/>PROS :<br/><br/><ul><li>The actors were good, even if we had no time really to care about their characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Droïd is good.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tarkin was well done but over animated.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The admiral was better than the New Order guy in Star Wars VII.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not a Skywalker or Jedi story : refreshing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good design, vehicles etc.</li></ul><br/><br/>CONS :<br/><br/><ul><li>Dialogues, Storytelling etc</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Red glasses (from clone wars?) don't look good on Vader.

"luap-51485","1","21","41","1 August 2017"," I was bored
","Simply put there Is no character development.<br/><br/>Character development is essential, especially in a movie of this nature. Caring about the characters is what gives action scenes their tension, and I didn't care. So as you can imagine I was bored, plus there are many plot holes and pointless scenes just to throw action in, which you notice a lot more when you don't care.<br/><br/>In the originals, We have funny characters with CHEMISTRY. Han solo is the charming rogue (no dumb pun intended), Leia is the sassy princess, and Luke is our weak hero that grows stronger as the series continues. The action is based around intense dialogue and characters we grow to love and care about. The effects were limited but the characters carry the film like they should. The lightsaber battles may have been a bit rubbish but we were still invested in the stakes we were given.<br/><br/>Rogue one on the other hand is all about effects and visuals. Sure it looks pretty but its bland and boring because there is nothing to invest us in the action. And there is quite an obvious ending that everyone will know.<br/><br/>This film doesn't deserve the popularity and is more evidence that if you slap a star wars sticker on something, people will lap it up regardless"
"frenchjuice","4","17","32","3 January 2017"," Dear Star Wars
","Dear Star Wars, how are you? I am doing good. Let's get to the point, I have a problem with you. I can't enjoy you. I was born way after you and saw two of your films A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back during my cynical teenage years, and I admit your movies are entertaining but they didn't live up to the expectation. That's not a bad thing, I still appreciate you for what you are and what you did to the entire industry but unfortunately I can't enjoy you like the fans of the franchises can. I want to, really bad, but your expectations are incredibly high and the pop culture already showed us what you are multiple times. I skipped The Force Awakens for exactly that, less than a week passed and already I was spoiled of the whole thing and already there was a hype, maybe it was a mistake, I don't know, I will probably visit that film when I am less cynical. <br/><br/>However, your new film, Rogue One, seemed like a good gateway for people that want to get into Star Wars but can't because of the situation we are in. It didn't, it was still entertaining from time to time but I can't say I became a fan of your franchise after this movie, here are the reasons. <br/><br/>1. The characters are ""cool"" but that's mostly it. I like the characters in your movie, they were cool and memorable. My favourite one is probably Chirrut Îmwe as his way of detecting enemies even though he was blind was awesome, and he had a funny side of him. Actually, most of them were interesting but I didn't care about them. Everybody in the movie had a single trait and a skill, because of that feel one dimensional. I don't really know the story behind them and why each of them were so inclined to follow Jyn Erso. (mostly, there's evil and we must stop it) Like at the end of the movie I feel like I learned not that much about the characters and I didn't feel emotional attachment to any of them. <br/><br/>2. Death of the characters were predictable My favourite death in your movie was K2SO's death. His slow death felt was more emotional than the death of Jyn Erso, or any of the death of the Rogue One crew. Because each characters would fulfill their duty and then die immediately. Most of the characters had one thing they had to do and then die. That's why I guess Jyn Erso's death wasn't a big emotional moment for me. In the span of 5-10 minutes all the main characters died. I was tired of it, what's the point? It would be so awesome if one character dies without fulfilling his quest. It would be a emotional moment and as he is dying he would regret it and think that he jeopardized the mission. Even the villain Krennic basically served his antagonist purpose and then died immediately. (I did like how his death was handled, as he is staring at basically his creation killing him). <br/><br/>3. Villains were meh. Krennic was so blend. He could be so menacing, but he wasn't. He was so understated when he could be bigger and when he should be understated he feels caricature. He is ambitious, I get that but he is not that scary. He doesn't have that legendary presence like the Emperor, Vader or even Tarkin has. The second villain Tarkin, other than for one scene when he would give motivation to Krennic, felt useless. Why is he in this movie? I am struggling to remember if his presence shifted the story at all and unlike in A New Hope he doesn't feel like a force to be reckoned with. Part of them maybe due to the CGI character, which sometimes looked like an animated character in a middle of a live action set. Or maybe it's the fact that he feels crammed in to show the connection to the main saga and to please the fans. Finally Vader, who also seems to be a fan service, as in the story he doesn't do a great deal however when he does something it's meaningful. His hallway fight was amazing and he felt like a legend every time he was in the screen. Vader was great and could have been the main antagonist but he was in screen for a such a small time that his character kinda feels wasted.<br/><br/>4. The world. I know that the biggest thing about you Star Wars is the lore and the world, then why the heck did you introduce all the planet's name in the bottom left hand corner? That's so lazy and doesn't tell anything. Also the landscape changes a lot so we can't stay at an interesting place so that we can get adjusted to it.<br/><br/>Those are my main problems. There are some great things about you, the technical aspect of you are amazing, and you aren't using the main franchise to convince the moviegoers to watch this film. I was also entertained here and there but unfortunately your latest film Rogue One didn't convince me to join Club Star Wars. You might say that I am being unfair to your new movie simply because it is a part of you and in some aspect, I am. I am judging this film by high standard because it has your name on it. People flock to the theatres if a movie is connected to you, I get why but you haven't shown me why. This film was average. This film didn't show me why so many people find Star Wars endearing. I want to get to know you, Star Wars but you aren't trying hard enough. Be risky, emotional, great.<br/><br/>Show me you deserve the praise.<br/><br/>Sincerely, an asshole on the internet"
"SirKashmir","6","11","19","26 December 2016"," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, fan service with terrible pacing
","My favorite Star Wars movie was always The Empire Strikes Back, not only because it is the best Star Wars film but because it is a well crafted movie as a whole. Through the eyes of a fan everything can be good except maybe for George Lucas' green screens, but it's an obligation to watch and review it as a movie, not as a hype product. That's why The Empire Strikes Back is so great, it doesn't matter from what perspective you are viewing, either Star Wars fan or movie buff, it is still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Rogue One tells a very messy story with uncharismatic characters about something that didn't need to be explained. The movie has poor character development leading to them being boring and irrelevant to spectators, including the protagonist Jyn that lacks charisma even for a role in a meaningless spin off. Every character feels shallow and the acting doesn't help to change that, just makes it worse.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is were it shines, it's so utterly bad that establishes a whole new level of terrible pacing in movies. Half of it's duration being slow paced scenes with failed character development, making it very tedious, and the other half being so chaotic with so much rushed action scenes that it also succeeds on being tedious. It's also worth noticing that this movie uses some of the most unconvincing plot devices I've ever seen, like a necklace, leading me to question if the script was lazily written or that they just couldn't think of anything better.<br/><br/>With the two main characters being abysmally acted and uncharismatic the movie feels dragged with very few good scenes, almost none of them being in the first half. A lot of the time I didn't even care about what was being shown at the screen, this includes all of the cheesy death scenes. How can someone be emotional about a death scene of a character that meant nothing to the spectator the whole movie? Cramming almost all of these death scenes at the last 30 minutes felt rushed, mainly because none of these characters could be left alive since none of them actually existed in the Star Wars universe before this movie.<br/><br/>Besides all of these flaws, and the force brainwashing used in at least 4 scenes, the movie presents a good photography, and great use of special effects. <br/><br/>The whole experience could be better but it does what it was meant to be done: to give fans another Star Wars movie. Not for the sake of being an excellent movie, like The Empire Strikes Back, but for the sake of being another Star Wars movie."

","I am not a Star Wars fan, but must say that the old trilogy was and is very viable and cool, whereas newer trilogy started well, but then plunged into a total mess of a horrid making. This new pre- pre- prequel is not good. Why? Let's be honest - it's slow, it's very long, fat too much longer thane it has to be in fact. Be it 90 minutes, the world would devour it better. With its 2 endless hours run and very boring slow scenes it seems an eternity. Honest. The plot? Ah, rubbish, the obvious exploiting of far too well known scenery, places and even monsters. The main hero? Nay, she is just okay, but in a deeper sense, she is none above average and is paled into insignificance when displayed in relief of better stars. The effects? Good, but again, we have seen it all time and again. So, what remains? Nothing, in fact. Even all the recognizable characters and places do not warm up our hearts, all 2 hours an undying feeling of exasperating discomfiture does not leave us. We've been had by and racketed by greedy studio bonanzas."

","SPOILER ALLERT!!!!<br/><br/>When you are using real actors and not ""reheated"" stars alongside silly semi-amateurs, plus a script that does not self plagiarize, any movie from franchise can only be good and very good at least for a hardcore fan like yours truly. Rogue One dares to get out from the Star Wars clichés, but not so much as to alienate the fan-base. It is designed as a single episode without the possibility of a sequel, because otherwise it would be seriously out of time line of the universe. Action is firmly anchored in the main story and in general throughout the universe by the appearance of characters (Senator Bail Organa, Saw Guerrera, Mothma mother, Princess Leia - CGI and of course Darth Vader in the flesh ... and various gadgets attached trough was, you know ..) or by references to them (at one point is heard the name of Admiral Syndulla - Hera Syndulla from Star Wars Rebels). I can not help noticing the courage with which the filmmakers abstained to ""exploit"" heavily Darth Vader, risking nose grimace of a significant portion of the American public that wants endless remaking of the first three films, mistake they made, from my point of view, in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Overall, the script does not contain exaggerated sentimental effusions, relationship between Jyn and Gaelen ERSO is treated naturally as possible without accents of soap opera. K2 android has replicas of natural humor, unforced. As I said, the acting is well above the average Star Wars movies and I may remark Bob Mendelsohn, actor ""specialized"" on negative roles in Director Krenik character, whom he plays it brilliantly. Also, a great novelty, at least from my point of view, is ""Cassian Andor"" the character played by Diego Luna brilliantly. I think that is the first true three-dimensional character of the entire Star Wars series, not like rebels with a heart of gold - Han Solo but authentically. Captain Andor is able to kill in cold blood for the cause he believes in honestly and has a dark but human side, real and not simulated as in other cases."

","Now I know that many of you guys will be smashing that ""Not Helpful"" button because I am giving this a bad review (because the same thing happened when I gave ""The Force Awakens"" a very positive review), but there's one thing I beg you to do. Hear me out! Read this review before deciding that I have no good taste, because I believe that I have good reasons to personally dislike this movie, even if others like it. And I will admit there are positive things about it. As a matter of fact, the performances (except for Forest Whitaker's really silly accent), directing, and visual effects are all very well done. I will not deny that this is a well made film that took some hard work and effort to create.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>It is boring! There is nothing particularly interesting about the plot, the characters all have little to no personality, I was so bored I wasn't paying any attention-I was just staring at a screen as random stuff was being thrown in my face. It is packed with uninteresting dialogue, surprisingly boring action sequences, and an overly depressing tone. I am all for dark movies, but this is just ridiculous. One of the most annoying new blockbuster movie clichés is that every movie has to be so dark and depressing for seemingly no reason, simply because it works flawlessly with Christopher Nolan's work. But, this is because Nolan is a much more talented filmmaker than Garreth Edwards, whose work I admittedly enjoyed in the past. I thought that, while very flawed, his 2014 ""Godzilla"" movie was really underrated and epic. I enjoyed that movie, even if it was dark there were still cool things about it and it didn't feel overlong or boring to me. Unfortunately, this film is DEFINITELY boring for me, and is almost factually overlong.<br/><br/>Think about it, the whole concept of this film is stealing plans. If the characters were developed, perhaps it would be worth a 2 and a half hour runtime, but the characters each have little to no personality or backstory. This is a movie of nothingness, of a painful dullness. I attempted to eat too many Reese's Pieces during this movie so I could throw up because then something interesting would be happening. Footage of me pathetically vomiting out of boredom would be a much more powerful and engaging movie with better characters and conflict than ""Rogue One"".<br/><br/>I watch movies to be engaged and fascinated, not to be bored. This movie is just flat out BORING. I've already stated that plenty of times in this review, but that is because I mean it with all of my heart. I could not pay attention or care about anything that was going on because of the lack of personality the film had in its writing and even in its cinematography. The visual tone of this film is needlessly dull and grey. I know many will defend this movie by calling it a ""gritty war drama"", but it doesn't work as that either. Also, ""Star Wars"" is mainly a fantasy universe, why would I want to watch a gritty war drama taking place in this universe rather than in a more realistic environment. Why do the most fantastic, wondrous concepts have to be transformed into something realistic? The original trilogy, which pretty much everyone agrees includes the best three films in the entire saga, did not try to be realistic. It tackled a few realistic themes and conflicts, but those themes were never made to be over the top. The original films were not gritty, they had much more humor and fun. They were entertaining thrill rides that also included characters and stories we cared about. They could be intense, funny, and even tragic at times, and it always worked because they were made in such a way that the viewer was always engaged in the story, the viewer always liked the characters. ""Rogue One"" is the opposite of this.<br/><br/>Now I'm getting really controversial...<br/><br/>So it seems that 90% of IMDb user reviewers thought that ""The Force Awakens"" was 1/10 trash, despite it being a very well made and colorful film that genuinely had some heart and soul. It was flawed, but it was also fun. The special effects were wonderful, it worked as a celebration of ""Star Wars"". The characters were likable and (for the most part) memorable. It had humor and heart, action and suspense. It may have been a very unoriginal movie due to it being so ridiculously similar to the original 1977 classic, but at least it felt like the people behind it were much more loving and joyful. It feels like the people behind ""Rogue One"" just wanted to kill themselves and make money from basement dwelling internet geeks. However, ""Rogue One"" is packed with 10/10 star reviews, people saying that it made up for ""The Force Awakens"". This is something almost impossible for me to wrap my mind around. Was it just more awesomer? Were the past references so epic that it is now a masterpiece of cinema?<br/><br/>I am sure there are plenty of great and intelligent people that will disagree with me entirely, and I am well aware that I may have been a little unfairly mean while making fun of some members of the ""Star Wars"" fanbase, but the overall point of this review is just:<br/><br/>This movie is boring and I do not understand the praise."

Some parts of the second act can kinda drag but it is all worth it for the especially awesome 3rd act Battle Of Scarif. The Battle of Scarif is everything I want from a Star Wars battle in a movie. Space battles with Rebels attacking the planet gate, to ship battles in the air of Scarif, to the awesome ground battles with Rebels on the ground near the Citadel tower. I love new Star Wars ships and troopers and stuff like that and this movie gives you plenty of that with stand outs include Shore trooper, Tie Striker, Combat Assault Tank, U-wing, At-Act, and Death Troopers.

","Gareth Edward's entry into the Star Wars universe with his spin-off 'Rogue One' is a bold move, getting rid of the Skywalker family completely. In place of them are a group of unmemorable characters who are an exciting story filled with many callbacks and use of nostalgia. 'Rogue One' is a very good Star Wars film, with an exciting score by Michael Giacchino, and a creative fun 'Saving Private Ryan' take on Star Wars, showing the war aspect of the saga. The comedy in this film works with the main cast and the fight scenes are very well done, and the acting is very good among most of the main cast. The only fault I see with this installment is the lack of reason to care for any of the main characters other than our main heroine. The film introduces these characters very quickly and gives them a quick sad story. It will be difficult to walk away from this film saying that you remembered all of the main characters names. However this is a stand-alone, regardless still manages to be a fun Star Wars flick."

","I see a lot of glowing reviews, perhaps we watched a different movie.<br/><br/>The good: For the hard-core fans, yes see it. Also, the story was not a simple remake; that part is good. And, as always, the special effects were great. <br/><br/>The bad: Be warned that this movie was dark, brooding, had non-stop tiresome violence and killing, was overly long, and had milk toast tie-ins to the characters we know. Also, the audience was assaulted with a plethora of unknown characters without background, context or hope. What was missing: any on-screen friendships that you could care about, light moments, or really anything to make you smile. <br/><br/>The movie had a very impersonal torch to bear. Like an explosion, the movie tore through the story line in a rush to fill in the gaps of the SW master story line, but in the process, it abandoned any concern for simple warmth, basic charm, or even subtle charisma. I left the theater tired and in a funk; longing for some of the Lucas' bad prequels. <br/><br/>Conclusion: In the end, I don't regret that I saw it, but I would not watch it again; this is one of my least favorite SW films (episode 3 is still at the bottom, by a good margin). Perhaps your take will be better than mine."
"andymiller-47999","5","15","28","26 December 2016"," Rogue One: Just Your Average Star Wars Story
","I first want to start off by saying that I am a true fan of the Star Wars movie franchise. They are some of my all-time favorite movies to watch except for the prequel trilogy (they're awful). A New Hope is one of the best movies in cinematic history, and Empire Strikes Back as well as Return of the Jedi are absolutely phenomenal films in their own right. These three films have created a fictional universe, along with one of the most crazy and loyal cult fan bases the world has ever seen. When we learned that more Star Wars films would be created when Disney acquired the Star Wars Franchise, many fans including myself were excited yet, we also had a bad feeling about. I truly believe the fan base was duped when George Lucas created the prequel trilogy. We want more movies but only if they are quality movies. JJ Abrams delivered what fans wanted; He did an awesome job directing and reviving the franchise with Force Awakens this past year. Fast forward a year later, and you have Rogue One, the most average Star Wars movie ever made. <br/><br/>Rogue One wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. There are many things I thought were well done and there are things in the film that were terrible. One of the worst parts of the movie was the entire first hour of the film. The director, Gareth Edwards, did nothing to pull me into the movie. By being a huge Star Wars nerd, I should instantly be engaged in the film simply because it's a Star Wars movie. One of the main reasons this didn't happen was due to the omission of the opening crawl. My brother and I, being the massive Star Wars fans that we are, were incredibly dumbfounded and offended by this. The opening crawl is vintage Star Wars and not having it in the film was a huge mistake. Another reason I was not pulled into the movie was the lack of emotional attachment of Jyn Erso and the other main characters. Unlike the original trilogy and the Force Awakens, there was nothing about the main characters that made me like them and thus I had zero connections with them, therefore, when they all started to die in the amazing climatic battle, I really didn't care all that much. An example of this is seen with Saw Guerra, a great character from Cartoon Network's animated Clone Wars Series. His presence in the film did not do him any justice, and he shouldn't have been in it to begin with. I also thought they could have so much more with Donnie Yen's character. Through him, the film could have explored some of the mythology surrounding the Jedi. The planet of Jedah (the one to be blown up by the death star) is the home world of the Jedi. This idea wasn't explored at all and could have been a real bright spot to the movie without having any actual Jedi in the movie. Overall, the lack of an emotional connection with the main characters really hurt the film in the final act. When I can't even remember the names of the Rogue One fighters when writing this review, it clearly isn't a good sign. <br/><br/>Another major detail that should be noted was the lack of the original Star Wars soundtrack. Soundtracks are what help set apart good movies from award worthy movies (Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, The Last Samurai). Music is played in the background to establish the tone of the scene and dictate how we as the audience are supposed to feel at that specific moment. The original Star Wars soundtrack is so iconic that even a five-year-old child can recognize it. It was clear that it was mostly absent from the movie. For a few scenes, for example when Bail Organa and Darth Vader first appeared, the iconic music was played and as a result, these scenes were some of the most memorable. <br/><br/>While there were many things that upset me about the movie, there were some great things that helped make this film incredibly average. First off, the film was loaded with amazing visuals. Every shot was beautiful and had a purpose in telling the story. Second, the acting was actually very good for the lack of depth for the main characters specifically Ben Mendelshon. Third, the film had great action and especially the final space battle (I didn't care about the fight on the ground with the Rogue One fighters because I had no attachment to the characters as they started to drop like flies). Darth Vader was also used perfectly in the film. Not too much and not too little. The final sequence on the rebel ship as he mowed down the rebel fighters showed us the true powers of the most iconic villain in cinematic history. This was easily the most memorable sequence in the movie for me. Darth Vader's cameo as well as others were some of the bright spots of the movie. Bail Organa, Mon Montha, Moff Tarkin, R2-D2, and C-3PO were the most obvious. Even some of the smaller characters such as Red and Gold Leader were awesome to see in the film that your average moviegoer would not pick up on. However, what shinned the most in Rogue One is how it set up a New Hope. The final ten minutes which included Darth Vader's rampage, the plans moving being transported to the republic ship, and Leia receiving the plans was nothing but perfect. <br/><br/>Overall, I found Rogue One to be very disappointing after last year's release of The Force Awakens. I believe this movie had so much potential as a Star Wars movie but ultimately it failed to live up to its predecessors as it's only an average Star Wars movie."

","This movie is everything I had hoped it to be and far, far more. Literally every choice they made while making it was a right one. The cast acts well and creates excellent, lovable characters. The visuals are incredible. Writing is beautiful. Action is perfect. Story is original, well-crafted and at the same time manages to fill in some plot holes in later set films.<br/><br/>I have tried very hard to find even a single thing I disliked about the film and only came up with one minor thing. The music. It is by no means bad, but it's not extremely memorable. As it's a different composer, he didn't use much of the classic star wars tracks (with a few exceptions here and there). Often there's a track that starts similarly to the old ones, but goes in a different direction. And while it's not bad, it just didn't feel as powerful as the classic music did."

"darnelltrinity","4","24","49","19 December 2016"," Mediocre
","Rogue One is an 'okay' movie. Not great, just okay. I had no expectations going into it, and I left, still feeling nothing. This was partially due to the acting, and partially due to the story line. As a female, I enjoy strong female characters in movies. However, Jyn (Felicity Jones) never had a moment in the movie that 'wowed' me. In fact, none of the characters from Rogue One impressed me. The acting was substandard. Due to the story line, none of the characters had a chance to shine, as in previous Star Wars movies. At least in The Force Awakens, Rae (Daisy Ridley) was believable during the fight scenes. Jyn, not so much. Many of the lines, which was not the actors' faults, were very cheesy. Cheesy enough to make me cringe. I held absolutely no sympathy when all of the characters died, because the movie allowed me to feel nothing for any of the characters. Also, the small spark of romance between Jyn and Cassian felt very forced. This movie was honestly not necessary. Everyone who watches the Star Wars movies can most likely assume that the plans of the Death Star were miraculously retrieved by the Rebellion from some glorious battle and then given to Princess Leia. Therefore, the story was just drawn out. Most of the movie was slow, until the fighting at the end. Some people say that the picture was great and it was so beautiful, but I do not watch a movie for being pretty, I watch movies for entertainment. The story line lacked substance, and the highlight for everyone was when Darth Vader made his debut. Unfortunately, he was only in the movie for three minutes at the most. Overall, I was not impressed. Rogue One was nothing new, as it simply showed what we already knew happened. None of the actors were able to outshine the weak story line and it all led to a mediocre movie. Also, K-2SO was no R2-D2 or BB-8. He said like two funny things, and then he was annoying."

","At first glance Rogue One looks the part. However the great cinematography, interesting locations, and classic Star Wars aesthetic are merely a veneer, a carefully crafted charade that hide the superficiality underneath.<br/><br/>The film is not devoid of value. The action sequences are good and certain elements of the story are interesting.<br/><br/>Possibly its best but least explored dynamic is the class divisions within the Rebellion itself. At the top are upper-class elites who are timid about getting their hands dirty and on the other side are hardened extremists like Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) who is an inverted Darth Vader, kept alive by a mechanical apparatus.<br/><br/>However, despite a few genuinely fun moments, the film does not stand up to hard scrutiny upon second viewing, nor does it actually add anything of significance to the franchise.<br/><br/>The dialogue is clunky and repetitive.<br/><br/>The characters are two dimensional and none are really given enough time to develop.<br/><br/>The plot is generic and doesn't take any stylistic risks, sticking to a very familiar Star Wars structure.<br/><br/>The pacing is too fast, constantly moving from location to location.<br/><br/>The music lacks the subtlety, sophistication, and acoustic quality, of A New Hope's.<br/><br/>The cameos are buoyed by unconvincing performances that, for a film so obsessed with banking on nostalgia, should have looked and sounded exactly as they do in the following film.<br/><br/>Rogue One could have been an interesting experiment into fusing different genres into the Star Wars franchise, but it ended up as a generic filler film that fills a gap in the narrative no one needed to have filled.<br/><br/>As a mindless action film that puts you in the space of the Star Wars Universe it's effective, but as a story that adds any value to the Star Wars lore it isn't."
"vniktron3000","5","8","13","4 October 2017"," Thoroughly Disappointing
","I don't know why some many people thought this was a good movie. The writing is terrible. There is no character development. They don't even have so much as a personality, each character is just the bones of an overused trope. I couldn't tell if the actors were good because their interactions with one another were so unnatural. The main character's only defining characteristic was her relationship to her father, who had no personality either. Because all the characters were nobody, when they started killing them off it wasn't emotionally impactful at all.<br/><br/>Rogue One had no worldbuilding to it at all, which is one of the things that made Star Wars so appealing. At best there's the introduction of a couple of new-looking droids and aliens in the background. <br/><br/>Visually, it didn't look great. Of course the effects were fine, but many scenes had a muddy look as if large portions of them were blurred to look good in 3D. <br/><br/>Rogue One made me decide I don't want to spend money on another Star Wars movie or merchandise because it's so clear Disney is just going to start churning out low quality movies year after year, trying to milk as much money as it can out of the Star Wars franchise before it becomes a joke."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","8","13","9 January 2017"," The true prequel to Star Wars (1977)
","More often than not, spin-off and rip-off become distressingly synonymous. Not this one. But then, it is not really a spin-off , something you sense more and more throughout the movie, until you finally realize that by right, ""Rogue One"" can claim to be more of a prequel to ""Star Wars"" (1977) than the ""Skywalker trilogy"" (I coined).<br/><br/>To those of us who have watched the original in 1977 (and probably numerous times on a TV screen since), the one most obvious plot deficiency has become so eroded over the years that it is now all but oblivion. I am talking about the question why would such a meticulously designed, formidable killing machine as The Death Star would have an Achelous's heel that is pivotal to the entire story. ""Rogue One"" provides a logical answer.<br/><br/>It starts with a family in hiding being sought out by the Empire, resulting in the mother killed and the father and young daughter captured. Some years later, we see grown up Jyn (Felicity Jones) in prison, a little trick the movie makers play on us. She has not been in captivity since the last shot we saw her in, but was in fact rescued by militant resistance Saw (Forest Whitaker) shortly after that. She then turned delinquent and is now in jail for some minor offences, with a false identity. Nobody knows she is the daughter of top Empire scientist Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) whom we saw in the opening scene forced to come out from a quiet rural life to do some more research.<br/><br/>I wouldn't elaborate the plot here. While there are some twists and turns (including what has happened to Galen), it is in fact quite simple. The single most important thing is that Galen knows that if he does not complete the design of the Death Star, somebody else will. What he did was to secretly add a weak point through which the indestructible Death Star can be destroyed. It is quite predictable that before he dies, he tells Jyn where this map containing this vital information is hidden deep in enemy territory. The mission for our heroes is to find the map and transmit it back to the resistance base.<br/><br/>So who are these ""heroes""? To make things simple, I'll just say who play them: Diego Luna plays the militant resistant fighter, Donnie Yan and Wen Jiang play an odd couple that embraces The Force – a blind monk and a wild warrior, Riz Ahmen plays a pilot with a conscience defected from the Empire, Alan Tudyk's voice is the most recent addition to the Star Wars robot collection, one K-2SO. Of course, in the grand finale set piece (which by the way is excellent) there is the company of resistance fighter pilots.<br/><br/>""Rouge One"" is a slow tease of Star Wars fans that builds up gradually to a satisfying conclusion. You don't get the rousing Star War theme at the opening. Background music initially is only vaguely, but tantalisingly familiar. Then, slowly, all the familiar melodies emerge, one after another. Likewise, the vehicles you see at the start are not entirely familiar but in the end, you would almost believe you are watching the finale of Star Wars (1977). Other familiar hardware that emerge towards the end include the giraffe-legged (two legs only) tanks from the original Star Wars trilogy. Characters? You see a very brief glimpse of C3PO and R2D2 with one line of dialogue (don't think I have to tell you spoken by which one). Chewbacca too, but make sure you don't blink whenever a bar scene starts, or you'll miss him. Then somebody starts throwing around dialogues like ""I've got a bad feeling about this"". Light sabre too, wielded by Darth Vader, another cameo. And as I alluded to, in the grand finale set piece, you would almost feel that it is Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in the pilot seats – you have finally come home. And then.there is that very last, 5-second shot. I cannot go on any more, as tears are blurring my eyes"

This makes for an oddly paced, unbalanced movie that is simply rather bland and boring. Even the special effects were tame and the much discussed CGI revival of some characters looked quite ridiculous. The film is not terrible, but considering the resources at the disposal of the makers, it does not deserve a higher rating. The Darth Vader cameo is the only element that is extremely well done."

","While I did not grow up anywhere near the release of the original trilogy of the star wars series, I did grow up watching them again and again on VHS tape. The original trilogy, and even the prequels to a degree, presented a bright, fun world full of intrigue, action and adventure.<br/><br/>The fact that on my very first viewing of 'Rouge One', I actually fell asleep half way though the movie, tells you everything you need to know. I attempted to watch the movie a second time, and once again dozed off at a few points, relying on my family to periodically wake me up so that I didn't miss the plot too much.<br/><br/>This movie's attempts to breakaway from high fantasy action-adventure, and make a dark, gritty sci-fi, has resulted on one of the most insultingly dull movies that I have been made to sit through. Most of the story is an unintelligible confusing mess, impossible to follow plot, no lovable or relatable characters, and an annoying monk who won't stop chanting (which is WAY more annoying that it sounds, trust me).<br/><br/>This movie attempts to fill in the gap between Episodes 3 and 4, and does a pretty poor job. If the first hour and twenty minutes had been cut from this movie, and the last forty or so left in, it would have turned out exactly the same, in terms of plot. We didn't learn anything worthwhile or important during the set up, just a fairly good action climax at the end. Even the ending stand-off between the opposing sides felt like a watching a video-game, rather than a good movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that you do not watch this movie, as it is a failure as a Star Wars title, and a movie in general. Or, just skip three-quarters of the way into the run time, and watch from there. The anti-hero side character has an annoying voice too. Everything that's meant to be chilling or gripping, like the monk or the anti-hero, come across as boring, or annoying, and in this case, both.<br/><br/>I do not believe that the director could have watched this movie back and felt proud of it, as it is just outright uninspired. Pointless Star Wars title that should never have been made. I would EASILY consider this to be the worst Star Wars movie that I have ever seen. (yes, even the Phantom Menace was better. WAY better.)"

","Okay, so Mrs. Shullivan insisted we go to the movies (since we were entering a New Year) and she had heard only great reviews from friends how fantastic this new chapter was in the Star War series. So we went all out and upgraded to the 3D film version with reclining theatre seats and waited for the film to start. <br/><br/>Let me say that I did not mind the original 1977 film episode IV A New Hope, and even the subsequent two (2) films, episode V (1980) and episode V1 (1983) were passable theatre versions. But when the Star Wars film empire commenced with their Christmas mass merchandising effort and a continuous new epic (or spew yech) film every few years my own interest in the Star Wars series waned. <br/><br/>Being the good sport that I am I agreed to get to the theatre early so we would not disturb anyone else and after sitting through 20 minutes of TV quality commercials, the movie started. The gist of the film is about a young five (5) year old Jyn Erso being instructed by her parents that she had to proceed in to her survival mode as the bad guys showed up to whisk daddy away so that he could complete building the ultimate laser weapon to destroy anything that the bad guys wanted to destroy. What followed over the next 15 years or so is the young five (5) year old Jyn learns to survive on her own and as a young female decides to find her father the scientist and save the world from weapons of mass destruction ....once again.<br/><br/>If you like CGI and starships blasting each other out of the galaxy for the majority of the film then this chapter in the Star Wars saga will be right up your proverbial alley. As for me and Mrs. Shullivan we can sum it up in the following words: All hype and CGI and boring as hell. I give this chapter a 3 out of 10 rating and only for their marketing effort. I guess my personal review of Rogue One will illicit a lot of ""not agreed"" responses as the 184,601 reviewers have rated this film with a overly generous 8.1 rating.

"Gatorman9","5","6","9","5 November 2017"," And the Modern Movie Continues To Decline . . .
","(Spoiler Alert?) <br/><br/>Where to begin? Let's start with the rating. At the time of this writing - November, 2017 - it stands at 7.9. 7.9??? Indeed? Just look and see what REAL movies have gotten a 7.9 on the IMDb, and then ask yourself whether this Cartoon comes anywhere near close. Admittedly, it is easy to understand why the Loser demographic might see it that way, and it would not be the first time a movie designed like this so appealed to 15-year-old future non-achievers (as well as those still living in their parents' basement at age 27), but it is completely out-of-line with the broad spectrum of movies made since The Great Train Robbery became the world's first feature film in 1903. Maybe the IMDb should have a dual ratings system: one for real movies, and another for Star Wars / Star Trek spinoffs. <br/><br/>Essentially, this movie is a predictably unsuccessful attempt to merge the now-venerable Star Wars genre with the more modern explosion-and-grunge-fest genre where the stars are flashes of light and smoke that go ""boom"", and the Awards at the end of the year get handed out only to the special effects department. These are two different genres that this movie proves do not blend well (even if the explosion-fest offered anything to anybody other than a zit-faced adolescent male with a C-average). The former genre was light, breezy, optimistic, good old-fashioned melodrama; classic action-adventure with the the can-do spirit tone of classic action adventure. It eschews the need to tangle with much if any moral ambiguity, something the original Star Wars was noted for as a breath (actually, more like a WIND) of fresh air in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, post-1960's-mayhem world of 1977 when it was first released. The second genre is perpetually moody, downbeat, apocalyptic, oppressive, and frequently overwhelmed with moral ambiguity. Nobody is ever very calm or confident; the actors are scruffy if not utterly grungy; and even the girls are never really very pretty, either. (I have to wonder if this genre appeals to certain people because they, too, are perpetually downbeat and hopeless in their overall outlook, and such movies are something they can relate to.) Thus, the main characters here are almost utterly devoid of humor, much less any kind of love of life, as well as much external beauty. The result is that they are not compellingly likable, nor compelling in any other way. One could be forgiven for rooting for the villains, here; at least they were true to their warped souls and they certainly believed unambiguously in their own values, such as they were, as well as themselves (not to mention being impeccably well-groomed!)<br/><br/>Perhaps worse still, basic story-telling gets lost in all the noise and smoke. With this movie, I don't know what happened, except that the good guys get what they are after in the end. But I can't tell you just exactly how they did that. The frenetic scene-shifting is just too fast and frantic for that. And in that, the movie fails utterly. The purpose of nearly any movie is to tell an entertaining story. Being ""entertaining"" means getting you emotionally involved. Here, the story gets too muddled to follow completely, and when that happens, it loses its dramatic (i.e., emotional) grip on the audience, and what should be a powerful, compelling, even epic story becomes a gigantic, expensive ""so what?"" While this movie does a creditable job of aping interesting combat moments from modern war movies from *Apocalypse Now* to the present, it doesn't matter. It is hard to get emotionally-involved enough to care what is happening on the screen for too much of it. Whatever deficiencies the George Lucas movies may have suffered from (George Lucas did NOT make this one), he never lost sight of that. <br/><br/>And thus, in those parts where this movie stays true to its Star Wars roots, it has some of the classic Star-Warsian features that were so significant to elevating the franchise to the lofty heights of popularity it has enjoyed. The secondary characters are often very interesting and there are a number of clever lines and plot devices that showcase that; in point of fact, they are often more interesting than the main characters. The way they are included here also evokes a certain *Magnificent Seven* quality which is welcome even if it is not a classic Star Wars flavor. If there was anything wrong with them it was that in combination with the main characters and other supporting characters, there were too many of them, with too little time available for focusing adequately on each one. <br/><br/>Moreover, the movie has the now-classic Star Wars look and sound (if mostly lacking in its feel). The music was not bad if not as prominent as is characteristic of the earlier films. The special effects were as good as they should have been. Appropriate cameos by major story arc characters and actors necessary to graft this story, which is after all a subsidiary one to the main arc, now drilled into the audience's collective memory with the power of over forty years' retelling, onto the main story line, is present. And in that vein the ending was of a kind that was was never so welcome as it was here, finally returning to and regrounding you in what a Star Wars movie should be all about in the first place (dare I say it: a prominent, upbeat and unambiguous tone of ""Hope""). <br/><br/>Thus, I rate this at 5/10 stars: not a compelling should-see (7/10) nor even a completely technically competent yet slow or dull effort (6/10), but simply an expensive, epic bad idea."

","For younger viewers Rogue One was probably just wonderful, especially if they have not seen episodes 4-6. I was a boy when the franchise began and its now utterly disappointing. The effects were always and still are unbelievable. Not so much now, but 40 years ago they were jaw dropping compared to anything we had seen. However, what made Star Wars was the story and characters. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher were visually appealing, but they were generally pretty good actors with loads of chemistry. And you got to know them because they were around for subsequent episodes. Throw in Alex Guinness, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader...what memorable and entertaining characters. There was adventure, romance, humor and the story line was night and day compared to later episodes. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna cannot carry this movie. And who comes up with these dry-as-a-bone side kicks like K-2SO? Watching Rogue my son (14 years) and myself fell asleep. Yes, its that boring and lifeless. I'll pay a couple bucks to rent the movie, but seeing it at a theater and paying ridiculous sums of money is out of the question. <br/><br/>How to fix? Get a better script with some humor and a little sexual tension, actors and side kicks with actual chemistry and presence, and keep them around for awhile. Bring back the Star Wars we all loved and now miss."

","Personally, Rogue One falls second to The Empire Strikes Back in my list of the best Star Wars films. This film was meant for the fans, but after watching it again, I feel anyone can enjoy the story without having seen a SW film. The various nods to both the original and prequel trilogies will make any fan jump with joy, but they're not crucial to the plot; so, again, as a standalone film, the average movie-goer will not be lost. <br/><br/>The first half contains a great deal of exposition; with so many diverse characters to introduce, the film can't help but quickly and plainly explain what it needs to. The pace is rushed here and there and some issues solved effortlessly, but the story picks up as it goes. The third act is simply incredible. The love for the franchise becomes crystal-clear here. You can feel the film's eagerness to reach this point in the story and have fun, offering satisfying character/ story arcs. The action scenes, especially the space battles, are wonderfully shot, providing striking cinematography not seen (or fully enjoyed) in other SW films. <br/><br/>I cannot praise the film's use of practical effects enough, and Rogue One ties-in flawlessly with A New Hope. It's a great time to be a Star Wars fan."

No new ideas, pale acting, soapy, thin to no story, just a big disappointment. This movie is basically with exactly the same story which is in all Star War franchise movies so far! Grow up. I know there is kids who would like it but even they will say this is nothing new. Granted, this genre is Space Opera (which has 1% SciFi in it) but with all that money they've spent on making Rogue One - I am SURE 100% that Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, etc.) would make a much better film. Finally - I just cannot believe there is not a bit of creativity in making this movie - scenery is the same, narrative is the same, duplicates of the similar characters are everywhere, sentiment is weak, and technological background is stuck in 70s. For God's sake can we have some breakout from this overflow of cliché wanna-be SciFi movies in Hollywood? Someone? One, lone-gunman, shining example in comparison to slew of stuff like Rogue One is Passengers. Trust me, I know tastes are different for movies and all - but Rogue One has no ""taste"" at all."

","The star wars franchise is becoming a joke and this film does it no favor's. I like an underdog story, don't get me wrong, but this film takes it to a whole new level!!, you would think the rebels wouldn't be scared of the empire due to the fact that every foot soldier they have seems to be able to shoot the wings off a fly! and dodge or miss every incoming shot It must be the force protecting/guiding every one of them (wtf). All I saw in this film was storm troopers dying and very few rebels doing the same. I thought that at- at's shields were so strong that very few weapons could penetrate their shields? Not in this film though seems that a lot if not every weapon can take down one of these beasts no problem. Also star destroyers getting completely immobilized by a few ion torpedoes is ludicrous it amazes me that every time the empire gets completely annihilated no matter their advanced weapons and overwhelming numbers they still get beat. I would like for once the empire to win and maybe kill some main characters before they carry out their plan to destroy them. The end scene in this film with Darth Vader is the only reason I'm giving it 4* even though there was no reason for him to be in the film except to get kids to go and see it."

The rebels had more consistent uniforms for freaks sake.<br/><br/>The quasi force user was hugely annoying. Either make him a legit force user, or drop it.<br/><br/>Creation of new rebel fighter never seen again even though it would have been quite useful during ground assaults in original trilogy. Imperial shuttles are apparently all a special different snowflake, that suddenly becomes uniform when you get back to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Shields make no sense, if you can shield a planet from the planet, why the heck cant you shield the death-star from the death-star? Also, in the movie the ""gate"" blocked the shield by dropping blocks that blocked it therefor creating the opening. Can someone explain to me how destroying the gate somehow creates an opening?<br/><br/>Everyone dies, the only good part. I lied, the death star firing at lowered power is also pretty much the bomb.<br/><br/>Lighting round: AT-AT's appear out of nowhere, how many ground troops fit in this one shuttle, the rebels can run faster (while staying unseen) then a transportation system can get the main characters to the place, crystal sub plot that is quite literally a waste of time, dumb power struggle between uncanny valley and generic boss villain, do they follow any rules with the colored squares that obviously denote rank, What's with the super AI bot you never see in any other movie?<br/><br/>It's a pile of steaming bantha excrement, but it's warm, and you get to watch the death-star be awesome."

The main star is miserably unconvincing and not even good looking. The first hour is a bunch of meaningless dribble and no excitement whatsoever. I'm all for backstory and character development, but I had to shift around in my seat to stay awake. It lacked the magic that Star Wars used to have when George Lucas was making the films (the 1st 3 releases; before the singing teddy bears and the politically correct nonsense). The main character does not possess start potential and the rest of the cast just didn't carry the movie. This is supposed to be the future, but they were retrieving data with clumsy mechanical arms.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","19","38","14 August 2017"," A film worth rebelling against
","""Rogue One"" is an American science fiction film from 2016 and actually the highest grossing film of the entire year. The reason is obviously the film's close connection to Star Wars and as the series got new life breathed into it back in 2015 and we get the next film in 2017, this one here was a bit of a filler movie that made sure fans don't have to wait for the next blockbuster for two years. What a long time! And eventually the film was nothing but forgettable filler material. And at easily 2 hours, it really dragged on many occasions. The director here is Gareth Edwards and I am not familiar with the name or works at all I think. The writers are really many and I won't list the names, but it turned out to be an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The film can easily be structured into two halves with the first ending with Mikkelsen's character's death. The first half is certainly superior to the second and because of the latter you could maybe also add war here as a genre. There with Mikkelsen I already mentioned an actor who is one of Europe's very best these days for sure and in my opinion, except the opening scene, he was completely wasted. Same can be said about Forest Whitaker, another very talented guy and the only Oscar winner in the cast here I think. I also think that Smits, Ahmed and Mendelsohn have more range than they were allowed to put on display here.<br/><br/>And then we have lead actress Felicity Jones and there is no denying that she is really talented, recently got her first Oscar nomination too. But these kind of movies may not be her thing, maybe she is actually too talented to lead a film like this. She may not have huge star potential, even if she is stunning and that's certainly why people in 10-15 years will talk about Ridley, but not about Jones I am afraid. Her male co-lead Diego Luna may be another actor from this category. Talent yes, star potential not really. There is just no denying that this film is about nothing but the technical aspects, most of all the visual effects of course and the latter is also one of two categories where this film, mostly thanks to its box office success, managed Academy Award nominations. But in my opinion, this is a contender for weakest Academy Award nominee released in 2016, even if the work in the respective fields may be impressive. I can't deny that. But story is just so much more important to me. So yeah as you see, I had quite a few problems with this one. I think that frequently memorable villains/antagonists are more important than memorable heroes really, but the bad guys here are just as forgettable. One of the not too many positive aspects from the film is the ending, which probably let many also forget about the tons of mediocrity in the previous hour. Overall, I cannot share the praise critics and audiences had for this one.<br/><br/>I may be a bit biased as sci-fi has always been among my least favorite genres, but I also liked the Star Wars film from the year before a lot more than this one here. By the way, the occasional Star Wars reference here in terms of character inclusions (like Leia in the very last scene) could not save this style-over-substance film either. And it is also not very original anymore to have a robot creature be the only source of comedy here, not even for the franchise. My idea here would have been extend the first 75 minutes story-wise to 100 and include the crucial parts of the rebellious attacks and make this a more focused film. That way I may have liked it more. It's a thumbs-down. Not recommended and it is a good thing that many aspects here (gonna avoid spoilers) indicate that there will be no Rogue 2. I just hope they come up with something better if they need to fill another year before Episode 9."
"knielsen-57930","3","19","38","29 December 2016"," More ""war"" than ""star"".
","Nope. Not actually bad, just not very interesting at all. Mostly war and gun-fighting, explosions and dead soldiers. No adventure, no elegance. No interesting villain, and the main characters are rather flat too. Some kind of unnecessary (almost unmotivated) and sugary romance side-story. <br/><br/>A few positive details though: some cool geography, one somewhat witty droid, a bit of healthy de-romanticising that Rebel thing. And one of the more annoying details about the DeathStar is explained - I've always thought it silly to build that kind of weapon with that kind of vulnerable spot, you know which one... On the other hand, it is typically Evil Side to leave a few openings for the Good Side, isn't it? <br/><br/>They could ""easily"" have done it more to my taste: more MissionImpossible-style to the procurement of blueprints, and maybe some looks into the actual building of the Death Star."
"terhitapiainen","3","19","38","26 December 2016"," Never tell me the odds
","This review contains indirect spoilers. I felt empty and old after seeing this movie. It made me miss my childhood and the days when ""Never tell me the odds"" was a fantastic and funny line because we all knew that Han Solo is our loved one and you do not kill your loved ones in Star Wars movies which are essentially old school adventure films in space. In old adventures movies, the old men could die, as they chose to sacrifice themselves for greater good. In real wars, young boys and girls are sent to death, but not in adventure movies, not in Star Wars. Rogue One is a huge violation against the genre of Star Wars. It is a dull, boring, poorly written, not funny, cruel, cynical, calculated movie. It lacks all hope which is ironic. Rogue One makes me even miss Jar Jars Binks; that awful creature really got me to feel something but Rogue One left me totally untouched except the final shot on the beach. I hope that I am just an old fool who does not understand modern cinema because I sincerely thought that the production team had really lost it. The magic had gone even though they were really trying their best. I liked Force Awakens, loved the original trilogy but Rogue One was a huge disappointment due to its cynical darkness."
"latinfineart","2","19","38","21 December 2016"," Trite, mind numbingly boring, and hard to sit through
","I have to start by admitting, I am not a star wars fan. I have only seen a few of them. Also, I have to admit I am not a comic book fan either. So, that makes it hard to sit through a movie like this. There were some decent characters. And some of the creatures or aliens were kind of cool. But, somehow with a film like this, you expect that. And more. It just did not deliver. It was boring, trite, ineffective, and somehow very, very unexciting. <br/><br/>Let's break it down: dull, repetitive, unsurprising, under-characterized. This tale, placed chronologically between episodes three and four, has no reason to exist. We know the rebels will get plans that let them destroy the Death Star. So, who cares how they did it, when the storytelling is so uninteresting and pathetically boring.<br/><br/>The series cannibalizes its own mythology. A child with incipient Jedi powers (Felicity Jones) loses her parents and gets raised by a surrogate the Empire brands for death. She teams up with a freewheeling fighter pilot (Diego Luna) and a comical droid with an English voice (Alan Tudyk) to go against the Empire; she's advised by an older Jedi with amazing gifts (Donnie Yen); she learns her father (Mads Mikkelsen) is highly placed in the Empire himself. The main twist is that he built the Death Star against his will and installed a flaw that will blow it up, if his daughter finds the designs after his death. So, I guess he is not so bad after all. Redemption. Oh my. <br/><br/>It's as if the whole cast had been culled from understudies. Jones, so good in dramatic roles, looks like a last-minute substitute for Daisy Ridley. Luna's a lightweight Oscar Isaac. Mikkelsen scarcely works up a passion, yet he is such a terrific actor, in films like the Salvation, The legend of Michael Koolhaus, and many others. Yen, star of the ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Ip Man"" series, pulls off deft martial arts moves but lacks Alec Guinness' charisma. The main villain (Ben Mendelsohn) remains whiny and ineffectual, and other than the diabolical acts he commits, he just does not have much oomph. And as far as Darth Vader goes, he just need to be retired, once and for all. How long can the darkness last?"

","I would have given this 8.5, but they won't let you do that, so I gave it a 9. Why not?<br/><br/>I was very pleased with Rogue One, especially after walking out of the theater feeling a little disappointed last year. If nothing else, Rogue One tries some new things, which The Force Awakens didn't do much of at all. It also features an arguably better balance of old and new characters, and one of the best scenes in Star Wars history near the end. The special effects (both CGI and practical) are also amazing, some of the best I've ever seen in fact, and one particular aspect of them may change the way movies (especially sequels/prequels) are made FOREVER. I'll be shocked if Rogue One doesn't win Best Visual Effects at the Oscars this year, because it totally deserves it, even though Doctor Strange is a worthy contender. <br/><br/>As for negatives, there aren't many. Some may argue that the new characters are largely flat, but I would point out that this is a standalone story, not part of the main series. These characters will not be featured in any other movies in the foreseeable future, so not focusing on them as much left some time for the old characters, as well as what we all came for, the epic battle scenes, which are much better than those in TFA. And I actually grew to like several of the new characters more than I thought I would. The first act is a bit hectic, jumping around all over the place very quickly. There are also a couple scenes that are quite strange, even for Star Wars standards, but these are all fairly minor complaints. <br/><br/>Rogue One is a new hope for Star Wars fans that were disappointed with The Force Awakens. It's definitely not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than it had any right to be, especially considering that any fan of Star Wars knows exactly what's going to happen. It stays grounded in what we know and love while branching into just enough new territory simultaneously. I will eagerly be awaiting the next Star Wars story!"

","I don't know what others have to say about Rogue One, but this is what I have to say. I am in the multiplex, Rogue One is showing, and I am writing this review. This is what the film is doing to me. It cannot even hold my attention.<br/><br/>Maybe I am not cut for sci-fi. But James Cameron's Avatar, too, was sci-fi. It had me engaged. And I watch Avatar again and again on DVD. Why isn't Rogue One holding my attention? In January 2016, I saw another Star Wars film. I don't even remember its name. It is understood that Star Wars, despite the Lucas name attached to it, doesn't really appeal to me.<br/><br/>Rogue One seems to me like a politically correct film aimed to please everyone in this galaxy. The female lead is played by a British. The male lead by a Mexican. There is an African-American actor, a British-Pakistani actor, and two Chinese actors. The father of the female lead is played by a Swedish actor. I could see some characters wearing a garment that resembled the burqa. Then there is a reprogrammed droid with a sense of humour and huge machine quadrupeds.<br/><br/>There is the done to death father-daughter angle. And dialogues that try to be inspiring but sound straight out of a self-help book. The special effects and the 3D effects are well done, but they are nothing that we haven't seen before. And the names of the planets in the galaxy - Jedha is the only one I can remember, though I am still watching the film - do not help either. Why couldn't they think of easier names for the planets? Something like Mars and Jupiter. And - honestly, I do not know how else to put this? - is there even a story in Rogue One? I am sorry, just a big name and big franchise alone do not make an engaging film. Rogue One is strictly for the fans of Star Wars."
"zimmerblake","5","12","22","25 June 2017"," Easily the worst film of the Star Wars franchise.
","So the prequels are starting to look pretty amazing compared to the two most recent ""Star Wars"" films. The Force Awakens was a terrible remake that wasn't even supposed to be a remake and this film is some sort of off-shoot that was just terribly done from start to finish. Let's start with the casting. The Jyn Erso girl was annoying and had nothing redeeming or interesting about her. Not sure if that one is on the writing or acting but the character is very bland. Forest Whitaker tried way to hard with his character and he ended up just sounding like someone doing a bad impression of Bane from Batman. Diego Luna was out of place the entire movie. I think he thought he was on set of Zorro instead of a Star Wars film. The CGI characters were disgusting. I've never seen such terrible work in a big-budget film. Tarkin looked like a guy from a PS2 game and Leia looked like a light bulb. If they so badly wanted those characters in this movie, they should have just cast some look-alikes and that would've looked much better and not taken away so much from the film. You couldn't pay attention to the movie when either Tarkin or Leia was on screen because they were so distracting with their awkward CGI. I do not understand how when screening the film before release someone didn't tell the director/producers that Tarkin and Leia were laughable and they look awful. The script was clumsy and cluttered, and the names of things were even worse. Bor Gullet? Seriously? At least Lucas came up with legitimate sounding names and didn't just use words from a human anatomy book. K2-SO was alright but his attempt to be different from past droids was all too obvious. Yes, this wasn't supposed to feel like a part of the seven episodes and was supposed to be darker, but it achieved those in a very bad way that just made for a bad movie. Nice idea, but terribly executed."

","Wow, just wow. As a huge fan of Star Wars, I was not expecting this movie to be good....at all. To be fair, I didn't read reviews or do any extensive research. All I knew was that it was a new director, not John Williams, and a Star Wars movie not on the main path of episodes. <br/><br/>And after watching ""The Force Awakens"" I felt like I, and other fans had been robbed and that Disney was just trying to cash in on the franchise with the return of the ever so many characters from the original trilogy, the way too many clichÃ©s, the humor that got really corny and annoying fast...etc. <br/><br/>So with J. J. Abrams not being the director, who I thought would have done an amazing job with the reboot, I really wasn't excited about this movie.<br/><br/>Anyways here are my opinions on ""Rogue One""<br/><br/>THE GREAT:<br/><br/>VISUALS: Holy cow. I felt like I was in a ""real"" Star Wars Universe for once (setting aside episodes 4-6). It was dirty, realistic, chaotic...anything you SHOULD expect from a movie based on war, destruction, secrecy...etc.<br/><br/>COSTUMES: Okay, so this is where Rogue One is the star among the recent additions to our Star Wars adventures. The dirt, the grit, the EVERYTHING. This is how it should be (in my opinion) if you're actually fighting a WAR. All of the ridiculous costume design...especially in the ""Phantom Menace"" and the pristine look of the storm trooper armor from ""The Force Awakens"" makes absolutely no sense; Constant war should show some kind of visible...signs....ugh, does it need to be said, seriously. THANK YOU ""Rogue One""<br/><br/>SCORE: Okay so Michael Giacchino had a huge task set for him. I mean, how do you follow up and add to the already beautiful scores set up by John Williams. Well, he does. It's a perfect blend of the nostalgic music we all know and his flare he adds. And by the way, this is coming from a professional violinist who went through music school. Don't be thrown off by the beginning...I mean you will be, but looking back at it...that's his flare...It was definitely a curveball. But by the end, your ever loving Star Wars Themes will be there.<br/><br/>FIGHT SCENES: So this is where I went in skeptical. I was thinking, no lightsabers? Star Wars? Huh?? Yeah, well watching Master Martial Artist Donnie Yen destroy storm troopers with a...uh...space stick/crossbow made up for that. WITH REAL MARTIAL ARTS AND NO FLIPPING AROUND SPECIAL EFFECTS. And to be fair, that was just one of the amazing fighting aspects throughout the film. I loved seeing the Gold and Red squadrons also!<br/><br/>Oh and back to the lightsaber issue. Well there is a scene with one. And lets just say that in about 2-3 minutes you'll see the best lightsaber scene in any of the Star Wars Movies. It's dark, terrifying, cruel, not forgiving, and what we'd want the most powerful force bearer in Star Wars history to unleash. <br/><br/>ACTORS: To Summarize, K2 the Droid....best droid invented. Donnie Yen, such a fascinating character besides the epic fights. Ben Mendelssohn as Krennic; He always delivers. Jyn and Cassian; At first I thought...oh great...another romance with a happy ending...think again. They have great interactions between each other. <br/><br/>Okay so don't be hating on me, but Grand Moff Tarkin...well I saw it in 3D and coupled with the voice actor and superb CGI, I was actually confused the entire movie on how the guy was still alive and looking the same since the 1970s. (Yeah I Know)<br/><br/>THE DEATH STAR....nothing more needs to be said. <br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>Saw Gerrera: I don't know, he just felt awkward and really pointless to the story. He also had very few scenes. I thought he was going to have more based off of the trailer. I honestly didn't know who on earth the character was based off of...I had to look it up. I haven't seen all of the ""Clone Wars"" stuff so yeah...but still...I thought he was going to be a major role but...well nope.<br/><br/>A few scenes in the first 20 or so minutes were a little odd. It was a little confusing figuring out how Jyn fit into the plot for a bit in my opinion but it was soon cleared up.<br/><br/>Bohdi Rook: I don't know, to me he seemed like a mediocre character throughout the entirety of the movie.<br/><br/>MY OVERALL REVIEW SUMMARY:<br/><br/>My Favorite Star Wars Movie since ""The Empire"" Strikes Back""<br/><br/>GO SEE IT!<br/><br/>11/10"

I felt that there was no connection to the recent Star wars film made 'The Force Awakens' with the film Rogue One at all.

It's just all too much - visually stunning, but mostly unnecessary. Come to think of it, the first 30minutes as a whole are a little big higglty-pigglty jumping between here and there, character to character. It was really hard to focus on any character without that firm footing, and I felt like they missed an opportunity to help the audience connect with the characters.<br/><br/>I personally felt no connection to Jyn; I didn't understand what made her tick, her motives, or why she did what she did in some situations. If they meant for her to be a lovable rogue, I'd say they failed. She was more of an enigma. Even in the last few scenes I was trying to figure out why she was doing what she was doing. But OK, if we put that to one side and just take a 'hero' pill, you can mostly ignore the poor scripting and lack of character development and enjoy another dive into the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>The movie is very slow to get going, but as it went on, the better it got. The last 30-40 minutes were fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ending.<br/><br/>If you're a Star Wars fan, there are plenty of nods and 'in-jokes' which you'll enjoy, and the battle scenes are epic, but overall I was quite disappointed to be honest.<br/><br/>I mean, I guess it's entertaining?

It just looks amazing. They really did an amazing job catching the Star Wars feeling and spicing it up with modern technology. From the amazing designed city of Jedha, over the hands down best space fight scene in Star Wars to the freightning end scene and reconciliation to episode IV. Everything just feels so good to watch.<br/><br/>Sound 5/5
Just as the visual design the sound design is very good. The soundtrack written by Giacchino feels like Star Wars without copying the original. In cooperation with the overall awesome sound design it manages to create an intense atomsphere. I still hear this alarm from the Tantive IV when i think about the movie,<br/><br/>Story 4/5
I honestly dont know what bugs me about the story. Its very good for the cannon and explains a lot before episode IV. Its well written and narrated, its not boring or feels unnecessary and still there is something that does not feel right. Maybe its the rather teenie-like rebellish Jhin Erso at the beginning or the badly explained mindset of Cassan which often leads to weird changes of actions they make. Overall the story still is very good and adds a lot to the canon.<br/><br/>Cast 4/5
If you like to watch big hollywood stars on screen this movie is nothing for you. With Felicity Jones in the main role you dont get a big star but its still a really good perfomance, just like with the rest of the cast. They manage to show emotion and passion for the rebel movement. With K-2SO they added a droid supporting role which is worthy of his colleague R2-D2. Forest Whitacker and Mads Mikkelsen are by far the most famous of the cast. As long as you can live with a CGI Grand Moff Tarkin and young Leia or the fact that you will not see a Tarrantino like star ensemble you will have a great time with the acting in this movie.<br/><br/>Nostalgia 3/5
While its still a Star Wars movie and I absolutly had a great time watching it (a lot) I have to admit that it doesnt really tickle my nostalgia nerve. Maybe because im not the biggest fan of episode IV. So because of that some of my ratings might be off a bit due to nostalgia glasses but I think I managed to give you my honest opinion."

","In the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me as George Lucas' epic sci-fi saga, Star Wars. Much like many other kids of my generation, I grew up thinking, dreaming, watching and playing Star Wars. I watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much Star Wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. After Revenge of the Sith came out, it seems that Star Wars as a film series was over. That was until 2012 when George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to the Walt Disney Company for 4 billion dollars and the studio announced that they would be making more films set in the Star Wars universe. One of these films would focus on a group of Rebels stealing the plans to the Death Star. When I first heard about the film, I was quite gritty about it and when the first teaser trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story dropped in April of 2016, I was even more pumped to see it as it appeared that director Gareth Edwards would be taking a more serious approach to the series and give us something in the vein of Saving Private Ryan. Of course, when I did go see the film later that year, I was at first blown away by it but as I thought about it more and more, I began to love it less and upon rewatching it earlier this year in preparation for The Rise of Skywalker, my feelings on the film haven't really changed as while I find Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to be a highly enjoyable film thanks to its action scenes, acting and musical score, some elements of the film leave a lot to be desired in my eyes.<br/><br/>The film opens with Imperial scientist Galen Erso hiding with his wife and daughter on the planet Lah'mu where Imperial weapons maker Orson Krennic finds him and begs him to help finish building the Empire's new superweapon, the Darth Star. Galen's wife is killed in the stand-off but his daughter, Jyn, escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist Saw Gerrera. We then cut to a defective Imperial cargo pilot named Bodi who is captured by Sal's extremist group of rebels on the desert planet of Jedha while carrying a message for Saw. Meanwhile, rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star via another agent and rescues Jyn from an Imperial labor camp and brings her to the Rebel headquarters where Mon Mothma persuades Erso to aid in finding her father so that the Rebel Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Together with Andor and a reprogrammed Imperial droid named K-2SO, they head for Jedha. Now, the trio must find Galen, assemble a rag-tag team and steal the plans to the Death Star before it's too late.<br/><br/>What's interesting about Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is how the film feels split between two frontiers. On one hand, it's a spectacular war film in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down about a universe that is ensnared in disorder between a plucky rebel alliance and an evil imperial empire. Though the world of space fantasy, Rogue One is able to arouse the viewer with all sorts of fascinating ideas about the battle that is at the core of the Star Wars saga. What would a war in space look like in the 21st century? What is the viewpoint of this massive conflict from outside the cockpit of an X-Wing or the Millennium Falcon by those on the front lines or those people caught in the crossfire? These are just a few of the points that Rogue One focuses on as a war film that so happens to take place in the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Rogue One does in some ways feel like a bunch of deleted scenes that intend to link the prequel films with the original Star Wars trilogy. The essential idea of Rogue One results in the stealing of the plans for the Death Star that move the plot of A New Hope which in theory should be enough to connect Rogue One to its parent. But much like Solo: A Star War Story, Rogue One feels the need to pepper the screen with various cameos and callbacks to previous Star Wars films in order to pander to the hard-core Star Wars fans. Much like Solo: A Star Wars Story, some of the Easter eggs and callbacks work in the film's favor but others just feel tacked on and don't add anything to the story at hand. So, Rogue One feels imprisoned in-between being a thrilling look at a familiar film series with a new perspective while at the same time feeling a bit too much like Star Wars fan fiction. It's no shock that the war angle of the movie is far more interesting than the fan fiction angle.<br/><br/>The most compelling element of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the bold promise of the entire film. With it not being a main chapter in the Star Wars saga, there's a feeling that Rogue One is able to have a bit of fun with one of the most beloved movie franchises ever put to screen. It can acquire the current framework that the previous Star Wars films have built and undo or question what has already been established. Think of a spy film set within the Star Wars universe starring Jyn, Cassian, and K2 or a heist movie on a grand scale. Envision seeing the Star Wars saga without the Jedi and Sith playing a central part in the story. That is the kind of film Rogue One is.<br/><br/>Words can not explain how much Star Wars has become engrained into our culture since 1977 and the fact that most of us know the saga inside and out, even the most casual of moviegoers know of the iconic imagery and mythology that the saga has given us over the past 42 years. People who don't go to the movies that much sometimes hum the opening Star Wars theme like a Beatles song. Yoda and Darth Vader are the go-to for Star Wars imitations that are the easiest to read even if the impressions themselves may be awful. So the Star Wars saga is as much apart of our culture as Coca Cola and is something that lends itself to being tampered with. Unlike some people who think the saga should be preserved in glass and put on display, I have always felt that's room in the franchise for improvement and exploring new worlds and characters. Sure, the Star Wars films do invite moviegoers of all ages to admire and be wowed by pure wonder and ask questions but the true delight of watching the saga that George Lucas created is the ability with which a single line of dialog can lead to endless hours of discussion between moviegoers and fans alike. The universe of Star Wars is so vast and endless in scope and yet so flawlessly created. When watching a Star Wars film, it's always fun to picture yourself dancing below the raindrops of continuity or recalling images of a pop art depiction of 2001: A Space Odyssey to Star Wars.<br/><br/>Certainly, that was perhaps the best part of the controversial plan by Disney to scarp the Expanded Universe and start over and by doing so, had erased several decades of novels, comics and video games that were built around the films. Now, it must be stressed that what has been tossed out of the new Star Wars canon doesn't mean that the books about Thrawn or Prince Xizor should cease to exist simply because Disney doesn't consider those stories part of their Star Wars universe. The stories are still there and the fans who love those stories can still love them and even Lucasfilm has been using elements of the EU in the more recent comics and TV shows so it's not like the EU has been snapped out of existence. As for me, while I did read some EU stories when I was younger, I never cared for it nor do I care for the new Star Wars canon mostly because I see them both as simply filling in the gaps before, between and after the films. When writing fan-fiction, the urge is to focus on building a universe from the inside instead of the outside as there's always a passion to link every important event or character to a slice of the continuity pie. Taking out all of the material that isn't considered to be apart of the canon allows the creative team to put their own stamp on certain events.<br/><br/>There's a ton in Rogue One that works perfectly in that respect. There are quite a few points that Gareth Edwards seems content to set free of the assumptions of a big blockbuster film. Right when it starts, Rogue One gives us a multitude of considerable ritualistic shifts from various tropes found in the other Star Wars films. The opening score sounds much different than the John Williams fanfare that usually opens the other films and there's no title card or text scroll as well as on-screen captions that show the various planets rather than having them explained to us. These departures from what we're used to seeing in the other Star Wars films are small but still critical. Over the course of the first hour of the film, Edwards gives the viewer his own touch to the greater Star Wars universe. This is a film that is steadily rooted in the background characters with none of them being a chosen farm boy or princess but rather mere footnotes in the lager Star Wars universe. In this regard, Rogue One builds upon the storytelling choices that The Force Awakens had already established.<br/><br/>At its finest, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gives us a view of the Star Wars universe for the ground floor. The film includes all sorts of classic Star Wars icons but the scoop and scale are so much more massive than what we've seen before. These affairs and clashes seem to happen on multiple levels above the heads of our main characters. The Death Star and the threat it presents itself as are what drives the story with different forms and descriptions of the battle station have shown up in four of the seven Star Wars films, however, Rogue One still finds a way to make the superweapon look intimidating and epic at the same time. The film looks at the Death Star from the surface of Jedha. At one point in the film, the weapon appears over the surface of the planet like a moon while another time, the Death Star places itself as if it's eclipsing the sun. When it does fire its laser, the viewer doesn't see the destruction from the freezing vacuum of space but rather they see"

A very brave entry overall that surprised me.
Why? It's ominous and bleak, no 'cute and fun' characters (unless you count the robot drone, who grew on me fast and was a worthy addition), and most importantly, none of the main characters survive this suicide mission of a plot. All those people on the poster... they all die. No one's sugar coating anything here, there's no 'coming back from the dead' type tricks. Now that's space opera cinema I can get on board with."

","26 December 2016. Without giving too much away, consider the dilemma of trying to tie in a prequel to the original Star Wars movie, and you'll get some of the darkness that this movie might entail. Missing are all the epic, royal court melodrama and trappings of the Empire. The audience only gets flashes of what is about too come, almost not enough. The beginning is a hodgepodge of flittering scenes that almost require a voice-over to explain what is going on along with a loud musical score to retain audience interest in these initial less than spectacular scenes.<br/><br/>What this episode attempts to present is a substantive storyline about sacrifice, parent-child loyalty, betrayal, and most of all ""hope"". There is no Harrison Ford persona to capture theater replaced by an evolving one in the form of a young girl transforming into a young adult. Overall, this episode is more about terror and rebelling against it at small odds and a lot of shooting, explosions, and killing, and dying. The premise that the larger the better as is profoundly used in this movie, may not always be better than the quality of the story."

"domjwhite","7","2","2","15 April 2018"," A Decent Holdover For Those Who Waited For TLJ
","I saw The Force Awakens opening night. The moment the film started with the iconic Star Wars title crawl, the theater erupted in cheer and applause. Wide smiles were all around and everyone was finally about to see what happened to our favorite characters after a lackluster prequel series, and the original trilogy's last film having came out over 30 years prior. I was among the excited film-goers. As the as of yet untitled eighth film does not arrive until next year, Rogue One would have to tide us over in the meantime. So how does it fare?<br/><br/>It starts with a complete absence of a title crawl.<br/><br/>Now this might seem somewhat of a silly complaint, but hear me out. Not only is this the first Star Wars film to ditch the title crawl, but seeing it in The Force Awakens made me realize that we had something to look forward to. We would get a three decade long closure. Rogue One features a cast of characters the likes of which we have yet to see. As the film takes place after Revenge of the Sith but before A New Hope, nobody featured in Rogue One really matters aside from the fact to serve as a reminder that we are watching a spin-off. Does that really lead to something overly thrilling if it does not really add to the main film series? Something about the lack of a title crawl served as a harsh reminder that unlike The Force Awakens, I didn't feel I was looking forward to much. But onto the rest of the film.<br/><br/>After the aforementioned odd absence of a title crawl, I found myself, unfortunately, incredibly bored during the first half of the film. I found myself not connecting with the characters, not caring about the mission the characters were undergoing (which takes a long time to really get going), and overall just sort of ""meh"". Many of the characters are not very developed and generally the script seemed ""okay"" at best. Aside from a few notable parts of the Star Wars score appearing throughout, John Williams was also replaced as the films composer as well, with the new composer unfortunately not bringing in the same ""oomph"" as Williams. Overall It wasn't particularly bad in the sense of ""this film is total rubbish"", but rather that the film was just sort of there, not really serving a purpose.<br/><br/>However, there comes a lovely silver lining to all that I had wrong with Rogue One in the end. And that is that luckily, the second half is much better than the slow first half, with the last quarter of the film being worth the cost of admission on it's own. The finale was a highly enjoyable powerhouse and I found that all my previous complaints began to drift away. Slowly, I came to appreciate Rogue One more and more. Among some of the films higher points include: The beautiful scenery and sets. The Force Awakens pulled this off as well, and for a spin-off, I was glad to see Rogue One was able to look as good as it did. Some characters of the previous films also return for varying levels of importance as well, which was a welcome surprise, as well as tons of cameos of other known characters throughout the series got a few smiles in as well.<br/><br/>Overall, what started as a dull and worrisome entry of the franchise (in my non-professional opinion), turned out to be decent hold-over for the upcoming episode eight. Just make it through the first half, and you will probably come to find that in the end, Rogue One is a fairly welcome entry to the franchise.<br/><br/>(THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BACK WHEN THE MOVIE WAS FIRST IN THEATERS)"
"proud_luddite","5","2","2","20 March 2018"," The Least Appealing of the Star Wars Movies
","In the Star Wars anthology series, taking place just before the very first film in 1977 (which was fourth in the actual series): Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is on a mission to disable a planet-destroying device (the Death Star) that is owned by the Galactic Empire - a device that her father was forced to create.<br/><br/>As could be expected, the set design and special effects are breathtaking. But in fairness, without such technical superiority, the film would be bland. The story and characters are not captivating enough and occasionally, there is too much happening for the average viewer (as opposed to a sci-fi-geek) to follow without getting confused and even bored at times.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in which front-line soldiers for the ""bad guys"" are killed off in droves with an attitude that is meant to be comical. This is an old gag that cheapens life for those that are considered to be 'nobodys'. The filmmakers could do better than this in their action scenes instead of regurgitating old crowd-pleasing techniques that have worked in the past but are now outdated.<br/><br/>While there were fine scenes and excitement in the beginning, these virtues were not maintained throughout the remainder of the film. There is also a very questionable use of CGI to recreate actors as they looked a long time ago (but not in a galaxy far far away). While the technology is brilliant, such usage is more than questionable.<br/><br/>I made the mistake of thinking that this film was the follow-up to last year's entertaining ""The Force Awakens"". It didn't follow that film in either sequence or in quality."
"alyssaeaton-48391","4","2","2","27 January 2018"," Not Impressed
","Going into the movie I wasn't expecting much, I didn't think I would like it much or care for it as it was the first Star Wars movie I've seen. Overall I felt the movie lacked detail, in the character development that was imperative for the audience to build the connections and be invested in the characters well beings. Jyn has a little amount of backstory shown in the opening of the movie that bring some detail into who she is as a person as we see her mother getting killed and her father being captured. Later we see her crying at the hologram her father sent, and even later you get to see her being with him as he dies. These should have been emotional and moving scenes but the actress didn't portray the part and emotions well enough which resulted in me not caring much for her character. She was a very flat character, we didn't get insight into her thoughts or how she was feeling. Without these insights the film lacks the scenes that are crucial in getting the audience to invest in the characters. The movie displays an abundance of Implicit content as shown with the relationship between Cassian and Jyn. They seem to have some sort of connection as they share long looks and close embraces. Cassian disobeys orders for her and helps her start a rebellion of their own. It's seemingly obvious they have something going on, but the lack of it being stated in the movie is another reason for the flat characters. If they had built their relationship up it would have given their characters some depth and helped involve the audience emotionally. There were also many inconsistencies in the character's actions that led the me to question their integrity and the believability of the characters. Such as Saw being described as a ""extremist"" then when he was shown in a questionable situation where the city is blown up he quickly gives up, no longer fighting for his cause or his life. Secondly when Cassian is given the opportunity to kill Galen, he disobeys orders and doesn't follow through. Though as he later describes, he dedicated his life to the cause since the age of 6, and earlier in the movie he showed no problem in killing people. It shows the lack of depth in the characters that creates questionability in their true self and credibility. Overall I felt the movie lacked depth in the character development which was a major flaw in the movie. They didn't allow the audience to build the emotional connections to the crew that was vital in getting people interested in the movie. Due to this lack of character development, I wasn't phased when the whole cast was wiped out in the end by the death star. It just made the movie more boring as they weren't people I cared about or felt a connection to. In conclusion it wasn't a movie I was impressed in or would watch again."
"rkoch1","2","11","20","6 June 2017"," Sucked. Irrelevant stories and characters. Only one good scene.
","The only scene worth watching was with the Chinese guy who uses his sword for like 30 seconds. Other than that, the entire movie was a re-hash of what people perceive to be classic ""Star Wars"" themes (bars with aliens and strange music, storm troopers who can't do anything right, villains who are inherently evil for no apparent reason). <br/><br/>Movie was also a shameful attempt for Disney to turn this into a political campaign, seemingly vindicating the war with insurgents in Iraq, in my opinion. This will do nothing but promote more people to become radical religious idiots, fighting against the ""american superpower"" which they correlate with the Federation. Technically, for that to actually happen you need a good movie which can inspire someone and we don't really have that here, so maybe we have nothing to worry about after all. <br/><br/>Still a shite movie and disgrace to the Star Wars saga."
"Mind-Boggling","3","11","20","7 May 2017"," Star Wars A snoozefest story
","Wow this is a really dull movie, I could hardly stay awake. Edwards continues his trend of making movies that put intelligent people to sleep and entertain the simple minded masses. Three thirds of this movie don't even feel like Star Wars, could be any other sci if film. There are no jedis, no lightsabers and no space battles. Although darthvader does show up for a couple of minutes, he breaths some life into this hollow husk of a film but not enough to save the viewer from boredom. There are a lot of newly introduced characters in this movie, and they are all uninteresting and one dimensional. The actors do an okay job but it seems like they are phoning in there performance, especially the lead actress she seems very unemotional and boring. she's probably the least likable. It seems a lot like Edwards is purposely directing his actors to show as little emotion and interest in the events that are transpiring in front of them as possible. Rogue one is a weird movie in a sense; it's to fast paced at times and also to slow sometimes. Generally it's a very slow paced movie but when they're are dramatic or emotional moments that require a slower pace for them to work properly and sink in. The movie just blazes past them at a lighting pace, not allowing the audience to digest whats happening. It ends up making the more dramatic moments feel superficial and rushed. The last fourth of this movie is were it goes full Star Wars with a big space battle accompanied by a land battle going on simultaneously. This part of the movie is admittedly a little fun, but it's to late, to little to compensate for the rest. which is dull, drab, vanilla and down right boring! I really don't understand how people find this fun. My father watched this movie, and he normally loves sci fi regardless of the quality;and even he thought this was boring. It seems to me like Disney is just trying to milk the series for all it's worth, they don't care about anything else. Rogue One is defiantly the most overrated movie of 2016; it's sad that people have such low standards."

Without getting into spoilers, there were so many parts of this movie that just did not make any sense. <br/><br/>Jyn's attempt at a rousing speech was stilted and weird. She was an incredibly flat character. On that note, none of the characters were interesting or memorable. I don't even remember any of the other characters besides the robot...and you know your characters are bad when a robot is the most memorable one. <br/><br/>Grand Moff Tarkin as a CGI character was a bad move. Any time he talked I couldn't get over how fake he looked, which was very distracting and it was hard to concentrate on what he was saying. The same could be said for another prominent character who was brought back with CGI.<br/><br/>A lot of the attempts at instilling hope were just kind of cheesy and unconvincing. Contrary to what you see in this review, I am not at all a cynical person. I'm not typically the type of guy who tries to pick apart movies, either.

","I grew up a big star wars fan. I may not have gone geek over it like some do, but I have been a fan of star wars all the same from the time the very first one came out back in the 70's. 2 weekends ago we had the torrential rains and flooding here in southern Missouri, so the kids going outside to play wasn't gonna happen, on top of that, both kids and my wife were all fighting the crud that was going around at the time, so going to church on Sunday wasn't gonna happen either. Therefore we decided to go to the video store, and rent about a dozen movies, and this was one of them. I was kinda looking forward to seeing how this movie would turn out, but after watching it, I kinda wish we didn't rent it. This was nothing more than a plot hole filler, and was really just to push the story line forward between the last prequel and the start of the original movie. The dialog and special effects were lackluster and boring. A couple times during the movie I felt myself trying to nod off from sheer boredom. I really think when they finally make the last movie, that they need to just stop. They should have just stopped at return of the jedi to be honest. Was not impressed with this movie at all, so rent at your own risk.

","Okay its not the worst film ever made but it's definitely not good. Film movies at a snail's pace, is overall terribly boring, the acting was pretty bad if not just awkwardly shameful, literally zero likable or memorable characters, but hey- of course it had some good effects! After all, an enormous budget and forcing this film into everyone's throats guarantees the return in investment so they can continue to churn out garbage like this for eons to come! I'll say the Darth Vader scene gave me goosebumps for sure, they won my old man's mind on that regard, but that's really the only good moment in the film and many of my friends agreed, and they grew up idolizing star wars like I did. And back to the acting, I get it that sci-fi films don't usually have any good acting, but you'd think with the money they're putting into these films and getting back from them, they'd hire some people who can actually act a little bit? Come on."

"BadAids","5","13","25","22 December 2016"," The Force Takes a Nap
","In a year where Hollywood has failed to deliver, the stage was set for Rogue One to steal the show, unfortunately that was not the case. Instead, Gareth Edwards gave us a Star Wars rendition that, while looking absolutely stunning, lacks any character and depth. Despite on the service being a movie that is, arguably, visually superior to The Force Awakens, Rogue One offers little more than fan-service and leaves no lasting effects for audience members that have yet to be indoctrinated into this Lucas/Disney cult. What went wrong? One of the most significant flaws of Rogue One is its protagonist, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). Jones' performance is utterly bland, especially when compared to last years predecessor Daisy Ridley, and she serves as more of a reference point for the audience instead of the charismatic leader that this film needed. Very little motivation for Jones, as well as the rest of the clichéd ensemble, means that it becomes difficult for the audience to get invested in what was actually quite an enjoyable and action-packed final act. This is a problem that I believe persists throughout Gareth Edward's filmography, most notably Godzilla (2014). While all his films do look visually stunning, he has yet to master the art of character development and when considering Rogue One's quite standard heist plot, the lack of engaging characters does mean that the film suffers heavily. Although I enjoy Episodes 4-7, I am far from a Star Wars buff but I can appreciate the level of fan service that Rogue One contains and I can understand why fanatics seem to enjoy this film. However, the persisting thought I have about this film is; why was this made? Of course it whets the appetites of those eager for Episode 8 but Rogue One leaves no enduring moments for the Star Wars universe and with the rich history and depth of the Star Wars canon, it is a shame that this films biggest achievement is being better than the prequels. As it turns out, that's not a very difficult task."

"cdjh-81125","6","18","37","15 December 2016"," Fun At Times But Flawed and Unnecessary
","I was really excited for Rogue One, I was fully aware that this movie was not necessarily needed but I wasn't to concerned about that as long as it was entertaining and had good characters and only to a certain extent did they succeed. This is not a bad film but it's just not all that great and will not stand as one of the better Star Wars films. But there was plenty of good in this film for one it looks incredible, Gareth Edward did a fantastic job at blending special effects with real life and was seamless, he is also a master at showing scale and making his films seem gritty and real. This is a war film and it made the world seem more grounded in reality. The performances were pretty good, Felecity Jones was really good and had a nice arc to her, Diego Luna was also really good and was an entertaining character, I haven't seen much of Donnie Yen but he really impressed me in this film and his character was a nice way of showing how the fall of the Jedi effected more than just the Jedi themselves. But easily this films greatest performance was Mads Mikkelson, he's one of my favourite actors and he was just perfect in this film as a father and as a man faced with an impossible situation. The last act of this film is easily its best it's directed amazingly you are invested in the plan and is easily the best thing about this film. But for every positive in this film there is a negative and this film has plenty. For one the character for the most part remained undeveloped, other than Jyn Erso not enough backstory and motivations are provided. I love Forrest Whitaker but he was so bad in this movie, his voice and mannerisms were completely over the top and was not a necessary character. Like I said I loved the last act of this movie but the first two were dull, slow and uninteresting for the most part. Obviously one of the things people are most looking forward to in this film is Darth Vader and he is a fantastic presence when he was in the film and I truly think that he could have been used more as the scenes he was in he added nothing to the plot other than fan service. Star Wars has a bit of a tradition of adding comic relief through droids and this film follows that tend but fails at it, K2SO was funny at first but after a while became really annoying and his humour was really forced.<br/><br/>I loved The Force Awakens and I was hoping that this film would tide me over until Episode 8 next year but it really hasn't, its an entertaining enough movie but far from one I'm going to be dying to watch again soon, if your a Star Wars fan you can at least appreciate it but it fails to live up to other entries in the franchise and doesn't give me a lot of hope for future anthology films. <br/><br/>66%/B-"
"jjprofetto","8","18","37","14 December 2016"," The war-torn approach to a Star Wars saga that otherwise indulged in fluff around mature subjects, like death, was welcomed.
","When audiences were given a first glimpse into the side story of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, it felt  different. This isn't a film that demands lightsabers every 10 or 15 minutes. This isn't what you'd expect from a traditional Star Wars film. This is gritty, dark and war-torn for Star Wars standards.<br/><br/>And it worked.<br/><br/>Rogue One opens without a crawl. ""In a galaxy far, far away "" That's it. It hops right into a sweeping aerial shot revealing an Imperial transport ship arriving to a planet with wide oceans and an endless backdrop of mountains. Director Gareth Edwards wasted no time beginning his story.<br/><br/>The Erso family is shown panicking in their home once learning of Imperial head honcho Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn), who oversees the Death Star project. Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is an Imperial engineer who laid out the design of the Death Star, however there's more to him than meets the eye. Galen's daughter, Jyn (Felicity Jones), is told to follow the escape procedure, which was practiced in the case of Krennic's eventual arrival. Throughout the tense encounter between Krennic and Galen, the darker, more mature tone begins. There's a sense of defeat in Galen's eyes during the interaction, and a sinister look in Krennic's.<br/><br/>Galen's wife, Lyra (Valene Kane), decided to shoot Krennic, barely grazing his left shoulder and, in turn, gets shot. She dies, the score begins to crescendo and we see young Jyn running to the cave and hiding inside of a faux rock structure. After the action cooled down and Krennic presumably vacated the planet, ex-Rebel turned extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) gives Jyn a blaster and wishes her luck.<br/><br/>To digress for a bit, the mention of Whitaker in that line is almost indicative of his screen time, which is not a large amount. Gerrera's character required lots of gruff, and I felt Whitaker gave it justice, but nothing about his character felt necessary in the second half of the film. He served his time well-enough on the Silver Screen.<br/><br/>Years later, Jyn is all grown up and we see her imprisoned. This is how we meet our first of six uncanny heroes.<br/><br/>Rogue One does plenty of planet-hopping, each with the purpose to introduce the audience to the newest characters to the Star Wars universe. When we meet Rebel fighter Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), he's walking with haste within Jedha City, where some of the diverse Star Wars universe is displayed through its people and settings. Andor is a tricks-of-all trades kind of guy. He can pilot a ship, fight and talk his way out of a situation. Andor gained information about defected Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook. Rook was given instruction by Galen to spill the beans about the engineer's whereabouts. After getting the information about the Death Star, Andor shoots and kills the panicky messenger who delivered the message about Rook.<br/><br/>Rogue One isn't a perfect film, however. Writers Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy struggled to pen good dialogue between the cast, and there were times the conversations felt heavy-handed with either clichés or poor monologues. ""The Force is in me "" is the beginning of a sort-of mantra for Chirrut, but it didn't click. It felt like a cliché that, along with the other clichés, distracted a bit from the storyline.<br/><br/>The lacking dialogue made the nod at a romance between Jyn and Diego hard to believe, as well. There's one moment before the big finale that Jyn looks up and down at Diego in a way that subtly suggested an attraction. Now, both characters are bred to be rebels (no pun intended) and are jaded to most emotion. I can understand them developing a romance down the road, but it felt rushed and used as a desperate plea to fill just one more cliché.<br/><br/>However, when the writing is good, it engulfs the viewer in this world that feels unique and unlike anything fans have witnessed. There are moments when K-2 breaks the tension with well-placed comic relief and other times when heroism is felt through war (Jyn rescuing a child crying out for her mother between gunfire). During one scene at Yavin-4, the Rebel headquarters, Jyn eventually fails to convince the counsel that it's wise to follow her father's instructions in destroying the Death Star. This built Jyn's character towards her eventual status of a leader among the Rebels. The Imperial generals and their evil nature was fun to see unfold in times of dominance and despair.<br/><br/>The cinematography was the most on-the-nose difference from the previous Star Wars films. Edwards is no stranger to shooting in low lighting with neutral colors (Godzilla), so it was nice to see the film open with a bleak tone that the rest of Rogue One retained. Well, most of the film. The second half became a bit lighter and not only because some takes place on the beach. This is attributed to some of the cheese felt through the clichés, as I mentioned before. It took a dark tone and tried to add a Hollywood spin towards the final 15 minutes. If the entirety of Rogue One was a product of its final act, I'd imagine my feelings for it wouldn't be as positive.<br/><br/>Rogue One was different and dark enough to make me satisfied as the end credits ran. The war-torn approach to a Star Wars saga that otherwise indulged in fluff around mature subjects, like death, was welcomed. Also, kudos to whoever worked on the CGI faces for General Moff Tarkin and  well, you'll see who the big reveal is at the conclusion of the film."

"saba-ojkawa","3","9","16","7 January 2017"," Proof that stories do no need to make sense to generate profit
","In the context of a Star Wars universe, the story sequencing of Rogue One is blotchy, vague and un-compelling. The film made a poor attempt at creating a clear, linear storyline. Outside the context of a Star Wars universe, the story made no sense, and so the viewers are left to their own devices to try and keep up with the unexpected scene jumps. Characters give you no reason to empathize with their objective to oppose the empire. Rather than going on a journey with the protagonist, we become unbiased observers witnessing a war of which we have no emotional investment in. <br/><br/>The originals were brilliant because the characters all had human elements and everyone from Han to the monster in the trash compactor was memorable. Darth Vader did not need to display excessive use of the Force to fear him, rather, he conveyed it by his actions. R2-D2 only needed to chirp and beep, yet he was a better-written character than ANY in Rogue One. In the originals, you could feel their joys, their losses, their victories and defeats; and discover the Force with Luke as he transformed from a boy to a man, fighting the empire along the way. Rogue One seems to miss the point.<br/><br/>Rogue One places you in scenes that serve no purpose and only generate more questions than answers. How did Saw Gerrera know to find Jyn after she hid in the bunker? How does Chirrut use the force if he is not a Jedi? If he can use it, does that not actually make him one? What is the backstory on his gun-wielding friend? Is Grand Moff Tarkin in charge of the Death Star or the man in white? Why is Vader on a lava planet? I could go on.<br/><br/>The Emperor is naked. Nobody wants to call out a pop culture relic. It's easy to go with the crowd, wear rose-colored glasses and not make a fuss. A movie is not intrinsically good because of the banner it holds; the proof is in the pudding. Rogue One is a forgettable film riddled with bland characters and a poor story that pampers to an audience that enjoys fast cameras, uncanny CGI and fan-serviced explosions."
"Domas-85-819741","5","9","16","28 December 2016"," You should rent this on redbox. And here's why.
","A great example of a franchise gone bad because it counts on the brand rather than on the actors who built it. Parts of the movie truly felt like a Star Wars parody with symphony playing in the background. Don't even get me started about where they supposedly spent $150MM making the movie. The CGI - if you can even call it that way - is from the 80s. The actors are mostly C list, with few B names. I mean, if we are trying to keep the franchise that authentic, why don't we hire some A list actors? Oh wait, less money to the producers and investors. Instead they hire IP man to add a billion viewers to the budget, a Bollywood star to add another billion viewers and a bunch of no names. But it does appeal to the nostalgia of the baby boomers. That's about it. If I were below age of 35, I would spend at most $2 on a redbox DVD to see this piece. And yes, if you watch it on a VHS - dang, or even on your granpas B&W TV stashed in a garage - you still not gonna miss a lot on the 21st century movie making (in fact, it might even improve your viewing experience, giving you this sensational feeling that there was this hidden episode of Star Wars that just got discovered 30 years later, i.e now) It's time the Star Wars directors watch Star Trek again and learn a little bit about franchise evolution instead of suing those guys trying to collect more money. I am not sure if directors realized but Star Wars was released even before Internet was around. So when you go back making it that authentic you sort of go against all odds of modern movie making. What makes me mad is that anyone who rated this movie use Star Wars franchise as a reference point rather than intergalactic sci-fi movies or sci-fi franchises. Do yourself a favor and wait to see this at home if there is a part of you that likes Star Wars."

Where his every gesture and nuance conjured fear and menace? Well fret no longer! Vader is back, but this time he has a comedy hunch-back and is cracking jokes!! He is even seen relaxing in his hot-tub before starting his day's work.<br/><br/>So, Darth was terrible. What did I like? Answer, potassium sulfate, the killer robot! K2SO4 WD40, to give it its full droid name.<br/><br/>Here's a great killer robot line from another movie:<br/><br/>""I think it would be better, not to die, don't you?""<br/><br/>Sonny, the title robot from iRobot had a great killer robot voice, almost on par with the killer robot daddy, Hal. So, in their wisdom the Disney execs decided ""hey, Alan Tudyk was a great killer robot in iRobot, why don't we reprise his role to the letter in Rouge One?"" (execs all nod approval). Now, for me, K2SO4 was the best character in the film, had the best acting (metallic!), the best lines, AND, the best voice! It was just a shame that he was already a robot from a different movie!!!!!<br/><br/>Real 3D, or Real (Painful) 3D.., for it was for me. Painful in my head (by the end of the movie, literally) and painful to my eyes, who watched with cardboard-ian disbelief. Things seems either flat, or blurred, or best of all, both. The best (worst) example being the opening ""A Long Time Ago.."", mostly everybody in the theatre were messing with their specs at this point! There were a few bits when I thought ""cool!"", but mostly I was left wondering if everybody else in the auditorium were seeing the same flat, dark, silhouettes that I was seeing. It really was a struggle to watch, so much so that intend to watch the movie again to see the bits I missed! (I think the movie may have been quite picturesque in 2D.., certainly there were tropical beaches and palm trees towards the end..)<br/><br/>Battlefield 1, yes, the EA WW-1 game. This was advertised at the start of the movie. It almost could have segued seamlessly into the movie itself, in fact it might well have done. Watching the tropical beach battle I was very much reminded of playing Battlefield (Wake Island). Perhaps war is like a computer game? Or perhaps Battlefield is a really good war simulator? Or perhaps pitching the final battle on a tropical beach resort was the cause of my confusion?<br/><br/>And then it ended. And the John Williams score started. That was the best bit."
"nightfall73","8","15","30","16 December 2016"," Possibly the best Star Wars film since the 1980s
","After the good but slightly disappointing effort that was Force Awakens I was not expecting much from this film, and so left the cinema surprised at just how good it was. I fall very much into the sceptic group regards this money machine franchise, but there was something fresh and invigorating about the latest film. It felt as if we were living in the universe created in 1977, but were getting to see different parts of it and learn unexpected things about it. The ships, droids and aliens fitted perfectly with the feel of the 77 picture but there was something new about it too, as if the Zero-Dark thirty vibe Edwards was aiming for was somehow able to mesh perfectly with the space fantasy without either aspect becoming too strained or giving way. I particularly loved the old, ancient Jedi temples, which brought the sense of wonder I felt watching the originals many, many years ago. <br/><br/>It really is episode 3.5, as much as it is a spin off. As well as Mothma and Bail Organa from episode 3 ROTS, we have 2 members of the Skywalker family, and you probably know which ones by now so hopefully it is not a spoiler. I did not really want to see Vader in this episode because we have so much of him already on screen and I felt we would just get cheap repetition; but yet again they managed to do something different and totally new. I don't mean the pun but the sheer brutality Vader shows; his utterly brutal fight scene is something we have never seen before and actually adds a dimension to the character. I loved seeing certain pilots on their pre Yavin form, and the new X Wing and Y wing pilots actually had characters for the first time in a long time. Talking of space battles the use of models in place of CGI gives the spaceships weight and gravitas and the complexity of the battle lies somewhere between eps 4 and 6. This film has actually interested me in the world of Star Wars in a way I have not been since 1983: Edwards has genuinely breathed new life into a pre existing universe. <br/><br/>As for the reshoots, go and look at the trailer released before the summer. Things are different: Whitaker's hair, the lines they give to Mon Mothma and certain plot points seem altered. The older footage gives no mention of the father-daughter arc which may perhaps have been the focus of Gilroy led reworking. Whoever did it, and however they did it, I personally thought the family angle worked fine and did indeed humanise and soften the film considerably. They played it convincingly and the platform sequence (you know something tragic is going to happen when a platform is involved) was genuinely sad and moving, because we realise Galen's awful, no win predicament and genuine good heart. Maybe if you have good actors, they can still do fine work even in a last minute rush. Finally, we actually have a decent Imperial officer; the depth of this character is important, he is motivated properly, he wants the death star to bring final victory for the Empire, it is his baby, and he wants personal control over it, a man fighting to save his career, but out of his depth against the wily politician Tarkin. I'll save Abrams blushes by making no comparisons between Ben M here and the counterpart villain in TFA. The makers of Episode VIII must be quaking in their boots after seeing this. Let us hope they do not choke on their ambitions."

","Rogue One is not a bad film but it certainly isn't a great film. The film has excellent digital effects and looks great on screen and this is where its strengths lie. The pacing of the film was completely off and I felt the main characters were all quite flat which resulted in me not really caring what happened to them unlike the characters in the excellent 'The Force Awakens'. I suppose it is quite strange when the best performance in the film is from a CGI generated human being (the original actor died over 20 years ago). I think the lack of a John Williams score was extremely noticeable and the film suffered due to this. I have read reviews where some people have said this is better than 'The Empire Strikes Back', I know everyone has their own opinion but I find that astounding. If you like plenty of action etc. you will enjoy the third act, unfortunately you will have to grind through large parts of the first two acts to get there."

There is an awful lot of padding - some scenes are as painfully long as an in-game cut-scene that you can't get out of. To make up for lack of story, lots of CGI has been thrown into the mix to try to create a ""wow"" factor. It doesn't. All it does is emphasise how weak the story actually is. For me, an adult fan (I'm 50), it was pretty poor but my 6 and 13 year old nephews seemed to enjoy it.

When I heard what the story was about my expectations were really bad, and it became even worse when I saw the final trailer, it looked so bad I didn't even want to watch the movie. It felt like a quick cash grab of a movie, but my brother and cousin said it was far better than it looked like on the trailers. Heck, my cousin said it was better than VII, so naturally I had to watch it, if mostly that was to get to have my own opinion.<br/><br/>The story takes place between episode III and IV, and it serves as a prequel to the latter rather than a sequel to the former. Basically the entire story is about making sense of a 39 year old plot hole from the first Star Wars movie (which retroactively became episode IV). It was never explained how such a flawless looking station like the Death Star could even be destroyed, however here they retcon that to make it so that the fatal flaw was planned out by the builder of it who was charged to work on it against his will, and it's now up to his rebel daughter to get this information and send it to the rebel alliance.<br/><br/>To sum up the rest of the movie, I thought it was in the bad to meh range. Didn't care about a single one of the characters, the dialogue was mostly bad, thought a lot of the acting was also pretty bad, some of the fighting scenes were alright, but most of them were laughably clichéd. Especially the final climax which included pretty much every single action movie cliché that exists and by that point I just wanted the movie to be over as soon as possible. (Spoiler warning) The Darth Vader portions at the end were decent, but it sadly lasted only a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>I feel like I also have to address the retcon. (this might be considered a spoiler depending on your perspective) I have to suspend my disbelief by a lot when you consider the fact that Mads Mikkelsen's character had many other co-workers working on the Death Star. All of them seemed very loyal to the empire. It's hard for me to swallow that not a single one of them noticed the flaw he had created in the architecture and informed the bosses of it.<br/><br/>Overall a half hearted movie, with half hearted acting. 5 out of 10."

Only Disney could take the Star Wars franchise and turn out a film that is a tragedy (as a genre). I have never seen a Star Wars film where everyone dies, even the droid. Most of the film felt like a a sequel to Apocalypse Now set in Florida. The dialogue was atrocious. If I hear someone say ""hope"" one more time, not to mention the bazillion lines they copied and pasted from the original trilogy, I'm going to do a Vader choke on someone. The only part of the film that felt authentic was the last ten minutes (Darth Vader killing rebels; and a young CGI Carrie Fisher making her escape from the dark lord). 3PO and R2 had the most awkward cameo, as did other characters. The overall feel of the movie was much too emotional. If the cast had not been tragically... eliminated, the story may have had some ""hope."" Instead the film made me want to cry and curse at Micky Mouse. To put things in perspective, let's use Episode IV: A New Hope. Rouge One was the equivalent of having R2 and 3PO killed by storm-troopers, Han Solo killed by a stray grenade, and Luke and Leia embracing on a planet as it disintegrates around them (picture Jack and Rose on the Titanic).<br/><br/>The technical aspects also deserve a mention. There was no traditional Star Wars scrolling titles, just a bland title with no creativity. The absence of the main title score was a huge blunder, I will not speak of the Rouge One score 🤐. The use of CGI... let's just say that even George Lucas would have used less. However, the recreation of actors in their youth was quite impressive.<br/><br/>If you and your family are looking for a fun and exciting Christmas Star Wars film, this is not it. You will feel left empty inside, with nothing but ""hope"" for a better film next year."

","Rogue One - very stupid episode with talentless plot. It didn't show nothing new – the same ships, the same star of death, the same protective shield. No jedis, no main characters (they all died). Nothing new. Lack of ideas - Darth Vader and princess Leia showed up again. In comparison to the previous episode, The Force Awakens, which didn't offer nothing new in its plot also, at least has the first beauty in Star Wars – the gifted actress Daisy Ridley. I was a fan of Star Wars but not anymore. I watched the first 3 episodes 4 times, the next 3 – 3 times, The Force Awakens 2 times, and the last one - I don't want to watch it again. Star Wars, for me, was a symbol of philosophy, fantasy, and elements of action and humor. In the last two episodes left only fantasy effects and nonsense action like many action movies nowadays.

"ViktorDrake","9","14","28","16 December 2016"," Best Star Wars Movie Since 1983
","PLEASE NOTE - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Without a shadow of a doubt this is by far and away the best Star Wars movie since 1983's Return Of The Jedi. It's also by far the most adult Star Wars movie yet, and as an adult viewer I found that seriously refreshing. One thing that did surprise me though was the number of extremely young children in the cinema - parents take note that this isn't really a film for little kids. The violence levels are much higher than previous instalments and (SPOILER ALERT!) all the heroes die at the end, so don't expect a cheery journey home with the little'uns!<br/><br/>I've noticed quite a few people complaining about this movie, and it seems that some are completely missing the fact that it's a Star Wars-RELATED movie, NOT part of the primary Star Wars story arc. Yes there's no opening crawl at the start. Why? Because it's not part of the primary Star Wars ""Episodic"" story. Yes there are no Jedi or lightsabers (well, not until the very end at least). Why? Because it's NOT part of the primary Star Wars ""Episodic"" story! Yes the music is quite different to the others. Why? Have a guess at the answer folks! This movie is different because it's MEANT to be different! Not liking a movie because of it's story line or the acting is one thing, but missing the point is something else.<br/><br/>Another common complaint is that it's too slow - personally I found the pacing excellent, building the main characters backstory just enough for you to care about them before the action kicks in. Some have also said that Jyn isn't a likable character - in my opinion, not being a typical whiter-than-white saccharine-sweet Hollywood heroine is something to be celebrated, not moaned about. Let's not forget she's shown to be a criminal at the start of the movie, so once again I think it's great the film makers decided to go down a slightly darker and (dare I say) more realistic route.<br/><br/>The characters are all original and well-developed enough for an action movie, the effects are generally excellent, and the story is coherent and refreshingly different to the others on the main Star Wars story arc. It's also great to NOT see Tattooine for once! As I said above, this is a much more adult take on the Star Wars universe, with people on both sides doing morally dubious acts. It brings a refreshing shade of grey to the usually black and white Star Wars world.<br/><br/>A special mention needs to go to the Vader scene at the end as it's fantastic - FINALLY, after nearly 40 years we get to see Vader kicking some serious backside...well, for a couple of minutes at least.<br/><br/>All in all it's considerably better than The Force Awakens (which I rated as an OK 6/10), and a million times better than the universally appalling prequels.<br/><br/>The only thing that prevents me from giving it 10/10 is the slightly ""off"" CGI that's standing in for both Peter Cushing and a young Carrie Fisher. Unfortunately it seems we're still in the ""uncanny valley"" when it comes to trying to produce a 100% realistic CGI human. That said, my girlfriend didn't actually realise that Tarkin was CGI, so maybe it's only noticeable to those of us who know Cushing is dead. Either way I'm still glad they at least attempted bring Tarkin and Leia to CGI-life instead of recasting either actor.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the best Star Wars movie.......ever."
"shredchris","9","14","28","16 December 2016"," The SW movie everyone has been waiting for since Empire came out.
","Alright, disclaimer first : I HATED The Force Awakens. I thought it was a bad rehash of Episode IV with some elements of V mixed in, had too much painfully obvious fan service, and a lightsaber is NOT a Harry Potter magic wand that calls upon a force user. Kyber crystals might initially in the SW lore but that's it, so that bothered me tons, plus I'd rather watch a well written movie poorly executed than a great looking movie with a crappy scenario. Now, R1 is exactly the mix of a great script AND awesome execution by the director. We all know the backstory. But to have such great writing meeting great directing is a rare thing, especially in the recent SW history. The coolest part of the movie is that it feels like classic SW, the characters are great, the universe is gritty and tangible to an extent, the story is compelling, the battles are intense, and Darth Vader is the ultimate bad-ass we never got to see before this movie. Sure there are a couple of flaws in the movie. CG Grand Moff Tarkin is meh. They can't really pull off CG human characters 100% yet and it still bothers me, but his part is important so it's kind of a small trade off and it serves the story, so I can live with it. Not a fan of Forest Whitaker's character either, but again, it still works and makes sense, so it's all subjective. But I'll tell you one thing : the last 15 minutes of the movie are a 10/10. They make the whole story, all movies, work together and connect so smoothly that it's just perfect. If you don't get shivers watching those last few moments, you must me dead, I don't see any other explanation. In my book, it's a home run. I'll be watching this one many more times. Also the score is great and memorable. That's also a welcome change from TFA. 9.5/10 for Rogue One. I just LOVED it."

This was the worst episode of the saga I have ever watched. Does Disney know where they're going with Star Wars or are they just cranking out garbage in order to recoup the money they gave to George Lucas. It wasn't until the very end of this movie that I finally figured out it had no bearing to the previous movie or the other 6 movies from Lucas.

"jediknight190501","8","8","14","18 February 2017"," The fall of the Empire begins with ""Rogue One.""
","Having lived through the initial pandemonium that was the original Star Wars film, I have been a loyal follower of the evolution of Star Wars over the years. Now we have a stand alone film set within the Star Wars universe, which is certainly a curiosity. So for ""Rogue One"" I was very open minded, not knowing what to expect and willing to form an opinion based on the presentation. In other words, I tried not to have either any expectations or preconceptions when I went into the theater to see the film.<br/><br/>I have to admit I had to overcome an initial feeling of ""this is boring"" before I became immersed in the story. Once I did so, I found a movie that was expertly crafted. From the dialogue to the action sequences, the various details were handled in such a way as to create an experience that ended up being very effectively bittersweet, much like ""The Empire Strikes Back.""<br/><br/>*Spoilers Ahead*<br/><br/>Star Wars fans know that the Death Star plans were stolen and used to help destroy that planet-killer in ""A New Hope."" ""Rogue One"" is the story of how those plans were actually acquired, and the sacrifices made by many people in order to get those plans. ""Rogue One"" is the most adult Star Wars film, and the characters are not one-dimensional. The film shows a side of the rebels fighting the Empire we haven't seen before. These people are gritty, not necessarily nice, and possess personal baggage appropriate for those involved with an underground war against an established government.<br/><br/>The direction, by Gareth Edwards, is quite probably the best of the entire Star Wars series. The story moves along crisply, and the actors are put through their paces with aplomb. There aren't any wasted moments, and there is an underlying seriousness that is absent in all the other Star Wars movies. There is no over-the-top acting in ""Rogue One,"" and the screenplay doesn't possess that element of corniness we've come to expect from Star Wars films. I wish Edwards was directing Episode VIII, but that film is being directed by Rian Johnson. I just hope Johnson does as good a job with ""The Last Jedi"" as Edwards did with ""Rogue One.""<br/><br/>Of special note are the set designs in ""Rogue One."" The locations and sets are unique to the Star Wars series for the most part, and the look and feel of the props, costumes and sets capture something that seems missing from the other Star Wars films. I guess the best way to put it is that there was an element of realism in ""Rogue One"" that seems missing from the other movies.<br/><br/>I suppose that with the success of ""Rogue One"" we will be treated to other stand alone films that will fill in gaps in the overall Star Wars saga. I hope that happens, but we'll have to wait and see."

","OK we all know star wars isn't the most intelligent type of movie. 1000's of star troops run out of doors just to be slaughtered by the rebels laser-beams, and they just keep coming like lemmings,...you would expect a little combat training for armies, but no, not in star wars. And yes we know. The real hero's are never really hit even if they walk through crossfires of laser-beams. no problem. But come on, it has to be a little bit real. When one of the side kicks is hit/killed his side-kick friend runs towards him from his cover screaming noooo. And suddenly no-one seems to be able to hit this person until the hit side kick has uttered his last heroic words. And what is it with star-wars, that they always have these very important switches on weird places that have to be changed before the hero's can do something. And of course they hero knows exactly what to do when the system states the antenna needs to be aligned. And the pilot that needed to go insane because of the interrogation by a weird creature is amazingly keeping his sense very well.<br/><br/>There are so many bad story lines/plots and dialogues in this episode, it becomes beyond ridiculous."
"Kaanb","10","8","14","19 December 2016"," One of the Best Star Wars Stories
","As I have long been a Star Wars fan, I've always been waiting for new films in a little bit of suspicion after Disney bought the franchise. And I was really happy that the first movie Disney brought us (episode 7: The Force Awakens) was inspiring in capturing the essence of star wars soul, may be even better than George Lucas's own prequels (episodes 1 to 3). But this time, with Rogue One, director Gareth Edwards along with screenplay and story writers told one of the best stories of star wars series. They told a story that truly reflects what we old fans like about the series, a story that took me to the day I went to the first movie with my father. And it was a great movie that I enjoyed with my son.<br/><br/>The story was in fact tense and dark. It offers some of the most notable underlying themes of original star wars such as hero's' (or heroine's) troubled relationships with fathers; losing him early, longing and hating him, and finding him, ...but losing him again. In Rogue One, Jyn Erso who is the daughter of an empire scientist (Galen Erso) who builds Death Star, adds to a row of strong female characters of Disney era. Felicity Jones takes the lead in her orphan role and brilliantly plays a beautiful and tough yet vulnerable character. Lack of trust between the characters make star wars movies dark, but this story is probably darker than others since most other characters have similar untrustworthy backgrounds. For example Jyn spent her childhood not trusting her father and turned to Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) for shelter only to be abandoned by him.<br/><br/>Hope is always the ultimate weapon of rebels to fight and succeed against a greater force. This gives them the reason to fight and makes star wars believable even if many unbelievable things are happening on the screen. We do not believe what we see, we want to believe that all sacrifice they have done could not be for nothing, it gotta work and it works. Like in first star wars movies, rebels find their way out of impossible situations. Their hope always wins.<br/><br/>The movie is tense. It connects sequence of actions with small reliefs that prepare audience for next sequence so well. As you watch, you immerse yourself into the story and really worry about the rebels. Disney made good casting choices to make the main team more colorful with addition of Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang. In his blind Chirrut Imwe role Donnie Yen brings choreographic martial arts style fighting to star wars while his ability to sense so strongly reminds us Jedis although no Jedi is in the movie.<br/><br/>Rogue One brings back the style of space wars of original movie, too. The white imperial star destroyers hold true to the original mock ups of George Lucas with their all-white surface without any significant touches of coloring & shading of modern CGI. Some scenes such as one in the communications tower on Scarif are direct reference to original movie. The final war scene on the tropical beaches of Scarif is one of the best war scenes in all star wars episodes and also reflects a taste of some old style Pacific war scenes of World War II movies.<br/><br/>The movie does very good as a prequel to episode 4. It connects to princess Leia and explains how she got the death star plans. But the true climax of the film is reached upon the charismatic entry of Darth Vader into the final battle scene. Again it was his daughter escaping unknowingly from father with something that would change the fate of galaxy with a new hope.<br/><br/>While we exit the theater with my son we were talking about probably similar scenes and having similar joy when I and my father had some 40 years ago. And I was thinking that one of the best stories of science fiction genre may be all about hope that is so great that can even fight Death Stars."

","Forget calling this film Rouge One this film should be dubbed A New Hope part 1. This film more or less is actually the appetiser for the main course directed by George Lucas. As mentioned in the opening crawl of the 1977 version Rebel spies have stolen plans of the Death Star and the film leads directly to the start of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>What I liked about the film was the return of the Death Star, Tarkin who looks his normal self despite Peter Cushing now deceased and of course the return of the one and only Darth Vader.<br/><br/>However the film was not without it's disappointment as there was no opening crawl. The film begins with the infamous A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away before it simply cuts to the action. The biggest annoyance however was that the Death Star was operational the whole time in the film. It was not supposed to be able to fire with it's laser beam until A New Hope. I bet George Lucas would be angry and if I was him I would sue Gareth Edwards for every penny he had as that is a huge plot hole in my opinion.<br/><br/>Despite that the film was not all bad as we finally see how the plans were stolen and we finally get a true prequel to A New Hope. I only gave it 5 stars as it had it's good and bad points and was not as great as the main Star Wars films."

","There are great war movies taking place on Planet Earth, but, most are formulaic and uninspired. Looking at this movie, you feel like you're again watching one of those ""procedural"" war movies, of which you can't really remember the names, plot or anything else. The only difference is: this one is in a different setting, in a galaxy ""far, far away"".<br/><br/>Script is weak, predictable and not interesting. The giant robot is the only one having any fun, but, it's weird... after all, it's a robot. You see, the legendary C-3PO and R2-D2 are fun and funny, but, they are not _having_ fun. They are robots, after all. BTW, they have a pretty meaningless cameo in this movie. CGI faces on Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia feel more weird than all the CGI characters from prequel trilogy put together (Jar-Jar included).<br/><br/>Apart from the Jimmy Smits and Forest Whitaker cameos, the rest of the cast are doing a pretty bland job. Even Darth Vader, in another cameo. There is no real sense of dread about him. He just seems like a ""crazy Batman"" of sorts. He's big and has a silly black outfit which provides him with many weird weapons - most of which seem to be some magnets. Yeah, we all know he's the strongest-Force-user-ever, but that is from other movies, in this one, he's the ""Crazy Batman"".<br/><br/>The movie looks fine, things keep happening, so you're not bored, there are a few laughs to be had. But, that's about it. Everything else is forgettable."

","I got disappointed from the get go. The Classic tones from John Williams's Star Wars Theme didn't open the film. Nor did the Star Wars Theme play at any time during the film or at the end credits. The music to Rouge One is composed by Michael Giacchino. The music isn't bad and Michael Giacchino is an excellent composer. Only Disney should had hired John Williams or at least paid him to get the permission to use his Star Wars Theme. This is one investment opportunity that the Disney executive will regret one day I am sure. All Star Wars fans wants' to hear the Star Wars Theme blast out of the speakers in the big screen cinema. The Star Wars Theme 'is' Star Wars. Without it the film can never be anymore than a 2nd grade copycat. I am sorry, but that is the Holy Truth of the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>They have changed the concept somehow. They want to stay in the mythology of Star Wars, adventures in outer space in the distant future with all sorts of high tech we still haven't invented. On the other hand they want the story and the film to be more buttoned down, more in contact with the realities of the world that we are actually living in. They are trying to make Star Wars more social realistic. And that is a shame. I want the adventure in the distant future. I don't need Disney to point their moral fingers at me telling me how to live my life and be a good human being.<br/><br/>There is clearly something wrong with Rouge One. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>So the good stuff.<br/><br/>Well, the character Saw Gerrera played by Forest Whitaker is amazing. Truly amazing. 99% because of Forest Whitaker's acting and interpretation of the character. So when he dies with only 10 minutes screen time you feel disappointed, cheated and lost. You can feel that you want to have this character in all future Star Wars films, but now he is gone... (or is he??? - in the world of cinema you can revive anybody from the dead).<br/><br/>Felicity Jones (Jyn Erso) and Mads Mikkelsen (Galen Erso) are great with their characters too, but Forest Whitaker takes the prices though he, we and everybody else are being let down without John Williams's Star Wars Theme.<br/><br/>Disney, Disney, Disney No, No, No"
"claritadeb73","7","16","33","15 December 2016"," A missed opportunity
","I'm reviewing this against my expectations based on what I think the story could have been like. Firstly, let's just say, this film has been produced to a high standard delivering the well-loved format of the Star Wars franchise, a similar calibre to The Force Awakens. The casting is excellent, the visual effects eye-wateringly beautiful. <br/><br/>However, it's quite clear Disney have compromised the potential edge this story could have had, to cash in on massive audiences. I would have loved this story to be told as an intergalactic spy thriller rather than a Rebellion caper. The script was fine but rather predictable and corny. The story didn't have enough intrigue or twists for my liking. <br/><br/>This is a film for a new generation of fans but the old generation like me are gonna get a bit sick of being fed the same showmanship instead of progressive sci-fi action drama. <br/><br/>I'm a devoted Star Wars fan but if the franchise continues to churn in this direction, the Star Trek reboots are looking much, much classier."
"qrules","5","16","33","14 December 2016"," 5 Darth Vaders out of 10 and Vader has no real function for the plot!
","I just saw the midnight premiere in Germany and I just wish to share my thoughts in this movie. I should mention I watched ANH right before this one, so I got a good comparison.<br/><br/>First, I would like to congratulate Disney for really trying to make a different movie, it has some good looking effects, the Star Destroyers looked like they were models, at least in some shots, which I appreciate. K-2SO has some funny one liners, Darth Vader is in it and the references are very neat. <br/><br/>**SPOILER** Although I ask myself how the two ""death sentences on 12 systems""-guys (dunno their names) escaped the destruction of the city?<br/><br/>All in all it felt nice to watch, yet there are numerous things, aesthetically, about the staging and the characters, that to me do not fit. If you want to know why Vader has no real function in the story, skip to the end. <br/><br/>There is Darth Vader's costume and statue. The whole thing seems somehow wrong. I thought to myself the helmet and his statue are looking too stocky and that rubber part under his helmet? It may be the same thing used in ANH, but it just does not look like it.<br/><br/>Although I was surprised about the quality of Grand Moff Tarkin's face, I could easily tell when it was CG and when it was stock footage. Nice try though.<br/><br/>Some shots on Yavon 4 are the same as in ANH, but still they were not able to recreate the atmosphere. But they gave it a good try.<br/><br/>By trying to close a plot hole, that is the existence of the exhaust port, another was created: why on earth didn't the death star attack the rebel fleet? Really? To give Vader his moment? There are some other things in the final battle that made no sense, but that's o.k<br/><br/>That virtually none of the main characters of the movie survives is the classic recipe for a so called war movie, but I found the deaths of most of the characters quite boring. It would have given the movie a much better dramaturgy if Vader killed most of them, but no, he just has to kill some poor rebel crew members.<br/><br/>Now for Vader. The bacta tank scene has no real function. Why is it there? We all know what is wrong with Vader. <br/><br/>His conversation with Krenic does what exactly? Remind him of all his mishaps and give him a warning? Krenic already knew this from Tarkin.<br/><br/>The boarding of the rebel ship? Haha. Vader accomplished nothing! The rebels escaped with the plans. (By the way the corvette in which the rebels escape looks wrong too!) So the story could have lived well without Vader or it makes Vader look really bad because he wasn't able with all his force powers to pull the disc with the plans out of the hand of that one rebel? Sorry that is lame. Vader is just there to please the fans.<br/><br/>I think the movie would have worked much much better if the Krenic character would have been replaced by Vader and make him the main villain of the movie and Tarkin responsible for the construction of the Death Star as it was indicated at the end of RotS! It also would have served the ongoing tension between Vader and Takin in ANH if they would have had tensions in this movie as well."

","Following a motley gang of rebels on the hunt for the plans to a planet-destroying super- weapon, Rogue One, the fist ""stand-alone"" Star Wars story, finally lands with a loud thud on our screens. Two films in and Disney's management of this golden franchise is already showing very troubling signs of laziness and risk-aversion. If you've come looking for something a bit more original than The Force Awakens, this will be a a very strange disappointment.<br/><br/>By now the consensus is in that Episode VII, while entertaining, is basically a soft reboot of Episode IV, weighed down a bit by a Mary Sue heroin (despite a personable and able actress in the role). What that installment did do right, however, was nail the tone, and perform at its best when offering new ingredients. Its original characters were, for the most part, interesting and fun to be around, and you wish there were less fan-service to distract you. I mention all this because, strangely enough, Rogue One has the exact opposite problem.<br/><br/>After a title that enigmatically promised X-Wing action, then a trailer campaign implying a kind of Dirty Dozen meets Star Wars, the resulting film is more a limp, flavorless war in space movie with bland, under-cooked characters embarking us on a mission we all know the ending to, and them peppering it very heavy-handedly with enough fan service to handicap any attempt at an original story.<br/><br/>An intriguing new villain is introduced... but the fans want to see Darth Vader (and, supposedly Grand Moff Tarkin from episode IV), even though they have nothing to do beyond look cool and menacing and defang the main villain. Each new character stumbles in and has to be introduced with words: so much for the visual fluency of the original saga. Everyone kinda pouts their way through this, and the mood varies through different grey shades of ""subdued"" in an effort to be edgy and dark... and instead coming across as completely joyless, a real first for the Star Wars saga.<br/><br/>Unlike Episode VII, the fan service moments will be the only ones to quicken your pulse, never mind their narrative redundancy or lack of sense. Cool! That's Vader's castle... but wait, why are we here? Wasn't Vader established as kinda subordinate to Tarkin in Episode IV? Yeah! We get to see the Death Star fire the big gun up close... Except wasn't Alderaan in Episode IV meant to be a huge surprise? Hey, there's Vader again... dispatching people nobody cares about... And on, and on... Everything ""new"" in between barely registers, with the exception of Alan Tudyk as K-2SO as a welcome but underused touch of vague humor.<br/><br/>On the strength or these two films, we can expect much of the same coming up. More of the same with fan service coming at the expense of a satisfying narrative. This isn't as inept or ghastly as the prequels by any stretch of the imagination, but boy is it just bland.<br/><br/>See it if you must, but if it's Star Wars in war mode you want, you'd be better off getting a used copy of the Battlefront video game, which probably has more character development and narrative cohesion. At least that will spare you the horrific site of dreadfully CGIed Carrie Fischer and Peter Cushing."

The beginning felt badly put together ( a bit like this review:) as if they wanted to give the intros to the characters but just threw them out at you hoping for the best. Then it was just boring till they got to scarif. Scarif was more what I was hoping for. Good action and lots of the stuff to make your star wars heart smile but it doesn't save the film as a whole. It does flow nicely into a new hope. Lower your expectations."
"kearashady","3","11","21","27 December 2016"," ""Star Wars"" in name only
","""Rogue One"" may be ""a Star Wars story"", but it certainly isn't a Star Wars film in any sense that I associate with the genre. Instead, ""Rogue One"" feels very modern, despite being dutifully styled after the ""New Hope"" universe. The lighting, the conversations, the filming, the acting, and the dramatic sequences are all very 21st-century Hollywood. Thus, everything about this film is darker, grittier and more unsettling than any ""Star Wars"" film so far. I was expecting this to an extent, and I realized it could be used to advantage. Sometimes realism is cathartic and relevant, and can make characters stand out and plot lines more powerful. This was not the case here.<br/><br/>It might have worked had one of the main characters been likable and clever enough to carry the narrative through its many waves of moral dubiousness and violence. Yet while the protagonists were human enough to make you sad to see them go, they are not apt to become role models for its audience. Since most of the characters inevitably didn't make it to ""A New Hope"", then they are almost treated as disposable. Like the plot itself, they are simply a means to an end that we already know.<br/><br/>Disney seems lost in their vision here, and it's disappointing. While ""The Force Awakens"" was almost too safely modeled after the original films to the point of appearing to be a remake of ""A New Hope"", ""Rogue One"" is modern to the point of being nearly unrecognizable as existing in the same time frame as ""A New Hope."" For example, how did Jyn Erso exist in the same year and in the same organization as Princess Leia? Both reflect the varied advances of feminism in their respective film eras, which does not make sense when reversed in their canonical chronology. Leia was a strong woman for the 1970's, but Jyn is a very different lead woman representing the changes that have taken place into the 2010's. I know they're supposed to be from different planets, different backgrounds, and very different experiences. But they are both clearly products of their respective decades of creation in Hollywood. Setting ""Rogue One"" in the weeks or months preceding ""A New Hope"" reminds me of how ""Dirty Dancing"" was set in the 1950's. Technically, it COULD have happened, but the reality is that it probably wouldn't have.<br/><br/>While ""A New Hope"" was saturated with 1970's-era characters and Lucas's Baby Boomer nostalgia, ""Rogue One"" is saturated with Gen-X ambivalence and Millennial grit. ""Rogue One"" was clearly written in the ""post-truth"" age. This is a generation where a man of conscience is called a traitor, many would-be role models have failed to be anything but, and the paradigm of what it means to be a hero is constantly in flux. While ""Rogue One"" does tap into our generational uncertainties, it fails to give us much hope going forward.<br/><br/>Sadly, for a film wherein it is stated that ""a rebellion is built on hope"", the Rebels' attempts at heroism are often overshadowed by the apathetic absence of hope or integrity within the Rebel Alliance itself. The lines between the Empire and the Alliance are often disturbingly thin as well. Characters on both sides are having to follow their conscience against the dubious orders of their leaders.<br/><br/>Thus we have a Star Wars film, of all things, drawing thin lines between rebels and terrorists, traitors and heroes, evil empires and organized governments, all without giving us much to grab onto or go away with. The only clear message seems to be that the ends justify the means. That isn't very inspiring, especially because the same message is used by both sides.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, an Imperial leader is asked how the Empire can achieve peace by spreading terror. The leader laughs that it's all the same because, essentially, the ends justify the means. Likewise, one of the Rebel protagonists espouses the same thing by saying that as long as the Alliance achieves the freedom he's fought for, then all the horrible things he's done for that end will be justified.<br/><br/>This is, tragically and ironically, the very type of film that George Lucas first wrote ""Star Wars"" to counteract. In the late 1970's, he was fed up with the slew of films in which anti-heroes were the protagonists, the good and bad guys had been muddled into a gray mass of ambiguity, and ultimately it didn't matter anyway because they all faced some kind of tragic end in the name of ""realism"". Is there a hidden irony here in ""Rogue One"" having been created to be just this sort of film, set to be taking place in the events leading up to ""A New Hope""? If so, I'm not sure anyone got the joke.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a rather joyless affair. A ""Star Wars story"" in name and imagery only, but the very antitheses of it in the story it tells."
"nazztrader","4","11","21","25 December 2016"," A big missed opportunity here.
","This was really three movie's worth jammed into one, unfortunately. Why not make three movies exploring the lives of the main characters and providing a sense of what is happening on the planets they inhabit? And I'd like to know why there's an Asian Ninja guy who talks a lot about the Force yet isn't a Jedi? And so on (they could have even spent some time on how the main robot character came to develop a conscious, whereas his robot buddies did not!). As others have said, this felt rushed, yet some of the dialog was rather stiff, but to me the biggest problem was the acting. The ""universe"" felt like Star Wars but the main characters felt like they were from somewhere else, a boring galaxy far away, perhaps. While I disliked the Asian Ninja guy character most (seems like they did this to appeal to the Asian viewing markets), it's easy to overlook the one character and enjoy the rest. But after a while I began thinking that if one of the characters went to a refrigerator and took out a can of Coke or Pepsi, it would not be at all surprising!<br/><br/>I liked the idea of the film though as I said it should have been divided by three, and the action scenes were good, but to me it registers as a good Star Wars-ish action film. If that's what you want, you'll likely get it. However, I don't think you'll get anything ""deeper."" For example, why not spend some time on showing us why the ""average Joe"" is tempted by the Dark Side? Instead, we get boring or basic/stiff dialog that had a deadening effect on the film. The previous effort wasn't very good, but it felt like a kind of kiddie version of a ""good"" Star Wars film, whereas this one has more of a ""mish mash"" feel. I can imagine an excellent film after what I saw (or two or three), but I wish I had seen that film!"
"funcrunch","6","11","21","24 December 2016"," The Force is weak with this one
","I went to see this movie with fairly high expectations. I've seen every live-action Star Wars film, starting with the original trilogy on first release. I was disappointed by the prequels, but greatly enjoyed The Force Awakens, so hoped that the momentum would continue with this ""anthology"" film. I'd also re-watched Episodes IV, V, and VI the week before Rogue One opened, so the saga would be fresh in my memory.<br/><br/>That said, Rogue One did not feel like a Star Wars film to me. The costumes and setting were there, but the spirit was not. Story and charm were sacrificed for action and (admittedly very impressive) visual effects, and what humor was there felt forced. For example, I knew K-2SO was no C-3PO, but he seemed more like an irritable human wearing a robot suit than a droid in his own right, like Marvin the Paranoid Android from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, except far less funny. And the blind Whill-guardian's constant mumbling mantra about the Force, and others' reactions to this, almost made a mockery of the concept.<br/><br/>Other, arguably nitpicky things were immersion-breaking. A species that has evolved to be capable of faster-than-light travel and planet-destroying, asteroid-sized death machines, should not be storing the schematic for said machine on what appears to be a standard desktop computer hard disk. Said schematic should also be stored under a more secure arrangement than a single name consisting only of letters. Also, the same simple pull-lever was the mechanism to perform two crucial tasks during the battle to retrieve the schematic.<br/><br/>Overall, this entry in the franchise is worth seeing, but that is what I feel this series has become: A franchise. The franchise will likely continue to generate billions of dollars in income regardless of the quality of the stories. I just can't help but prefer the classics from the original trilogy, even with the many ""director's cut"" revisions that have taken place since the 80's."
"Hirekitsa","5","11","21","23 December 2016"," Mediocre at best
","If i were to describe Rogue One with one word i would say mediocre. There are some great shots, scenery and practical effects in this movie, but with shallow characters and a plot that is ultimately without tension this movie falls flat. I don't like to use the word boring to describe a movie,but after falling asleep in the end of the first act/beginning of the second act i can say the word boring apply nicely. They had one chance to redeem the fact that they were gonna make a Star Wars movie that was completely pointless in the grand scheme of things, and a movie that had to build tension on the basis of the characters since most people already knows how the story ends. How you could fail so spectacularly is beyond me.<br/><br/>First off you need a background story to your characters, and by that i don't mean that you have to force feed me flashbacks and exposition, but at least you need to establish a main character that isn't a hollow plank. The problem is that they actually try to build a story around Jyn our protagonist, but they don't emphasize in the right places, and they draw the opening short. Visually it's stunning to look at, but with no emotion i get easily bored.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action in this movie, but action is only good if you care about the plot and characters, and i don't. Garerh Edwards had the same problem with his movie Godzilla (2014) which was visually stunning, but lacked personality and characters (except Bryan Cranston). I don't know if it's the story as a whole or the scriptwriters fault that the dialog is dry and pointless, but i will go for the latter one because i know that one of the scriptwriters greatest achievement is directing and writing New Moon which also makes no sense and is pointless. There are glimmers of personality in some of the dialog, but it eventually leads to nothing and most of the relationships feel forced. I can imagine that the re-shoots is behind most of the embarrassing tonal shifts, and may be the cause of the missing personalities of the characters.<br/><br/>I can bring forth a similar movie that came out this year: Star Trek Beyond. This movie is very similar to what Rogue One tried to be except the gritty tone, although Beyond was a little dark at moments. This Star Trek movie had great characters even though they had two movies to establish them, but in this movie they kinda redo all of that, and it still works as it's own movie. Rogue One doesn't really work on it's own. The best moments are the fan service (for the fans of course), and the other moments that work are the ones that set up A New Hope, and is somehow connected to something we care about. Even if you are a Trekkie or a Star Wars fan you can't say that Beyond is objectively a better movie although Rogue One is better in some parts.<br/><br/>At last, let's talk about the fan service. Without spoiling anything i will try to be vague on the details. In this movie there are characters we know of that are placed in various locations that makes no sense for them to be. I suppose you could argue on some of the locations of the various characters, but after a while my braim just says: nope! Also the use of Deus Ex Machina has now ruined every movie that comes after this one. The Fore Awakens is also guilty of this, but not in the same degree as Rogue One.<br/><br/>They didn't even have the balls to just call this movie Rogue One. They just had to add A Star Wars Story which is the stupidest title a Star Wars movie has ever had, and I'm including the prequels. You just know they did it to market this movie to people who don't really care about Star Wars. I will refrain from calling them stupid, but they just had to add that last part to get the message across. Let me just swing by the music department and say that the music didn't even make a slight mark in my brain. Either you have to go as far from Williams' work as you possibly can, or you have to get Williams to do the job, something in between is hopeless.<br/><br/>Finally this didn't feel like it needed to be a Star Wars movie, and it didn't feel like one for the most part. I'm not saying we can't have spin offs set in the Star Wars universe, but they need to make memorable characters that we care about, and they need to start believing that the average movie goer has the attention span to watch some good old character development that doesn't involve corny, long monologues, and pointless action scenes. The Force Awakens did at least make memorable characters that stuck with me more than five minutes after the movie was done. I'm gonna be nice and give it a 6/10, but in reality it deserves 5 or even 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>And to all the people that are going to say that this movie took a risk, the only risk this movie took was being underwritten. The worst thing is that it worked."

","I am 15 minutes in, and I find myself desperately longing for the atrocious prequels made by Lucas. That's how bad this movie is. It is boring, it has no sense of style whatsoever, it certainly doesn't feel like Star Wars, and the screen writing is abysmal. How do you make a Star Wars film that generates no thrills and fails to draw the viewers into the action in the first act? The original Star Wars started with a boom. It sucked you into the story instantly. Empire Strikes back made everyone amazed with the Hoth scenes, and hooked the audience from the start. Same thing with Return of the Jedi. These films all had memorable openings, with scenes and lines of dialogue true fans know by heart. Can anyone remember what happened in the opening of Rogue One? Will anyone pick any of these scenes and show them in film class or on TV as examples of memorable film making? No way in hell. I won't even say anything about the crap that followed later in the film, I have no more time to waste on this rubbish film.<br/><br/>Zero stars."
"amoledboy","1","17","36","1 January 2017"," Welcome to Phantom Menace country
","I was initially puzzled by the number of glowing reviews of Rogue One by fans and critics alike. Then I remembered that the first stage of grief is denial. Fans desperately want any new Star Wars film to be good and will stifle any doubts to avoid reliving the trauma of the Phantom Menace trilogy. Fair enough.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the same problems that dogged the latter George Lucas trilogy are here in this film as well. Instead of giving us a fast paced, feel good Sci Fi adventure, we have to sit through a stodgy, self important, overcomplicated mess. Apparently, George Lucas gave this film the thumbs up, which ironically is as good as a kiss of death. Lucas has completely lost touch with what makes a good Star Wars film, which is why Disney paid him $4 billion and freed the franchise from his evil clutches.<br/><br/>The film begins by hopping us about from planet to planet, so that we lose track of where we are. We are introduced to way too many redundant characters and never spend enough time with the main heroes to care about them.<br/><br/>The heroes of the story are dull and unlikeable. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna wear perpetual scowls and lack any chemistry. It felt like the filmmakers considered the idea of a romance between the two and then quickly realised it wouldn't work.<br/><br/>The main villain, played by Ben Mendelsohn, somehow seems smaller than life. Mendelsohn is a fine actor but he gets upstaged twice in the villainy stakes. First by a reanimated Peter Cushing and then by Darth Vader. While we're at it, I'm glad I'm not the only one who is outraged by the digital manipulation of a dead actor's image. I hope they don't have any ideas of doing the same to Alec Guinness in future films.<br/><br/>The final battle on the Imperial base fails to excite. I think they were going for a D Day invasion sort of vibe. Instead, it was like watching a bunch of kids playing cowboys and Indians at the beach. Blind monk and his mate dies, who cares? Pilot dies, who cares? Main heroes die, who cares? Robot dies... well, I kind of liked him.<br/><br/>Star Wars films work best when they are simple action adventure stories. The target audience is young males between 10 and 18 years old. A young George Lucas understood this, so too did J.J. Abrams. The older George Lucas messed up the formula and alienated a whole generation of fans. Gareth Edwards is in danger of driving the Star Wars bus off the same cliff."

","1. Predictable, routine action, and far too much of it.<br/><br/>2. Incoherent beginning, comprising scenes that flit all over the galaxy.<br/><br/>3. Jyn Erso is Galen Erso's daughter. So what? For some reason, Jyn's announcing her lineage is supposed to strike terror, open doors, evoke homage, whatever. Who would care after 15 years, which is how long it has been since she has seen her father? Why does her father write his message to her when he doesn't even know if she is alive and the fate of the galaxy depends on the right people getting his message. How stupid can you get? 4. Routine, predictable political correctness permeates the show - Jyn is a bad ass who beats up most men, the leader of the Alliance is a woman, the main characters are women, Hispanics, blacks, and a mystical Oriental.<br/><br/>5. Why does Galen tell Jyn in the opening scene to trust the Force? Neither she nor he has any special connection to the Force. The Force is not strong in either of them. Just routine sloppy writing to force a connection with the Force.<br/><br/>6. Why does Jyn's mother leave Jyn, confront the bad guys, and simply get gunned down for her troubles? How could a man as brilliant as her husband have married such a ninny? 7. The plot gets stupider as it progresses, going from silly to ridiculous. A band of rebels steal an Imperial ship (the Empire's people are so utterly incompetent) in one place and then show up at another station on another planet not knowing where to find the Death Star plans, which turn out to be filed along with the Empire's routine documents including the Emperor's favorite recipes with no special security. Knowing nothing, our heroes almost effortlessly figure it all out, retrieve the plans, and transmit them. In the meantime, the Alliance, roused by our heroes' pluck, attacks the Imperial base to draw attention away from our heroes (isn't that a rather tired plot line?) and have great success doing it even though they made no prior plans and didn't even decide to do it until the spur of the last moment. Yet they carry it off brilliantly. The battle scenes often seem to have been lifted straight from previous Star Wars movies - ""Copy that, Gold Leader,"" flaming X-wings steered by screaming pilots, ""I'm on him, Blue Leader,"" etc., etc.<br/><br/>8.

Along with the poor casting and the silly attempts to ""Disneyfication"" of the Star Wars franchise I quickly lost interest in the movie before the plans were even stolen.<br/><br/>I put an equal portion of the blame on the direction because the vision of the director is an interpretation of the writer. There are countless mistakes and continuity errors in the movie along with factual and illogical scenes. The ending being the worst of them all; as if they didn't even bother to check the original movies to keep continuity.<br/><br/>I didn't like the CG of Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin was also bad, but not as bad as Leia.<br/><br/>This is a sign of things to come and with Force Awakens I see Disney doing a repeat of their princess motif for all their movies. I'm surprised they didn't CG big droopy sad eyes on the character, Rey, who was not only a weak character, but Daisy Ridley was poorly cast.

"alexblk-66957","2","7","12","8 January 2017"," Wow...makes Ep. I, II, & III look good by comparison
","The reasons that Rogue One tanked:<br/><br/>1) Any Star Wars movie that does not have Jedi, the Force, and light sabers is going to be, by definition, boring.<br/><br/>2) The music sounded similar, but not nearly as good as, the original soundtrack. It was plain uninspiring, and mostly just helped to muddle all of the terrible dialog. In Rogue One the music was just lots of unending white noise, a distraction that wouldn't stop. Easy to tell that John Williams had nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>3) Once again, the characters in the movie were not likable (except Jyn, she's beautiful). Casting was mostly terrible, with few exceptions. It didn't bother me at all when they died off--just like Episodes I, II, & III. I didn't care what happened to any of them.<br/><br/>4) The dialog was God-awful; who wrote this droll s**t?<br/><br/>5) Oh, the dialog--it went on, and on, and on, and on, and I've never seen an action movie before that had so much stale talking. It made me just wish the movie would end soon. The dialog became an audio version of Chinese water torture.<br/><br/>6) Oh, the action--even the action was, incredibly, slow-paced. It seemed to take forever for anything to happen during what were supposed to be action scenes. Things and actions that should have taken 10-to-60 seconds in the movie were drawn out to 5 minutes or more. Awful pacing.<br/><br/>7) The cinematography was, almost completely, awful, as most movies are nowadays. The camera would not hold still, for even a fraction of a second, in nearly any scene in the movie (real or computer-generated). (Don't believe me?--compare this movie to the original Star Wars and it will quickly become evident.) This made it difficult to follow the action, or to even care after a while. (At least this movie lacked JJ Abrams' epilepsy-inducing, and continuous, lens flares and light flashes, thank God.)<br/><br/>8) Even though the human characters were speaking English, most had accents so heavy that it was difficult for me to understand them (and the terrible and ever-present soundtrack made matters worse). What were the character's names? I couldn't tell, so I gave up caring who-was-whom. <br/><br/>9) Where were all of the aliens? They showed in an occasional scene, but infrequently. Almost all humans, in a Star Wars universe. What gives? Especially the last 3/4 of the movie.<br/><br/>10) In the final battle scene, the rebels that were fighting on the ground didn't look like rebels; most of them looked exactly like the troopers in Aliens. Wrong movie.<br/><br/>11) This movie entirely skipped the great opening sequence musical score and moving text of all other Star Wars movies; I know that this is an offshoot movie, but this distanced itself too far from the originals. If they had used the moving text to explain the story line, as the rest of the Star Wars movies have, then maybe they could have removed half of the awful dialog that was in the movie. Bad storytelling. Suddenly, I miss George Lucas behind the wheel. <br/><br/>12) And the missing opening, dramatic, musical score by John Williams left a huge gaping hole in the Star Wars experience from the very beginning of the movie--this was just a taste, and perhaps a warning, of what was to follow.<br/><br/>13) Every scene featuring long, excessive, boring, dialog had to be done with close-up facial shots; there are so few scenes that show actors and their surroundings, making the visuals too claustrophobic. Wasted sets and environments. Bad cinematography. Lost chances to enrich the storytelling experience.<br/><br/>14) The droid main character had lots of funny lines, but they were not funny. The words were funny, but the delivery was done as bad as it possibly could have been done. A real shame. C3P0 could do a funny delivery, but this POS couldn't.<br/><br/>15) When the rebel fleet was trying to break though the force field gate, and couldn't, why didn't they destroy the circular spaceship that generated the shield gate? Eventually they did by forcing a Star Destroyer into it, but it seemed they didn't think to shoot at the damn thing for the previous 15 or 20 minutes!<br/><br/>16) Why were the rebels (and the main story line of the movie) trying to kill the designer of the Death Star, after it had already been built? What's the point? So the main story arc was a waste of time, and pointless. Soap operas have more believable and cohesive stories.<br/><br/>17) The computer-generated face of (the late) Grand Moff Tarkin was uncannily realistic, but his face had too many and almost-constant odd facial movements that just looked weird, and unnatural. He looked normal, but his face didn't act normal. And, of course, every shot of him was a close-up facial shot (like everyone else's). In this instance, they just had to prove how good they were at bringing the dead back to life. Lots of times. And the recreation of Princess Leia's face was done the very same way--so close up, just to prove how good the CG artists are--that you could count the hairs in her nostrils. Not pretty.<br/><br/>18) All of the characters in the movie--except the main characters, Jyn and Cassian--had so little reason to be in the movie at all; everyone else had minor parts that lasted hours on end. They became story line clutter.<br/><br/>A huge disappointment. I'll save my money in the future."

","5 seems harsh, but on a scale of 1 to 10, it really does, or should, mean take it or leave it. This movie was bland and boring, and this is coming from someone who watches Collider Jedi Council and has read most of the new canon novels, including ""Catalyst,"" the book that sets up this story. The characters in this movie are very forgettable save for Donnie Yen's blind monk or guardian of the whills character. He at least shows varied emotions. Everyone else is one-note. Story-wise, this movie is very choppy as we're dragged from one locale to the other. I wish they'd stayed on Jedda and perhaps used that planet as a base for recruiting old Force worshipers/believers and training them to be a fighting force a la ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""The Magnificent Seven."" TFA had its problems, but at least the first act was great and most of the new characters were likable and memorable. There's fan service galore in this movie, but all that did was remind me of how rich and fulfilling the OT is. I honestly can't imagine anyone but a SW nerd liking this movie."

","My review on the movie Rogue One(2016). 1.An individual can visualize and enjoy this movie in two types i. As a Normal space battle flick ii.As a star wars movie. 2.This is 2 hours of a climactic, heart-wrenching, no bullshit straight to the point event. Yes, I saw this movie as a star wars movie 'cause I know the story lines and characters. 3.MACHINES USED: X-wing fighters, U- wing fighters, Y- wing fighters, imperial I- class star destroyers, TIE-strikers, Resistance star destroyers,{ AT-ACT, AT-ST} walkers: cargo carriers, clone- tank. TROOPERS USED: storm-troopers, death-troopers, shore-troopers, and sand-troopers. 4. This story is about the bunch rebellions named Jyn-Erso, Captain Cassian Andor, Chirrut Imwe, Saw Gerrera, K-2SO(actually an imperial reprogrammed machine). Bodhi Rook. named Rouge-One. these five people will make you tear up for sure, awesome char' build-up. The movie is all about stealing plans located at SCARIF(Khyber crystal refining planet) from imperial and transmitting it over to rebel- alliances. If you know about the star wars- a new hope(1997), you see Princess Leia handing the death star plan Chip over to R2-D2. 5. Tone and cinematography of the movie is gorgeous, exclusively there's a char who's blind and the way camera angle is set when he senses the movement is gorgeous, even the hyper-drive chills just chills the way fighters arrive, ships arrive, are awesomely shown. 6. There's no point in discussing the story, it's better to acknowledge the way story is executed 'cause story is straight to the point.The execution is way better, way courageous than Star Wars VII : the Force Awakens. 7. I loved this movie to the core, it's heart-breaking and hope- bringing. The third act will BLOW- YOUR MIND. 8. Darth Vader OMFG he is damn terrifying. Princess Leia is CGI of the younger version. In the end when they ask what is this ? while giving the chip.She replies HOPE. SNAP END CREDITS. GOOSEBUMPS. VERDICT: Go, watch it, Irony I walked all the way to my home from the stop chanting "" I am the force, and the force is with me"" you'll get the reference after the watch. Way Way better than Star Wars VII. I loved it to the core"

","Can there be Star Wars in Star Wars? For over an hour, we're taken from random planet to random planet for no apparent reason other than to have new planets in the SW Universe. Gray, sad, dark planet to brown, dark sad planet, to rainy, sad dark planet. You can watch the first 10 minutes, then skip the next hour. . <br/><br/>But thankfully, Disney labeled them all, ala Michael Bay. <br/><br/>Fun Fact: There wasn't a single location popover in any Star Wars movie up until this point. <br/><br/>I had no emotional connection with the protagonist. Emo Skywalker was sullen, uninspiring, un-relatable and a tad barn-owly. The only thing more shocking than this casting choice that as of right now, this movie has an 8.2 rating. <br/><br/>Hey, and let's cast more English people with super thick Cockney and Gaelic accents who call Generals 'Mum'. Yeah, that doesn't break the illusion or take you out of the movie at all. <br/><br/>The fact that were was no opening scroll accompanied by a thundering John Williams orchestra is unforgivable. Intead, we're greeted with a Star Trek / Marvel / James Bone mini-10 minute-sequence, then the title, which again breaks the mood, then the rest of the move. <br/><br/>None of the supporting cast (which there were WAY too many of) had story arcs. Cassian, Bodhi and Saw could have been rolled into one - and still been incomplete. <br/><br/>Forest Whitaker was shoehorned into this movie for no reason other than to prove that he's alive. Another dull and shallow character.<br/><br/>They did get a few things right - the ending sequence almost saved this, but wholly disappointing.<br/><br/>Still better than the prequels - but barely."
"Tehmeh","4","14","29","18 December 2016"," Disney, you're losing me fast.
","I'll start on a positive note: ""Rogue One"" is far better than it should be. There is no need for it to exist other than box office revenue, and the cynical corporate machinery behind it is quite obvious. This one should flat out suck. It doesn't. There are a few moments in it, it's very competently made, there is real talent involved and entertainment to be had. If you're not too critical about these movies, you'll have fun with it.<br/><br/>...But after just seeing it, I suspect that Gareth Edwards didn't get to make the movie he wanted or then he was just a yes man all along. ""Rogue One"" could have been a really good standalone movie, but Disney had to interfere. They had to make everything feel ""more connected"", so they sacrificed plenty to the altar of Cinematic Universe For Dummies. Many references and familiar elements/characters are shoehorned in just for brand recognition and everything suffered from it. This feels exactly like the Marvel superhero franchise is starting to feel: A product that exists only to remind you of their other similar products.<br/><br/>The trailers had me worrying that the lead character/actress would be just a lifeless blank state. I was wrong, partially. The actress (Felicity Jones) is good. I know this, because at times she made me feel something, even when her character itself was paper thin. That would be alright if they didn't pretend she had a real arc or transformation as a person, but they did. That's the problem with forcing depth and moments where there are none: it feels undeserved, manipulative and cheap. I felt nothing for the character, but I felt something for Jones' screen presence - and that's a compliment, because when the mind-numbing laser show at the end begun, I just wanted to see more of her instead, along with Diego Luna.<br/><br/>The same can be said for many of the characters: there are good actors involved that sometimes rise above their empty, toothless and pandering material. Ben Mendelsohn is great, even when his character has nothing going for him. Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera is pointless too - just a name, funny voice and a costume. A gimmick doesn't make a character. The more they tried to make someone appealing, the less appealing they became. Less is more, studio people. K-2S0 would have been fine without the forced quips too, but at least I felt something about them. <br/><br/>This is not a spoiler, it's in the trailers: a certain famous character makes an appearance in the movie. And I must say that there was no point to it. The few last shots were alright, but there was a scene in the middle that served absolutely no purpose and felt extremely off. For the first time it felt like this iconic character was there just to deliver lines. It felt like product placement. Replacing Peter Cushing (deceased, RIP) with CGI was even worse. It was not only embarrassing, it was tasteless and disrespectful. There was no reason for it either, he too was in there for brand recognition only, and added nothing to the movie which makes it that much worse. It left a shitty taste in my mouth, just like the last shot of the movie in all its perverted CGI glory concerning a beloved character. Who the hell made these decisions?<br/><br/>I noticed much of the cynical studio machinery behind ""The Force Awakens"" as well, but I really liked that movie because it had genuine scenes. Real scenes with flow, deserved emotional stakes and purpose. ""Rogue One"" doesn't flow at all. At the beginning we jump from one place to another, explaining various things to the point of boredom and disconnect, probably because they don't trust the audience to pick up the clues or understand hints to the past. Remember when the Jedis, clone wars and such are quickly mentioned in ""Star Wars"" when Luke meets Obi-Wan? We picked up the clues then and let our imagination fly. None of that here, no room for imagination, no room for movie to shine. Shine it does, but in a wrong way: The last 30 minutes has plenty of space and land battles. Lights, lasers and explosions. No excitement, no natural flow, no reason to care. The ending also has three different scenarios happening at once, so we get plenty of transitions, plenty of unfocused fury and plenty of emotional disconnect. ""Rogue One"" can't find a tone. It tries to be dark, and it kind of is, but it also pretends to have real emotion and humor in it - and only some of it works. It doesn't have a real heart, and in the end most of it just slips through your fingers.<br/><br/>It tries to imitate the original trilogy. It succeeds only superficially. It captures the look, some (not needed) characters, references and such, but it doesn't dare to just be a movie. It's not comparable to the prequel trilogy either. While I think the prequels to be dumb, clumsy and emotionless, this one seems just cynical, manipulative and wrong in a whole other way. <br/><br/>After all this complaining, do I hate it? Almost, but no. It is well made, the actors are mostly good, and technically it's fine. It just doesn't feel like a movie. It has no identity. It feels almost like a product forced on you by some condescending, pandering marketing people. It holds your hand at every turn in an uncomfortable way, and it has no real creative reason to exist. If you're already cynical about this movie, don't see it - it's exactly what you think. If you're excited, you'll probably like it. As for myself, I will skip all these ""cinematic filler universe"" movies from now on.<br/><br/>Oh, and Disney: It's okay for the boy and girl to kiss in the end. Especially when you have a movie that already lacks human emotion."

","Pros: The visuals and the ending was well constructed; IMAX with Laser resulted in crystal clear images, projected by dual projectors on a giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!<br/><br/>Cons: Its dejà vu again. Since most of us has seen SW:VII(TFA) and the old trilogy; all of us know what is going to happen, especially in the first half! I don't want to spill the beans!<br/><br/>Verdict: I would prefer SW:TFA in lieu of this movie. With the concentration on action over narrative, we're left with a Disney outing that can't help but feel like it's lacking where it really counts. In short, old wine in a new bottle!"

","Rogue one didn't give me any emotions that i would get in really good movies. It had way too much forced humor possibly to compansate for the darkness and sadness it had. Also i felt the music was too underwhelming for my liking – again the music didn't give much emotions with the movie and seemed overall just too mild at least for my taste.<br/><br/>The story itself was made to fit it's purpose as a filler story between E3 and E4. Thats what it did and i think it did that job fairly well. It also gave some possible plothints for the coming star wars Episode 8 – something to talk about for the next year while waiting.<br/><br/>Rogue One delivers what you expect from a big blockbuster these days. Blockbusters always come with downsides. When the goal is to please the maximum amount of people everything ends up being milder. Overall good movie, not bad but not really good either. Safe to say it servers it's purpose at the Star Wars movie family but fails to deliver anything special."

","At this point, pretty much everyone that has been planning to see the new Star Wars story in theaters has already watched it. Perhaps there might be some out there that feel that an eighth movie in any franchise isn't worth seeing, and maybe some out there saw it, but didn't understand how much effort, love, and time went into each second of the movie. I will now recollect every right move that the crew over at Disney did in order to make a movie impossible to hate, without spoiling it of course.<br/><br/>There is a little known rule in the movie industry called the Bechdel test, which is put in place as more of a guideline than anything for gender diversity in the media. What entails inside it are three vague rules making one vague sentence: at least two female characters that discuss with each other something other than the opposite gender. The test doesn't specifically state how long those characters have to be in the movie or if their talking plays a prominent role in the story, making it confusing as whether or not Rogue One correctly passes this test.<br/><br/>There is a scene where the actress of Mon Mothma from the prequels (Genevieve O'Reilly) speaks to Jyn Erso about what her mission is. That scene is probably what some would think to be not enough for Star Wars to pass the test. However, I propose that Rogue One correctly allowed gender diversity without having to pass that dumb test. If Disney decided to use exactly two main female characters, then they would be pandering to a suggested rule more than anything. They would be following a rule that they don't legally need in their movie. If Disney had three female characters, that would be too much woman at once for a saga like Star Wars, which may lead to people thinking that Disney is attempting to be too equal in gender roles. Whether or not Disney theoretically did that is only guessing. In short, by having only a single female character that is also the main protagonist with no relationship, even implied with any man in the squad she's in was the best choice to go, and possibly the only correct choice.<br/><br/>Multiple interviews with the creators and cast talk about how this Star Wars film is not like the other ones, where there's no optimistic Jedi such as Luke Skywalker or any members of Rouge One who are even close to having the cunning accuracy of Han Solo. Some come close to being like them, but in truth, they aren't. This was the first Star Wars movie when you felt that at any point one of the heroes could die just from not ducking under a blaster bolt. Before this, all of the deaths in Star Wars were implied before they happened or mentioned years later, with the entirety of the Jedi Order falling to Order 66 mentioned in A New Hope. In the new movie, not a single thing is mentioned about the squad besides that the Death Star blueprints were transmitted, beamed to the Tantive IV, the ship that R2 and Threepio are on at the beginning of the first Star Wars released to the public. This led to many speculations as to why these characters were never mentioned again. Maybe they became the Knights of Ren in Episode VII, maybe they left the rebellion afterwards, or maybe they died in action, or all of the above?<br/><br/>All questions about who are these characters are and what happens to them are answered throughout the movie, leading to an ending that is even more memorable now only months after we first saw it, for obvious reasons I won't spoil. In my opinion, it is the best story."
"BoringJoe","10","6","10","24 March 2017"," Went in with low expectations. Was completely blown away.
","I actually had an IMDb account since 2010 but deleted it in anger when they did away with the message boards. However, I had never written a review before. I usually relied on the message boards to get a general feel for the movie as I found it hard to trust reviews. Since this is our only way now I read through the reviews before checking it out. I saw many either very good/ or very bad ratings. I tend to be pessimistic when it comes to Hollywood so I gave it a go with very low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome. I decided to remake an account to help others who may be needing average Joe opinions.<br/><br/>You will know very few of the characters aside from a few that are brought in from both the originals 4-6 and the newer Eps 1-3. I won't give away who they are but you will have a few nostalgic moments and smile when you see them. <br/><br/>Let me state that this movie was created with substance and storyline and forewent the graphical technology so prevalent in Hollywood over the last decade or so. For me this was a breath of fresh air and something that has been sorely missing for quite some time. The less is more was evident here. The story itself was very intricate. It wasn't shallow and built just as a popcorn flick just to make an easy buck. I felt as though they really put their hearts into creating something special for the audience. The acting was spectacular from all involved.<br/><br/>Here's something else I was pleased with. I have really gotten sick of franchise films (or films in general) such as Marvel and the newer Star Wars movies relying on the cheesy nostalgia gimmicks, cheesy humor/ joke scenes, and general fear of making serious story lines that aren't basic formulaic packages they feel the entire family of all age groups can be brought to. Where's the serious story lines that really encapsulate the thinking person. Do any of you go into a Marvel movie and get swept away in imagination like you would in a really good book or do the cheap ""same old formula"" movies like Marvel and the new Star Wars movies make you groan with their attempts to win you over with their overkill of ""humor scenes"" and CGI? <br/><br/>This Star Wars was made for those who fell in love with the original Star Wars 4-6. Who were swept up in the story and were in the movie for its entirety. This movie, in my opinion, stands up there in greatness with the original Star Wars trilogy unlike eps 1-3 and the newer Star Wars Ep. 7. It had that ""feel"" to it you only got from the original episodes 4-6.<br/><br/>Sorry if I made this review a bit long, but I didn't know what to expect with the either extremely high and low ratings. I watch a ton of movies and shows and so I have pretty high standards. I want to see movies with substance and storyline and could care less if they have over the top graphics. I wrote this review for those of you out there like me that look for the same. I rated it 10 stars, but have a tendency to do that for any movie or show I really enjoy. I would imagine most who look for the things I do as mentioned above would rate this an 8-10 star though. We don't have the message boards anymore so hopefully more average joes like myself begin writing reviews. I'm not looking for ""professional critic"" like reviews, just honest opinions."
"CookieVanSnott","5","6","10","29 December 2016"," Rogue One: The Return of the Market Research Based Movie-making
","Good things first. Compared to ""The Force Awakens"" - which I, as many, perceived as a giant slap in the face - this does most of the things better. The storyline is no longer reduced to a borderline plagiaristic ""homage"" of Lucas's work, the screenplay does not feel like it is only being held together by duct tape and chewing gum, the characters come across as actual human (or whatever the respective case may be) beings rather than comic figures and the Force is not degraded to being just another useful superpower. The bad news: the storyline is thin and predictable, the screenplay chaotic in places (especially in the beginning), the characters still unrelatable and badly lacking development and the Force only an afterthought.<br/><br/>The ultimate reason I cannot recommend this as a good movie to watch - and in my view the root of much of the above evil - is that I see the cardinal flaw of ""TFA"" largely repeated: the notion that you can make a good movie not by setting out to tell an authentic story, but by trying to guess what people might want to see and then showing them just that. In this case, the main guiding principle seems to have been: ""Let's just find out what people did not like about TFA and avoid that"". Take for instance the way that the movie desperately tries being ""dark"" - in my view an obvious response to one of TFA's major criticisms being that it was perceived by many as childish and shallow. One character after another is killed off on screen in pursuit of demonstrating to us how dark the movie is. Unfortunately, because of the lack of real character development, the wooden acting and the apparent fear to loose focus groups by wading too far into the tragic, what could have had a true dramatic impact instead turns into a monotonous march of unrelatable and unlikable figures from their mostly forgettable introductions to their very predictable and inconsequential deaths. Maybe it's just me, but after watching the movie I honestly could not immediately recall the name of a single one of them.<br/><br/>Like so many other recent Hollywood products, this movie leaves me feeling reminded of an old episode of ""The Simpsons"" where executives come up with the idea of creating the perfect kids show by basing it on what the children themselves say they would enjoy watching. The end result is a self-contradicting unoriginal mess that most likely none of the children would watch. Now I agree that this is a stark simplification that is not universally applicable, but it hopefully at least illustrates my point. At a minimum, Lucas understood that in the end of the day, movie-making is all about the art of telling a good story. Unless Disney remembers this simple truth, movie theaters will start to stay empty sooner or later, no matter the amount of market research."
"fire-child","5","6","10","27 December 2016"," If you adored Star Wars: The Force Awakens, you'll probably love this not necessarily a compliment
","Watching the trailers, I got the sense of Rogue One gearing up as a grittier, darker film. After the endless "" massive space battle clash"" feel of much of the rest of the series, I was hoping for a smaller, character intimate project about espionage. Perhaps a work about Bothans being the CIA, MI6 or Special Forces equivalent within the Rebel Alliance. Yep, the odd battle scene, but mostly these scenes as strictly character and story driven, rather than by plot and action.<br/><br/>Well, what were we delivered ? Sadly, you guessed it again, mostly plot and action. More massive space battles (more space dogfights than any Star Wars movie to date, incidentally); more explosions; more pace, over slow build up.<br/><br/>Beneath the surface in Rogue One, there's yet again more of the key issue that plagued Star Wars 7: characters and events, rather than being introduced and explored with respect and feeling, ""appear"" from nowhere. People thrown like driftwood - from plotted scene to plotted scene. We're supposed to instantly and intensely care them, and their fate. Well, I'm sorry, but if I can't get a rounded sense their histories and context, I can't suddenly force myself magically to care much in the end as to their outcome. Note that a large part of why the best film in the saga – the Empire Strikes Back – is best is because it takes a long, bonding, intimate stretch -examining Luke's fledgling sense of identity and purpose learned from Yoda, and Han and Leia's burgeoning relationship.<br/><br/>Rogue One's at least marginally better than TFA on one character front, but only by a whisker. Jyn Erso gets some nominal backstory/history, and has to work hard at her progress in the film (unlike the credibility stretching ""Mary Sue"" exploits and appearance of Rey in the TFA). However, aside from Jyn, who else gets a look in? Take for example Donny Yen's blind Force sensitive character, whom I was initially fascinated by. Where did his power originate? Who might he have trained under? How do his abilities tie with the Jedi exactly? But the filmmakers didn't seem to care two sticks about exploring this kind of territory. He ends up finally, as might be expected, as little more than cannon fodder for yet another large scale Empire-Rebel battle.<br/><br/>As said, building a person driven story is not helped if the film insists on jumping location to location, at a breakneck pace – Rogue One revels in this. Just when you're beginning to work out where you are, and what might be going on – bang, they move again! Note it's very telling the filmmakers decided to add captions at the bottom of the screen, that describe which place and planet you are now on. These were never present in the previous episodes - you need them to have a faint stab at where you are next! To justify a five out of ten rating - there are things to appreciate here. The cinematography, special effects and 3D detailing are mostly excellent - probably the best of the saga to date (the only exceptions being the facial recreations of Grand Moff Tarkin and Leia: see below). I was also impressed with the narrative decision that all the major Rebel characters are dead by the end – bold, but gives the story at least something of an attempt at a kind of sad dignity (although as I've said, given how little characters are fleshed out, it's not nearly as sad as you'd hope it might be).<br/><br/>There's also frankly an incredible scene – one of the best of the saga. Vader, in Vader costume, goes into full on Sith mode towards the end, in a way we've only imagined for the last 40 years. It's a truly stunning moment – that sadly only lasts a minute or two.<br/><br/>This again makes the point again about meaningful and memorable characters. Vader - the most memorable character of all in the entire saga - could have done with being in the film a lot more than the three or four minutes present. Tarkin (and Peter Cushing) being recreated digitally, eclipsed Vader's screen time, by some distance. Was he memorable? Yes, but sadly not necessarily for the right reasons. I don't know whether if I had not seen the original Star Wars: A New Hope, whether I would have noticed the digital recreation or not. If you've seen him though in the prior film, you'll see the difference between the digital and the real Cushing. The effect wasn't stunning to me: it's creepy and unsettling, and distracts away from the film. Ditto the young Princess Leia digital recreation.<br/><br/>So why all this plot based, digital action obsessed filmmaking taking place in a saga that once mixed action and character so beautifully? Perhaps because you get the sense that, under the Mouse House, their primary concern is displaying as many new locations and characters as they can squeeze in, in order to sell more toys and merchandise.<br/><br/>It's interesting to me David Fincher – who would be my first choice by a long shot with this kind of movie, if allowed to work without creative interference from Disney - originally declined Star Wars 7 when offered it. My guess now as to why he declined is because he was wisely afraid of exactly what has happened - the franchise being dominated by the Mouse suits, and their intent on lowering Star Wars to the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>My overall comment then: what a waste of creative and narrative potential - just like Episode 7. For the love of Pete, Disney – tone it down in future: please. Please. We don't need recycled space spectacle every time: we don't need endless action and jump cutting. Stop treating us like we have the attention span of a goldfish, and actually write a quality story - over constant visual effects and space battles filler."
"DJAkin","6","9","17","24 December 2016"," Corny in parts but good. Mainly for kids.
","I went to see Rogue one not knowing what to expect. It takes place immediately before Star Wars and the entire crawl on Star Wars is the synopsis of Rogue One. there are a few things I noticed about Rogue One. The Storm Troopers may as well not even have armor. The armor is completely ineffective against even being punched much less shot at. My friend Jason Houston saw it and agrees. Also, I noticed that Darth Vader in his Bacta Tank was a neat scene but I was hoping that we could see the tank empty and then look at Darth without his costume. I was also hoping that the guy who plays Hannibal Lechter would have had more of a role. Forrest Whitaker's character was really funny. The way he spoke will be imitated for generations. He reminded me of that villain from Mad Max - Immortan Joe. When he had that blob like octopus read the pilots mind, I thought it was Jabba the Hutt at first! The Death Start was really neat looking. I liked all of the graphics. I am sorry I had to go to the restroom when R2D2 and 3PO made a cameo, ugh. I thought that Felicity Jones's character was so so. All of the accents bugged me. Danny from Bloodline was a so so villain. The scenes on the ""beach"" like planet reminded me of the D-Day invasion to an extent. Darth Vader only has 10 minutes of screen time. He sounded more like James Earl Jones than ever this time around. Grand Moff Tarken was silly looking as CGI and so was Princess Leah. Like I said, one thing that is good about this movie is that it's good special effects but overall, it's a a little hokey. Lenny said she liked how they resurrected Grand Moff Tarkin and the movie kept her attention more than the others. I like the Darth Vader light saber scene at the end."
"botrytis","9","9","17","17 December 2016"," Empire Strikes Back = Rogue One > Force Awakens
","Rogue One is simply one of the best thing that could happen within this franchise. It successfully accomplishes to be a Star Wars movie without relying too much on mass Easter-eggs as Force Awakens did, but it also extends the lore with its new story-line which in the end perfectly docks to the beginning of the New Hope.<br/><br/>Do you remember how was it like when you played the Jedi Knight Outcast for the first time, or a more fitting game, Rogue Squadron? Or read some of the novels of the young Obi wan Kenobi, when he was a Jedi padawan, or any of the Dark Horse comics about Luke's dark side? It gave wider perspective to the universe that the Star Wars movie anthologies represented. It's just a refreshing feeling when you experience the happenings of new characters in different places of different galaxies, reminding you that not only the universe of the movies exist in this franchise, and that there is a lot more beyond that line abundantly more. <br/><br/>And here we are, Rogue One, a story which is the prequel to the New Hope, a sequel to the new trilogies about Anakin Skywalkers failure. A story where we see a totally different side of the Rebellion, a lot more dirty, darker, with its morally questionable members who struggle to bring justice to their galaxy which is under the rule of the Empire. We can feel this blooming hope, as we watch these people throughout the movie, where we see the most credible representation of this repression, as non-stop tension rules around the forces of empire walking around of people's everyday life. I assure you, non of the prequels could present the oppression in such effective way as this film.<br/><br/>The storytelling is beyond amazing with examining every cliché a Star Wars movie could possibly do, and with that it could re-think how even the most minor action scenes would be exciting without making the audience yell: damn, this again!""; Here we go again!"". The characters have also interesting dynamics between them, and makes us feel attached to easily, making them well understandable in most of ways. <br/><br/>The cinematography is really distinguishes itself of the Star Wars norma, but with an understandable purpose: The monumental scenes never felt so monumental EVER in any other Star Wars movies, or it is just executed in a way as it is should be nowadays, making these scenes Huge, and Wide. It was really a long time ago that I had ever been so touched by the visual presentation of any movie. That's how amazing it is.<br/><br/>With these elements listed above this movie perfectly works as not just a Star Wars movie, but also as a motion picture which wants to be a Sci-fi/fantasy. And that is what Force Awakens looked over, to be not just a movie that relies on being a Star Wars movie, thinking that it is enough to be a sci-fi nowadays, but a production, which has to be a Sci-fi in the first place and THEN Star Wars. With this thinking I believe it could be possible to bring a totally new, fresh feeling to a film within this franchise, to think a bit out of the box, and not being afraid to tell new stories, to be INDEPENDENT from the Star Wars norma.<br/><br/>The narrative is a blast from A to Z, it is fast phased, but still comprehensible, enjoyable. It has seemingly many stories but perfectly built around the main story: which is to steal the famous plans of the Death Star. To understand the hugeness of such action the movie made us to understand the Rebellion. To understand the Rebellion we had to believe that the Empire is indeed repressing the people and maintains the stress-fullness in people's everyday life. The story perfectly gives you these right information at the right time. Everything is perfectly built on each other, the narrative has never been that complex and yet understandable in a Star Wars movie in my opinion. It just feels natural to watch and it's simply enjoyabe. So that's all you gotta do when you go watch this movie: To enter this world and let it tell you the story the way it wants to do it. You will hardly be disappointed. <br/><br/>There are also flaws of this production though, but mostly minor ones. Only one big issue I had with this movie is what every other reviews are talking about: The CGI faces, but you will understand when you watch this.<br/><br/>Overall it is a Star Wars movie, gave me such emotional waves at places that couldn't resist me saying in my head Oh MY GOD, oh MY GOOD! Is this really happening?!"". And sometimes made invisible ninjas cutting onions. But what's the most important thing in my opinion: I just couldn't take off my eyes from the big screen that was presenting the One and Only real Star Wars I have waited for long, giving me feelings that even Force Awakens couldn't accomplished. And that my friends is a HUGE thing for a Star Wars fan."

","I went to see this film with high expectations given the positive reviews from both professional critics and general public alike. About an hour in to it I was utterly shocked at how incredibly dull and plodding it was. I found I had little or no empathy for the characters, in fact the only character of any interest was ironically not human! (A droid the name of which escapes me) I'm sure the die hard star wars fans may like it but anyone with a simple passing interest in the franchise will be falling asleep in the theatre. <br/><br/>Basically the entire story could easily have been done in about 45 minutes but it was padded out for what seemed like at least 2 hours. Also, they appear to have emulated the ill advised CGI cameo of long dead/very old actors that can be found in films such as Tron Legacy and Terminator Salvation. The result was then and still is a character that looks like they are out of a computer game. It was so distracting that I wasn't really able to pay attention to the dialogue, not that it mattered too much as the plot was so dull anyway. <br/><br/>The final 30 minutes of the film is action packed Star Wars space battles and was really fun and entertaining. The way it leads in to Episode IV was also very cool although I would have preferred not to see Princess Lea's CGI plastic face at the end which just looked like a freak. Overall this is one for the fans only - otherwise don't waste your time and money."

Again Rogue One lacked in all of these domains. The characters were flat, it was impossible to feel their ambitions and they severely lacked humour which was Omni-present in the originals...<br/><br/>The graphics were excellent, the film was of very high production standards but it felt unstitched, it felt amateur, it sorely lacked the pace and excitement that the originals developed.<br/><br/>Hans Solo was a hero, Luke Skywalker grew from a boy into a man, C3P0 and R2D2 had soul, there was action and tension between the principal characters, where was all of this in Rogue One.... nowhere to be found....<br/><br/>It just felt like a slightly above average B series... I do not understand the great reviews, unless if course they are in comparison to the 1,2 and 3 episodes...<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy this film but simply came away feeling very unimpressed, it felt more like a marketing adventure rather than a serious attempt to make a good film"

The new "" A Star Wars Story"" saga is a return to glory for ""Star Wars"" fans. It's the best film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The new blood pumped into this series was much needed. Especially with the film being helmed by Gareth Edwards. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, special effects, screenplay, editing, score and acting. It's an action packed thrilling ride. All the actors portray interesting, captivating and remarkable characters. The plot revolves around the origins of the Evil Empire's most feared and devastating weapon, the Death Star, and tells the journey that is taken to destroy it's completion. It provides an outstanding backstory to the, ""Star Wars"" saga.

","It could have been a good part of the saga, it could have been dramatic and tragic, but it didn't work out, and that's the most tragic part of it.<br/><br/>Bad acting. While the actors in the original trilogy weren't quite the major league except for the few ones, with the downfall of the standards they can certainly give the new 'promising' faces in the cinema industry a lesson or two. Felicity Jones is painful to watch - who called her an actress, actually? Diego Luna is nonexistent, nothing to be gathered about his character revealed by the acting. My gosh, Forest Whitaker whom I enjoyed in some of the very silly movies like Species, caught something from the rest and is cardboard AF. Maybe a 'death' of a robot, a lame C-3PO substitute and a forced comedy effort, was the most dramatic death of them all. That should certainly give an idea of how much the actual characters don't deserve a single *** to be given.<br/><br/>OK, 1 star for being slightly better than the Farce Awakens. 1 star for not flawless, but bold effort to reconstruct Peter Cushing with CGI. 2 stars for the non-typical for the main saga cruelty, only the Expanded Universe had the balls to show all sides of the story before, that's why I loved it so much. 1 star for Darth Vader presence, with James Earl Jones voice, as it should be, but there's something off about him actually. 1 Star for the last 40 minutes of action. Minus 1 star for SJW agenda - I don't care if they're white, black, Hispanic, Arabic, men, women, straight, gay, if they can't act to save their lives. Minus 1 star for the forced dialogues, worst of the lame video game mission briefing kind, and may the Force be with you if you actually lived through a single one of them."

"aladdesign","8","5","8","5 April 2017"," This is how The Force Awakens should've been made
","Surprisingly solid and lively blockbuster filled with everything I expected from the Star Wars sequel The Force Awakens - a bit of adventure, a bit of laughs, a bit of tears, a bit of tension and tons of action. The picture is very pleasing to the eye - new interesting ships, new beautiful planets and new interesting creatures. The story itself is pretty straightforward as all we see is actually the Episode 4 opening crawl made into a movie, so nothing new in general but the way it goes on screen tells us: they've made an effort. And when somebody makes an effort it always shows. Even the secondary characters have their own small story. Even the smallest backstreet in some alien town is populated with life. Battle scenes are epic. I mean, epic. Probably, the most beautiful space battle in all 8 movies (so far) and the most engaging ground battle ever. It's literally a war movie in space. So, it's Star Wars!<br/><br/>There are hundreds of carefully placed cross-references to other SW movies, books, animated series etc. which is undoubtedly entertaining for SW lovers but you can try to watch this as a standalone movie (though you probably won't understand a half of what's going on on the screen). <br/><br/>CGI Tarkin and Leia are... er... promising. There's definitely more 'magic' than 'light' in ILM nowadays but we are still 'almost there' I think. Anyway, digital characters are surprisingly convincing, not overdone and really fit in the picture. Frankly, I expected worse.<br/><br/>The only drawback is, sadly, the music - inexpressive and somewhat bland, it shines only when some classic SW themes come through. Yes I know Michael Giacchino had one month only to make the whole score but who cares, it's not mentioned in the credits. <br/><br/>The bottom line: go watch it, it's the best Star Wars made without Lucas (so far)"

"Dmagic5000","6","5","8","3 April 2017"," Rogue One is flawed, but still a hell of a time
","Despite having a number of problems and flaws, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a whole lot of fun and another solid entry into an already great franchise.<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first anthology Star Wars movie and what many are calling ""Disney's experiment."" If this movie succeeds, Disney can feel confident in releasing additional anthology movies, if it's not then Disney will need to reset their course of action. With it's release well underway, Disney can feel confident in the direction they're going.<br/><br/>Rogue One simply tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance stole the plans to the Death Star and sets up the plot for the Original Star Wars.<br/><br/>Now, there is a lot to like about this movie. This is a very good looking and well shot movie. The cinematography is beautiful at times. It's very well directed and the action scenes are breathtaking at times. The third act alone is incredible and is a visual feast.<br/><br/>The movie also does a very good job at connecting things to episode 4. If you are familiar enough with the episode 4 and the Star Wars franchise you can hear a line, or see something happen that connects to it and it's just very cool. It's like finding a piece to a puzzle and watching it fit in to the rest of the picture.<br/><br/>The CGI (for the most part) is incredible. When the AT-AT Walkers in particular are jaw droppingly realistic. The space battles are exciting and thrilling and while Darth Vader doesn't have a huge role in the movie, he does have one incredible scene in the movie that may just be my favourite Darth Vader moment of all time.<br/><br/>The performances are all universally pretty good. Felicity Jones is very good in the lead role. The movie mostly rides on her performance and she does a very good job. Mads Mikkelsen is also very good in his role, I wish he was in the movie just a little bit more, and Ben Mendelsohn is really good as the main villain of the movie.<br/><br/>However, while the performances from the actors are all great, the characters are not. There is absolutely no attempt to develop any of the characters save Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso. She's the only one we ever learn anything about, she's the only character we are meant to care for, and she still is not developed well. Everyone else is just so poorly developed. Take Donnie Yen's character Chirrut Îmwe. All we're told is he is very in tune with the force, he's blind and he protects the temple. His friend Baze Malbus we learn even less about. He's really good with his gun That's it.That's what every single other character is like. We are told one or two character traits and that's it.<br/><br/>The Force Awakens cared for its characters so much more (I'm only comparing because both movies had to introduce new characters.) We learn so much about Rey, who she is, why we should care f0r her. We learn about what she yearns and desires for, we see her discover things about herself. We learn so much about Finn. Who he was, and his desires. Kylo Ren is probably the most interesting new character in the Star Wars franchise. We see this villain, so conflicted within himself. We learn a little about his backstory, his struggle. These are characters. These are well developed characters.<br/><br/>Rogue One just puts people on screen and is like, ""here are some people. They're good guys and they tell jokes so you should care about them."" It just doesn't work. The characters need to be developed otherwise there is just no emotional weight in the movie. Just think of how much more emotional weight could of been felt in the last act. Sure there was some emotion, but I just found myself not really caring what would happen to the characters and I didn't feel the emotion the movie wanted me to feel and that is because of how poorly the characters were developed.<br/><br/>The other big issue with the movie are the two CGI characters. I don't want to spoil who the characters are, but there are two characters from the original movie that make appearances and well, they couldn't really use the actors now so they had to digitally recreate them. As stated, the CGI in the movie is mostly incredible. I did however have issue with the two CGI characters. The one at the end isn't a huge issue. The other one was very distracting and he is in the movie quite a bit. Every time he was on screen I just kept thinking, ""He looks like a video game. It just doesn't look real."" It was very distracting and he is in the movie a lot and it just pulled me out of the movie every time.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is also uneven. Within the first 5 minutes or so the movie jumps around so much from planet to planet and it feels very choppy. The movie also has a lot of exposition. From characters introducing themselves and saying who they are and what they do, to the movie literally putting lower thirds up to tell you where you are, it just felt kind of lazy.<br/><br/>Overall however, despite the flaws the movie has, Rogue One is a really good movie with incredible visuals, very good performances, and thrilling action sequences. Plus, it's Star Wars."

","Out of all the Star Wars movies made after the originals, Rogue One is without a doubt the greatest. Its nostalgic feel brings you just as close as you can get to the original trilogy, but unlike The Force Awakens(still an amazing movie but lacking in originality), you're presented with an entirely organic and fresh plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Not only is the plot refreshing, but the cast is as well. The diversity is truly worthy of special praise and admiration for anyone that enjoys seeing as many different types of racial representation on the movie screen as possible. I can honestly say that Rogue One was a special treat and an all around fantastic movie experience."
"Sir_Greedo","6","5","8","2 January 2017"," A forgettable action film with flat characters.
","I liked Rogue One. I thought it was great. But there are many things in it that bothered me. The biggest flaw is the lack of character development: 1. The dynamic between Krennic and Galen was something I was looking forward to and I was hoping to see how their relationship falls apart. But we only get one flashback scene where they are buddy buddy to each other and then the rest of the movie they are enemies.<br/><br/>2. Rogue One crew itself was barely developed. Jyn Erso has the most character development out of all of them but it isn't much. Her character lacks a charm and charisma that main characters in Star Wars usually have. We don't learn much about her as a character other than the circumstances she was put through. Her relationship with her father and how she feels about him is about as far as they go.<br/><br/>3. Diego Luna and Felicity Jones should have had more chemistry. I was hoping to see a subtle developing love between them as the movie goes on much like Han and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back. But there was nothing. The death scene would have been so much more effective and heartbreaking had this been there.<br/><br/>4. The rest of the crew suffer from the same problems. A little bit more character development could have gone a long way. I wanted to know more about them, especially Donnie Yen whose character did a great job bringing the presence of the force to this film. (The force was personified through his character much like it was through Obi-wan in A New Hope. I absolutely love it.)<br/><br/>5. The pacing is a mess. The first half of the movie cuts from location to location way too fast. I wish the film could have stayed in one location for a bit longer. The second half of the films pacing starts to drag abit, making the pacing inconsistent. The fact that the film had extensive reshoots really shows.<br/><br/>6. Yes this a ""war film"" and everything isn't black and white but I think they went too far with the Rebellion. A lot of the things they do is out of character. For example, the way they interrogate people and how quick they were to surrender.<br/><br/>7. There's no title crawl. We known this before the movie came out but giving the nature of the films opening sequence and the events that happen before it, it would have been nice to have the title crawl. 8. The music score served this movie in some parts but overall it was forgettable. I understand Michael Giacchino only had 3 weeks to do the score (plus he had to come up with a balance of originality while also following the man himself-John Williams) and given his past work he has done on the Star Trek films ,if he was given more time, I don't doubt the score would have been much better. I was disappointed that there were very few queues to well known pieces of Star Wars music like Binary Sunset or the Imperial March.<br/><br/>But even with these flaws Rogue One still had tons of impressive moments and some of the best imagery ever done in live action Star Wars. Director Gareth Edwards outdid himself with the visuals."

Years later, Saw has become an extremist and Jyn (Felicity Jones) is in Imperial prison. Galen convinces cargo pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) to defect and seek out Saw with a message. Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) with droid K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) from the rebel alliance rescues Jyn. They are sent to find Saw and the pilot defector. The ragtag group is joined by Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang) as the empire completes its secret ultimate weapon.<br/><br/>This is a fan service war movie coming from director Gareth Edwards. I don't know why fan service has such a bad reputation. It's definitely better than fan disservice. This should satisfy any fans of episode four. There are solid actors doing good acting. Mendelsohn does a great job and Felicity Jones is a good lead. K-2SO is probably the best new character. There is an international cast with corresponding accents which will probably annoy certain people. It doesn't bother me but I expect snarky internet comments. The CGI characters recreation is a great idea looking for better execution. The movie does miss the opening crawl. The start feels abrupt without it. There are a couple of dialog speeches that get a little long. Despite the little hiccups, there is plenty of action and an epic third act which should be fun for any fan of the franchise."
"tieman64","Null","14","30","9 January 2017"," Show me on the doll where Mr Lucas touched you
","Directed by Gareth Edwards, ""Rogue One"" is a prequel to George Lucas' ""Star Wars"". It opens on the planet Lah'mu, where little Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) witnesses the apparent murder of her family by the henchmen of a Galactic Empire. Jyn's father is Galen, a weapon's developer. His buddy, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), takes Jyn under his wing.<br/><br/>After its generic opening scenes, ""Rogue One"" flashes forward fifteen years. Here a pilot called Rook defects from the Empire with vital information from Galen, whom Jyn had previously assumed was dead. Galen's information reveals plans of a super weapon known as the Death Star. Rook smuggles this information to Gerrera. Gerrea passes this information on to the Rebel Alliance, who are currently waging a guerrilla war against the Empire. The rebels respond by sending Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) to assassinate Galen. Jyn tags along. Cassian refuses to assassinate Galen, and together he and Jyn instead go to a high-security Imperial facility on the planet Scrif. They hope to infiltrate this facility and beam the Death Star plans to a Rebel fleet in orbit. A big battle ensues.<br/><br/>""Rogue One's"" plot is needlessly convoluted. What should be a swashbuckling tale of plucky Rebels outsmarting Big Bad Wolves is instead filled with dull subplots about abandoned girls, guilty scientists, random space-Asian-force-ninjas, and generic villains who spew cartoonish dialogue in-between an endless parade of establishing shots. A better writer would have jettisoned half this material and constructed a script that moves.<br/><br/>""Rogue One's"" plot was haphazardly cobbled together by boardroom puppets and money men. Its aesthetic is similarly soulless. Like most raised on Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas, Edwards' shtick is to replicate everything he's seen as a kid, before replacing the light-heartedness of his fore-bearers with grunge, emotional distance and a low-key tone. His awful previous films, ""Monsters"" and ""Godzilla"", pretty much play like ""Rogue One"": dull characters running across glum landscapes whilst big CGI objects do explosive but ultimately unthreatening things. ""Rogue One"" itself plays like ""Saving Private Ryan"" meats ""Star Wars"" as directed by a director of joyless pornography, Edwards rolling out yesterday's decor to appease the basest, most unimaginative expectations of an audience desperate for yesterday's murder. George Lucas may be a joke today, but his original trilogy was once weird as hell. In contrast, Edwards' version of ""Star Wars"", a franchise whose mysteries were long killed by millions of video games, books, comics and sequels and prequels, comes out the gate looking like a deflated balloon.<br/><br/>Edwards' cast is no better. Diego Luna is cool as Cassian, but Edwards has mostly obediently assembled a bland band of politically correct faces; the white girl, the Latino, the black guy, the Asian etc etc. This is casting by robots and banks, every decision dictated by spreadsheets and market researchers, all calculated to guarantee maximum demographic penetration. There's no spontaneity, creative decisions or real art here; just machine logic, up and down and all the way around. Lucas' ""Star Wars"" may have been white as hell, but Lando Calrissian, a disco space pimp with a private mining empire and lady-cape, didn't feel like an attempt to court black dollars. Everything in ""Rogue One"", in contrast, reeks of reverse engineering.<br/><br/>""Rogue One's"" first action scene occurs at the 31 minute mark. Here, on a desert planet, Imperial stormtroopers battle rebels. Lasers fly back and forth, but there's no real danger; Edwards' stormtroopers are more inept than usual (a problem in a supposedly ""gritty"" ""Star Wars"" film). The film then climaxes with a half-hour battle on land and in orbit. A replica of Lucas' Battle of Endor, this sequence finds giant Imperial walkers missing everything in sight on land, whilst giant Imperial Star Destroyers miss everything in sight in orbit. And unlike Lucas' climactic battle, Edwards' lacks drama, danger, a cool score, good compositions, intelligent pacing and clean camera work; its mostly a blur of CGI whilst humans attempt to hack into the silliest computing filing cabinet ever conceived. <br/><br/>""Star Wars"" was a weird independent film by a geeky kid who just wanted to make goofy B movies. Today it's only B movies which get A-list budgets, and ""Star Wars"" has not only become the template for virtually all tent-pole movies, but become emblematic of Hollywood's escalating drive to capture dollars and lowest common denominators; ""Star Wars"" as the ultimate Hollywood and so American Success Story.<br/><br/>Ironically, ""Star Wars"" was conceived as a giant middle finger to Uncle Sam. Writing of his franchise, Lucas would say: ""I took concepts I was going to use in a Vietnam War picture, and put them in space. So you essentially have a large technological empire going after a small group of freedom fighters; a small independent country like North Vietnam threatened by gangsters aided by empire. The Empire is like America ten years from now, after Nixonian gangsters assassinated the Emperor and were elevated to power in a rigged election. This 'total control' police state was welcomed by the people, because the Empire created civil disorder by instigating race riots, aiding violent groups and allowing the crime rate to rise."" <br/><br/>But of course the United States has made a career out of imagining itself the injured victim. Indeed, both the nation's Imperialism and national image hinge on it being seen as an underdog. And so somewhere along the line, Lucas' tale of Vietnamese communists and the ""force"" which helps them defeat Western Imperialists and their giant space gonads, got turned upside down. Thus ""Star Wars"" became, not just the ultimate tale of How We See Oursevlves vs The Other, but an altar to Hollywood capitalism itself; big, loud, faceless, endless, soulless, bland, impersonal, pointless, infinitely propagated for the sole purpose of profit, and completely designed by yes men, algorithms, the deluded and those fork-tongued marketing gurus on cell block 1138. And here's another one. And another one. And another one. And another one.<br/><br/>5/10 - Sithspawn."

","Okay where to start.<br/><br/>I will confess I am not a particular fan of the Star Wars movies, I never got ""into them"" as many others have, but never-the-less I found them harmless entertainment. The action moved quickly and generally they were upbeat and vitriolic. Obviously, you can't take them too seriously when you have weapons which can blow up a planet, yet people still fight hand to hand or rather lightsaber to lightsaber combat.<br/><br/>This film tried to add a more serious side to the story. It tried by combining more slow serious scenes with the frivolity of the previous movies and unfortunately it just doesn't work. In fact, instead of giving the film depth it made it a dull, boring and miserable story. There's no fun in the movie and no interest.<br/><br/>The plot is painfully slow, the dialog is boring and doesn't add anything to the story or the depth of the characters. The action is dull and routine and the CGI of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher is terrible! In 2001, Final Fantasy looked more realistic.<br/><br/>The film needs some editing, a number of scene's could have been trimmed or eliminated altogether, to get this down to 100 mins and more watchable.<br/><br/>In the end, you have a fun action movie genre, made in a serious, uninteresting and boring style.

","Don't watch it unless you are a SJW. Totally one dimensional, flat characters. I couldn't care less for any of them. It would be impossible to watch if it wasn't for the good old ""evil"" characters. SJWs spoil everything they touch. Good special effects, not a bad story but an awful, soulless film. It is sad that everything you see from Hollywood now days is multicultural, feminist propaganda. The end of the film was good, probably the only 5 minutes that weren't terribly boring. Sadly, 2.5 hours of my time were lost. Please, don't watch it, especially if you love original Star Wars. Maybe OK for kids, even though I wouldn't want my children to be exposed to such rubbish."
"matheusteixe","4","14","30","19 December 2016"," 'Rogue One' Reviewed: I'm one with the Force. The Force is NOT with me.
","'Rogue One' revolves around Jyn Erso, who abruptly transitions from an apolitical troublemaker to a radical martyr in order to rescue her father, Galen Erso, from the wrathful hands of the underwhelming, Director Orson Krennic and his mediocre death squad of exuberant stormtroopers clad in black armour. Her father had been held hostage by the Galactic Empire until he decided to flee — only to be recaptured and separated from his beloved family— so that his vast knowledge couldn't give rise to an intergalactic genocide.<br/><br/>The plot follows the maelstrom of events that culminated in the discovery of a flaw, deliberately placed by Galen Erso, in the reactor of the Empire's iconically notorious mass-destruction weapon,'The Death Star'. The captive scientist surreptitiously gives away his plans via a hologram message that ties together a group of reckless warriors, who set out to transmit secretive data to Rebel stations.<br/><br/>The dark-drenched atmosphere alludes to a war-stricken soldiery perspective, which is tormented by nefarious acts of violence in the name of the Rebel Alliance; nonetheless, the film breezes past through sentimentality, and only conjures up camaraderie in order to set the tone for a last-ditch effort to frustrate the totalitarian plans of the Galactic Empire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film falls short in forging a strong rapport amongst potentially unique characters, who are devoid of in-depth personality and slowly decays as the plot fails to transport the series to a high standard level of drama and obscurity. The promise of exploring the atrocious angles of George Lucas' vastly picturesque universe is replaced with vacuous elements that simmer in a bland mixture, which hinges upon nostalgia and C.G.I. resurrection.<br/><br/>What first appears to be moulded in unconventional grounds turns out to stumble upon pedestrian territory, teeming with a middle-of-the-road approach, steeped in commonplace traditionalism. Despite its constraints and uninventive spirit, the film throws in a visually stunning palette of colours that transforms a Spielbergerian battle, which takes place in a paradisiacal island, into a psychedelic trance of laser-beams contrasted with evergreen nature and a breathtaking baby-blue sky. Sadly, not even the presence of illustrious characters, such as Darth Vader, was capable of bringing balance to The Force."

It was beautiful to watch, and it raised the bar with regards to the CGI standards within film. For that, I commend it. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the dialogue was hollow, the characters forgettable (aptly), and the acting was OK.

"SeanDTheFilmMaker","4","8","15","1 January 2017"," Its really just a well funded fan film
","If you want an opinion you agree with see it yourself.<br/><br/>But generally these are the few reasons why this movie may disappoint you. The lead cast member(s) are miserable, no fun, wouldn't wanna hang out with them. Lead actress shoots a look all the time like a girl friend who doesn't wanna just break up with you, but brain you with a rock. Cant remember a single characters name cause none of them were really interesting, except the father (weapons designer) and the blind guy. THAT WAS IT. I will say them bringing Deceased characters back into fully performing roles was actually insanely impressive. Those were the good moments of the film.<br/><br/>But Darth Vader, wow wasn't just bad, it was insulting. I think the adrenaline woke me up a little at this cartoonish, poorly scripted, wanna be of Darth. Here is a Tip. Darth Vader doesn't make jokes nor use puns. Its so off putting and ridiculous, I was wondering if James Earl Jones even came back for it, it was that far off.<br/><br/>Finally the score, spoiler alert it wasn't Williams scoring it, but you will find that out instantly. There was even a brief movement that was referenced to the arena scene score in Episode 2. Yeah, it was weird, and jarring, came off and on within one measure, didn't fit with the score before nor after. Right then I was saying, there is no way John scored this.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Disney does what it does best. Forget quality, just produce a product with a few beloved space ships, favorite props, and somewhat of a aligning plot to the original. Almost like they shove it in your face, ""Here watch it, its star wars ain't it, see there is a spaceship on the box!"" And you watch people just gasp and gape and say they love it. I'm like ""You are watching the same thing I am."" And trust me guys I really wanted to love it, I wanted to see more of the star wars universe, something a little different, something cool and unique. Just don't set your expectations at the J.J. level, just think of it as your friend down the street made a cool star wars fan film. It will be OK from there. But it getting a score of 8, only by people who literally love anything star wars...anything...at all...period"

I felt a star wars with Darth Vader has to be good. Nope!<br/><br/>Just another poorly acted dull movie to act as a cash grab!<br/><br/>I think what star wars is lacking is trying to do the same thing over and over again instead of coming up with new and more importantly interesting characters we can love like Han Solo. <br/><br/>Where did all the humour go? Stars wars is much more than effects! Darth Vader should be terrifying, the new robot was so dull, nothing like R2D2."
"splitp-50714","6","8","15","23 December 2016"," Rogue One (2016)
","General Notes: Rogue One was marketed as an action-war film that happens to take place in the Star Wars universe. That is what I was hoping for and for the most part, it delivered.<br/><br/>Positives: I enjoyed a few of the secondary characters. Imperial droid K-2SO stole every scene he was in. He was very snarky and played off the human characters very well. The interplay between blind warrior Chirrut Îmwe and mercenary Baze Malbus was also very well done. The third act of the film was excellent as it really did feel like a war movie. Rogue One is at its best when it is focused on the rebellion against the empire and not on fan service. More on that below. I do like the fact that the Disney took a chance and tried to make a different kind of Star Wars film. The tone is much darker and emphasizes the war aspect of Star Wars. However<br/><br/>Negatives: The character development was lacking. I watched Jyn Erso's story, but I really never liked her as a person. Felicity Jones' performance was flat and uninspiring. This is not what you want from your lead character when they are is supposed to inspire a reluctant rebel alliance. Captain Cassian Ando was basically an ass throughout the first half of the movie, and then he suddenly wasn't. His abrupt change in personality did not work for me. Another reason it was hard to relate to the characters, is the fact that it is almost impossible to identify anyone by name. While watching the movie, one of my favorite side characters was ""the Asian-looking blind martial artist"". It was never Chirrut Îmwe, which is a horrible name by the way. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian are memorable names and roll of the tongue rather easily. Chirrut Îmwe? Baze Malbus? How are you supposed to pronounce those? Plus, I do not ever remember the names being used in the film.<br/><br/>Mixed: I am somewhat torn on the use of Darth Vader in this movie. While it was nice to see him back on the screen, he was not critical to the story and he was a bit of a distraction. Part of the problem was his voice. Although he was again voiced by James Earl Jones, something did not seem quite right. In fact, after the movie, I had to check the Internet to make sure it was really him voicing Vader. This brings me to another problem I had with the movie, excessive and unnecessary fan service. A movie set in the Star Wars universe would be remiss if it did not include some things that we are familiar with. Lightsabers, AT-AT's, dogfights in space, Stormtroopers etc. are welcomed and are somewhat expected. However, Rogue One goes too far by including things that can be found in a more in-depth spoiler filled review. Lastly, I was surprised the in inconsistency of the special effects. There are times, especially early in the film, when the star destroyers look like unpainted models bought from a hobby shop. It just looked a bit unfinished. This was a $200-million-dollar movie. There is no excuse for that. There are few more comments I would like to make, but I do not want to spoil anything for those who have not seen the film.<br/><br/>Overall: Is Rogue One a bad movie? Absolutely not. Is it a good movie? Wellmaybe. At the time of this writing, I am less than 24 hours away from seeing the film. My feelings on Rogue One may change over time and upon a second viewing. For the most part, I found the movie enjoyable, but it had too many flaws for me to give it high marks. I give it a rating of 6."

","As a Star War fan I was very pessimistic about the story-line and character building for Rogue One. A mix of characters from the famous clone wars animated series and some new, I wasn't expecting much. <br/><br/>But the movie had it all, a true star wars Story. Great action, both ground and space fights, politics, humor, glimpses of Vader's powers and the most important of all the force that makes individuals become great through heroic feats and sacrifice. <br/><br/>The character building is strong and very smartly the story writers have placed the events right in sync with the Episode IV of Star Wars. The rebellion heroes Jyn Erso and Captain Cassian portray what all star wars rebel heroes portray, the will to fight for the cause.<br/><br/>Every star wars fan will obviously go see the movie but for every non-fan the movie presents an opportunity to join the fan club of the biggest cult movie in the history of entertainment industry."

","It's not really a bad movie. I think the idea is pretty good, but it was really boring most of the time. It didn't give me the real Star wars feeling either. But I really liked the ending, so thumbs up for this!"
"vinnieboards","9","3","4","3 April 2020"," The best Stars Wars Film of them all - HONEST!
","Oh yes - in my honest opinion, this is THE best Star Wars film of them all. Even better than The Empire Strikes Back, and that is some claim so at least I should attempt to explain myself (I may struggle!).<br/><br/>I stand by opinion 1000%. Up until Rogue One appeared on our screens, The Empire Strikes Back was the go-to movie. Dark, sinister and moody with spectacular set pieces, the film took the Star Wars universe to a different level, focusing on the desperate fight between good and evil (which in essence is what this franchise is all about). Nothing before or since this film has come even close; in comparison, most of the other movies are either a bit tame or just plain dreadful. So watching Rogue One was not an experience where I had the feeling of much hope (but then Rebellions, as they say, are built on hope!) After 2 hours and 13 minutes, I realised that I had not just watched a great Star Wars film - I had watched the best one of all.<br/><br/>Why? OK, here goes.<br/><br/>The Plotline
It's ingenious. How the writers managed to take a line from Mon Mothma in 'A New Hope' and turn it into a 2-hour long film is smart, to say the least. And it works too. The idea of creating a back story focusing on how the plans for the Death Star come into the hands of the Rebel Alliance is a stroke of genius. The story is compelling and introduces an entirely new cast and with one fundamental difference between all Stars Wars films. There is no hope for the main protagonists; there is no happy ending. Here lies true heroism in the face of Imperial annihilation.<br/><br/>The Cast & Characters
One of the difficult hurdles that Rogue One needed to get over was creating characters that the audience could believe in, and the producers achieved this in most parts, flawlessly. It helps that, unlike in previous iterations, the cast of this film act exceptionally well. Felicity Jones (as Jyn) does a fantastic job and at times, delivers a barnstorming performance. Cassian's objectives are shrouded in mystery, and he gives a brooding, tortured performance. Baze (Wen Jiang) and Chirrut (Donnie Yen) are bickering buddies and stellar, triumphant heroes. Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) plays the villain of the piece gloriously over the top. However, the laughs and the stand out performance all come from Alan Tudyk as K-2SO. A literal, caustic and sarcastic droid who delivers his lines with a blunted severity that has you laughing out loud. No gimmicks, no ingenious tech. It is the character aspect that makes K-2SO the best droid of all.<br/><br/>Set Pieces
It's easy to forget how many fabulous set-pieces there are in this film. The most expansive is the battle on and above Scarif, but there are so many more. The fight scenes and destruction of Jedha, the attack on the crystal mining colony. There is, of course, a lot of CGI going on here but it is delivered at such a pace and in such an exhilarating way that it immerses you in the Star War Universe and gives you the box seat.<br/><br/>Bad Bits?
Well, there are some but thankfully very few, and not enough to detract from what is an epic movie. Saw Gerrera is dissapointing which is a surprise considering Forrest Whittakers acting credentials. The film also delivers an astounding piece of CGI and then near the end, an utterly laughable one. I thought Peter Cushing had miraculously come back from the dead or there was a doppelganger in the acting world, for at least for a few seconds. The way the filmmakers did this with CGI was impressive, using a real actor and a voice that sounded very similar. However, Leia's appearance at the end was shockingly bad, totally unconvincing, and one intelligent step too far. It was unnecessary in the scheme of things. Vaders voice didn't work either which is nobody's fault since James Earl Jones is now 89, and his voice has lost that sinister grit. He could have been helped with some better dialogue to be honest. ""Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director"" seemed a bit contrived to me. Not the least bit scary.<br/><br/>Still, Rogue One is an unexpected gem. When compared to all that has gone before, it is better written, better produced, better acted and does one thing that all other Star Wars film failed to do apart from Empire. It makes you care. For me, there are only two Star Wars films worth watching. This one is the most fulfilling although the Battle of Hoth for me is still the standout sequence of any in the entire franchise.<br/><br/>Please take note Disney - originality, competent acting, real drama and not so happy endings make better films rather than the regurgitated nonsense of the Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.<br/><br/>Today's children are intelligent enough to take it."

The overall look and feel i enjoy the most and it overshadows a bit a lack of overall tension - in a positive way.<br/><br/>It may is an advantage that Rogue One did not need to tie into the Skywalker Saga, just being a side story and have an independent story to tell with new characters.<br/><br/>Although i generally did not like the type of ending they choose, it's the perfect and best choice possible and it's also different from any other Star Wars movie."

"Here_2_Review","10","3","4","20 November 2018"," The Best Star Wars film of the 2010s
","Yeah, we can ALL agree that TLJ was a major joke and shame to everything Star Wars. The Force Awakens was okay, but did not spark as a legitimate Star Wars that could be at least on par with the original trilogy, but was entertaining. Rogue One is the greatest well crafted Star Wars film outside the original trilogy from way back in the day! No, it is not about the characters who wield light sabers, so do not expect a lot of saber duels in this film. Expect A LOT of gun fights instead! I know, Sabers are to Star Wars as the whip is to Indiana Jones, or even Iron Man is to Tony Stark, but this film managed to make a lack of sabers make sense. About the characters, they are all FANTASTIC!!!! No, there is not a lot of character development, but that is a sliver of an issue that fades away VERY quickly, because all of these characters really have their shine and it is impossible to dislike any of these characters, well with the exception of a couple of villains. These characters are not even wooden or generic, but feel like people who are worth caring about, and they are. There are a few characters who are more fleshed out than others, but all of these characters are fantastic! Considering this is a movie under Disney, humor is spread throughout this movie, but hits EVERY time! The character who carries his own humor is K-2SO, a reprogrammed android who fights alongside the Rogue One group. He is a very unique android unlike the most known, including C3PO and R2D2. He is an android who acts very human like, even though there is nothing that looks human on him, like Terminator. He looks like a robot, but speaks very much like a human would and has human-like expressions. He steals just about every scene he is in! He is the comic relief of this movie. This is the kind of humor that should be in a SW film, if done right. Rogue One is a very dark and dramatic story that is REAL SW material, believe it or not! I wish more newer SW films were like this! The cgi is fantastic, the story is fantastic, the portrayals are fantastic, the emotions are fantastic, and the battles are fantastic! About Darth Vader, yes he has only 4 min of screen time at least, but he is very crucial to the story. His appearance is nothing short of how menacing he is the original movies in any case. Plus, HIS SCENE!!!!! His scene actually makes the ENTIRE film, even if the rest of the movie was fantastic! That scene, even with the music combine and acting of the rest of the rebels who 'survived' his attack, he shown his darkest moment he has ever had in the SW saga and it was INCREDIBLY chilling, even when he had an objective during that scene that was so simple, and that scene was basically a horror movie moment. This movie, believe it or not, even being under Disney, is a special masterpiece that is very dear to the original SW saga! Forget the meaningless Solo film and sequel trilogy... This movie is also an anthology that actually is a prequel to the first SW, A New Hope, just happening shortly before A New Hope begins. One last thing, I wish the Rogue One team didn't all die, because of how much I love the characters, but it only made sense for that to happen, because...this is a prequel....and obviously they are not in the main saga..."

I didn't grow up on the films, and to be honest, I only watched them for the first time a couple of years ago to prep for Episode VII, and never even got around to watching VI all the way through, but I loved them. IV and V were so amazing, and yes, the prequels had problems (a lot of problems), but I understood their place and what they were trying to do. I adored The Force Awakens, and I went into Rogue One (albeit late) with high, high hopes. And then... Well.<br/><br/>The first few minutes were stunning, impactful, and I was eagerly waiting to be sucked right into the storyline. And then we saw Jyn. And I just felt myself drifting further and further away from what this movie was trying to make me feel.<br/><br/>I didn't care about Cassian, and I cared about Jyn even less. It takes so long for her to show any emotion, any motivation, that by the time that she did... I couldn't connect with it at all. I had no reason to feel anything but a vague shadow of sympathy that she lost so much, but then it was so... distanced. It felt as though it were a story that a friend of a friend told me about this one person that they met once, rather than this person that I'm supposed to empathize with and admire as a hero.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that I disliked all of the characters. My heart hurt for Bodhi, and I fell in love with K2 and Chirrut and Baze, and I thought most of the references to the original movies were wonderful, but the fact that I couldn't connect with the two main characters seriously hurt my appreciation of where the film went.<br/><br/>The climax, I thought, was wonderful. As soon as the battles picked up, it was a bit overwhelmingly hectic, but that to an extent served a point, showing the chaos of what they were trying to do. I did expect the ending, to a degree, and it have an effect on me... But to me the real saving grace was the last five or so minutes, when the connection to the first films became clear. The way that they tied things together, the line of emotional connection that they managed to pull with the assumption that you know what happens, after the film ends? Wonderful. But it just doesn't make up for everything wrong with the first 2+ hours.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie could have been a lot worse. It very nearly was. But it could have been so, so much better, at least in my opinion."
"jtnickelson","9","3","4","21 July 2017"," Some errors, yes, but a Star Wars unlike any other before it
","I've seen this movie several times, in the theater and at home. <br/><br/>This review is mostly to set expectations, and counter the complaints. The idea of the movie is 'Ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things'. This movie is about heroism, at all costs. <br/><br/>The Star Wars bar is so high it's unrealistic, I think each episode appeals in their own way. Yes, they sometimes fall flat but I disagree with others who feel this one did, I thought it was profound. <br/><br/>People have a 'Han Solo'/Vader / Luke Skywalker expectations for character development. I want to to stress that strong character development wasn't necessary for Rogue One. I LOVED this aspect, a 'stand alone' story with finality. We're so used to flashbacks in movies now; revisiting dead characters so often the expectation is now a cliché. Rogue One had plenty of tie ins and FINALLY explained the reason Luke was able to blow up a massive Death Star with one shot (A joke that's festered for 40 years). <br/><br/>The end of the movie AND the lead characters (literally) left me amazed and applauding the choice the creators made. After seeing the movie again, the realization that completing the mission involves their own demise is presented early and without ambiguity. The acceptance of this is fully acknowledged in the last scene. Their demeanor wasn't of shock at all, and their embrace was the mark sealing their known fate. <br/><br/>These quickly forgotten characters set the direction for the entire Star Wars story line, it's an homage to the ''little guy, if it weren't for their sacrifices, this wouldn't have been possible''<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me was all the damn levers, it seems like nothing major happens unless a lever is pulled... watch it again and it will make you laugh. - thanks for your time."
"claudio645","8","3","4","21 May 2017"," A Star Wars Dirty Dozen movie
","Without going into details, this was a refreshing and enjoyable departure from the main Star Wars films. It plays more like a war movie (think The Dirty Dozen, the Guns of Navarone, A Bridge too Far or even The Magnificent 7) than a sci-fi genre movie, especially when compared to the rest of the series. Characters have flaws, things go wrong and no one is truly a hero for most of the film. If you are looking for a fun, well-made action movie with human characters (even the nonhuman ones) placed in a science fiction setting, this is the movie for you. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan, if you enjoyed any of those movies I listed above, you'll enjoy this one."
"JediMichaelCera","6","3","4","18 April 2017"," A good movie, an average Star Wars movie
","This film had a lot of hype which had me thinking it would make up for the rather ""rinse & repeat"" story that was used for episode 7. But I don't think it was as good as episode 7.<br/><br/>I love aerial dogfights & ones in space are even better. So with a title with a homage to Rogue Squadron I was hoping for a lot of spaceship on spaceship action.<br/><br/>Sadly, there was only one big ship fight at the end (which was quite good but nothing better than what's been in other Star Wars films before) & a hit & run strike attack by some X-wings on an Imperial base. Some what lackluster given the title of the film.<br/><br/>Most of the characters were interesting enough but I only felt bad at the death of K-2SO. <br/><br/>However the two lead characters weren't as iconic as I would have hoped. Cassian just felt like a poor mans Han Solo & we were told about how awesome Jyn was & were just expected to like her. It's hard to love a character when you only hear about their actions & all their on screen actions are bland & uninteresting.<br/><br/>The final fight between the Alliance & the Empire had its moments, but it was mostly just duck & cover generic blaster fighting. No one/moment particular stood out.<br/><br/>Vader's appearance at the end was a welcome change of pace & a much needed refresher of just how badass of a character he is. Outside of videogames, we've never seen Vader be so brutal & ruthless in a combat scenario. <br/><br/>But again, this one 20 second scene just reminded me why made Star Wars stands out from all the other generic scifi films there are out there. I'm not saying Star Wars can't have a good story without the force, lightsabers, Jedi, Sith etc. But rather that a story needs great characters for it to be truly memorable & I feel Rogue one did not live up to those standards.<br/><br/>Overall the film was good. But for a Star Wars film I would expect much better."

","Recently Star Wars Universe has become more laid back and entertaining. With younger auditory oriented animation series, Rebels and Clone Wars, and the greatest fan fiction of it all, The Force Awakens, Star Wars seems to loose its burden of tragedy and titanic struggle of few against many. So, Rogue One is an effort to remedy this...Nabooo sunshine with some inferno of Mustafar. <br/><br/>Does it work? Well, what does work is a path well trodden - establishing a likable company of heroes, to become the core of future movies and probably TV series. Felicity Jones is energetic, dark, impulsive and virtually non-stoppable. Diego Luna is absolutely stunning and very charismatic. Donnie Yen is a great addition to Star Wars universe, his role is sadly smaller than it should be but he is definitely an actor and martial artist new Star Wars need. <br/><br/>And thus, the company gathered, and they all together proceed to...And here follows a strange turn of events. You see, true tragedy lies not in numbers but in depth. There are many deaths in this movie. And they all sort of look like...unnecessary. They all happen in period of ...about 20 minutes of movie time and look more like a hasty wrap-up of urgent movie production issues than a coherent movie story.<br/><br/>Agreed, sometimes numbers are in place. In episode III, the massacre of jedies was in tune with the dark storyline, descending into the abyss, but here....it doesn't work. <br/><br/>Jyn Erso's struggle to clear her father's name and to become his legacy of freedom and redemption, aspiring higher and higher up to the top of Scarif tower, is impressive and visually symbolic. <br/><br/>But the sacrifices....however justified by the highest goal and the better good...do not, historically look like the Battle of Iwo Jima, but more like the trenches of World War One..."

","I like to pride myself on not being a fanboy of anything, not even Star Wars, the biggest franchise of all time, featuring one of the greatest and worst film trilogies of all time, both curtesy of George Lucas. So with ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" I tried to stay away from any reviews of this film, so after finally seeing it 4 days after release...I can say that the wait was definitely not well worth it. ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a mostly flat film, from its unmemorable cast of characters to its poorly written script, say whatever you want about ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" being a carbon copy of A New Hope but at least that film introduced some memorable characters, there's NONE in this entire film, Jyn Erso can't hold a candle to Rey, Felicity Jones is a wonderful actor but there's just nothing in her performance, there's one emotional scene between her and a hologram of Mads Mikkelsen where she's trying SO HARD to cry but there's just nothing there, this is a Star Wars film that lacks any real heart, one of the complaints I hear about director Gareth Edwards is that he does not know how to direct actors, and that's pretty evident here, at least in his 2014 ""Godzilla"" reboot you had Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen as an emotional connection, there's none of that in this film, God bless Forest Whitaker but man is he overacting his ass off in this film, and so is Donnie Yen, but at least they're trying, Ben Mendelsohn as our villain of the film is absolutely wasted in this film, his villain is pathetic, he's either yelling at people or acting like a wuss in the film. Gareth Edwards delivers some very well executed action scenes but overall his direction just doesn't fit well with Star Wars, this isn't the Bourne films, this is Star Wars, put down the fricking camera for at least two fricking seconds. If it weren't for the last twenty minutes, I would have NOTHING positive to say about this film, this is STAR WARS we're talking about here. I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson has up his sleeves for Episode 8, hopefully it's much better than this sorry excuse for Star Wars."

Any fan of Star Wars I think will be happy with rogue one, I thought it was good how they used technology to use old characters from the original trilogy and it didn't look too bad either. Also really thought the way they used Darth Vader in the film was just right the scene near the end where he starts taking out rebels was great made him look even more scary then his reputation is now. It's left me wanting more I've already started counting down the days to the next Star Wars movie and I'm hoping they decide to make more spin off movies as long as they are as good as this one."
"gyanbann","5","12","25","17 December 2016"," Star Wars Rogue One - A View
","You know some people watch Star Wars for the stunning special effects, and some watch it for the characters and their journey lines. Combining these elements you have an epic story-line and the movie goes on to become a cult.<br/><br/>I liked loved revered, the original trilogy for the underlying narrative. Think of binary, 1 and 0. Darkness and light.  Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker.The characters fit in so beautifully. Each so well defined, with a history, and a complexity ,that made this out of the world experience so real.<br/><br/>The darkness of Lord Vader's character accentuated by the restraint,mysticism and gravitas of his personality. It underscores someone with deep knowledge and mastery, a powerful adversary.<br/><br/>On the other side was Luke, the young apprentice. Like a caterpillar waiting to transform. The self limiting doubts, vulnerability and the inability to realize his true potential ,represented hope against the darkness.<br/><br/>And somewhere in between you had a powerful character Yoda representing the wisdom that comes from experience.Ob1 and other similar characters balanced the narrative brilliantly, each playing a part to move the narrative forward.<br/><br/>The underlying story line was so ahead of its times, that I sometimes wonder if George Lucas had a vision or access to some alien classified files? The visualization was so complete and ahead of its time that it still holds relevant today.<br/><br/>The fight between logic and faith. The fight between process and will power. The fight between light and the dark. It continues to this day. So when I see the sequels, I see no such underlying narrative, but just another sci-fi – flick with special effects packed in.<br/><br/>Star Wars was as much for kids as it was for adults. Rogue One seems it has forgotten to address the latter. So what is the solution ? I am going to be biased here and say, it needs a George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and a James Cameron to sit together to develop a strong script and then one of them directs it. I know its an outrageous thought. But that seems to me the only way the magic of  Star-Wars can be resurrected.<br/><br/>Let the force come back strong.<br/><br/>GB."

","I know that not proclaiming love-- nay, *adoration* for Star Wars will upset people reading this review. People are alarmingly reverential about Star Wars, and critiquing it will net you surprising levels of hostility. When I came to IMDb to write this review this evening, look at the front page user review that greeted me:<br/><br/>""I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now. 14 December 2016 | by dorteel (Aalborg) – See all my reviews""<br/><br/>Wow-- ""void left my heart."" I wouldn't say that I have a ""void"" so much, but if I ever feel like something's missing, I fill it with work, relationships, people, and reading. But this guy chooses Star Wars. So: is Star Wars really that good? <br/><br/>Answer: no. No, no, no. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a muddled and overlong special effects show filled with thin characters with thinner attempts at characterization. Riz Ahmed's character wears a pair of goggles strapped to his forehead for the entirety of the movie, even after he leaves the desert where he's first introduced. He's a character with no personality, so they try to conceal this by giving him a costume. It's like that goateed, fedora-wearing guy you sometimes see at comic book shops. He thinks wearing something weird on his head somehow gives him personality. He thinks he should be a character in a movie, not a person. He also wonders why, deep down, things from childhood don't really make him happy now like they used to.<br/><br/>The whole production is just lifeless, bland, boring, and borrowed. There are multiple pull-away shots of busy hangers featuring people reloading ships and such-- I've seen sequences like these done much better in Pacific Rim, a movie I recommend over this one. There are also multiple scenes of the players walking through crowded market streets, but all I see during these moments are actors in masks and baggy costumes. The ""troll market"" scene from Hellboy 2 did this better as well.<br/><br/>I keep on scratching my head, wondering about Star Wars' appeal, and the answer is depressing. This generation of Americans has been infantilized. George Lucas, creator of Star Wars himself, has stated that Star Wars is for children: he's very right. What's scary is that media created for children, like superheroes and Star Wars, is enjoyed mostly by grown, 30+ men. Ask a Star Wars fan anything about the SW universe and they'll surprise you with names, dates, locations, and enough information to flesh out an entire wiki. Then ask them something like, say, who the first five US presidents were, why Hamlet can be considered a villain, or how a telephone works, and they'll fall completely silent. What's even scarier is that both Star Wars and Marvel are owned by a single corporation: Disney. Is a slave a slave if he doesn't know he's a slave?"

"WooderIce64","9","4","6","3 December 2018"," Best New Star Wars Movie
","The idea of the Star Wars series making movies outside of the main story was questionable at first, given the sheer amount they could explore, and how that would tie in to the main story. If they're all as good as Rogue One, then they're good to go. It follows the story of the Rebellion, and how they came to acquire the Death Star plans, which was the central conflict of the original 1977 Star Wars movie. While it may seem unnecessary to explain that, it does it well enough to keep us interested with a new set of characters, some mysteries explained, and some absolutely fantastic action.<br/><br/>There's a whole new set of characters. The main character is Jyn Erso, the daughter of the architect of the Death Star. She's not the type to get involved in the war, or to really care about it, at least at the start of the movie. She's joined by a gang of new characters, the best of which is Chirrut. Chirrut is played by Donnie Yen, popular Chinese movie star. He may or may not be Force sensitive, but he's an excellent fighter and a very wise man. The other major character is Captain Andor, the morally ambiguous leader of the group. However, it's impossible to talk about Rogue One without the ending. Everyone dies. Every single member of that crew dies. Not even K2-SO, the comic relief droid, is safe. While that may put a lot of people off, it was necessary. It avoids the giant plothole of not having them in the Originals.<br/><br/>It's very different from most of the Star Wars movies for a host of different reasons. The first, and most notable, is that there is very little usage of the Force. The Force is at the center of the main conflicts in the core Star Wars series, Originals, Prequels, and Sequels alike. Despite the lack of the Force, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. This is, however, owed to the fact that several classic characters and vehicles return. The other notable difference is that it's the most violent movie in the series, bar none. There's no question about it. While the main Star Wars series has all sorts of Science Fiction violence, Rogue One felt more like a straight up war movie set in the Star Wars Galaxy. This is likely due to the presence of familiar weapons and ships.<br/><br/>There's no denying that Darth Vader is the best thing about the movie. He's the reason a lot of people saw this movie. For anyone who didn't see the Originals in theaters, this was the chance to see Vader on the big screen. He only has two scenes, one with Krennic, and then ""the scene."" The scene is the ultimate fanboy moment; watching Vader rampage through a hall of Rebel soldiers. The other nostalgic callbacks are welcome. Since it's set just before the Originals begin, you have the TIE Fighters, the X-Wings, the Star Destroyers, and of course, the Death Star. The Death Star was so cool. The best shot in the whole movie was the one where it forms an eclipse over Jedha. The Battle of Scarif is, dare I say, the best space battle in the entire series. The battle on the ground was very well done too. Seeing the Rebels and the Empire clash on the big screen again was a great experience, especially for those of who were born after the Originals came out. The cameos are awesome. It's an excellent addition to the Star Wars canon, and I'd say it'll be the best of the spin-offs for quite a long time."
"verminhater","8","4","6","3 April 2017"," Why wasn't ""The Force Awakens"" done this well?
","Disney made a complete pigs ear of their first attempt at Star Wars so it comes as a massive surprise to find they've done so much better with this prequel. Given the lead times from shooting to finished film it can't have been the public criticism of the first. I must therefore assume that someone at Disney knew they were selling rubbish and had the clout to correct it for the second effort. Well done that man / woman or committee.<br/><br/>This is everything that the first one wasn't. The clichés were dropped, the tie in to the original films was (largely) dropped. They bothered to include a decent story without a pointless comic relief character like Finn. This is aimed squarely at an adult audience unlike Awakens with the baddies behaving like true baddies and not some 10 year old's idea of them.<br/><br/>The only real fault was with the cgi in resurrecting actors from the grave or their youth. It's still obviously cgi and I'd rather see a look-a-like actor or actress doing the job than a cartoon character.<br/><br/>I'll finish with a couple of points I'd like to whine over and they're both of a rather inconsequential nature.<br/><br/>1. Why is storm trooper's armour not stick proof? 2. Why does Hollywood insist on an English accent (you know that really posh one that all British actors and actresses have to adopt to get work in Hollywood) that comes from just a small percentage of the accents we have?"

","I have seldom been so disappointed by a Star Wars movie. I guess, in part, this is due to how much Rogue One had been hyped. Visually, it was everything you might expect from a Star Wars movie. The characters were somewhat better drawn than most films in this series. Where it really let down was in the editing. In my opinion, no movie better illustrates the impact that editing has on a film. The editing here was analogous to having the perfect flowers and a beautiful vase, and putting them together blooms down. It just bogged down in long stretches of tedium in between short bursts of brilliance. I would gladly watch it again, if it were cut down to 90 minutes by a talented editor."
"bob the moo","Null","4","6","29 March 2017"," The action and nostalgia help cover a weak narrative and under-developed/used characters (SPOILERS)
","The power of the Star Wars brand is significant to say the least, and it is this that carries this film, although to say it does it alone is to do it a disservice – although it is a prequel to the original trilogy, this is not 'the' prequels in terms of quality. Unlike those films, this one gets the action and impact right. It has been said it has been made for adult, and it has in so much that it is not aimed at children – although those are not the same thing.<br/><br/>The plot dovetails into the original film nicely. There is a lot of nostalgic pleasure to be had seeing the various links to the original film, and there are plenty of direct references as well as 'easter eggs' in there to be had. This is different from the plot being good though, because mostly it isn't great. The action and movement covers for it, but mostly it seems to be a bit contrived in making scenes happen, and it doesn't really produce an organic feel to the end. In terms of tone it does have a good 'war movie' element – and the fact that pretty much everyone in it dies adds to this, but yet it didn't feel as dark as the content suggested.<br/><br/>Partly this is down to the plot not being as compelling or tight as it could have been, but it is also down to the characters not really winning me over. In some cases this is because they feel really undeveloped (Jyn, Andor) or just underused (almost everyone else). The action is great, and has plenty of effects while still managing to stay out of 'cartoonish' territory. The recreation of characters from the original film is also impressive – still ever so slightly 'uncanny valley' but impressive nonetheless. Credit to the sets, costumes, and casting too – it really has the look and feel of the original film; not just in the recreation of the sets, but in smaller things like the abundance of British actors (and in particular the use of generally older British men in the Empire's crews).<br/><br/>I did enjoy Rogue One for what it was, however at the same time I know that the nostalgia, branding, and big budget action did a lot to keep me entertained, even while the writing, characters, and narrative were all short of what they could have been. It is much better than the other prequels, but it is certainly not the Empire equivalent that some claim."

","It takes a pair of Death Star-sized balls to release a Star Wars prequel at this point. Gareth Edwards, director of 2014's Godzilla, did it. He has this got-to-know curiosity that the most hard-core Star Wars fans have always had. And he rewards us with a thrilling adventure that's every bit as satisfying as The Force Awakens. The thing that has always made George Lucas' ""Galaxy Far Far Away"" so unique is its richness. Every character, every planet, every plot line and technical spec seems to have been considered. It is a thoroughly imagined universe, full of tiny details and arcane backstories. There are no answerable questions just untold tales - and unmade movies. <br/><br/>This first stand stand-alone chapter in the franchise is set just before the original Star Wars ""Episode IV: A New Hope"". Of course, that was our introduction - our gateway - to Lucas' world of Wookies, droids, rebel heroes and imperial villains. But the thing about that movie was, more you watched it, more questions it raised. How did Princess Leia come to possess the plans of the Death Star? Where did they come from? And that one tiny missing puzzle is the entire narrative of this new instalment. <br/><br/>This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we all know by heart. As in The Force Awakens, Rogue One screenwriter's centre on a female warrior, driven by destiny to take on the mightiest power in the galaxy. In fact, this film is ultimately Jyn's story, she is a fierce fighter, a rallying leader and the kind of role model any movie-going parent would want to expose their daughters and sons to. Felicity Jones plays this character with warmth and turns her into more than just a chest piece. She makes her human. Plus, alongside Jyn there is a droid named K-2SO, who is a more useful, resourceful and sarcastic than C-3PO. Beautifully designed and voiced with wit and exquisite timing by Alan Tudyk. He is the most useful of Jyn's cohort, as well as the most entertaining. However - and I can't believe that I am actually writing that - the film might lack a strong and charismatic male character (such as Han Solo or John Boyega's Finn) to balance and supply Jyn with a sparring partner. <br/><br/>Though, the jaw-dropping resurrection of the late and singular British actor, Peter Cushing, who played the role of Grand Moff Tarkin, the Imperial leader first seen in 1977's original. Cushing, who died in 1994 at age 81, pops up here with matter-of-fact naturalness and complete credibility, playing the same character he did before with fresh dialogue. It is the art of CGI taken to new and perfected lengths and it has to be said that this actor dead now for more than 20 years, give a better performance than some other actors in the cast. More importantly, the Dark Lord of the Sith's appearance is more impactful than ever. Undoubtedly contributing a couple of entries to future Best Vader Moments lists and finally answering the question ""Who would choose to live in a fortress with a lava waterfall?"". <br/><br/>Shot on a more spontaneous-feeling manner than his predecessors, it keeps the energy high and both the actors and the audience on their toes. Edwards builds up to a gigantic third act showdown. Moreover, Rogue One is loaded with allusions to other films in the franchise, without ever relying on them too much. It is fun, but the risk is to make it too elaborate and complex-to-the-point of confusing space opera, which will only appeal to the already converted. This film has undertaken extensive and very publicised reshooting and you can tell sometimes. Lastly, younger generation might be bored, confused, or both. But for the original generation of Star Wars fans who were not sure what to make of episodes one, two and three, Rogue One is the prequel they always wanted. <br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a Star Wars film, yes. And it feels epic. But what it really is at its core is an Ocean's 11 in space. It perfectly connects events we already know by heart with ones we never even considered. Mix that with loads of actions, great effects, good comic relief and stunning locations, you get a perfectly entertaining movie."

","This is the type of movie I was hoping the 1999-2005 prequels would be. The story is tight, the drama is visceral, and the characters have a vividness that was lacking (or replaced caricature) in the other prequels. It is the best Star Wars movie since Empire. The third act alone was worth the price of admission. I wish I could have seen my face during the last five minutes of the film -- I'm sure I was bug- eyed and my jaw was nearly on the floor. Yes, there were a few campy moments -- a VERY few -- but the saccharine tone of the trailers was absent in the final cut. This was the most gritty, tragic, hard-to- watch-but-can't-take-your-eyes-off-it Star Wars of the whole saga."

","I won't ramble on or try to use big words to demonstrate how much more valid my review is than anyone else's but I had to add to the voices rating this film. I grew up watching the original Star Wars films and they became part of my treasured childhood memories, revisited regularly. I didn't heavily rate any of the new movies - even seeing Han and Chewie popping up in the last film didn't quite match the magic of the older films, and so I expected Rogue One to be in the same vein. I was wrong. Rogue One made me laugh, cry and gasp like an excited kid all over again. Some new characters, sadly in a one time gig, brilliantly developed and a real sense of this film's story standing up in it's own right. LOVED IT and honestly cannot wait to see it again!"
"jelkzul","10","10","20","15 December 2016"," Amazing
","The flow: in episode VII we got a very fast movie where it seemed they didn't take the time to explain, build story and allow the viewer grow emotions for the characters. In this movie there was the fast action and there was the slow rhythm and the combination of them was fantastic.<br/><br/>The CGI: There where two characters that were made with CGI that were really detailed and awesome, but their animations were horrible. There movements were so jerky, artificial, on rails. They failed bad here, and what annoys me most about this is that the models were perfect. but somehow they messed up the animations.<br/><br/>Battle CGI didn't disappoint, though. The battle effects were off the charts. The battle choreography work with the transitions.<br/><br/>One thing I liked very much were the scenery and settings. They were so well built. all the details made them feel so real and inside the universe. <br/><br/>The Acting: top-notch. Not just because the film took care to slow down where it should but also because the actors played so well we really feel what's going on. We understand what goes on their head and heart. It was intense.<br/><br/>These were my main comments on the movie. It worked really well and a I liked the story a lot. I didn't miss the crawl text as it had such a strong intro."
"oppisand","10","10","20","14 December 2016"," A fanboys Favorite!
","I was a 90's teenager and a Star Wars Fanboy; I saw Star Wars the first time ever in South Africa watching it on a crappy TV possibly around about 1992, and it never left me after that, it was all about hope and adventure every Kid's dream. The next 8 years of my life consisted of scraping together meager scraps of information, books, and action figures that revolved around these life changing movies. The reader should note Star Wars memorabilia was as rare as chicken teeth in the early 90's South Africa and the other kids thought I was nuts for loving a movie made in the years they were born. <br/><br/>My entire childhood imagination was based on Star Wars and the wonderful characters it so beautifully portrayed. I daydreamed about the adventures of Boba Fett, Wedge Antilles, and Han Solo; I read intensely into the expanded universe. <br/><br/>I did not mind the prequels as much and actually remember enjoying Phantom Menace for some time. Then I grew up, and Jar Jar Binks became that odd friend from primary school that you did not really want to hang out with in High School anymore. This you felt bad about because you actually had good times as kiddies but social norms dictated you had to move on to fit in and leave Jar Jar to become the outcast in the schoolyard. In the eyes of a child, George Lucas created a masterpiece but then we grew up. <br/><br/>Lucas announced his never again rant, and Star Wars came to an abrupt end with no hope in sight for more Star Wars delights. The Star Wars fanfare was left wanting for what appeared an eternity. Then came Disney and our hope was sprung again, we had hope for new adventures, hope for a new beginning after Jar Jar, hope to learn more about this universe that made our childhoods so delightfully colorful. We were happy for Lucas and his billions; it made us feel better for handing over his sacred reigns to someone else, a different leader, we entrusted our hopes in someone else now. <br/><br/>Throughout 2015 we were teased by amazing trailers of the Force Awakens, we were lured by images of Han, Chewie, and the millennium falcon, it was all so marvelously exciting, even for a 32-year-old ""so-called grownup."" <br/><br/>I remember watching Force Awakens (in Argentina of all places) and loving the first two Acts; I loved Rey, Loved Kylo and loved the promise of the movie, but then by Act 3 I felt like I have been kicked in the Gut, and some schoolyard bully just confiscated my lunch money. I realized Disney pulled a fast one on us, it was such a blatant rehash of A new hope that I felt terribly cheated, and also many other faithful fans. I still have hope, hope that the story of Rey and Kylo will evolve into something memorable, but I was sad, I truly started believing I have become too Old for Star Wars, a sad realization of age and having to grow up. Did the time come for me and others to hand down our light-sabers to the next bright-eyed youngsters, it seemed my generation was left cold in the shadow's? We were being labeled the fanboy haters etc. Maybe we loved Star Wars too much? <br/><br/>As soon as Force Awakens ended, we got hints of Rogue One, and to be honest, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the movie, as I'm not a fan of Gareth Edward's Godzilla, but as the trailers came in and I developed a new hope. Rogue One seemed as if it could actually be good! Last night I watched the Premier of Rogue One in Dubai. I was so careful going into this movie keeping my expectations to a minimum, to the point that I was refusing to let go and enjoy, I was determined not to become too vested into the film. I think I was waiting for a Jar Jar moment, or some terrible dialogue as in the prequels or an overbearing focus on CGI, or a rip off of an older movie. After about 15 minutes I started sitting up in my seat, I started listening, feeling and loving this movie, an hour in I was hoping it would never end! I realized the characters were interesting, the plot something to enjoy and I knew we had a winner on our hands. I started having real hope again; maybe I wasn't too old for Star Wars! I absolutely loved every aspect of this movie, the grittiness, the aliens, the X-wings, Y-wings, the battles the cameo's the CGI characters, everything. I loved the rebel soldiers, the Pilots, the smallest characters, I felt them again they weren't some meaningless CGI character with no soul! . <br/><br/>I had doubts about Donnie Yen or more so Kung Fu in star wars; yet he was fantastic, Diego Luna was my favorite character with his conflicting inner struggles. Felicity Jones is amazing, everyone was wonderful. And Oh Glory Glory then there is the last 5 minutes! Every Star Wars fan will absolute crumble at the end! <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards you sir are a genius and a true fan of this Genre, thank you so much for paying tribute to a generation that so loved and nurtured this franchise long after many have forgotten or could care less. This is the Star Wars we where waiting for, now we have a New Hope. Thank you."

"kaptenvideo-89875","4","11","23","19 December 2016"," The Force is strong with this, or so they say
","I have never truly enjoyed any of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Seen all of them except ""Force Awakens"" – which I tried to watch on a flight and got so bored after about eight minutes that switched to something else. Not that it was badly done. I just couldn't find anything to care about.<br/><br/>But I can dig why many people like or even love the Lucas seminal creation. It's the same reason why many still love Elvis Presley, The Beatles or, say, Frank Sinatra. When the first ""SW"" came out in 1977, it was phenomenal cultural event in a sense that today's cinema lovers can't quite fathom.<br/><br/>The age of blockbuster movies had barely begun, the sci-fi movies in general had never been mass friendly – it was a dry, intellectual or just downright trashy field, and always geek-oriented. And the wider audience had never had a chance to experience such a big-scale, detail-rich, lovingly crafted made up universe. <br/><br/>Sure, the screenplays have always been mediocre. Even ""SW"" creator George Lucas has freely admitted that he was not a good writer. But fans were happy to satisfy with style and quantity because these movies sure do have lot to offer to the eyes: places, characters, action, design, details... <br/><br/>Don't forget that blockbuster movies were still a new thing. The next trilogy, released from 1999 to 2005, never received the same amount of love because people were much more used to screen spectacles than in 1977-1983. They still admired the visuals and Lucas's team's world creating skills. But it just wasn't the same.<br/><br/>And that may be the reason why I never cared about ""SW"". I stepped on Lucas's train so late that I had already my firm beliefs about what good story means. I had seen seen many big screen extravaganzas already and acquired a taste for more depth than usual blockbusters are prepared to offer.<br/><br/>Still, I decided to give ""Rogue One"" a go. The reviewers have already praised the fresh approach where we have a strong female hero and how there's no clear line between good and evil side before and how plays out like a war movie, etc.<br/><br/>But watching it myself, I instantly remembered why I don't care about ""SW"": <br/><br/>* new faces on screen but the same style of wooden acting and dialogue that feels like characters just reciting their lines instead of really talking to each other<br/><br/>* characters have almost zero depth so there's no really argument for being interested in them, if you are not ""SW"" fan which makes you interested already<br/><br/>* I didn't acquire a cohesive sense of time and place, just a series of scenes which don't always connect to a greater whole and often don't even have a proper flow. <br/><br/>* For most of the time, ""Rogue One"" felt like a bunch a short movies that are connected by faces and places. Like a picture book where you have to concentrate only on one or two pages at a time. And many of those pages are not even exciting, maybe due to hammy acting and depthless characters.<br/><br/>* The only part that feels like more than a series of loosely connected scenes is the rebel attack which can really be compared to war movie in its own right.<br/><br/>What I liked about ""Rogue One"" was this female hero everyone's talking about who never plays on the gender card but acts like a soldier on the battlefield as everybody else. And the visuals are cool as always, all these pictoresque places, interesting details, awe-inducing battles. And, of course, the war movie part. And the heartfelt prologue. <br/><br/>So for me, as a person who doesn't swallow ""SW"" hype easily, there is maybe an hour of adventure interesting enough for watching and another hour and ten minutes just enduring and hoping it will not get too boring."

Imperial robots appear to be far superior in combat in just about every possible way and can pilot, do data extractions, etc. Why don't they just use robots? <br/><br/>A much smaller ship could push a star destroyer off it's course and slowly crashing into another one? Can the other star destroyer even move? If a star destroyer can't dodge a slow moving object like that, how would it expect to dodge anything? I guess throwing large rocks (meteor) at one would destroy it, right?<br/><br/>Why would Jyn think it was appropriate to give a pep talk when she was clearly not the leader of the group? <br/><br/>How would a small time criminal know how to use imperial communication tower and why it is not even password protected? Even our phones today have better security.<br/><br/>If the rogue one pilot can use radio to contact the ships outside of shield then why would they need to open the shield gate to transmit death star data files? Radio waves can certainly go through the shield.<br/><br/>If there is a shield can stop physical objects like star fighters then why the death star was not equipped with it? If the shield could stop x-wings getting close to the death star then Luke would not be able to fire the torpedo and destroy the death star, also the torpedo would not be able to go through the shield, right? <br/><br/>I guess kids may enjoy this, but people with basic brain function might think it is just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Other than nostalgia what is the point of this movie?

"yordance","6","7","13","12 January 2017"," Better than The Force Awakens
","Last year's disaster of a Star Wars movie (TFA) left me angry and disappointed. I thought I would never like any of the new films. Rogue One is not great but I generally enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>I cannot help but drawing a parallel between both. Rogue One is done with a different twist: it is more like a good war drama, rather than being a western-style sci-fi picture. What I find annoying about it is the choice of Diego Luna for the main character. While he is a fine actor, I am not sure who decided that he could be a convincing bad ass member of the Rebellion. He was equally as ridiculous as Adam Driver playing Kylo Ren in TFA. The rest of the cast did a good job. Felicity Jones was much better than the actress (or is she a female soccer goalkeeper?) playing Rey in the previously released movie.<br/><br/>The other parts that could have been done better: the dialog (and monologues for that matter). Too much explaining of what is happening and why, instead of showing it. This is a movie after all, not a radio play. And where was The Force? They kept talking about it but it was not given a chance to show itself...The story was quite boring as well but I guess it is not easy to right a good Star Wars script."

There are numerous new characters in this episode, all with their own stories some of them very interesting unfortunately possibly too many characters to develop any affinity with as they feature all to briefly. This is despite the story being quite long and meandering. Enjoyable battle scenes and nice to see the resurgence of the 70s/80s moustache for the fighter pilots. However the lead characters are weak it's difficult to develop any empathy for them or really care what happens to them. Diego Luna......... Why? He has the charisma of a wet rat in this film. Enjoyable as a family film but ultimately disappointing for my 11 year old who usually leaves talking about the best characters or machines or robots. No one is outstanding here actor wise, the characters back stories are undeveloped the stars are the special effect coordinators and designers here."
"quinimdb","5","7","13","19 December 2016"," Rogue One
","Coming off the heels of the light and fun ""The Force Awakens"", ""Rogue One"" is a very different Star Wars film in tone and scale. While there are big battles and big explosions, it's based mostly on one set of characters trying to accomplish one specific mission. The film has a much more muted color palette, and the action sequences are shot like a war film. While I admire the film for trying something new, the characters aren't as enticing as they should be. What is really striking here are the action set-pieces, which are all well directed even if its a bit hard to care about what is happening.<br/><br/>The characters are serviceable as vehicles for the story to take place, but there really isn't much there. The film immediately begins with Jyn Erso's father being taken away from her by the imperial forces as she runs off and is saved by Saw Gerrera, played by Forest Whitaker. It then cuts to the future when Jyn is a loner who will do anything to get by. We basically learn she has a rough past and has been left to her own devices, yet she has a deep love for her father, who she hasn't seen in years. When her father becomes involved with the rebellion, Jyn now has motivation to assist them. While she is a good-enough character, and while she is definitely deeper than the other characters (which isn't saying much), she seems pretty cut and dry. The group of characters that band together don't have good enough chemistry to make them interesting or relatable, and Jyn delivers one absolutely cringe-worthy, corny monologue regarding the rebellion.<br/><br/>The group is made up of a girl with a tragic past who is motivated to join the rebellion by her father, a guy with a (vague) tragic past who joined the rebellion at age 6 and continues to fight because it gives his life purpose, a blind religious guy who knows how to use the force, a big guy who doesn't believe in the force at first, an eccentric pilot, and a robot who's supposed to be comic relief but fails miserably. They're all pretty much caricatures except the first one, who is still quite boring anyway.<br/><br/>The film is held up by its visual design. The movie has absolutely incredible special effects, and it looks maybe even better than ""The Force Awakens"". It contains a perfect mix of CGI and practical effects to where it all blends together seamlessly. The action scenes are well shot and well constructed, such as one scene in which Jyn's father is being interrogated by imperial forces at his base, while Cassian is about to shoot him so he doesn't give away any plans, and Jyn is on the platform and trying to save him, while the rebel attack fleet is coming to blow up that very platform. In this scene, there is a lot going on but I think it was handled rather well. However, it was difficult to tell who was doing what and why during the climax of the film. There were a lot of moments in which a character had to get to one place to push a button, or pull a switch, or plug something in, and while I understood that they were trying to send the Death Star plans to the rebels, I was never sure exactly what significance that button or switch or plug had on the overall goal. Also, many moments during this climax felt forced to get more dramatic effect. Chirrut, the blind guy, and Baze, the big guy, have a moment in which Baze suddenly runs out to Chirrut as he is dying, and they have a heartfelt moment where Baze suddenly starts believing in the force, just, because, I guess. They were polar opposites at the start of the film, yet they have this forced emotional moment, even though the film hadn't really developed their relationship whatsoever. Also, Orson Krennic, the antagonist, has a moment in which he is literally aiming a gun at Jyn, yet he stands there to monologue for a little while, and then listen to her response, even though everything around him is coming down in flames and he has absolutely no reason not to kill her right then. While I'm glad the film had the nerve to literally kill off every main character, which at least gave the characters a sense of vulnerability and tension during the action scenes, the ""war film"" vibe that the film goes for is ruined by moments like these. Also, the last few minutes of the film are inexcusable fan service that have no other reason to be in the film.<br/><br/>While the film and its writing are most definitely flawed, I liked the originality of the film in the ""Star Wars"" franchise, and the visuals and action scenes are pretty impressive overall."

","I just got home from seeing Rogue One, and I must say, it was excellent. I grew up watching the original trilogy and was pleasantly surprised at just how well this fit into the Star Wars saga. The acting was superb, the costumes were outstanding, and there were several moments where I was taken back to my childhood by memories of Episode IV in theaters. This was a bit grittier than the rest of the series, but it also had more to do with the actual rebellion/empire war than with the Skywalker family. There was a real human element to it, with some of the backstory that gets revealed as the plot moves forward, as in, not everyone in the Empire is evil, and not everyone in the Rebel Alliance has pure motives. That being said, the characters have real flaws and real virtues, just like any normal person. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend it, if you have I would say it is worth repeated viewings. All in all, it exceeded my expectations and was thoroughly enjoyable."

Episodes 1, 2 and 3 were focused too much on technical and political things, so I never liked them. The Force Awakens I felt was okay, but my hope for another dark Star Wars film was all but squashed. Out of seven films, I only cared for ESB, so I stood in line to watch Rogue One with my expectations set to the lowest levels. I was pleasantly surprised! Rogue One is dark, serious, and has a sobering conclusion that I found utterly satisfying. This is now my all-time favorite Star Wars film. The lack of many of the familiar Star Wars elements such as the opening Star Wars logo with accompanying text scrawl, or even John William's familiar movie scoring (he does the music in Rogue but it's nothing familiar) made me feel I was watching a fresh, new and improved Star Wars. I loved the movie immensely from start to finish."

I was, and replied, ""I'm sorry. Its boring."" ""I know,"" was his response. That about sums it up. I didn't care about the characters; I did not care if they lived or died or succeeded in their mission--even though going into the movie I knew that they had succeeded. Luke blew up the Death Star about 40 years ago after the Death Star blueprints were stolen. I don't care how they were stolen nor who stole them and neither did my son.

","I do not know what to say. If I say it is a big poop, fans worldwide can get upset on me and is no good to make so many enemies. So, to be wise, I will say that is just a little poop. Just bad scenes of shootings the entire film, with guns which you can see they are made of plastic(Steven Spielberg should have direct). The acting is of second, third and fourth class. Poor Peter Cushing, he came to be ""cloned"" digitally, lack of imagination in casting (I could have done a better role, I'm still alive ...) Star Wars without Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness is not Star Wars, is another film, of lower category. Only Forest Whitaker as usual, shows that he is an actor of big caliber. Neither Ben Mendelsohn and Mads Mikkelsen are not bad, but... Darth Vader does not scare anyone anymore."
"dreamdemon-1","5","9","18","18 December 2016"," It's almost enjoyable
","It's really difficult to put this movie in the Star Wars context. The original movies were groundbreaking scifi for their time and inspired generations (although not enough it seems since we're still lightsabre- less as a civilization).<br/><br/>On one hand, just about all the new Star Wars movies have been made to explain things from the original trilogy. From the need to introduce a physiological explanation for the Force to a nearly enjoyable story-line about how Darth Vader came to be, their downfall was that they didn't bring anything new to the fold.<br/><br/>On the other hand all movies follow the pattern of finding a rag-tag hero who wants nothing to do with the events they are about to be dragged into.<br/><br/>Same thing applies here.<br/><br/>The very first movie told about about the 'high cost' of acquiring the plans, this movie comes to tell us the story behind that, which is what makes it worthwhile, in theory.<br/><br/>I was always curious about that part and from this perspective it's a story that needed to be told. But what I can say ... it's not like this.<br/><br/>The storytelling starts from being schizophrenic and ends up being ridiculous (which opposes just about all the other movies in the sense that the others were mostly linear or spawning side stories in a controlled way).<br/><br/>The movie starts off by throwing the audience in a bunch of related but isolated settings. There's a guy who started of designing the DEath Star but somehow ran away and now they want to being him back (with no explanation as to why he started in the first place and how come he only realized that later, what did he think the big golf-ball in the sky with a death ray was going to be used for?), a spy killing another spy, and pilot being sent off to a paranoid rebellious lunatic.<br/><br/>We follow through the Star Wars pattern where the unlikely hero finds motivation to get involved and up to a grand finale where they nonsensically cram the death of all the main characters.<br/><br/>However, the characters are quite enjoyable. We have a strong female lead, because when you go about Star Wars you don't want balance but rather going around to the other extreme altogether. Felicity Jones does a good job here (we're talking a good sci fi hero, not Golden Globe expectations).<br/><br/>We have an obnoxious assassin/spy who gets his heart melted for no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>We have a sarcastic robot (pretty good one).<br/><br/>We have an overly dramatic and intense Whitaker portrayal (I really don't think that this guy can can be act anything else but dramatic and overly intense). He could do a Vader impersonation though, breathing aid and everything.<br/><br/>We have a lot of people sacrificing themselves left and right (quite happily doing so for someone they just met and of whom their own leadership disapproved of) including an entire fleet. Enough to warrant the name Pyrrhic victory for some plans to find a fault that was always going to be there. But hey, Vader did capture a lot of people alive, enough to find out the location of the rebel base later on.<br/><br/>Of course, we have a totally stupid way of data search (much alike trying to grab plushies out of a box with mechanical grappling hooks) ... quite ironic for a system that uses robots a lot. ALso to note that while the empire stored those plans on something that looks like a hard drive of the 80's, the Alliance only needed something like a mini-disc for the same data.<br/><br/>Finally we have history breaking things, like the guy running with the disc containing the plans around the attacked rebel ship (when the first movie made it clear that the way Vader learned about the plans leak was by intercepting a transmission). Speaking of which, they transmitted the data from the planet to a ship, why didn't they send it to all ships? Or, for that matter, why was there a guy running around with the one disc? Why not make 1000 copies AND transmit the data to all ships? Or directly to the rebellion?).<br/><br/>What's offsetting this? Well, there's all the visual magic done by ILM, then there's Felicity Jones, Madds Mikkelsen and Donnie Yen."
"jonkrancan","6","9","18","17 December 2016"," I expected a new take on Star Wars films, but this your average action flick
","I am a huge fan of Star Wars universe and when I first heard about Rogue One and the amazing lineup of actors - including Mads Mikelsen, Forest Whitaker, Ben Mendelson, Donnie Yen and others, it felt as this movie could be an independent, almost artistic take on Star Wars galaxy.<br/><br/>I know I must be delusional but I strongly believe that this is what the Star Wars in 2016 era needs. A step away from the action, CGI flick into something much more intimate, atmospheric, with much less CGI. To me, Rogue One felt as any other modern comic superhero flick.<br/><br/>I remember Rogue One being advertised as a different take on Star Wars, being a ""war movie"", a movie about small scale warfare and a band of rebels taking on a small operation. But as I watched it, it felt like the last Episode in different clothes. Do we really need two of the same Hollywood blockbuster movies?<br/><br/>As I walked out of the cinema, I thought to myself how awesome it would be if they used half of the budget and actually had Neil Bloomkamp direct this - his sense for tactical and grand sci-fi but placed within a small intimate story of few individuals (think District 9, Chappie, Elysium) would be a perfect fit for a Star Wars spin off film, one that Rogue One was supposed to be. <br/><br/>And I write this only because I felt the whole plot and drive of Rogue One was so lacking. And the actors I had such high hopes for and I absolutely love them, had such small part and such lacking lines in the movie, I do almost feel robbed. <br/><br/>And Donnie Yen - I mean come on, we get one action sequence from him. He had such a potential for a non-Jedi bad ass role in the story but one short fight scene is all we got.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but average at best. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan, you'll like it. And there's some great cameo appearances although they came off a bit cheesy for me. <br/><br/>But I wrote this as I believe Star Wars needs something different. I hope we get it one day. Disney, please give Neil Bloomkamp a new set of Star Wars stories, micro-stories, something set away from the plot of the main movies. Please."
"alex-kalve","9","9","18","15 December 2016"," A great movie about hope and rebellion!
","Going into this movie, I was extremely exited, but vary at the same time. Having purposely stayed away from reviews and spoilers, I didn't quite know what to expect. What I did know, was that I was thrilled and overjoyed with having another Star Wars movie to enjoy.<br/><br/>The film's main story is about the rebellion and their mission to obtain the plans for the ""Death Star"" which we all know is the Empire's super weapon for the film in ""A New Hope"" and through the Star Wars story line. The film opens with Mads Mikkelsen who portrays the main scientist behind the ""Death Star"", Galen Erso, with excellence and he manages to show the quarrels and doubts he has about creating such a devastating weapon for the Empire. The main story though, revolves around Jyn Erso, the daughter of Galen Erso, played extremely well by Felicity Jones, and her transition from a wandering criminal without roots, to a leader in the rebellion's mission to obtain the schematics for the ""Death Star"" which her father, Galen Erso, purposely built with a flaw, which we can later see being exploited in ""A New Hope"".<br/><br/>Big credits to Diego Luna for his portrayal of Captain Cassian Andor and Forest Whitaker as the extremist rebellion character of Saw Gerrera. There was also memorable performances by Donnie Yen (Chirrut Îmwe), Wen Jiang (Baze Malbus) and Ben Mendelsohn as the Empire's Orson Krennic. There was also two extremely nostalgic flashbacks with the CGI characters of Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia, which were so real I almost teared up when I witnessed it (especially since I've seen ""A New Hope"" almost 20-30 times as a youngster). We also get a few scenes with Darth Vader and his mission to obtain the schematics for the ""Death Star"", at the end of the movie, which leads up the opening sequence of ""A New Hope"". The movie had a few scenes with comic relief, especially from Chirrut Îmwe, and the re-pogrammed droid K-2SO (brilliantly voiced by Alan Tudyk), but overall the suspense and drama were the most integral parts of this movie.<br/><br/>All in all the film has everything a Star Wars fan wants, and this movie was more ""human"" in it's portrayal of characters and story line. There are no Jedi's to easily fend off 40-50 storm troopers alone, and even though I at times ""wanted"" Jedi's to appear, the Force is not the main proponent of this story, even if we get glimpse of it at times. The Rebellion and the coming together of the Alliance to obtain the schematics for the ""Death Star"" was really well done, and when the movie was over I immediately wanted to watch ""A New Hope"". There are a lot of critics and fans who wont like this movie, as with ""The Force Awakens"", but make up your own mind and try to be thankful we actually get to see more Star Wars in the future. I for one am thankful and grateful I got to enjoy another Star Wars within a span of 1 year, and I cant WAIT for more to come! 9/10 stars from me!"

"Burnoutsss","7","12","26","15 December 2016"," A movie caught between a director and the studio
","Rogue One is a movie that wishes to tell the story of the Rebellion's darker side, the anti-heroes who don't care who gets caught in the crossfire be it Imperial or Civilian.<br/><br/>The story follows Jyn Erso, the daughter of Galen Erso, the lead scientist who created the Death Star. In a quest to find her father, she learns that Galen left a critical flaw in the Death Star's design. Jyn joins the Rebellion in hopes to fulfilling her father's wishes. <br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards tends to focus more on characters rather than spectacle, as seen in his previous films of Godzilla and Monsters. Here, the reverse happens. While Edwards' mastery of scale is something to behold, the large cast of characters have barely a moment to flesh themselves out. The stand-out is Alan Tudyk's K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial Droid that can't help but say what's on his mind and Donnie Yen's Chirrut, a devout believer in the Force who cannot wield it. <br/><br/>The film reported a number of reshoots and they can't help but stick out. Just when Edwards wants to take an original turn in the Star Wars universe, a surprise cameo or two pops out of nowhere. Just as the film wishes to go darker, K-2SO says a funny one liner. It feels as though Disney is so afraid of fans disliking their film, they go the opposite direction and stuff it full of fan service, regardless of how it relates to the actual plot.<br/><br/>I don't know if Gareth Edwards' original cut of the film would've been any better, but get the feeling there wouldn't be so much tonal clash if it did. Still, the spectacle alone and the effects from ILM make this film something to enjoy in the theater."

I was really confused when I first started watching it, and became even more confused when Vador showed up. Then I put two and two together and realized it's where A New Hope left off. Like seriously, if you're going to keep making these movies, stop flipping back and forth in the time periods. I was really looking forward to the sequel of the last Star Wars, but instead you shove this one out.

","I have only written 2 reviews on IMDb, first was Force Awakens, this is my second one.<br/><br/>I watched Star Wars growing up, and was fascinated by it and greatly influenced me since. Besides the cool special effects, the galactic wars, the lasers, the Force, the light sabers, what really touched me was the philosophy behind the story line. <br/><br/>When I saw Episodes I, II, III, I was a bit disappointed as they seemed to have lost the ""soul"" of later episodes, but I felt that these episodes were acceptable because there was a need to explain what happened prior to A New Hope. Though the first 3 episodes did not have as deep of the philosophy as episodes 4, 5, 6, the dark politics and conspiracies filled the fun. <br/><br/>I watched the reboot of Star Trek and felt great, so when Force Awakens came out, I was so hyped and went to watch it the first day. I was quite disappointed (I wrote a whole review of it on IMDb) because I felt the story was focused on special effect, and did not even have a single line from the movie that I can remember. Unlike episodes 4, 5, 6, there were always many many deep philosophical lines that will make you think about life.<br/><br/>As the whole Star Wars plot heavily revolve around Skywalker family, The Force, and Jedis, it seems almost impossible to have a good Star Wars movie without these basic elements, but Rogue One surprised me.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that the story fills quite perfectly between episodes 3 and 4, there are no Jedis, no training, no deep philosophy! But somehow it is better than Force Awakens simply because it doesn't have these! Reason? Jedis are supposed to be wise, while you follow them in the movies you are supposed to learn certain meaning in life. But since this movie has no Jedis and no learning of the Force, there is no need for deep philosophical lines. It was just a simple but fun galactic war story.<br/><br/>But of course there are SOME things that tells deeper meaning. Like Chirrut (Donnie Yen) kept repeating about the force with him and he is the one with force, but Baze (Wen Jiang) didn't believe in it anymore. Later Baze started believing again when Chirrut died, just like finding your own faith again.<br/><br/>When Darth Vader came out, I was smiling, and when Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia came out, I was WOWed!<br/><br/>Overall I like Rogue One, and I like it more than Force Awakens. I hope JJ Abrams will be able to put more deep meaning and philosophy into the coming Star Wars films. I really like to see similar lines like those awesome lines from episodes 4, 5, 6."

","Although I am not a huge Star Wars fan I did come to enjoy ""the force awakens"" but this movie came to me as a disappointment. The main issue with the film was that there was no character build up and several flaws that really annoyed me throughout the film. Director Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn, was a serious letdown to what I was expecting from the main antagonist of this star wars film. He does literally nothing. He doesn't use any powers, he doesn't shoot any weapon, he literally acts like a dick and orders people to do things. The most important, or memorable part, was when he confronts Darth Vader, which brings me to my second point. Gareth Edwards, director of film, had the chance to bring back the best Star wars villain of all time (Darth Vader) yet we only see him for a few minutes. And let me tell you that if you love star wars for its cool light sabers and forces from hands don't watch this film. there is only one, yes one light saber appearance in the film, and that is at the very end of the film. Now with character build up we are introduced to several new characters, which is quite cool, but don't get to overly attached. Spoiler: they literally spend the boring hour of the movie introducing these characters to you and then at the very end needlessly kill every single one off. They even kill off the hilarious robot! The sad thing about this is that we fans don't really get the chance to get connected to the characters like the characters from the other films because they spend so little time to build on a load of characters, and than a few scenes later, they just kill them off expecting a emotional response from viewers, which did not happen. Now looking at the bright side the visuals and space war scene were impressive and thrilling, but one thing did bring a new aspect to the star wars film. The rebels were not squeaky clean unlike the previous films. This can be seen by the decisions made by Cassian Andor, who in my opinion was a complete dickhead. The decisions he was making throughout the film were stupid and made me kind of dislike his character. Im not going to lie, when he fell down the shaft and hit his head on some beams I was quite happy, although the fall did not kill him.<br/><br/>Brief summary:<br/><br/>+ Visuals were satisfying<br/><br/>+ last hour was quite entertaining and thrilling<br/><br/>+ the good side was more enjoyable than the childish good side from ""the force awakens""<br/><br/>-character build up(Includes all unnecessary deaths of each character)<br/><br/>-how little the dark side did <br/><br/>-how little of Darth Vader is shown <br/><br/>-the CGI of some characters -Major flaws (mainly how a small ship maneuvered a destroyer into another destroyer)"

I mean, yeah, I guess it was an OK idea, but it just seems like one of those fly-by-night episode ideas that writers throw in for a filler episode-- only with excellent effects/visuals and a decent cast and diversity for effect. Every SW now needs a young female as the lead, and seems to just be cashing in on the SW name-dropping and young kids getting sucked into the hype.

"Leofwine_draca","6","6","11","25 June 2017"," Better than The Force Awakens, at least
","As a STAR WARS movie, ROGUE ONE is another mixed-bag affair, thankfully better than the last in the series (THE FORCE AWAKENS) but not exactly what I could term 'great'. I don't think that the overrated Gareth Edwards makes a very good job of the direction, relying on cliché too much (the good guys hitting everything that moves, the bad guys constantly missing) and doing the stupid inter-cutting of fight scenes that result in headaches and a lack of flow. He certainly showed promise with his debut feature MONSTERS, but both this and GODZILLA have been more than a little disappointing.<br/><br/>Unlike THE FORCE AWAKENS, ROGUE ONE is a stand-alone prequel that sets up the events of A NEW HOPE. The bits that tie in to A NEW HOPE are done pretty decently, and I liked the appearance of Dareth Vader (great to have James Earl Jones back once more), a young Princess Leia, and a CGI Peter Cushing, who all add to the flow (a shame Cushing's voice was wrong, though). As for the new cast members, the leads (Diego Luna and Felicity Jones) are bland but the supporting members are better, particularly Alan Tudyk's sarcastic robot and Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen as an ass-kicking tag team of Jedi fighters.<br/><br/>The first hour and a half of this film are slow and stately and more than a little boring, with long stretches of setting up where little happens. The CGI is okay but too much of it looks like CGI. Thankfully, things build to a great beach assault battle sequence at the climax, which is very well achieved and brings some fun and excitement back to the franchise; it's the best scene in a STAR WARS film since RETURN OF THE JEDI."

","Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death Star this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.<br/><br/>As the film opens Imperial forces order scientist Galen Erso, who had been working as a farmer, to return to work on a new project. His wife is killed but his young daughter, Jyn, manages to escape. Fifteen years later news of the new weapon leaks out when an Imperial pilot defects while carrying a message from Galen. The pilot is held by a particularly radical rebel leader Saw Gerrera, the man who had helped save Jyn all those years ago. Jyn has lost contact with him but other rebels want her to help them get to Gerrera and learn the content of the message. Rebel officer Cassian Andor rescues Jyn from Imperial forces and they, along with K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, go to Gerrera. By now the Empire is fully aware that a pilot has defected with a message and they will do anything to stop the rebels using that information. Jyn sees the message and learns that her father built a weakness into the Death Star but to use it the rebels will need to steal the station's blueprints from an Imperial facility. After seeing what the Death Star can do many rebels want to give up but Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, the pilot and a few others decide that they will do what needs to be done whatever the personal cost and so a single stolen Imperial cargo ship, call sign 'Rogue One' sets off to find the plans.<br/><br/>This is what the original prequel films should have been like. It is the darkest 'Star Wars' film to date; for once we see just how oppressive the Empire is; not just when dealing with rebels but as a brutal power of occupation. It also shows that the rebels are willing to do questionable things for what they see as the greater good of their cause. It might be thought there would be less sense of jeopardy as we've known for almost forty years that the rebels get their hands on the Death Star plans however since we haven't seen these characters before there the lingering question of why that might be is it just because they were doing other things or is it because they don't survive?! This question played on my mind throughout the film. As one would expect from a 'Star Wars' film there are plenty of exciting set pieces on a good variety of planets. The central cast are impressive; these include Felicity Jones, whose performance as Jyn I really enjoyed; Diego Luna who brings some believable ambiguity to the role of Cassian; and Alan Tudyk who provides the voice of K-2SO; one of the films best characters. The rest of the cast were pretty impressive too the only thing I was unsure about was the use of CGI to enable the late Peter Cushing to reappear as Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Carrie Fisher to appear as Princess Leia; the effects were pretty good but there was something of the 'uncanny valley' about them. There are plenty of enjoyably nods to the previous films; most notably some brief appearances from familiar characters; I also liked the nod to 'Zatoichi the blind swordsman' in the form of a blind Jedi played by Donnie Yen. I know that not everybody will like this but I really enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to any 'Star Wars' fan."

Prior to that, it's just hopping from one planet to the next.<br/><br/>But these characters aren't all that important, are they? this is another chapter in Disney's Cinematic Expanded Universe, and we're all here to see the lead-up to the original '77 Star Wars. In a way, this is almost more fan-fiction than ""The Force Awakens"" was. Everything's a nod or a reference, and to be honest, that's what's honestly satisfying about all of this; it's played to calculated effect. I got a kick out of seeing Darth Vader, not to mention the Tantive IV; the recycled '77 footage was nice touch; we had James Earl Jones and the red lenses again; and they actually did a decent job ""reanimating"" Peter Cushing.<br/><br/>But are they actually going to do something new with Star Wars or just keep playing on our nostalgia? <br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>Leia didn't fare so well in the CGI department, but given the recent loss, the ending carried an unexpected poignance."

Star destroyers look like plastic models. The past of the foundation of the rebellion is hardly illuminated. Which would have greatly improved the story. Furthermore it is difficult to establish a connection with the characters. Also the music is badly adjusted, since I am usually used by Star Wars better. Only the end (the last 5 minutes) can convince.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Abrams has not been disappointed with Episode VII and has made a worthy succession.

","How describing Rogue One? Could I say it is a bad film? No, certainly not. Before going further and saying how this movie is, I wanted to say that it isn't either a good one. It is a basic film that is on the exact point of winning and losing at the same time. <br/><br/>I am not going to talk about the special effects because I think there is no need. What I would like to talk about first is the characters of the film. <br/><br/>None of them is well developed. We have for example Felicity Jones' character who watches her mother die and is introduced as the main character of the film. Everything she does is because the script asks her to, but at any point she really works like a realistic person and shows how she is. This happens, actually, with all the characters. <br/><br/>We have some cool characters (I mean, a blind samurai!) but as I said, none of them is well developed and they are not credible. They are archetypal. There is one of every type with no good reason, just because they have to be there, and that's all.<br/><br/>Their stories are told one after the other and they try to piece them together. This doesn't work very well as the structure is not well made and some of the sequences have no link with the next. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is not bad. I mean, the worst part of it are its characters, with no charisma. I think the movie is a bit scattered, and there are good moments that aren't well told: they try good dramatic moments, but without interesting characters they can't be good. They could have been ""wow"" if I could have connected with the characters, but I can't when ""x"" character has appeared 3 minutes and is not well introduced. <br/><br/>Let's talk about Darth Vader. <br/><br/>His presentation sequence is very, very poor. Later on, he appears more times and that's when you say ""wow, okay, this is Darth Vader and... this movie is the perfect fan-fic"". This is how I will resume the movie. <br/><br/>I will say also some good things about the movies: the fights are pretty well made. There aren't many cuts in the screen and you see almost all of the movements. This isn't easy to do, actually, and makes the film more fluid. <br/><br/>At least, I can say that this is not the worst movie about Star Wars. Episode II: Attack of the Clones is still the furthest this franchise has gone."

","Who would have thought we would see the day where we would get two Star Wars film within a year of one another? Though Rogue One, given the subtitle of ""A Star Wars Story"" couldn't be more different from The Force Awakens released in 2015. Though it is a prequel to the original 1977 film (""prequel"" being a word likely to strike terror into the heart of even the most casual Star Wars fans after two of the three films in that ill-regarded trilogy), Rogue One couldn't be more different that what has come before in terms of what we've had from the series on the big screen thus far.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that it not quite being what one might expect is a bad thing, quite to the contrary in fact. Unlike The Force Awakens which worked so well in part because of its playing into nostalgia, Rogue One subverts that. To be fair, the entire premise of the film is rooted in the same elements of nostalgia as that film. Instead of taking familiar elements and story beats, Rogue One builds on references (well the entire opening scroll of A New Hope to be fair) to create a prequel to that all important 1977 film, telling the story of the race to steal the plans to the Death Star. That being said, if you're expecting a puff piece though, you're in for a surprise.<br/><br/>Rogue One takes the familiar elements and uses it to tell something bolder. This is a grittier, much more 'lived in' version of the Star Wars universe than certainly I, as something of a casual fan of Star Wars, has been used to seeing. It's a film that explores what it's like to be the rebels fighting on the front line of the struggle against the all power Empire and what it's like for some on the inside of the Empire's biggest weapons project. There are hard choices to be made on both sides, internal power struggles, and people who just want to get on with their lives without getting involved. In a way, Rogue One is a Star Wars take on the Second World War commando genre with teams behind enemy lines trying to sabotage an all important enemy project, albeit one in a science fiction context and with some more depth to it. If you're one of those people like myself slightly put off by the black and white nature of previous Star Wars film, then this is the film for you as puts some much needed shades of gray into the equation along the way. <br/><br/>Yet this is definitely a Star Wars film. One of the most impressive things about this film is how it takes a few details and turns it into a fully formed two hour story that really, if one thinks about it for more than a moment, really exists to fill in a major plot hole from nearly forty years ago. Yet you would likely never think that watching the film as it presents a highly engaging story in its own right. Not only that but there are Easter eggs and references throughout but not enough to alienate anyone who isn't the most die- hard Star Wars fan including a couple of cameos that will likely come as a surprise if they haven't been spoiled for you already. It's a Star Wars story quite unlike any other as a result.<br/><br/>In telling this story, director Gareth Edwards has assembled quite a cast. Felicity Jones cements herself as an up and coming leading lady with her role as Jyn Erso, a role that is at times written all over the place but made all the more effective by Jones' skills as an actress. Diego Luna's rebel intelligence officer fills in the Han Solo role in effect, something Luna does well by bringing a world weariness (or should I say galaxy?) to the part. They are aided by Alan Tudyk in a memorable droid role plus both Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen in interesting supporting roles. Playing the role of chief villain for this film is Ben Mendelsohn as Krennic who while not on the level of a Darth Vadar comes across as a genuine threat due to his position and his experiences dealing with his project. Mads Mikkelsen gets a memorable supporting role here a scientist who plays an all important role in proceedings, one that leaves him conflicted and torn by his experiences plus Forest Whitaker gets a small but pivotal role in proceedings as well in a memorable series of appearances. The supporting cast is solid as well with several Star Wars veterans returning to their roles from other films in the franchise plus some unused footage and some very skillfully done effects work in a couple of cases. The results are solid all around. <br/><br/>It's hard then not to recommend seeing Rogue One. It's an entertaining and engaging piece of science fiction action/adventure that takes one of the most black and white tales out there and not only fills in some details but gives it some much needed shades of gray as well. It's perhaps too different to be the best Star Wars film but it may well be someone's new favorite film from the series and, if nothing else, it finally proves that the words ""Star Wars"" and ""prequel"" might go together after all."
"Paynebyname","6","8","16","22 December 2016"," Okay but I felt uninvolved
","I saw it last night and was a little disappointed. It just felt uninvolving to me.<br/><br/>I had deliberately kept my expectations low but it felt really generic. The K2 character was nowhere near as 'snarky' as I had seen some describe him. Forest Whittaker felt wasted and the destruction scene in Jeddah had that similar Roland Emmerich 2012 'it looks pretty but I'm feeling no tension or any peril'.<br/><br/>On the plus side the last third was good when it felt a lot darker and heroes were having their little death montages. I liked the cleverness of pushing the powerless star destroyer into another and the Vader tunnel scene at the end was easily the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>Jedi's only ever seem to fight with good intentions so to see him employing his 'trade' so aggressively was a real sight to behold. You could feel the terror of the guys that were trapped in the tunnel with him.<br/><br/>Maybe it would be better on a second viewing but the film didn't get my heart racing, it didn't generate an emotional connection and it felt all very tick boxey. There was no laughing in the screening that I saw and I think only one or two moments (powerless destroyer and rampaging Vader) that made me turn to my friends with a wow.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm expecting too much, maybe I've seen too many films but for all the talent that Disney's money could buy I had hoped for something a little more."

","I enjoyed Rogue One significantly more than The Force Awakens! I liked it so much more because it was a notably more balanced film. Rogue One has a great stand alone plot that seamlessly integrated into the Star Wars universe. The characters were great and I bought in almost instantly. Even with the new characters and plot they gave the original trilogy some great background. The writers also went a little easier on the nostalgia this time compared to TFA, which was one of my biggest complaints about Episode 7 (but don't worry there is still plenty to be nostalgic about). Definitely go see it in theaters because the visuals are stunning!"

One of the greatest franchises in the history of cinema with all the money and movie-making resources on planet earth, and the best they have to offer is...what? A mildly snarky drone who vaguely resembles Sheldon Cooper? <br/><br/>Anyway, you know you're going to go see it, so go. Pay your money, sit back and enjoy 1977 all over again.

","I didn't really expect much because of Force Awakens, I just wanted to see some lightsabers. Didn't even get much of that... <br/><br/>It's the same story as A New Hope... seriously. I was rolling my eyes, it's almost identical in plot. I wouldn't have minded that if they actually tried to make any characters, instead they just had bodies on the screen repeating the script. The acting was good and the production value is high, but I just didn't care about anyone. The robot had more character than the living beings. <br/><br/>Not sure why they hate developing characters in movies now, probably because the mindless masses like their special fx and things blowing up. I don't even remember most of the movie because I was so bored and dying to check my cellphone for messages. There's no suspense involved, and the cliché ending probably has people falling all over themselves to get a Darth Vader doll for Christmas. <br/><br/>I liked the FX, I liked the sets, but I don't even know any of the characters names.

"macewindu-2","8","8","16","16 December 2016"," STAR WARS IS BACK after 11 years !
","To be very honest with you, after The Force Awakens, I started losing hope for new STAR WARS movies because it failed to bring the essence and spirit of SW to the screen. It wasn't a continuation of the saga, but a shallow reboot without any depth, substance, mythology or spirituality.<br/><br/>ROGUE ONE however is a different story. I was immediately fully immersed in this gritty somber atmospheric universe, where you feel you are watching a STAR WARS movie. It did capture the spirit and essence of SW. The planets had a great vibe, you felt the oppression of the Empire, the breath of Darth Vader giving you goosebumps. The characters in ROGUE ONE were fantastic and the actors did a great job. They were a diverse group of strong individuals fighting for the same cause and it was inspirational. That's this other thing about SW movies & myths in general that they should speak to your inner hero's journey, inspire you, move you and touch you. ROGUE ONE DID THIS. The soundtrack was very cool, camera was great and special effects were phenomenal. John Knoll is a true VFX master and he really knows his craft. Hats off to him and his team for being able to pull up such amazing shots. Another super cool thing is how brilliantly it expands the story that leads to the beginning of A New Hope. There were also these cool fan service moments that will make you happy but I don't want to reveal anything. But I can say that it's such a shame they did not include Obi-Wan and Yoda in at least one epic scene (communicating through The Force for example). That would be the cherry on top and I'm sure Ewan and Frank Oz would be both very happy to do this.<br/><br/>To sum it up ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY is a gritty version of STAR WARS for a more mature audiences and has a great vibe. In the words of Vader: ""I sense something. A presence of STAR WARS I've not felt since Revenge of the Sith."""
"joshbarton15","8","8","16","16 December 2016"," Not quite a Star Wars great but Rogue One is still mightily impressive
","Bold and brave, just like the set of characters the film follows, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a Star Wars film but not as we know it. Set just before 1977's A New Hope, this doesn't continue the saga, instead going back to show a pivotal moment in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire. <br/><br/>Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is a criminal and daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a weapons designer forced by the Empire to complete their super-weapon, the Death Star, a weapon rumoured to be capable of destroying entire planets in one strike.<br/><br/>With the Empire having such a powerful weapon at their disposal, the Rebel Alliance recruits Jyn to work with a team, led by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), to infiltrate the enemy and steal the design schematics for the Death Star, to aid them in taking down the Empire.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a Star Wars film but that doesn't stop it from being a massive risk. Rogue One has the challenge of being set so close to the fantastic original however, Gareth Edwards does a great job in delivering a film that pays homage to events in the original trilogy while stamping its own fingerprint on the franchise.<br/><br/>This is a war film within the Star Wars franchise and Edwards certainly makes it certainly look and feel like one. The production design is full of dirt and grit, totally missing from the prequel trilogy, and there is some quite wonderful cinematography from Greig Fraser, honing in on the close proximity of war all while still managing to make this feel like a Star Wars film. Like The Force Awakens last year, Rogue One possesses some magnificent shots that I won't be forgetting anytime soon.<br/><br/>The combination of both of these with the special effects certainly make Rogue One such a visual treat. There were two uses of CGI that I absolutely hated and they really did distract me from what was happening in the film, one character getting a lot more screen time than I thought they should have had and the other almost looking as if no work had gone into their appearance.<br/><br/>The writing in Rogue One, in terms of story, allows the film to move at such a brisk pace, leading to an enjoyable experience at the cinema. There are plenty of references to other Star Wars films and it all concludes with a final act that you just have to sit back and applaud. If you have trouble seeing Rogue One as a Star Wars film, this final act will persuade you to change your mind.<br/><br/>I found the the characters to be the one thing that really held this film back from being a great Star Wars film. Jyn is just about the only one who gets any element of character development, meaning it's tough to really root for them all. There is a severe lack of characters for people to fall in love with, unlike the best of the Star Wars films. There is one returning character in Darth Vader, who I was particularly excited to see on the big screen again, and believe me when I say, there is a Vader moment that will make you lose your s**t. It's just amazing.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Rogue One definitely possesses one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a Star Wars film. Felicity Jones truly brings a lot of steel to her good performances as Jyn Erso, Alan Tudyk steals a lot of scenes with his often comedic performance as K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, and Donnie Yen finally gets his chance to shine in a major American blockbuster, taking it with plenty of style too as Chirrut Imwe, a blind warrior.<br/><br/>The other disappointing aspect of Rogue One is it's score, this time composed by Michael Giacchino. John Williams' scores bring a certain kind of magic to the Star Wars films but I just didn't feel that same sense of magic with Giacchino's score here. Disappointing for me when I know Giacchino is such a capable composer.<br/><br/>As a whole, Rogue One is a risk well worth taking for the Star Wars franchise, opting to attempt and deliver a distinctly separate film from the rest of the franchise. It has a few issues holding it back from being great but I will certainly be heading back for repeat viewings."
"customerservice-51779","9","8","16","16 December 2016"," Definitely Star Wars, on steroid.
","Unlike The Force Awakens, which more focus on characters deeply display, I found that Rogue One has defined the Star Wars tone more accurately in RO. Some may call it a bit Nolanish, but the identity and the philosophy of the war between the Empire and Rebels are crystal clear.<br/><br/>Yes indeed the TFA has the continuity and materials for which when we watch it we could say, ""yeah i know this guy, that guy, this thing that thing"" and make we want to know the backstory of main characters and villains. But as a regular, Star Wars novels reader, one can say that for RO, ""omg, Star Wars really should go like this, seriously!!!"", we could give a focus more to the plot and story. As for the acting, contrary from what was seen in the trailer, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsen and Felicity Jones have delivered very solid impressive performance, unexpectedly very remarkable.<br/><br/>And the Vader's final scene for sure is unforgettably very badass pure carnage of massacre. For the novel's fan, this is the movie for us, the battles, the war, the darkside moment, everything in RO is so perfect."
"alainahardie","10","8","16","16 December 2016"," Maybe better than TFA?
","I saw A New Hope in the theatre when I was a kid (ahem, before it was called A New Hope). I've been a Star Wars fan since then, cheerfully suffering through the prequels and being ridiculously excited when The Force Awakens came out.<br/><br/>I was iffy on the idea of the SW universe stories like Rogue One. I don't expect them to be well-executed, but holy hell did they knock it out of the park with this one.<br/><br/>This is not a kid-friendly movie. This is Star Wars for grownups: dark, gritty, intense, with more moral ambiguity than we've come to expect from the light vs dark that George Lucas set up. Other reviewers have pointed out that this movie puts the war in ""Star Wars"", and while I thought it was a corny thing to say, having seen the film I think that's an accurate description. They weren't afraid to kill off characters; in fact, they make Joss Whedon and George R.R. Martin look like amateurs.<br/><br/>Now, that said, I felt like there was more levity than in any previous Star Wars movie, provided especially by Alan Tudyk's (ALAN TUDYK, Y'ALL!) K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial 'droid. I also loved the shout-outs to old Star Wars fans: the scene with bumping into Ponda Baba and Cornelius Evazan (""I have the death sentence on twelve systems""); a nice little cameo by R2 and 3PO; Jimmy Smits reprising his role as Bail Organa; Tarken's back-from-the-dead-incredible-CGI prominence. And at the end they connected it directly to the opening of A New Hope, providing full continuity with the rest of the universe.<br/><br/>I think I liked this better than The Force Awakens, and I like TFA an awful lot. If this is the standard set for the ancillary titles set in the Star Wars universe, my expectations has been raised."
"SpoodermanDerp","10","8","16","16 December 2016"," ""Pure Star Wars Magic""
","Just when you thought Episode IV was always the right film to start if you wanna properly feel the Star Wars experience. Rogue One draws you in with something new, dark, epic and fulfilling, that truly makes the 3 paragraphs in the opening crawl of Episode IV feel like a film we should've seen first.<br/><br/>The film soars in it being appropriately being titled ""A Star Wars Story"". Although some might see that the ""Star Wars"" franchise name it carries will obviously hold the film back and limit it to just setting up for sequels and pausing moments for nostalgia. The film does this naturally and it does not hold back at all with a tone that differs from the usual hopeful text book heroes' journey space opera of the previous films in the franchise. It does not need to set up for an even greater sequel because it merely needs to set up an already beloved franchise that has already had its high and low points. The film also doesn't stop to boast a nostalgic reference, they're there with subtle hints, nods and blends in with the over arching story. Simple nods like showing familiar faces appearing by having them blend in the crowd or be part of the rebel fleet, people playing Dejarik, and even fixing plot holes that have haunted the franchise for years. The film also does even better what ""Force Awakens"" did best, which was the introduction of the new characters, but what Rogue One does special was to not have the sequel do its job for them which is to develop each individual in the same movie. (because obviously the sequel already exists). Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones works perfectly well in a film that aims for a darker tone and with her story directly contrasting Luke's humble beginnings of eventual greatness. Along with Cassian played by Diego Luna, Chirrut (Donnie Yen), Baze (Wen Jiang), Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and Bodhi (Riz Ahmed), they bring a whole new perspective and layer to the rebel alliance which we previously just usually saw from the eyes of our protagonists like Luke, Leia, and Hans. The film does a great job capturing themes of extremism, internal struggle within the alliance and how under powered they felt during the creation of the Death Star. They also capture a whole lot more context with what goes on within the Empire with Orson Krennic, Ben Mendhelson's character. Starting off as sort of a ""Hans Landa"" esque type of villain, his character highlights the flaws of the Empire and their eventual downfall. Also who could forget K-2SO voiced by Alan Tudyk who carries the comic relief and probably the best jokes along with Donnie Yen's character. But probably one of the strongest part about the film is how much it strayed away from usual Star Wars clichés and generating a feel like no other. Sure, probably the biggest flaw of this film is the first few parts which starts off slow and sort of inorganically introduces and sets up each character, but as the film progresses, it evolves the characters through emotional and dramatic moments delivered astoundingly by its lead actors. Every time the film delivers a climax, they are filled with strong emotions that were properly set up and developed before hand and this pays off incredibly well in the last 15 minutes of the film (more on that later). The cinematography and scale this film delivers is also off the charts and is probably THE strongest part of the film if not the latter. Gareth Edwards who also directed Godzilla (2014), is an absolute genius in creating massive set pieces and making your jaw drop in each establishing shot. Each shot drips of the epicness Star Wars created a legacy on, each shot feels like a film that definitely comes before a 1977 film, each shot has subtle nuances that make it even richer in detail. Along with the beautiful cinematography also came the fluid action scenes that were well paced and directed. The last 15 minutes of this film will absolutely leave you in awe, bring you to the edge of your seat and even make you cry because of euphoria. Gareth Edwards absolutely needs to direct every action scene, whether in space, on the ground or hand to hand combat, his style is what Star Wars needs to elevate their game. <br/><br/>In the end, the pay offs that this film will give you both as a Star Wars fan or even a casual fan are complete pure movie magic. Having not been born during the original trilogy or experiencing them in the theaters in the 70s-80s, I think this film is the closest I can have to having that inexplicable feeling of joy, wonder, excitement and refreshment this franchise has YET to offer. <br/><br/>Verdict: 9.7/10"

","With this movie not being an episode and being a Star Wars nerd I was worried as to how well this film would turn out. I really need not have feared, the film was amazing. Captivating throughout with tense moments, which I thought was impressive given we know the outcome (A New Hope). The last sequences for me was the outstanding highlight of the film, not only do we have Darth Vader showing how he would kill a load of rebels in battle, but we also have the return of Leia! This film is amazing. Top marks to Disney. Additionally the return of Grand Moff Tarkin and the lack of the Emperor was a very good decision, the cameo of R2 and C3PO was enough to bring a grin and brief enough to be just perfect.

","I think a lot of these 10 star reviews are from people who are still feeling the 'exhilaration' from just leaving the theater. If you let the novelty wear off, I don't think you'd see as many 10 star reviews. <br/><br/>Assuming Empire Strikes Back is 10 stars and Phantom Menace is 1 star, this movie is a solid 5 stars. I'm a Star Wars mega fan; I've been watching the movies since I was a kid and I can go on for hours about parsecs, kyber crystals, and Chewbacca's home planet. Now, the movie wasn't bad, far from it -- in fact, I applaud Disney for making a gritty, dark film after the kid-friendly 'The Force Awakens'. <br/><br/>The problem is that there's no Star Wars magic until the end of the movie. When I saw the 'A long time ago ...' come up on screen, I got ready for the yellow screen crawl and the John Williams 'da da da dahhh' -- but I got nothing but some CGI planets. That's when I knew things were going to be very different. <br/><br/>You got about an hour of setting up the characters and the backstory and, honestly, I was kind of bored. You don't know any of these characters and they have ridiculous names so, unless you're taking notes, it's hard to understand who/what they are talking about.<br/><br/>As a Star Wars fan, I'll admit it was nice seeing Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia on the big screen again. The problem is the way it was done -- slapping CGI faces on live actors. CGI has a LONG way to go before it can trick the human eye. Tarkin's CGI was so distracting I don't think I even heard what he was saying -- I just kept staring at his unconvincing face and thinking 'no they didn't'. The ending of the movie was great except for CGI Carrie Fisher -- they could have kept her back toward the camera or done something with a reflection in a window, but no they show us a huge, full screen shot of her poorly computer generated face.<br/><br/>Lightsabers. Star Wars movies need light sabers. Yes, there is one in the movie for about 30 seconds -- and it's an AWESOME 30 seconds. Yeah I understand there are no Jedi in the movie (and only one Sith) and that limits what you can do with the light sabers. Why not give the blind guy a lightsaber instead of a stick?<br/><br/>Speaking of the blind guy, I think he was the only memorable character in the movie. Everyone else was pretty bland. Forest Whitaker's character seemed to have potential in the trailers but he doesn't have much of a role in the actual movie and we really learn nothing about him (why was he protecting Jyn? why did he have mismatched metal legs?). Jyn was decent as well -- I find her less irritating than Rey and can respect her for sacrificing her life for the sake of the rebellion. The new droid was trying way to hard to be the next C3PO with his constant stream of witty sayings. Make him darker, more robotic and he would have fit in better with the rest of the movie (again, I respect the way he went out). <br/><br/>We need to talk about Jimmy Smits -- I don't understand why this guy keeps appearing in Star Wars. I assume he has some nasty pictures of George Lucas, that's the only logical explanation. I suppose they were using him to tie this movie into the prequels, but no one cares about his character and all it does is remind people of the awful prequel trilogy. The part where he says he's going to Alderaan to send Princess Leia is cringe worthy and not needed.<br/><br/>Now, I will say when they go to the Imperial Base in Key West, I started enjoying the movie immensely. This last 30 minutes or so the movie started to actually feel like Star Wars, The X-Wings blasting the crap of the AT-ATs, the blind guy using the force to reach the control panel, the Star Destroyers crashing into one another and then knocking out the gate- - this was AWESOME. And the scene where Darth Vader turns on his light saber and starts killing everyone with the force -- A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. It's hard to believe the people who made the last half hour of the movie made the other 90 minutes. Speaking of Darth Vader, he's got maybe two minutes of screen time but he's extremely evil in his brief appearances. I like the red tint they added to his eyes--you can feel the hate flowing through him. Seeing him mercilessly go after the Death Star plans is incredible and really makes guys like me feel the nostalgia -- knowing he's going to be breaking through the door of the Tantive IV shortly and 'start' the movies we know and love is chilling.<br/><br/>I usually see Star Wars movies multiple times in the theater. Yes, I'll probably go back to Rogue One one more time to see the ending, but I'll be sleeping for the first hour and a half."

This was a film made for the hardcore fans, the fans that read the books and watch the TV shows, the fans who even like the prequels because it's more Star Wars, the fans that dissect everything just to get the most minute details. Everything fans of Star Wars love is in this film. Great characters, strange worlds with amazing creatures, intense battles, deep emotional pulls, and wonderful jokes. There are lots of new faces and some old ones too, but it all feels cohesive and like it was always this way. It's almost like they dug this out of the archives at Lucas Films it fits in so well with everything we already know of this galaxy far far away. It grows the universe as well, everything I saw made me want to know more, what's that guys story, what's that guys story, what's that guys story. The camera work and effects were some of the best I've seen and the re-shoots were almost un-noticeable. This film was so much fun, and left me wanting more. It is a great time to be a Star Wars fan.

","Rating 8.0, A Great STAR WARS Spin-Off<br/><br/>* Rogue One a Star Wars Story is another fresh take on the franchise bridging the gaps between my two favorite Star Wars movies Revenge Of The Sith and A New Hope, however when I first found at that director Gareth Edwards, who created the second disappointing Godzilla movie, I lost all hope, but god damn the movie was good! Indeed it has flaws scattered across the galaxy but its strengths outweighed them at every turn. It felt like a great blend of the prequels and the original trilogy, able to please Mr. Lucas and myself.<br/><br/>* Characters: Jyn Erso: Felicity Jones shines with emotion as our protagonist on a an adventure of redemption and connection, being the spark of hope in the movie really lightens the dark pitch all the way through the movie.<br/><br/>K-2S0: But the really star here is Alan Tudyk, seriously someone give this guy a medal, he deserves it, as Star Wars goes on the droids just become better and better. Playing a reprogrammed imperial droid with a hilarious sense of humour really fills the crew and crowd with joy!<br/><br/>Orsan Krennic: Another great thing about Star Wars is its ability to produce amazing antagonists , and Krennic was another one of these, although selfish and intimidating at times whats really great about is blind devotion to peace through tyranny, something we haven't often seen in the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Chirrup Îmwe: We might now have any Jedi in the movie, but Donnie Yen's character who has a great connection with the force is indeed an interesting one, not to mention its great to see a diversity in the casting of this movie, finally received our first two Asian actors in a Star Wars story. That being said this is were most of the 'good characters' end.<br/><br/>Baze Malbus and Bodhi Rook: While not necessarily bad characters they were seriously under developed and felt forced into the battle. Not to mention being the forced the name Rogue One named by Rook himself was just battled out, it doesn't feel powerful or motivating at all.<br/><br/>Captain Andor: While Diego Luna is a talented actor his character; being a rebellion hero and captain and all, is literally just a dick, i understand that in conflict people change and times are tough but it feels so negative like Jyn says, ""you may as well be a storm-trooper!"" -great line BTW. I guess it does make it feel realistic thou.<br/><br/>Saw Gerrera: This however really agitated me, while Forest himself is a decent actor, he ruined a great character from the clone wars. He felt so forced in! He did jack all, even if he is old! The voice he used was so cringe! And he honestly was executed poorly. Im sorry but his character was rather pointless and the movie would have been great without him, its pretty much what lost this movie the 8/10!<br/><br/>Darth Vader & The Cameos: Whats also rather satisfying in Rogue One is the numerous character cameos through out, some unexpected and some rather moving. It was great to see Bail Organa and Tarkin riding the gaps between both sides of the conflict! But enough chat, its Vader you want to hear about. While the dark lord is barely in it, he steals and owns every scene he's in! Not to mention we are rewarded with the greatest scene of Darth Vader in action! I was about to jump out of my seat!<br/><br/>*Plot & Design: Okay so basically we have a story off redemption and rescue, Jyn the daughter of the man who created the Death Star and he designs the weakness and all in Episode 4. If your a Star Wars fan we already know this, yet director Edwards is still able to produce a compelling story of surprises despite knowing the outcome. But the best thing about this Star Wars movie that separates it from the others is illustrating the consequences and views of conflict not to mention feeling like a realistic war. The practical effects and CGI are the best that I have ever seen on set! The droid K-2S0 was so realistic, didn't even look like CGI! And if you thought the battle of Hoth was the greatest Sci-Fi battle ever, its got a contender, a contender I found superior.<br/><br/>* I was satisfied watching this movie however I do wish they used the characters from Star Wars Rebels as they have been developed through a series and not just chucked into a conflict. And while the introduction is slow and clunky the conclusion is up-lifting and paced beautifully! I am happy to say Gareth Edwards has redeemed himself after the tragedy of 2014's Godzilla. Rogue One a Star Wars Story is a unique and refreshing take on Star Wars and I highly recommend all fans of a galaxy far, far away to experience the capturing the plans of the Death Star!<br/><br/>Thank You for reading this review, and please check out my other Reviews and List here at IMDb: Iron-Bat-Prime! May the force be with you."
"davieo61","4","10","22","21 December 2016"," YAAAAAAWWWWWWWWN! This was underwhelming.
","I found nothing good with this movie. Absolutely nothing! The story line sucked and was predictable. The score sucked. The CGI was dodgy. I didn't find the finale mind-blowing. Disney didn't even try with this movie. They're just packing in as much nostalgia as possible. This movie was terrible! I've tried to look for some good in it but I can't find any. I almost slept through the first act. IWhen it was time for action sequences, I was underwhelmed once again. Man, you can't trust critics nowadays with the way they overrate Disney movies. The movie wasn't engaging at all. I guess Star Wars fanatics will lap this piece of crap up. I love the first three Star Wars films, hated the prequels. The Force Awakens was palatable. But this? It was a piece of crap. It'll make lots of cash though. Star Wars fanatics should demand quality films from Disney. Enough with the fan service!"
"mark-durfor","6","7","14","24 December 2016"," Rogue One Disappoints
","""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . ."" Those iconic words lit up the screen for the eighth major Star Wars film, just a year after Episode VII: The Force Awakens revitalized the franchise with director J.J. Abrams calling the shots. Star Wars: Rogue One could also be called Episode 3.5 as it takes place approximately 20 years after Episode III ends and leads right into Episode IV: A New Hope. Rogue One was directed by English director Gareth Edwards who directed Monsters (an alien invasion sci-fi drama) and Godzilla in 2014. Both of those films boasted intense special effects which played into his Star Wars debut. <br/><br/>A lot happened at the end of Episode III. Obi Wan fought and defeated his apprentice Anakin Skywalker who was burned by lava over most of his body. Anakin was saved and became the dark sith lord Darth Vader made up mostly of machine to keep him alive. He was seduced by the dark side for its potential power, namely that of saving his beloved wife Padme from death. However, Padme died giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. To hide them from Vader, Yoda and Obi Wan (the only remaining Jedi) and Bail Organa (one of the few Senators not deceived by Emperor Palpatine) determined their fate. Bail adopted Leia and raised her to be the princess of Alderaan. Luke was raised by his uncle Owen and aunt Beru Lars on the desert planet of Tatooine with Obi Wan keeping a distant but watchful eye. <br/><br/>Rogue One is the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). As a child, she barely escaped a Stormtrooper attack on her planet. 15 years later, she is a criminal who finds herself in the captivity of the Rebellion. They promise her freedom if she can help find out what the Empire's plans are. In doing so, she learns her father was coerced into helping design the Death Star. This prompts Jyn to not only join the Rebels, but lead their mission to steal the plans to the planet-destroying weapon. <br/><br/>The preview for Rogue One looked just as visually stunning as the recently released Episode VII. Of course, I was excited because it's a Star Wars movie and I was also curious to see who of our favorite classic Star Wars characters would make some sort of cameo appearance. We already knew Darth Vader was in the film. Unfortunately, two others showed up, but I'll get to that in a second. I had high hopes for Rogue One, though I cautiously gave it a 4 Star Prediction out of 5 stars. I had hoped that number would go up after seeing it; however, it looks like it's going to go down.<br/><br/>If you don't want any spoilers, you should stop right here. Otherwise, here we go. Right from the beginning, a black screen displayed the blue words ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . . "" and then it jumped right into the movie. That's right, no scrolling yellow synopsis to let you know what's going to happen. Then, after the first scene, the title popped onto the screen with no traditional Star Wars theme music that was the score for all seven other movies. Next, the movie jumps from planet to planet it seemed every 5 minutes for the first half of the film. Since it jumped around so much, it was hard to keep track, except for the subtitle telling you where you were and what the significance was of its location. Every other Star Wars movie didn't need that because the dialogue effectively let you know where you were. Felicity Jones did great as Jyn Erso, however, like the movie itself, she had the unfortunate task of having to follow Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey in Episode VII and it fell a bit short. She was, however, one of the three bright spots in the movie among a sea of unmemorable characters. And the final gripe I had with Rogue One was the appearances of Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin. So how did a 60 year old Carrie Fisher and a Peter Cushing who passed away 22 years ago reprise their roles? Computer animation. Really good computer animation, but still noticeable and distracting computer animation. <br/><br/>Okay, enough with the downers. In addition to an entertaining performance from Felicity Jones, there were two other things that really made this worth watching. The droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) was a security droid for the Empire before being reprogrammed to serve the Rebel Alliance. And he was programmed with a snarky personality that has clever one liners in the movie that made him quite endearing. The other scene that was probably the best scene in the whole movie was Darth Vader showing off what an angry Sith Lord can do with the dark side of the force. In his own words from Empire Strikes Back, it was ""impressive, most impressive.""<br/><br/>So, I anticipated 4 Stars, but Rogue One was a bit of a letdown for me. I'm dropping it to 3.5 Stars as my final rating. It's worth watching in the theatre, but more of a rental. I'll definitely be owning it, but that's more because a Star Wars fan has to have all of them in their collection. If this was a stand alone movie, I doubt I would. That being said, it made me even more anxious to see Episode VIII next year.<br/><br/>marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"
"dsmgdesign-34381","6","7","14","22 December 2016"," This movie went rogue, alright.
","I had high expectations for Rogue One after hearing from people who said it was their favorite Star Wars film. I am not really sure what movie they watched, but the movie that I saw left me disappointed when those expectations weren't met. This movie had a sluggish pace and its seemed to struggle to tell a story that could have been told much more swiftly. <br/><br/>Most of the supporting characters were under developed and lacked the heart needed for me to genuinely care about them. Felicity Jones on the other hand, delivered as protagonist Jen Erso. That said, Erso's relationship with Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna, felt forced, unconvincing and lacked sparks of anything. Han Solo and Princess Leia they are not. <br/><br/>The character's use of the word ""force"" felt misplaced and a little misguided. The climatic space and ground battle scenes in the second act is where this film clearly shined. <br/><br/>The deliberately darker tone in this film stands as a stark contrast to Lucas' prequel trilogy. In comparison, I must give Rogue One a nod. But is this stand-alone better than ""A new hope"", ""Empire strikes back"" and ""the Force Awakens""? Not in a million light years."
"tye1138","6","7","14","16 December 2016"," Rogue One; The Uninspired generic ""family Friendly"" blockbuster
",":cough: Let me begin by stating the obvious... Disney is the wrong studio to be involved with the Star Wars franchise. They are a bunch of pencil pushers who are only interested in churning out one ""safe"" movie after the other. What they fail to realize is the 'Star Wars' franchise is bigger then anything else they've had and it's FAN driven, so millions will go no matter how dark or dialog driven the movie is.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, 'Rogue One' is a poorly conceived, single plot action film that if it weren't for some good acting, decent sets/costumes and the 'Star Wars' name attached, would have bombed at the box office. Why? Because frankly, it's uninteresting. All of the great and interesting dialog scenes that would have helped generate sub stories to keep the audience interested, simply didn't exist. It's as if this movie was a sequel and the previous movie had all the information we needed, yet this isn't a sequel. 'Rogue One' is a unique movie that fits between Episode III and Episode IV, featuring only TWO of the characters from the entire 'Star Wars' Franchise. Yes, there are brief cameo's with other characters, but that doesn't count. Worst off, TWO of those characters are 100% CG and they just look like crap. <br/><br/>It's as if the filmmakers never watched a single 'Star Wars' movie and/or never understood what made them decent, even the not-so-hot prequels had their moments. Even 'The Force Awakens' was ""entertaining"" with far more complexity and overlapping plot lines. Still, 'Rogue One' feels more like a dumbed down 'The Force Awakens' then anything else in the franchise. Heck the filmmakers couldn't even be bothered to put the standard 'Star Wars' introductory story brief before the start of the movie. They threw that out the door, even though it COULD have told the audience what they SHOWED over the course of the first 20 minutes, which were a train wreck of back story and filler story to bring the audience up to speed. Three paragraphs could have answered all of those questions, but then they wouldn't have been able to show off the special effects wizardry.<br/><br/>Unlike 'The Force Awakens' which is saved by it's ""classic"" cast and more similarities to the world of 'Star Wars', 'Rogue One' makes some very well thought out attempts, but doesn't cash in on them. Yes, the cast is good and strong, but they're all worthless underdeveloped characters, thrown in because they're ""cool"". Yes, the sets are spot-on, but they spoil them by using heavy CG which makes set extensions, ships and space battles, look like every other stupid Hollywood movie. Even technical things like the score, were boring and uninteresting. I was shocked because John Williams had already written so much music for the franchise, all they needed to do was tweak it slightly and they would have had a pretty decent score. The surround mix was very flat, with only a few dynamic hits, but no crispness at all. It's like spent all their time trying to make it even, without even contemplating dynamic range. This is probably thanks to Disney not wanting general audiences complaining about how ""loud"" it seemed. Even the mix had to be super ""safe"", which is a load of ballix. I could go on all night about the flat and uninteresting cinematography and over-use of CG as well, but those two things are to be expected in a world of tent pole blockbusters like these. <br/><br/>Fifteen minutes into 'Rogue One' I was already done with the movie. I was done because the plot was so tripe, it was so been there, done that, I knew exactly how it was going to end. There was no reason for me to waste two hours, but I continued to watch. Then we were introduced to the stupid robot character who was there only for comedy relief. Then everything that came out of his mouth was written for 8 year olds. That was about the moment I was going to walk out. I grabbed my things and was over it, but they threw some eye candy at the screen and I stuck around. I felt bad for the set's and actors honestly because they were playing around in this cool world, that we the audience weren't allowed to explore. <br/><br/>In the end, 'Rogue One' is one rotten tomato, thanks to Disney exec's to scared to release the ACTUAL movie, prior to re-shoots. I could see rough outlines of the original movie as I watched and was dismayed to have not seen the original cut. It's hard as a filmmaker to have your movie taken away, but it's even harder as the masses to watch something that COULD have been great. This movie COULD have been awesome, they sure had so many great elements, but it failed miserably and if audiences see the same movie I did, we won't see the same box office numbers as 'The Force Awakens'. Maybe then Disney will recognize their failure, but I have a feeling they'll make plenty of money and push it under the rug.<br/><br/>6/10 2 and 1/2 stars."
"RLTerry1","9","7","14","16 December 2016"," The Force has FINALLY Awakened
","Just when all hope was lost, the force has awakened this time. After the disappointingly stale installment last year, I did not have high hopes for Rogue One. To my surprise, the first standalone Star Wars franchise film exceeded expectations. Although the public is accustomed to Star Wars films coming in threes, Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Studios took a risk in creating an original story to successfully setup A New Hope. With twenty-some-odd years to fill between Revenge of the Sith and the original movie, how was one film going to do it? Focus on what was ultimately important. Not that the development of the Empire would be uninteresting, but the white elephant in the room was ""how did the rebels get the plans that setup the events at the beginning of A New Hope""? And that is precisely what director Gareth Edwards did, and it paid off! One of the elements that plagued Episode VII was the simple fact that it was little more than a remix and mashup of everything that had been done before, including main plot points, subplots, and predictable behavior. Rogue One feels fresh and new. Thematically darker than the original film but not as dark as Empire Strikes Back, this installment strikes a balance in the force that makes it interesting to watch. <br/><br/>Already, this film seems to have sparked arguments among fans of the franchise and those who enjoy them but may not be fanboys. Interestingly, at first glance, it seems as those who liked Episode VII: The Force Awakens did not like Rogue One, and those--like me and the friends I went with last night--who thought The Force Awakens was garbage but found Rogue One to be fun, exciting, and refreshing. Of course, there are plenty of people who like both films released under the Disney banner, either because the Big D can't possibly do anything wrong or because they are true fans for better or worse of the nearly forty-year-old franchise and staple in the future fantasy genre (notice I did not say science-fiction--no real science here). At this point, I am unsure why those who liked last year's film may not have liked this weekend's installment; however, it appears to be clear from multiple comments and reviews that the reason why those who did not like Episode VII enjoyed Rogue One is the newness of a film that embodies the spirit of the original but provides audiences with a new adventure that connects well without redundancy. One of the reasons for the success of the original film--aside from a great cast--is the focus on the drama between characters and camps. There is the drama between Rebels and the Empire but also drama within the camps themselves. Rogue One borrows from A New Hope in that the focus is more on the drama than resting its laurels on the technical elements. Not that this film lacks in the technical category. Rogue One comes complete with great direction, color grading, cinematography, and impressive editing.<br/><br/>For all that this installment did well, the beginning of the film following the prologue was dreadfully ill-conceived and mostly unnecessary. Unlike all the other Star Wars films, this one did not open with the trademark scrolling written prologue offering exposition to setup the movie. Instead, after the ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away"" the film cuts to the opening scene of Krennic recruiting Galen. Following the prologue and rather PowerPoint-looking Rogue One title card, is a rapid, incoherent, and confusing sequence of montages. Honestly, I am still unsure why that whole sequence was necessary. Between the PowerPointy title card and this sequence of montages, I did not have hope for the film at all. Obviously, I ended up enjoying it immensely, but I look back and feels strongly that it could have been left out. The settings/planets that were depicted did not play into the plot at any level of significance. Felt like filler. Thankfully, the scenes following the prologue are but a small portion of the film and the film really begins to take off after Captain Cassian and his team rescue Jyn from a prison transport vehicle. After Jyn's rescue covert operation, the rest of the film is nice paced and developed. Other than knowing the ending, the majority of the film was unpredictable. Unpredictable in that you know the direction it's going and ultimately what's going to happen but you don't know HOW it all happens and works together to setup A New Hope. <br/><br/>Just the right amount of nostalgia and Easter Eggs. For those who are fans of or simply familiar with the movies, there are cameos, references, and shots taken from the preceding films (mostly A New Hope). Just enough nods to and direct connections to provide the audience with a film that IS as much a part of the Star Wars saga as the official Star Wars cannon. It's no surprise that the Death Star is a big part of Rogue One, Senator Mon Mothma is seen leading the rebels, Darth Vader (still voiced by James Earl Jones) makes several brief appearances, and a couple other nostalgic cameos; but there are some characters who are included in the diegesis of this film who will delight old and new fans alike--one in particular that will incite an eruption of cheers! Beyond the human characters, there are other appearances by iconic ships and war machines that aid in cementing this story in with the rest of the franchise. While the film contains some lighthearted, witty dialog between the core group of principle and supporting characters, the film also contains some dark moments. Personally, I think the film should have been a little darker since it sets up the installment all about hope reborn; but, the atrocities of war are definitely not hidden from the audience and events transpire that are atypical of future fantasy films between heroes and villains."
"slashingthrough","9","7","14","16 December 2016"," The way Star Wars should feel
","After a lot of talks and a lot of rumors all over the place regarding this side-story for the Star Wars Universe. Finally, we get a fitting SW story that feels gritty and looks amazing. <br/><br/>Rogue One has three acts where it first introducing the characters, second part developing the characters to react to each other and set up the mission. Third part an epic battle where the actual plans get stolen. (yeah real spoiler ;) ). <br/><br/>The whole universe of SW in this movie just fits the rest of the original trilogy. The costumes the way the world looks like, the struggles on both the rebel side as the imperial side. It all fits good together. <br/><br/>With the introduction of so many new elements some fall a bit short especially how certain characters interact with each other. Maybe on that front Rogue One wants to push a bit too far. The movie is not long enough to put as much in it as it wants.<br/><br/>So lets talk about the third act. The third act is where the most action and the best visuals during the movie come in. The space battle in this act is just great, visually stunning and great use of the characters. Some you will recognize from EP4. A lot attention went into making this a solid SW set up, there is a battle in the sky, a battle on the ground and a battle in space taking place all at the same time. <br/><br/>The main bad guy shows divided side of the Empire, where you see people are still trying to take control of the powers within the Empire. I myself loved this, the struggles it shows the early stages of dominance. Vader is not used as much in the movie as the trailer might say, but I think this is a good thing. Vader is such a powerful character which would have taken away almost all screen time of the rebels or make the movie a Vader movie. Luckily, they used him for the right moments and the right times. <br/><br/>Again, the gritty atmosphere and the different locations this movie takes places are awesome and a welcome addition to the whole diversity of SW planets. You read about them in books but to actually see them represented in the movie is just awesome. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was a great experience and if this sets up the rest of the spin off movies than keep them coming. Don't expect a 10 out of 10 movie because there are too many plot holes and other little things that make less sense. But a solid SW movie it is. I would put this one right after Empire Strikes Back in my SW list.<br/><br/>9/10"
"lisee_lulu","10","11","25","14 December 2016"," One word...EXCEPTIONAL
","Firstly, to those complaining about it being another Star Wars movie that involves the Death Star, let me tell you something extremely important. That's the point of the movie!! It's set before the original movie so they're trying to get the plans to the Death Star. Seriously, people shouldn't complain about this stuff without understanding what the movie is about. Secondly, my review. I saw the midnight screening and I was very tired but I still enjoyed every second of it. The characters were well developed and deep. The story was strong and the CGI, while a lot of it, was well done. What I loved is even though there was a hint at romance between the hero and heroine, they didn't overdo it. It was hinted at and that's all. After all, the Star Wars movies are NOT romance movies so you can't overdo it. And you know what else? I'm glad they died. It gives the movie a darkness to it. Absolutely loved it!"
"senor_spielbergo123","Null","5","9","30 April 2017"," Fan service, nothing to care about deeply
","The Good: Gritty, visually great, fine looking action scenes plus a dramatically atmospheric end scene with Darth Vader (almost a horror vibe). <br/><br/>The Bad: Story-wise flawed, the whole movie only exists to close the logical plot hole of the original Star Wars' Death Star's weakness. Basically fan service. Has no character arcs whatsoever. Oh, they all die in the end. Why should I care again? <br/><br/>The Ugly: Creepy uncanny valley CGI. Why are they doing this to poor Peter Cushing??<br/><br/>Verdict: 5/10"
"anthony-burton4","8","5","9","30 April 2017"," Decent effort
","Quite how ""The Force Awakens"" can poll 8.1 while this only achieves 7.9 is beyond me. I'd award Episode VII at best 6/10. This one is significantly better - perhaps on a par with Episodes II and III - weaker than the original trilogy though.<br/><br/>So what did it get right, and what did it get wrong? Well, the original movies succeeded so well because there were only a small band of characters to get to know - e.g. in the first film: Hans, Luke, Leia and Ben. This one introduces so many characters it's hard to know who's going to be important - then even when we work out who the main characters are, the interplay between them leaves a lot to be desired - there simply isn't enough TIME for them to properly build the characters and their relationships - everything feels a little rushed. <br/><br/>Because of the nature of the plot, it's considerably darker than any of the other SW movies - there's very little for kids. It feels a bit like the later Harry Potter movies did - same material, but a more serious and sometimes disturbing presentation. Definitely more Terminator than Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent - it doesn't come across as a SFX showpiece - everything feels just right - in this respect it is by far the highest quality SW movie to date.<br/><br/>If you're a SW fan, you'll really enjoy this movie - it's almost good enough to make you forget how bad the last one was. Just not perfect. Next time, please can we focus more on a small group of characters and their interactions please!"

Mostly by characters that more or less explain it like they're reading children a book. ""Hey, remember that you need to do this and this so this and that will happen which was all planned for by your dad and he did it all for the best of us all.""<br/><br/>I want to go on but I can't effing bother anymore.

"shane_beacham","8","5","9","13 January 2017"," The Prequel That Should Have Been
","""Rogue One"" is somewhat an anomaly; it's the first non-Episode Star Wars film, set before the events of the original 1977 film, that is meant to show what led up to those events occurring, portraying the mission to retrieve the Death Star plans. The question is, does it live up to what it sets out to accomplish? In my opinion, yes, with a few issues along the way.<br/><br/>One of the things this movie gets right is how much it ties into the Star Wars Universe. You have characters from both the prequel and original trilogy showing up here in the form of cameos or even as main plot devices. While some of these additions can feel forced at times, I would not have taken any of them away, and it reminds how connected this film is to the others.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed, for the most part, the new characters. Felicity Jones does a good job as Jyn Erso and carries the movie well. We get to know a great deal about her backstory and the connection with her father (played by the always awesome Mads Mikkelson), which plays a huge role in the film. Diego Luna does a good job in the supporting character role, and his characters shows you a different side to the rebellion that we haven't seen before. Alan Tudyk is great as the comic-relief robot K-2SO, and Donnie Yen is great as Chirrut Imwe, who was a cool, almost Jedi-like character (he's not, in case anyone is wondering).<br/><br/>The action is intense and fast paced, particularly in the film's final act, which is outstanding. You feel the intensity of every moment and the grittiness of the war that is going on. I'm not sure I would go with those who are saying that is a totally dark movie, but the film does end on a very bittersweet note that actually packed a lot of emotion within it. Visually, the film is also stunning, with most of the visual effects exceeding. Again, I love that they are using both practical and visual effects, something I look forward to see more of in the future.<br/><br/>The film also does something that most prequels (including the Star Wars ones) fail to accomplish: it adds to the original. It fixes plot holes that were found in the original, but it also adds weight to the events found in A New Hope. You understand the gravity of this situation, how important it was and how much sacrifice went into it. It's nice to see this film accomplish that.<br/><br/>And then of course we have to talk about Darth Vader, who plays a small but significant role in the film. This is the first time in the history of Star Wars that I was truly afraid of what Darth Vader could do. He's not in the film much, but nonetheless this is some of the best we've ever seen from the character, making you forget about the whiny Anakin from the prequels.<br/><br/>Of course with any movie, there are flaws, and Rogue One's problems mainly have to do with its story, the character development in particular. There are some characters who were fleshed out fine (Jyn, Cassian, etc.), but then there were others where you didn't really get to learn the motivation behind their actions. I would have liked to have learned more about some of them. I also felt like the story, while overall consistent and well-written, was edited together very oddly. In the beginning of the film, we jumped from several different moments within the span of a couple of minutes. This may be due to the re-shoots that occurred a few months before this film's release, but still, it did feel like it could have been done better.<br/><br/>Also, as good as the visual effects were in this film, there was a case of motion capture that I felt didn't work. I won't reveal which character they recreate, but anytime that character was on screen, it took me out of the movie. Sometimes it looked fine, mostly when the character was standing still, but whenever we saw their mouth move or their facial features, it reminded me of a video game. Another time it was used for a different character and it looked really good, but still, I think the motion capture could have been worked on a bit better.<br/><br/>However, despite my problems with the movie, ""Rogue One"" is a phenomenal addition to the Star Wars universe and is, in many ways, the prequel that should have been. This is what many people, including myself, wish the Star Wars prequels had been, because not only does it connect the dots between films, it also adds weight and importance to the events of the original Star Wars. It may not be perfect, but with this film, Lucasfilm continues to prove that Star Wars is back and better than it has been in a while."

","The first Rogue One trailer was great. It promised a dangerous mission of vital importance against insurmountable odds with a heroine who may or may not turn to the Dark Side.<br/><br/>Reality is a harsh mistress, particularly when she's had time to do reshoots and play around in the editing room. Which is understandable, because while Star Wars has a deep emotional connection for many, in the end it's also a product. Each movie is designed to make money, scratch that, a whole lot of money. So yes, Disney is going to push and pull on things in the editing process to invoke all the feels, making us want to open our hearts to our wallets so that we can lose ourselves for two hours.<br/><br/>Too bad this example does a such a textbook case at failing. The plucky band of heroes have almost no character development. The plot is needlessly long and convoluted and revolves around a death star. The action is badly directed and ultimately this is a story that doesn't matter much and didn't need to be told. Save your money and catch it cable."
"The_Legend3","6","5","9","22 December 2016"," Better then Force Awakens still a mess
","This is my second IMDb review for Star Wars. I was disappointed with the Force Awakens so I was going in pumped. Did it deliver? Well I must say there are improvements, for instance the darker tone, the humour going to the droid and better actors. I really like Felicity Jones and that guy from Elysium. This is overall a better film then Episode 7. Unfortunately like Force Awakens this film is just a Disney marketing machine aimed at kids and families and ultimately suffers for it. <br/><br/>After seeing this movie it is quite clear that they do not care about story,character development or pacing. There was so much potential wasted. It is just a cheap rip off of 4,5,6 AGAIN! Seriously Disney stop banking on the originals and trying to be good. I did not understand what the hell was going on throughout this film as the plot was a mess. I did not care about anyone or had no empathy because there was no character development. The villain was so bad I did not understand his motivations, his plans were garbage. Darth Vader should of killed him. I found Donnie Yen annoying. Especially that force prayer. Seriously Dude shut up! Forrest Whittaker was underused what was he doing in this film? His character had no use. I didn't understand why that Indian guy from Jason Bourne was in this. Just did not care. I must say though those action sequences were amazing credit to ILM and the art direction was great hope they get Oscars. There are some funny moments and good cameos. Sadly it does not save this poorly directed film. I just feel like they are just not getting what Star Wars is to the hardcore fans. <br/><br/>Star Wars is epic for it's mythos and legends. In the OT even the Prequels The force is a mysterious ancient power that the Jedi yield. It felt insulting how they used it here as none of these people are Jedi as they are all dead except for Obi-Wan. So how do they know about it? Just an example of how Disney are just throwing crap at the wall and it is evident in each scene. This movie makes no sense and is the second film from Disney where I didn't care. Gareth Edwards the Director had a huge task to make this. I think he did his best but this just feels like a studio drunk on power, only out for money. Episode 8 I'm guessing will be an Empire Strikes Back rip off. Time to bring back old man Lucas and get these Mickey Mouse duds who know nothing about Star Wars out. BTW I want to see Jedi. Next spin off is Han Solo Anthology. This means more shooting. I want to see Lightsabres and Jedi Knights. Seeing Vader fight like that should have been the movie. Also that's not how to destroy an ATAT. In The ESB it takes a tow cable from a snow speeder. Yet it takes one shot here and it explodes. DO YOU KNOW YOUR OWN MATERIAL? I will always be a fan but I feel Disney is single handily trying to destroy our love for Star Wars and take our money. It's a real shame because I believe there are many nerds and hardcore fans who could write a movie better then this pointless drivel."

","This is another movie about people running around and things blowing up. Or maybe since it's a Star Wars movie it's about things running around and people blowing up. Also, things flying around and planets blowing up along with comic relief provided by silly robots speaking with English accents and making dumb jokes. There is not a single effect or musical motif that everyone hasn't seen and heard 20 times already. It's as though there is a machine that Hollywood puts $200 million into and it spits out $1.054 billion. There isn't a single original or fresh idea and this movie will be forgotten along with every Swashbuckler adventure that was ever created. It's a money maker. Enough already."
"congminhvuong","1","8","17","23 December 2016"," ""Rogue One"" can make fan of ""Star Wars"" correspond with spectacular action scenes. But sketchy script and how messy montage is something no one can deny.
","Movies with good content. But Rogue One suffered the limitations caused regret. Screenplay contains more than enough, making tangle film circuit. Meanwhile, a number of important details to help develop content and character to be done through the speakers, sketchy.<br/><br/>That makes some characters appear faint shopping without specific role, such as Saw Gerrera veterans of Forest Whitaker. His story line can totally omitted without causing a major influence on the work.<br/><br/>Focusing on the story of Rogue One detachment, but outside Jyn Erso female, most of the remaining characters are not built specifically biography, personality.<br/><br/>How they met, build connections and become born into death squad untapped properly. Therefore, the members of Rogue One memorable back in a more personal nature as a collective whole. Most prominent in the team's robot K-2SO (Alan Tudyk dubbing). Although the character is only ""virtual"" K-2SO seemed robbed of all glory from the actor who plays the ""personality"" but frankly simple, effective and quite humorous.<br/><br/>Two Chinese actor is Donnie and Jiang Wen's first appearance in a super blockbuster Star Wars leave a good impression, not a disadvantage or fade than the stars.<br/><br/>In contrast, many other characters have a lot of scenes, but is yet to be built, properly invested. Such as Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) are always very fuzzy, character property is unclear. Plus acting not convinced by Diego Luna, the character can not be counterbalanced by Jyn Erso.<br/><br/>One montage of Rogue stitch definitely is something worth complaining. The first half of the film, many sequences are quite messy collage, making the work tempo was shattered, lack of seamless. On the other hand, the overall film is quite lengthy, lacking the necessary point, because many details have to plug connected to the previous films."
"alva3901","9","8","17","15 December 2016"," A new perspective into the Star Wars universe
","Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards, is the first standalone film in the Star Wars saga and by far the most intriguing in the franchise. Set as a prequel to Episode 4: A New Hope, Rogue One brings in a group of unknown rebels led by Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones), as they travel to new worlds to find the plans to the Death Star, devised by her father Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelson). Gareth Edwards, who's other major films include 'Godzilla' and 'Monsters', brings in a new perspective into the Star Wars universe, combining characters and action so well, you'll leave the theater buzzing for more (even when you realize that it leaves you right off a New Hope). <br/><br/>The plot to Rogue One is very simple, but it's the characters that really take this movie to new heights. The likes of Jyn, Captain Andor (Diego Luna), K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk), Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) make this movie worth watching (other than it being a Star Wars film). The droid, K-2S0, was the stand-out secondary character, able to bring great sources of humour while still being of use. But the real star of the show was Jyn Erso, with Felicity Jones doing a great job as the female lead. She is tough, rebellious and reckless, making her a well-crafted character, that has a great backstory.<br/><br/>Though Star Wars creates great protagonists, Rogue One's main antagonist Orson Krennic is definitely up there with the best. Ben Mendelsohn is powerful, able to give you a villain that any Star Wars fan would want. <br/><br/>The action was also spectacular, with the final climatic fight one of the best in the franchises history, which is definitely saying something. Full of wonder and delight, you never drift your eyes away from the screen, with the special effects staff deserving full recognition as they recreate some of the characters of the originals.<br/><br/>It seems hard to not mention Darth Vader, so I will. He has little screen-time, but for every second he is in, he steals the show. One scene in particular was very special, as we see him in action for the first time in years.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a Star Wars movie that really takes you on a different journey from what you would be used to. It connects itself so well to the beginning of A New Hope, you could combine both movies with no problem. The cast and crew deserve the credit for the effort they made in creating a standalone film in the biggest franchise in movie history. Though the most 'war-like' of the 8 films, it still has moments of levity spread throughout, which reminds you of the original Star Wars spirit. It stands alone in the saga, and I believe it stands as one of the best."
"desertfox1942-178-876030","6","8","17","15 December 2016"," At least it is better than The Stupid Awakens
","We all know what is going to happen at the end of the story. We just don't know how it will happen.<br/><br/>Rogue One certainly isn't the best Star Wars movie but at least it is better than the abomination of The Farce Awakens that dares to have the title of Star Wars.<br/><br/>With a 2nd Star Wars movie released by Disney it is crystal clear now that all this company cares about is money (of course) and force their political liberal leftist narrative into this beautiful universe. Anyone who denies this is either stupid or a liar.<br/><br/>Some words about the content of the film now. You get an action packed adventure with as much Empire and Rebels you can wish for. Felicity Jones is a bad actress but hey, that's Dinsey forcing females into the main role. There is also a lot of violence and I can imagine it would have been much more without Disney's censorship. The CGI for the space battle were bad. I really don't understand why they did them so lame. There was no speed and excitement about them (the missing Lucas touch is once again obvious here). The rest of the action scenes are good and anyone can enjoy them.<br/><br/>Having said this, if you are a fanboy, desperately in need of some fan service, then you'll get plenty of that with Rogue One. There are many surprises that will make you happy, from the beginning to the end of the film.<br/><br/>If you are a fanboy who wants something original and daring like George Lucas did with the prequels, then don't spend money to watch Rogue One because you will be disappointed. Better wait until you can watch it on TV. Rogue One still misses the mythology, philosophy and history that surrounds the Star Wars chapters made by George Lucas."

","I find overall 2016 not so very successful about blockbuster movies that came out, but deep inside I told myself maybe Rogue One could come close to the unanticipated success of The Force Awakens. Nevertheless in the end we all asked ourselves ""Is this movie really necessary?"". After watching it, I believe the answer is a big ""No"".<br/><br/>The story is about how the Rebels got the plan of ""Death Star"" in order to defeat the Empire and save their galaxy. The daughter of the main engineer of Death Star is Galen Erso, played by incredible Mads Mikkelsen, is put up a difficult task. His tiny little fierce daughter named Jyn Erso is given the task by the Rebels to capture his father as well as the plans to Death Star. The Rebels intend to destroy the biggest war machine through this little girl by giving her a quite impossible mission.<br/><br/>So by taking a look at features of Felicity Jones, you might say Daisy Ridley wasn't tall or an Athlete either. However, Daisy Ridley in The Force Awakens was very convincing in her role as a scavenger and was a muscular, agile fighter. With Felicity Jones, from the beginning I had no belief or whatsoever that she could take down one Trooper with a single hand , or could fight them off with only a stick. Something with her is really off-putting, I'm sorry but she is really not meant for action roles. Even during her speech in front of a group of Rebel soldiers was far from convincing, her facial expressions and her voice sounded.. amateur.<br/><br/>The other characters had all problems as well. I think the main problem starts with the script which was heavily loaded with clichÃ©s such as countless repetitions of ""Hope"", not getting killed during prayers (and how come is this a Jedi thing?!), slow motion deaths, Deus-Ex Machina moments and so on. The movie was so predictable that no one could really care about any deaths in the movie. You will be like ""Yeah, that was coming"".<br/><br/>After all, I think this was a huge waste of time and a very unnecessary addition to Star Wars series which proved that Lucas wants more cash and that's all about it. By that, I don't know how much more money, I mean, they are super rich right? Just stop! And for Felicity Jones, sorry but it was very unfortunate that her lead came out after great performance of Daisy Ridley. She shouldn't be in action movies."

","On the surface, this is a well-made action movie set within the Star Wars universe filled with nods and homages to ""A New Hope"" that will make you tingle with warm nostalgia. The reappearance of sets, costumes and characters from our favorite childhood movies might make you say ""Now, THIS is a Star Wars movie!"" <br/><br/>However, nostalgia and making copious amounts of money on that nostalgia seemed to be Disney's primary strategy with this movie. It's mimicry, plain and simple. The CGI recreations of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher felt very dirty and a flagrant disrespect to the departed actors, not to mention jarring, for a first time viewer. The digital appearance of Grand Moff Tarkin disengaged me from the frail story and made me settle my stomach with a handful of antacid tablets.<br/><br/>The story, writing, characterization is on-par with what you'd expect from modern cinema and the movie serves it's primary purpose of being entertaining.

No mystery, no real suspense. <br/><br/>The actors, well, a mix of old C rated actors, and young B-C rated actors.

"Irie212","5","6","12","14 January 2017"," Not a fresh moment in it
","If you've seen previous Star Wars films-- almost any of them-- then you've seen this movie. The premise is rather fun: it's a prequel to the original 1977 film, ""Episode IV: A New Hope,"" detailing how rebels acquire the plans to the Death Star that Princess Leia delivers to R2D2, and ultimately to Obi Wan Kenobi, in Episode IV. Unfortunately, the two plots-- this movie and Episode IV-- are virtually identical. In both, rebels plan and execute an invasion of an Empire stronghold. Little effort is made to enliven that old plot with fresh ideas, fresh humor, fresh anything.<br/><br/>Several actors from the 1977 original are digitized in (Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher), and Darth Vader shows up (James Earl Jones' voice), and I don't expect or want anything new from them. But the rest of the characters are just rehashes of previous ones. We've seen them before. The generic Zen character (Donnie Yen) is part Yoda, part Obi-Wan. The robot K2SO is part Wookie, part C3P0. Bad guy Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelssohn) is Darth Vader but in a white cloak. Jyn (Felicity Jones) and Cassian (Diego Luna) are basically the same character. They're fine actors, but one does wish for the occasional change of pace, even if its just a different facial expression.<br/><br/>I wish I could recommend it. It's not an embarrassing disaster like ""Phantom Menace"" or ""Revenge of the Sith,"" it's just boring."

","I saw the first Star Wars movie when I was around 14 years old at a friend's birthday party, his father owned the first VCR far and wide. The tape was probably rented from a video store. Thirty years later, it seems that they have nailed the concept. There's a lot of soap opera, a surprising amount of Holocaust movie tropes (families being torn apart and genocide by crazy dictator), and there is a strange fixation on daddy (he will make it right, but he's the incarnation of evil, but they made him to do it).<br/><br/>Rogue One is the umpteenth part of the franchise, and in no way a ""stand alone"" as Disney would have us believe (maybe in order to prepare us for the fact that they'll be churning out more ""episodes"" annually.<br/><br/>Hold on, I've just googled it, actually the studio has ANNOUNCED that the next episodes will appear annually.<br/><br/>In brief, I liked the spectacular effects in the last third of the movie. Storywise, it's a wild rehash of tropes from all genres. The combat scenes are pretty much ""Platoon"" with lasers (the rebels even wear GI-style helmets all of a sudden), the intrusion to the VCR storage tower are lifted directly from ""2001"".<br/><br/>I actually wouldn't have seen Rogue One at the cinema, but the town I was in has one of the biggest screens in the country, and Rogue One was what was on.

"jtindahouse","5","6","12","30 December 2016"," A real let down
","Usually I wouldn't give a moments thought to watching a 'Star Wars' spin-off movie, but I had heard great things about 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' and that, coupled with the death of Carrie Fisher, was enough to get me along to pay my $20 to see it. In hindsight, I probably wish I hadn't bothered. As a kid I loved 'Star Wars'. I watched all the films and had all the toys and costumes. It fascinated me. Then I went off it altogether (mostly because I went off sci-fi as a genre completely) for the next 20 years, until recently I saw 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' and it had more of an impact on me than I expected it to. I started thinking about it again and running through all the story arcs and characters. I wouldn't say it had me hooked again, but it certainly had me interested. Now, I fear 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' may have done enough to quash that interest again.<br/><br/>It just didn't do anything for me. I kept hoping a character I knew and was familiar with would pop up, but it just took so long to happen, and even then the cameos were brief and fairly forgettable. The characters didn't have much going for them at all. Felicity Jones in the lead role completely lost me. In contrast to Daisy Ridley who blew me away in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', Jones did nothing more than bore me. They were quite different characters in a number of ways, but at the heart of things they were meant to be someone you could root for. One achieved this, the other did not.<br/><br/>The humour in this film also did not work. A lot of jokes were attempted, mostly by the character of 'K-2SO', but almost all of them fell flat. This was quite the opposite to 'The Force Awakens' where a large majority of the jokes were landing. The character of 'K-2SO' was clearly based, at least in part, on 'Sheldon' from 'The Big Bang Theory', however it seemed they didn't quite know exactly how to right for that kind of character. The idea was a decent one, the execution just wasn't there.<br/><br/>I think the thing that's making a lot of 'Star Wars' fans enjoy this is the nostalgia factor. Getting to see 'Darth Vadar' again, all the intertwining stories relating to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' and a rather timely and sad cameo right near the end are making people think they like this more than they actually do. It's a harmless film, but it certainly has no place in the IMDb Top 250 movies list."

I have seen all the episodes but force awakens so far and I admit not a huge fan though as a child I was definitely sucked into the world. For me this is a forgettable star wars episode which I neither love nor hate.Visually it looks the part but for me it lacks impact, the characters left very little impression on me and action sequences are not tense if you don't care about the characters outcomes and know basically whats going to happen in the end, I quite liked Mendelson as the main villain and the final scene setting up new hope was a nice touch which did give me a bit of excitement and a blast of nostalgia reminding me why I enjoyed the first trilogy as a yout, overall it is mostly a bloated battle sequence with a foregone conclusion and I was pretty bored checking my watch throughout the movie."
"StarWarsDisco","Null","6","12","22 December 2016"," Should have known better
","Okay, there must be two types of Star Wars fans who see the universe completely differently. First, there are the children of the original trilogy generation, which includes myself, whom adore Star Wars as a keystone of our early development; as penetrating as any religion, if not more so. I saw all the original movies in the theater, multiple times. I played Star Wars in the schoolyard, and had the compulsory toys, games, accessories etc. Star Wars was a part of me and my friends daily conversation. That being said, we never read a Star Wars book or comic, nor did we dress up in goofy SW uniforms (except at Halloween). We balanced our childhood pop culture fantasies with healthy sports and activities. To us, Star Wars and the NFL were both cool. There were very few geeks that I was aware of. We knew immediately that Return of the Jedi was only half as good as the first two, mainly because the story really betrayed Lucas' need to pander to kiddies. I was 13 by the time of ROJI, and I needed my Star Wars universe to continue to get darker and more intense, not more sickly sweet.<br/><br/>Now, enter the second set. Geeks. I hate you. You have hijacked and ruined that part of my childhood Star Wars memories as described above. You have immersed yourself in fandom in a way that has lit up dollar signs for George Lucas, Disney and every other big corporation that has had a hand in reviving Star Wars for the geeks. You actually liked the prequels (or parts of them) as well as these last two installments. You read all the fan novels, graphic novels and whatever else; and you have PhDs in the Star Wars universe. Good for you. Just because you know about all these new characters and story lines doesn't make you a real Star Wars fan. You're just geeks if you don't know a good movie, Star Wars or otherwise. And geeks generally don't know good movie storytelling, you are too hung up on the video game and graphic components. <br/><br/>I watched a review by some geek group on youtube who praised Rogue One as being really good. It sucked. There is so much going on on the screen at any one time it becomes distracting, characters are underdeveloped, score is overused, and the whole thing is edited together at breakneck speed. And this is nothing new. This is what the video game/comic book/geek masses consume endlessly. No wonder the studios keep serving up the same old drivel. Watch Empire Strikes Back again. Note how much care is taken to allow characters to fill space and time. The pace is pitch perfect, and there are beautiful moments of quiet (not silence) that allow you some breathing room to absorb the story. Geeks, all I can say is, I hope you're mass influence is on the downswing. Oh, and you owe me my money back."
"Wizard-8","Null","6","12","21 December 2016"," An improvement over ""The Force Awakens""
","To a certain degree, I initially kind of enjoyed ""The Force Awakens"" despite finding some significant flaws, the main one being that it had WAY WAY too many echoes of the original 1977 ""Star Wars"" movie. But the more I thought about it afterwards - and I thought about it a lot - I realized how unsatisfying it really was. So now my opinion of it is a definite thumbs-down. So I was not looking forward to ""Rogue One"" when it came to my neighborhood, but I finally broke down and went to see it after getting a number of positive reports about it.<br/><br/>I just got home from the theater, and my state of mind feels a lot more positive than what I got from ""T.F.A."". It's definitely a stronger (and better) movie in a number of aspects. What I thought was really interesting about it was how kind of downbeat it was. It shows that war is really painful and not fun at all, and that good guys do get killed (though I didn't think it would be to the extent it was in the end.) But despite the strong cynical edge, there is also plenty of excitement and action, some fine special effects, and occasional (and welcome) touches of humor.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect, certainly. While I did appreciate the gritty and cynical feel of the movie, it unfortunately extends to the photography and the lighting for the most part. The movie is so dark-looking I would have welcomed any character bringing in a flashlight. Also, I was disappointed that Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen was largely wasted - I could see great potential in his character that was simply not realized. Speaking of the rest of the cast, the CGI-generated Grand Moff Tarkin, while not as bad-looking as some reports have put it, didn't look quite right. And Darth Vader in his appearance didn't seem to be acting quite like the Vader we know from the 1977 movie, acting a bit too lively with his words. The script also has some greatly predictable touches here and there.<br/><br/>Weighing the good with the not-so-good, in the end you have a fairly decent ""Star Wars"" entry. It's no classic, but it is a noble try and it does reasonably entertain. However, I cannot help but wonder if my opinion of the movie will change in the weeks to come like it did with ""T.F.A.""...."
"erkucz00","10","6","12","17 December 2016"," An excellent companion, for both new fans and old.
","Rogue One: a Star Wars Story is a movie far different that anything that has ever been released under the lucasfilm name. It is completely devoid of a crawl at the beginning for one thing; Instead it starts with a concussive sforzando of the score, and space flashes onto the screen, as if to say, ""Here it is, what else did you expect?"" I love those bold yellow words as much as the next guy, they function as a call to adventure, an invitation to a place far different from anything the viewer is used to. But Rogue One is different: it's a lot less adventurous and far more familiar than the galaxy far far away has ever been. I mean this in the most complimentary way possible; this is a film that puts the War in ""Star Wars"" in an acute fashion.<br/><br/>Rogue One's main strength is its action. In this reviewers humble opinion, it features the best action the franchise has to offer. Before you cry ""Blasphemy!"" and slam the computer shut in rage, allow me to explain myself. The battle of the death star in Return of the Jedi is probably the original trilogy's best space combat. It provides a vigorous depiction of spacial warfare, displaying the speed and chaos of ship to ship combat. It is, however, fettered by the primitivity of early 1980s special effects. The Force Awakens brought to the table modern effects, but was fairly unexciting to watch due to its being a near carbon copy of the battle in IV. The battle that serves as Rogue One's climax is an all-new concept. Things like planetary shield gates, message transmissions, and ramming ships are brought in the picture. Aided by 15 or so visual effects companies Disney recruited, it looks considerably excellent as well.<br/><br/>Many aspects of A New Hope are also addressed. The conveniently placed exhaust port is no longer a shoehorned plot device, but a final act of revenge by a defecting engineer. Tarkin isn't a Grand Moff but a lowly Governor, and we get to witness his ascension to power firsthand. Darth Vader also plays a fairly major role in the film. Many have criticized Edwards for his habitation of barely three scenes, but really, this makes them special. Lack of cinematic appearance for the last 34 years makes it that much more exciting. I struggled in containing my excitement when I heard that mechanical rasp coming out of the pitch black hallway of the rebel cruiser in the last scene. After all those warnings about cell phones, I figured a boisterous scream of childlike glee would probably be frowned upon in the establishment. When Vader's crimson blade appeared, spreading the faces of the trembling rebel soldiers and the hallway of that ship in rufescent, evil glow, I was actually shaking with anticipation. Vader precedes to hurl himself upon the hapless rebels with his wieldy might. The rebels rush back, handing off the sought after plans from man to man, as Vader slashes, chokes, and tosses through their ranks with ease. In a moment of perfection, the trooper hands off his precious cargo to a CG Princess Leia. ""What did they bring us?"" he says. ""Hope"" she replies. Needless to say, I almost cried. <br/><br/>Before the movie, as I put on my IMAX glasses, a Coca Cola advertisement ran. I usually dismiss these, but this one was cool enough to stick in my head and I thought later it did a great job of introducing the movie: ""Taste the universe, begin your journey, explore your boundless imagination,"" it read. That represents really well a movie that show us about ten new worlds, five or so new ships, and a plethora of new characters. Rogue one increases the scope of the universe and expands the possibilities of Star Wars. It fuels the imagination and invites Star Wars fans of all ages to embark on a journey of rediscovery. <br/><br/>As I exited the theater, barely keeping my balance after listening to Giacchino's brilliant overture, I overheard a woman talking with dissatisfaction about the movie: ""I guess it was good, it was kind of depressing though. I mean, they all died, right?""<br/><br/>""WRONG!"" I wanted to scream. Yes, they all die, but in a blaze of glory. Each character receives the fitting end that I only wish Han Solo had been given. Countless rebel giants fall, fighting for the rebel cause. Bohdie the pilot dies wiring an antenna, Baze Malbus dies fighting with newfound acceptance of the force, and Cassian and Jyn die having passed on the death star plans. While nothing else can ever fill the place the original trilogy holds in my heart, I must admit no other Star Wars film has ever portrayed, at least this powerfully, the theme of sacrifice, and how it can pave the way for a new hope."
"iepw12","10","6","12","16 December 2016"," Enough of all that's good about the franchise
","I have now watched this film twice and I will confess to struggling with the first viewing with almost too much of what I have known and enjoyed of Star Wars over 40 years.I found it almost too serious for the first hour but given that the entire story is predicated on one line from episode 4 about loads of folk dying for the cause, inevitably one is going to experience some fairly bleak stuff. That said,I found the script to be almost too adult as if I was watching a modern war movie by the likes of Ridley Scott or even Quenten T without any blood, and be assured this movie has no blood.There are lots of great surprises in terms of links with Ep 4 especially and the introduction of character actors from other genres to create a new dimension to the action(Johnny Yen, Yip Man)was a creative move I found quite acceptable.The following on from Ep7 with a strong female lead works really well for me also. Dare I say the on the money moment in the film was a Vader entrance which I found absolutely stunning and the seamless link into Ep 4's opening was sensational for me. I do have a couple of minor quibbles ...I'm sorry but the two stunt men in the Vader suit at different times didn't seem quite huge enough to me but maybe Dave Prouse had bigger heels, or maybe all the actors in this film are a bit taller!! All in all by the end of the second viewing in what was a daytime empty auditorium I was suitably emotional to forgive any anomalies, hence the maximum score here withe small reservation that you really do need to concentrate for the first hour and a distracting full first night audience doesn't help that atal."

"bryank-04844","9","4","7","23 January 2017"," 'Rogue One' goes all the way!
","Since the release of 'The Force Awakens', Disney will be releasing a 'Star Wars' film every year for the foreseeable future. Well, it's been a year since 'The Force Awakens', which means it's time for another 'Star Wars' film, and luckily for us, we get 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'. I'm so glad that Disney is allowing up and coming, young filmmakers a chance to have a go at 'Star Wars', because director Gareth Edwards ('Monsters' and 'Godzilla') has knocked it out of the park, even though there were some re-shoots with writer Tony Gilroy ('Michael Clayton' and 'The Bourne' films). This is the 'Star Wars' film we have wanted for a long time, in that we get to see some characters do some truly amazing and badass things that we've never seen before, and a return to some of those classic set pieces and ships.<br/><br/>'Rogue One' takes place in between 'Episode III' and 'Episode IV'. We all know that the original Star Wars film 'A New Hope' focused on Luke Skywalker destroying the Death Star, by way of stolen plans that Princess Leia entrusted to R2-D2 that instructed how to destroy that mega Death Star. We know how that turned out. 'Rogue One' tells the story of how and who stole those plans from the Empire and got them to the Rebellion. I don't want to give too much away here, because I know all of you will just fall in love with these characters.<br/><br/>Every performance is excellent here from Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso to Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, and even Forest Whitaker as fan favorite Saw Gerrera. Everyone gives a great performance of characters struggling to overcome the empire and deal with their past losses. Alan Tudyk ('Firefly') voices the new droid K-2SO, which might be my new favorite 'Star Wars' character of the whole canon. K-2SO is just plain fantastic and funny in a way that C3PO could never be. It was a delight. Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn are just straight up phenomenal and have many layers to their characters and steal each scene they are in.<br/><br/>Then of course Donnie Yen comes in and just owns every scene and proves he is the badass he has always been. There is a great story in this 133 minute film that keeps its pace with some of the best action sequences you'll ever see involving spaceships and tie fighters. Michael Giacchino has done a phenomenal job of bringing John Williams' score to this film by adding in some of the old with the new, and it just adds to every scene and suspenseful and heartfelt moment.<br/><br/>'Rogue One' is definitely one of the best 'Star Wars' films I've seen.<br/><br/>MUST-SEE!"

"dobikrisz","8","7","15","16 December 2016"," A Star wars with balls!
","First of all I have to admit it: this is not one of the best movies I've ever seen but the best Star wars (as an adult) in the series. As a kid, the original trilogy was one of the best movies. It was funny, had lovely characters, the story was pretty simple and it was somehow magical. It was like a fairy tale just with Jedi. But as an almost grown up man the only things which make those movies better than an above average movie is the nostalgia. And here comes this spin-off which makes the movies a real action -sci-fi. The first half-one hour was nothing new. A little bit boring, a little bit slow but it was alright. The real things happen in the last half our in the great battle scene. There I finally understand why everybody afraid of the empire. Finally it's not a clear battle between the good and the evil where the good always better but it was a dirty, hard battle between 2 side who's want victory. The whole scene is really like a Vietnam war movie (with those helmets at the rebellion). Yes, the storm-troopers still a little stupid, the rebels still fight like some war demigods but this was the first time that I felt real battle in the Star wars movies. And it was good. Not the best of the bests but good. And the end of the battle they finally dare to gave a finish which is more than a fairy tale. And the last scene we finally understand why everybody afraid of Darth Vader! In summary it is a great movie which is a strong 8 between the all movies but it's a 9 (and this is my point)in the star wars universe."
"firewynd","9","7","15","16 December 2016"," Better than expected, Possibly the best SW movie since Empire (some spoilers)
","Warning: Some spoilers ahead, including what I would say is the biggest possible spoiler. Yet I don't focus on the spoilers a lot, this is more of an even keeled review.<br/><br/>My background: Pretty avid Star Wars fan. More than most, but not as extreme as some. I've seen all of the movies many times, have read a number of SW extended universe books (when I was a teen). Have played many of the video games.<br/><br/>My exposure to the movie prior to watching: Minimal. I hate spoilers and actively avoided watching trailers or reading anything about the movie. I heard it was about finding the plans to the death star and that is about all I knew.<br/><br/>Overall: I like the direction Disney took this. This is a fantastic add to the SW universe and I'm pumped for more.<br/><br/>What I liked: - The movie had a fair amount of grit to it. Some of the elements reminded me of WW2 movies.<br/><br/><ul><li>This movie felt like a war movie. Probably the most of any SW's movie I've seen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No Jedi. (Unless you count Vader). I thought this was awesome. Past installments have focused way too much on the Jedi, especially the prequels. I felt like that focus destroyed the mythos and reverence of the Jedi. I was so glad to get a look at the SW universe without a Jedi main character. It was really awesome.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The overall story made more sense and felt less contrived than parts of Episode VII. Some exceptions to the ending though.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Everyone dies. I think this is the first western Hollywood produced movies where all of the main cast dies. This blew my mind. This is more common in foreign films. I did NOT expect that to happen at all. I actually thought this was pretty awesome. It hopefully helps to set expectations of mortality and fear in future movies.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Reminded me of Game of Thrones due to the grit and the main cast deaths. But RO doesn't have Game of Thrones nudity or political maneuvering.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Decent plot. Some may argue against this due to the audience largely knowing the outcome if they know SW. Again, I knew nothing about the movie going in, and I found the back story and the way the movie evolved all very interested and not predictable. I largely don't care for predictable movies, and I was surprised up the the very ending of the movie by what was occurring. At one point I was actually upset that it wouldn't end and sync with other SW canon, but it played out true to form at the end.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The droid was awesome, whatever it's name was. Wow. C3-P0 move over. Great humor and for me - a very likable member of the cast. I was shocked by his death. I should have seen that as a precursor of what was to come but I didn't think Disney had it in them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cast. I liked them all and their performances were well done and pulled you into the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tarkin and Leia faces. Tarkin was for sure CG (boy is CG getting good). Leia was really well done. I couldn't tell for sure if it was CG or not.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The clips from Ep IV that they put in. As a deep fan, I loved this callback.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the action scenes were great.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I'm glad they didn't contrive some love scene / serious romance at the end. That would have been lame and really forced. The way it was done was in good taste and it ended perfectly from my point of view.</li></ul><br/><br/>Neutral: Vader combat scenes. Was probably fan service, but at the same time - Vader was a badass, so it was nice to see him cut a swath through some rebels. Helps give context / background to folks who aren't as up on the lore.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: - I missed the opening main crawl. Not a big ding, but still sad to part ways from tradition in that manner. Also the opening to the asteroid belt was a bit on the lame side. Definitely the weakest opening of all SW movies that I can think of (talking about the first 30 seconds or so). Ep 4 killed it here of course.<br/><br/><ul><li>Soundtrack really wasn't great. I had higher hopes. Probably on the same level as Ep 7. Nothing that really stood out to me too much. Not really a con, but a con because it didn't meet my expectations. This isn't to say the soundtrack is bad. It's just not remarkable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A few parts did feel contrived or forced for two reasons: 1. Fan service. 2. To make everything fit canon.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Vader choking the director. Felt like fan service and not necessary.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I still am confused as to how convenient it was that Leia's ship just happened to be docked with the main Rebel capital ship. I can't think of a logical reason other than it being contrived for plot. Not a huge ding, but does break the immersion a bit for me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They focused too much on fighter combat (X-wings, Y-wings) than I would have liked. I actually would love to see some more capital ship on capital ship combat (like episode 3 did). Not a huge complaint, but something that would have been nice. Because they didn't do this, I feel that the audience doesn't have a good grasp of the seriousness of the space battle happening.</li></ul>"
"kraytdragon-sean","8","7","15","15 December 2016"," Making the Franchise Fresh Again
","Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie since 1980. The general consensus of last years Force Awakens was that the spirit of the original trilogy returned. However, the problem with Episode VII is in how the spirit is captured identically. In having returned so reverently, the franchise needed to display a willingness to tinker. Enter the newest cinematic addition to Star Wars. Rogue One is a balanced movie of hope and despair. The last Star Wars movie to find this magical balance in tone is The Empire Strikes Back. Likewise, Rogue One finds a unique synergy between old and new. The first anthology Star Wars movie works in its inevitable lead-in to an almost forty-year-old classic with a sense of invigoration. The movie smartly covers up modern filmmaking conventions with amazing throwbacks to the original trilogy. Seventies style facial hair can still be found on the Rebel pilots while a few smart cameos make the Star Wars initiated feel at home. The amount of Star Warsness to the film allows director Gareth Edwards to comfortably recton A New Hope. A problem with Rogue One is how the film can only be best enjoyed by a Star Wars fan. Rogue One is a decent enough war movie. The dogfights are exciting. The characters are charming and funny enough. The overall plot can't be fully enjoyed without having seen A New Hope. In addition, the cinematic impact the film has on the future of this storied franchise also can't be appreciated by an outsider. Rogue One features the most diverse cast of any Star Wars movie... as well as the franchises more intense scenes. The mentioned scenes make up some of the best moments in a Star Wars movie to date. Rest assured the future of the franchise is in the very capable hands of Disney. Rouge One is how a franchise should make the old become relevant."

I strongly feel they covered and told the story line phenomenally with 'Rogue One.' <br/><br/>Character Development - The characters are very interesting and had me seeking to know more of their back stories, especially the story behind Chirrut Îmwe, portrayed by Donnie Yen.

""bad acting"" is unheard of and impossible. <br/><br/>Vader - He returns yet very briefly in 'Rogue One' but the scenes are well chosen for how he is portrayed in the film. Vader lovers are in for a treat! Trust me, one of the scenes with Vader will have you in tears because he has returned!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Character CGI - Easily noticeable, was a little iffy at first, but I can now accept it for what it is. It's a minor thing and it will only improve in the future. <br/><br/>Have to wait another year until the next Star Wars film. <br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Go see it, you'll be amazed!

","Rogue One is a Star Wars film wholeheartedly, but it does make its own through showing a story that is an entertaining and necessary entry in the classic saga. This is a Star Wars movie unlike the ones, in that there is no opening crawl; instead we have a prologue developing some backstory on what's to follow. That may throw some audiences off for a bit, but what follows is a ride and a real experience and mandatory big screen viewing.<br/><br/>I loved this film. Rogue One surprised me; and I'm sure it will surprise many others after the majority of audiences have seen it and finally give their thoughts on the movie. Despite the reports of reshoots covering a reported 20-40% of the story, Rogue One overcame all of those problems and gives a thoroughly entertaining experience that doesn't feel at all like boring or by-the-numbers canon; and for that I congratulate Gareth Edwards. If only I could actually shake his hand with him in person.<br/><br/>Is Rogue One flawless? No. Does it need to be? No. Does it provide genuine entertainment and escapism for your hard-earned cash? Yes; absolutely. And don't worry. It doesn't bog down into unnecessary exposition or anything like Episodes I & II suffered from. Rogue One gets right down to the action and shows a story of war and the devastation it leaves in its wake.

"lee_eisenberg","8","8","18","20 December 2016"," Episode 3 1/2: the non-Jedi story
","The first thing to note about Gareth Edwards's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is that it takes place in the same universe - or faraway galaxy, as the case may be - as the rest of the franchise, but it doesn't focus on the characters who dominate most of the series. The main character is the daughter of the Death Star's unwilling designer, making this the first movie in the series to have a woman as the main character. There are no Jedis or emphasis on the force. It's all about how Jyn Erso and her cohorts try to destroy the Death Star.<br/><br/>More importantly, this is not the same sort of movie as ""The Force Awakens"". That one had more of a see-what-I-did-there? side to it, probably with the aim of entertaining the nerds and geeks. ""Rogue One"" is likely the most intense entry in the franchise, with a lot of violence.<br/><br/>Otherwise, there's the usual sort of stuff that we've come to know (including a few surprise appearances). It's not a masterpiece, but an enjoyable movie nonetheless. Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances.<br/><br/>Finally, unlike with ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot (with TPM, I didn't understand the plot until I heard ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"", a parody of Don McLean's ""American Pie"")."

","A worthy successor to the Star Wars Franchise has arrived. Gritty & realistic War movie that takes place in the fictional Star Wars universe, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like this movie. Action packed yet full of clever Star Wars references this movie digs deep into the Star Wars mythos to bring us an exciting Space Epic. Dark forces rule the Galaxy and with the absence of the Jedi Order it is up to a band of discontents led by a reluctant heroine to save the Galaxy from the newly built Death Star. <br/><br/>The characters are all shadier than their counterparts in the Original Trilogy. In this era they are all like Han Solo. The visuals are what you would expect from a major blockbuster and once again ILM studios bring back the inventive new creatures that made the 80's installments so great. By having so much of the film set in or around a city it really brings out a war atmosphere that we see so little of in the Originals. This is a real war between two sides that really hate each other. A fact that is underscored by having figures such as Director Krennic, King Organa, Supreme commander Mon Mothma all set the scene and given greater attention than lightsaber battles."
"politicidal","10","5","10","13 January 2017"," Rogue One proves Star Wars is in good hands.
","Audiences returned to Star Wars with Abrams' entertaining if unoriginal The Force Awakens. Gareth Edwards reminds audiences why we love Star Wars in the first place with his dark and exciting installment ROGUE ONE.<br/><br/>The film presents us with the Rebel Alliance in full swing against the insidious Galactic Empire which is rumored to be building a doomsday weapon, described in whispers as a planet killer. They plan to contact or preferably kill the machine's creator by hiring his daughter Jyn Erso to track him down. Jyn Erso (Jones) is outfitted with a motley crew of killers, spies, saboteurs, and one very snarky but bad-ass droid (Tudyk). They are met with resistance from skeptical rebels, persistent storm-troopers, Imperial assassins, and Darth Vader himself! ROGUE ONE is not just a space opera but it is also a wartime adventure film. The ground battles, dog fights, and duels are all staged splendidly. Those felt short-changed by the more comedic action in 'The Force Awakens' will be pleased by the gripping and often dirty shootouts and skirmishes. Darth Vader himself gets in on the action in a short but fantastic sequence.<br/><br/>As an ensemble action film, ROGUE ONE works in making its ragtag cast of rough-n-ready characters memorable, granted even if I don't remember their names. I at least know their personalities. Felicity Jones' posh accent might be off at first but she proves a resourceful and relatable protagonist. Her counterpart Cassian (Diego Luna) is a tad darker in attitude but no less heroic. Alan Tudyk is the stand-out as the burly but wisecracking droid K-2SO. Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed, and Donnie Yen demonstrate how the Rebel Alliance (and in a greater sense bravery) can arise from any person. Ben Mendelsohn is a different kind of Star Wars villain, the pompous prick of a bureaucrat who is smarmy enough to curry favor with Darth Vader.<br/><br/>The first half of ROGUE ONE is a tense spy thriller and by the third act, it's a full blown war epic. It's arguably the best action that we've seen in a Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. Although ROGUE ONE is a more brooding picture, there's still humor, heroics, and more importantly hope to be had in the movie. Especially with the closing shot."

","The apparent purpose of ""Rogue One"" was to answer the question: ""How did Princess Leia obtain the plans to the Death Star?"" And, it was a very near thing. Generally, the movie may be complimented for the acting of all the principals, the action sequences and the visual effects. It was especially nice to hear the voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I found it to be a dark and depressing movie. (Was it an anti-war film in disguise?) But, I guess that is the formula for today's blockbuster Sci-Fi movie. Put the characters through hell with no real payoff in terms of their own relationships. You wanted a Leia-Hans type romance? Forget it. Where is the emotional payoff for the fan who goes to a movie to be entertained? What made the script writers decide to kill every member of the Rogue team? I suppose that precludes a sequel. Think about it. Even some of the Dirty Dozen survived, but not this movie. In fact, for the principal characters, they couldn't even be assured that their mission was ultimately successful. <br/><br/>The final scene with Princess Leia was designed to end the movie where ""A New Hope"" begins, but it was not enough for me to be satisfied with the ending. As a side note, the CGI appearance of Leia was not well done in my view. Only consider the younger face of Michael Douglas used in the ""Ant Man"" movie, which was outstanding. The CGI Leia dubbed over the face of Ingvild Deila was not as lean and youthful in appearance as the young Carrie Fisher in the original movie, so it was not as believable as the face of Peter Cushing placed on Guy Henry. The writers no doubt wanted to create something meaningful to add to the Star Wars canon, but ultimately created a product that is irrelevant to that canon. This was one of those movies that I can say, ""It was okay, but I don't care if I see it again."" I'm not even motivated to buy the DVD when it comes out."

","The purpose of Rogue one was simple, to fix a plot hole that had bothered Star Wars fans for nearly forty years. How did the rebels get a hold of the plans for the death star and why was it so easy to destroy? At a young age, Jyn Erso's (Felicity Jones), father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) was taken by the empire, to help develop the death star. Jyn was protected by the rebels before fleeing and living on her own, until one day, the rebels receive a message from Galen, saying that his daughter is the key to everything, and if they help get her to him, he can stop the empire.<br/><br/>What I love about Rogue one, is the fact that for this film the franchise took a step back. If you ask anybody what their favorite Star Wars movie is, inevitably you will hear A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, but why? It's because these films didn't have massive budgets, big name movie stars, the top directors in Hollywood, complex story lines, special characters thrown in for the kids, simply put they were the greatest space adventures of all-time. Rogue one leaves in the special effects, but the actors are not very well known, the director has only two films under his belt, the story is easy to follow, the characters are extremely likable, (much more so than the new ones in the Force Awakens), and most import of all the story is more narrowly focused and much easier to follow. There aren't a million different things going on here, there is one objective and it is being attempted by characters you can actually get behind.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso, very much has the Katniss Everdeen tough girl thing going for her and she is paired with Cassian (Diego Luna), who has all the charisma of a young Harrison Ford, together the pair is infectious and you can't help but like them. I didn't feel any of that with Rey and Finn, in fact, I barely remembered their names. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention the scenery and special effects in the film, unlike in recent films, we see a multitude of planets, it isn't just all sand and sun. The planet in the final scene with the beaches and the energy shield in particular was just amazing.<br/><br/>Finally there is the ending, I won't give anything away if you haven't seen it yet, but I will say this. While controversial, in my opinion, more perfect it could not have been. Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and I hope J.J. Abrams took notice. This is what the future of the franchise should be. Just because you have the largest film budget in history, doesn't mean your film has to have dozens of plots, and all these random characters we don't care about. Use that money on special effects, more amazing ships, weapons, and planets, and just make Star Wars fun again in a way that Rogue One reminded us it could be."
"smanteufel","8","5","10","7 January 2017"," Great addition to Star Wars, and hopefully the first of many...
","Rogue One, being the first of many to come in Disney's new anthology to act in conjunction with the main 'Skywalker' branch is really anything but a spin off. It is a film that fits seamlessly between episodes 3 & 4 filling in gaps and possible plot holes of the original film ""A New Hope"". <br/><br/>In many ways this film is episode 3.5 due to its ability to fill in and reference points from the original trilogy, and with lingering throwback shots of C3-PO, R2-D2 and blue milk aside, some of the reused sequences featuring original trilogy cast members in unison with amazingly done CGI work: as most Star Wars fans could probably attest to the fledgling nature of it's practice in the prequel trilogy, were used to great effect in bringing back minor and major characters alike. Of particular note being Grand Moff Tarkin originally portrayed by the great Peter Cushing, who is just about brought back from the dead to aid new cast members.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones and Ben Mendelsohn among others were inspired casting choices that paid dividends in bringing the film to life, with each and every character requiring, almost disappointingly, brief introductions before the main plot line, that inferred their place within the Star Wars universe paving the way for a visually powerful story that serves to unite them as The Rebellion.<br/><br/>The imagery was astounding with particular emphasis on scenery establishing shots that really showed the depth of planetary source material available to Gareth Edwards's, with the opening scene on Lah'mu being an excellent example of traditionalist Star Wars trope emphasizing that although this is not Star Wars, it still remains within the same world. And as always, a classic orchestral score, this time composed by Michael Giacchino: a worthy successor to John Williams, aids in the creation of a powerful atmosphere in unison with costume design to recreate that original Star Wars feel that Lucas and others formed over 3 decades ago.<br/><br/>Ultimately the story of Rogue One was entirely predictable, obviously leading into A New Hope, but that did not stop this film from providing laughs, thrills and intrigue that have become synonymous within Star Wars mythology and as a great fan of the series I can only hope that each iteration of this new anthology is as good as the last."

","Is it just me, or did anyone else wonder the same thing as me after watching this film, saying to myself, WHAT, WHY, and HOW? What in blazes afternoon was princess Leia doing at a gunfight above the planet crapola? Why was there a war, instead of a covert operation that was missing? So much for a the AT-ACT surprise in Episode V where it belongs for revenge as a unstoppable force, instead to a complete wreckage of garbage dumpheap for our eyes. Totally out of place. I give the movie a 6 for the old time sake, but not more then that. Again, way, way, too many flaws, and parts that needed to be cut out of movie entirely, like the wasted first 15 minutes. Disney please just call me, I could have made a better script, and actually follow episode IV to the T, I'll give the the audience a movie that they should have had, and with such conspiracy elements, that you would be forced to make a movie in the Clone Wars just to satisfy this movie. I could make you trillions instead of millions on what Darth Vader should have done in that movie, along with Tarkin, and also those wannabe first episode (IV) patriots that stole a ship?, that sacrificed there lives in bringing this information with a war? And brought with them Red 5, and Gold Leader?, to steal the most highly secured plans in the universe?, should have done. AKA, it's sort of been done already, a film with Tom Cruise, its called mission impossible, that no one on the production must have not ever watched. The missing link of creatures was out of this film too (how come bugs in episode II come up with the Idear of destruction, but can't help build it, or belong in the science team?!), along with Storm troopers are treated mostly like incapacitated morons for the most part, too much cgi (and if you are going to use cgi, it would have been nice to see the freaking Death Star move in Light speed on the screen!), and where the crap planet are we? It was so all over the place, I thought for a moment even a person like me who knows Star Wars so well was lost. My biggest beef with this movie is the primary flaw of how Leia got the stolen transmissions, what in tar-nations happened with the several transmissions were beamed aboard this ship from episode IV? Maybe it was lost in the translation of where the crap was Luke Skywalker in episode VII? Can we please just go back to Episode IV and V, watch it and realize that this will never be done again?"

","This movie will make you wish for John Williams' amazing composing skills. The music is too loud, and has no memorable or hummable melodies. As for the rest of the movie, it is too loud with explosions. In terms of story, Rogue One is so weighed down by formulaic Hollywood story conventions that it slips into the mire and loses momentum. When Cassian gets 'secret' orders to kill Jyn Erso's father, you know it will not happen. It does not. However, our 'good' sniper also has senior Empire leader Krennic in his sights, but does nothing! Of course, they have to keep Krennic alive to have a face to face showdown with Jyn. Really Disney, take a few chances with your story-telling and risk alienating the fanboys and fangirls.<br/><br/>What a waste of a fifth of a billion dollars!"
"przemekkalwa-72803","6","5","10","1 January 2017"," For Star Wars devotees
","Rouge One is fine. For Star Wars devotees that is. And for them it was made. The rest of us will recognize it for what it is: basically another mass produced sci-fi hindered with issues, some of them surprising given the budget.<br/><br/>It's all action that does not make much sense but is entertaining enough not to make you bored (a lot at least). Everything feels very rushed at times (especially the first act). Totally forgettable characters are the biggest weakness. It's been a week since I saw it and I already can't name even one of them. The only standout is the cynical black robot. All of this defines any modern popcorn blockbuster, which ironically, is capable of earning a lot of money at the same time.<br/><br/>However, dear Disney, CGI you created is simply offensive – I am looking and you Tarkin and Leia. I mean, the CGI-ed faces look horrific and are the worst I have seen in ages: plasticky and not natural. Funny enough, even TV series (Westworld) and movies of lesser category (Fast and Furious 7) were able to present a much better implementation of the technique. Rogue One will be remembered for those couple of scenes where Tarkin looks like a last year's Playstation4 character. Truly a massive let down and I couldn't get past that at all. <br/><br/>Costumes could be better as well: Darth Vader looks silly in comparison with the previous designs, though the cameo is nice and appreciated.<br/><br/>The score which was always top notch in SW movies thanks to John Williams and his imagination, is below average this time. Michael Giacchiano is a great composer but even the best can't do much when acting as a last-minute substitute and given just 4 weeks to create something memorable. Pity.<br/><br/>I am sure that we will get more of this corporate product that Disney is force-feeding us with. People used to go to the cinema once to watch the future. Now it is just to dwell on nostalgia."
"scvj-06911","5","5","10","30 December 2016"," It was a great movie in 1977
","The reason I rated Rogue One at only a five is that I saw (and loved) the movie in 1977. And that's the spoiler: the plot is basically a repeat of the original--with a CGI Peter Cushing thrown in (because we can?) providing way more distraction than intimidation. There's a single-child family living an isolated existence on a lonely planet whose lives are bulldozed by evil empire troops. Comic-relief android. Assorted species quirky characters interacting over drinks in a bar. Crucial holographic message to launch the ACTION. Idealistic rebellion pilots volunteering to go to their deaths to save the galaxy... I felt like I should have attended the film with a clip board handy in order to check off the greatest hits of the first movie.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang and Alan Tudyk's K-2SO made a great team--thank The Force the writers didn't copy Luke, Leia and Han along with the plot--but they deserved a completely original story, and so did I. Still, the kids loved it--as did I. In 1977."
"petra_ste","8","5","10","30 December 2016"," Oh, it's... beautiful
","Rogue One (""How the Death Star plans were stolen"") is an entertaining flick with strong moments and a few issues; inferior to the original trilogy and superior to the prequels, I'd rate it higher than The Force Awakens as well because at least it's not a remake of A New Hope.<br/><br/>The film does plenty of things right - the look of it, in particular, is perfect; sets, effects and costumes are great, with a ""lived-in"" feel which is classic Star Wars. Edwards is a fine visual director, his set-pieces are neat and stylish. Rogue One also features a rare case of clever retcon: the Death Star's fatal structural flaw was implanted as a revenge by a Rebel-sympathizing scientist. Not bad.<br/><br/>Also, the final hallway scene restores in a minute all the sense of menace Darth Vader lost with the Attack of the Clones - the one prequel I completely dislike, as it portrayed Anakin Skywalker as an emo teen.<br/><br/>The main issue is haphazard characterization. Characters are well-cast and competently acted but they are sketchily drawn, missing moments of development which would have made them pop to life.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones's Jyn Erso (Dark Forces reference duly noted) has two father figures but interacts meaningfully with neither, and goes in the space of a few hours (though admittedly eventful hours) from cynical loner to idealistic leader making pep talks about hope. Diego Luna's Cassian has a promising ""Han shoots Greedo"" scene at the beginning but then we never learn the reason of his devotion to the Rebel Alliance. Forrest Whitaker's interesting Saw Gerrera gets little screen-time after a long build-up.<br/><br/>Donnie Yen has some cool moments but blind monk Chirrut and trigger-happy pal Baze (Wen Jiang) feel more like NPCs with great stats in a role-playing game than fleshed-out characters. The Alan Tudyk-voiced robot (possibly inspired by KOTOR's HK-47) is droll.<br/><br/>Riz Ahmed's pilot is underwritten for such a crucial role; we don't learn what made him desert the Empire, but we do get a confrontation with a lie-detecting octopus (?) which is supposed to drive him insane but just leaves him a bit weird for a couple of scenes. It's a silly moment which sums up the movie's aimless approach to characterization (either cut the scene or give it meaningful consequences).<br/><br/>The lack of arcs and developed relationships make several supposedly emotional moments feel unearned - like Baze calling Jyn ""little sister"" near the end (I think that was the second time they spoke to each other) and Bodhi's ""For you, Galen!"" (the two never share a scene).<br/><br/>In fact, the more coherent character is villain Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn): a smug, amoral officer who is way over his head dealing with bigger fishes like Vader and Tarkin.<br/><br/>Speaking of Tarkin, he is played by a CGI version of Peter Cushing; although it looks good as far as these things go - and they don't go THAT far yet, a seamless CGI human is still impossible without the uncanny valley effect - pasting a dead actor's appearance into a movie he didn't choose to be a part of, in a role he had no creative influence over, is creepy. As iconic as Cushing was, just recast the part.<br/><br/>There are also some puzzingly strange narrative choices. The pilot in the final battle should be flying a ship, not plugging cables. To say nothing of Krennic, who (SPOILERS) is shot down not by Jyn, whose family he destroyed, but by Cassian, with whom he has zero connections. Although Krennic's final moments - hoist with his own petard - are fine.<br/><br/>Rogue One was just a few tweaks away from greatness... still, for me it's the best Star Wars movie in thirty years.<br/><br/>8/10"
"SleepyPeePee","5","5","10","21 December 2016"," A Space Adventure Action Film with Glaring Fundamental Flaws
","When I first saw the trailer for Rogue One I knew that I could forget the fun and character of the original Star Wars trilogy, and even The Force Awakens, because this film has firmly taken the stance of wanting to be a dark, brooding action film, but is this the correct tone for a Star Wars film? I would argue not, and I felt the darker tone only served to slow down the storytelling, to the point where I had to question whether this film would have worked better as a non-Star Wars film. However, putting the tone to one side, I feel this film has even more fundamental issues.<br/><br/>The film's introduction is confusing. Scenes skip between 4 or 5 planetary destinations within the first 15 minutes or so, introducing an array of characters, forcing me to question ""what's going on, and why?"" something no viewer should be asking themselves 15 minutes into a film with a simple plot. Certain films construct a vague introduction on purpose in order to create viewer intrigue, but this certainly wasn't the director's plan with Rogue One.<br/><br/>There are no characters to speak of. Every actor seems so concerned with being stern and stoic, aside from the comic relief robot ironically, that no character ever comes out of their shell and reveals anything emotionally for the audience to connect with... But that seems to be what action filmmakers want these days: Characters that can overcome any adversity, regardless of sex or race, and look damn cool while doing so, because they're awesome.<br/><br/>No character had a story arc, other than they all ended up being incredibly heroic individuals and did incredibly heroic things, and proved to be a real credit to the Rebel cause... but we all knew that already. The film has a clear protagonist in the shape of Felicity Jones' character Jyn Erso, so it's a mystery to me why they didn't develop her character at all. Giving her a personal demon or two to overcome would have gone a long, long way.<br/><br/>The film's final scenes also struck me as an unnecessary, rushed, and cringeworthy attempt to end events at the exact point Episode IV: A New Hope starts, which gave the film a very glib ending. Does it really matter how the Death Star plans specifically came to be in Princess Liea's possession?<br/><br/>I enjoyed the action-based ending sequences, and have to commend the film for providing excellent fan service which, as a Star Wars fan, I had no problem indulging in. Visually most of the action scenes were a real treat, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend seeing this in IMAX 3D while it's still in theaters. However, I feel the visuals and fan service are the only redeeming features of Rogue One, and this was an unfortunate misstep for the franchise."

","I wasn't going to see this in theatre, but caved as I've seen them all. It has been a full year since JJ stuck it in our bums, and still 99% of the population pretends ep 7 was a ""good"" movie, so I was expecting that within minutes of Rogue One starting, I would start looking around shaking my head and sighing at how overtly stupid and ripoff things were progressing. Instead....<br/><br/>That moment never came.... It wasn't a bad movie!!! The guy from Bloodline was in it, and Donnie Yen and nothing super dumb happened. I was honestly most surprised that they actually stepped back from the hype and slowed things down, giving the human mind time to really absorb the locations and people, which actually made it more immersive. Normally big movies are like a video game cut scene: simply swirling colours and noise with no flow... This film only did that a few times, and even then the editing was slightly closer in pace to the era of ep 4 film making.<br/><br/>So basically i feel like this film had the confidence to not just rush everything to get to the action. This film i actually wouldn't mind seeing a few times, unlike ep 7. What is the plan here??? Am i to think the spin offs will be OK, and the main films just brain-dead stupidity????"
"hzephora","9","6","13","23 December 2016"," Requiem for Rogue One
","Before I drop my personal opinion of this film, I'd like to preface it by saying that I'm 54 yrs old and I was around for the original 1977 release of Star Wars (before it was even ""Episode IV""). I'm a fanboy, albeit a realistic one. I saw ""Episode IV"" in the theaters 33 times plus countless other times on DVD, along with the ESB and ROTJ (the prequels were, ::aherm::, not as appealing or ""repeat- worthy""). I have huge emotional attachment to the original series and especially to ROTJ (though I don't think it was the best of the 3) because I was with the original ""Vader fans"" and his heroics in disposing of Palpatine left me with a fantastic sense of ""redemption"" , triumph and vindication.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I'm only going to address one criticism of this film, which even I had before stopping to think about it: Character development/fleshing out. I'm not going to counter the criticism, just offer an optional ""spin"" on it.<br/><br/>When I left the theater, after watching RO, I told my wife, ""Too bad we didn't get more back story on these new guys"". But on the drive home I was thinking, ""These were total nobodies, why would we know, or be told, that much about them?"" Did Edwards intentionally give us so few details about the lives of these rogue rebels? Honestly, I don't think it was intentional. It was probably the classic case of too much for one movie. <br/><br/>However, when I stopped to think about it, what Edwards did give us was a very somber ""Tomb of the Unknown Soldier(s)"". These rebels made the ultimate sacrifice in complete ANONYMITY. No mention of them in the saga (that I can remember), other than a brief, ""Don't act so surprised your highnessSeveral transmissions were beamed to this ship by 'rebel spies'.""that's it. Hell, even the ""bothans"" got a shout-out in ROTJ. Not this groupNo fame, no glory, no name- droppingjust ""rebel spies"". Then it sunk in: how tragic! They laid down the foundation for Luke, Leia and Han's heroics, fame and glory and paid with their livesand all that history would remember them by is ""some rebel spies"". <br/><br/>This made me love the characters even more and actually left gaping feeling of regret for not getting to know them better and admiration for their selflessness. The way that Edwards managed to rip emotions out of me (even if it was unintentional) was awesome. Only now, at the end, do I understand. ;)<br/><br/>To sum it all up: even though my heart wants to hang on to the original (untouched) trilogy as the pinnacle of Star Wars drama, my mind says, ""Dude, this was at least as good as ROTJpossibly a notch above."" It was Empire-Strikes-Back-esque. There it is, I said it.<br/><br/>Look, you're gonna find your mandatory elitists and purists looking for some soul-inspiring moral story in a freakin' sci-fi flick or projecting what ""should've been"" onto movies because it didn't match their personal vision of how things are supposed to go or how they would've done it. You know the ones: pretending to know exactly what the director and/or writers intended and how miserably they failed to deliver. They elevate themselves above us ignorant plebeians by bringing down the movie with their artificial critique only because ""Hey look, it's got an 85% review on Rotten Tomatoes. Let me put myself in the 'upper' 15% crowd and bash this movie"". It's their opinion. There are more than entitled to it. That doesn't exempt it from stinking just as bad as the opinion of the 85% crowd, mine included.<br/><br/>After letting the hype of the movie wane and letting it sink in, I say: Long live Rogue One!"

In particular, Forest Whitaker's appearance as Saw Gerrera feels completely unnecessary and underwritten, as do most of the characters. I found these 2 acts lacking in energy and momentum overall.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones puts in a fine effort as Jyn Erso, but is let down by the disjointed and cluttered screenplay which seems more interested in globetrotting than establishing a much needed rapport between the main crew.<br/><br/>The 3rd act is, admittedly, a rousing action piece that gives a jolt of life to the film.

","Rogue One is the first film of a set of anthology films that is based during the Star Wars saga, when it was announced people were eager and anticipating the possibility of what the film offers, safe to say that what we see is nostalgic, epic driven and a true prequel that puts the original trilogy in place.<br/><br/>Taking place between the film events of Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, we are introduced to the events that lead to the very beginning of AHP. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is rescued by the Rebel Alliance to help locate her estranged father, who was earlier abducted by Imperial Empire and was a key creator to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon to conquer the galaxy. With new allies on her side and enough hope to change the future, Jyn and the Rebels race in time to find the weapon's schematics, thus setting the events of the famous first film we know and love.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this film was Gareth Evans's eye on detail and representation to the continuity and universe of the franchise, he does manage to make the film feel as closer to the original trilogy than the recent episode VII (which is pretty much a year old now), he gives a fresh coat of new characters, intriguing concept and a satisfying style that gives light for the film. The cast as a whole handle themselves to the level of great and convincing, with Oscar nominated actress Felicity Jones playing the lead female hero, Diego Luna (Blood Father) playing her ally and Rebel Intelligence officer Cassian, Australia's own Ben Mendelsohn (Bloodline, Killing Me Softly, Animal Kingdom) as the convincing villain with a purpose Orson and Alan Tudyk (I, Robot, Wreck It Ralph, Tucker & Dale vs Evil) as K-2SO being the standouts.<br/><br/>The visual effects we know from Star Wars is as amazing and incredible is present again, with incredible use of practical and CGI work that takes it to a level of respect for the series. The music score by Michael Giacchino (Doctor Strange, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) is engaging throughout, with use of John William's original music from the trilogy incorporated to key moments.<br/><br/>Lastly, the storyline itself pretty much summarizes how a prequel should work if you take it to heart of the original trilogy (take note of the first three prequels). With moments of character connection, development, action set pieces and set ups to AHP, this literally should have been the only prequel to be made rather than Episodes I, II, and III.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is an epic piece of pure nostalgia and fun for all old and new fans of the franchise, with a solid eye on direction, story, production value, visual effects work and key references and connections to the original trilogy. Well worth the ticket price to watch, even for its engaging and action packed climax.<br/><br/>4.5/5 - The Autistic Reviewers"

I think he has some issues with that in Rogue One, I dind't connect with characters like Cassian, Jyn and Saw Guerrera because they didn't have enough development, but Disney has improved with the feminism because Jyn was much better than Rey the ""Mary Sue"".<br/><br/>I LOVED the connections between this and Episode IV ""A New Hope"", they are so well made, like in Jedah we meet the guys that in Episode IV mess with Luke in the cantina. Overall the characters were great, K- 2 is amazingly funny just like Chirrut and Baze. Loved the appearances of (SPOILERS) Darth Vader,Tarkin,Leia, Bail Organa and the droids :). <br/><br/>Really great movie,amazing battles, expanded planets,made for a very nostalgic surprise. But now i have to say that, the FINAL of this movie was one of the best ever, and certainly the best final of all SW movies. Vader was an absolute bad ass killing them all and Leia made for a perfect final scene that connected with the beginning of Episode IV.<br/><br/>I love Star Wars, and for that, thank you Mr.Edwards for this brilliant anthology. SORRY FOR MY English"

","Just recently finished watching Rogue one. And I have to say it was not bad. Not bad at all. Took its time to get going with the introductions of the characters as such. But once it did - we had a good film on its hand....<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert - if you are going to read further into this post!!)<br/><br/>Loved the inception of Tarkin and Princess Lea in the film - well done!<br/><br/>However, I wondered if we are going to move on with this - if we could see the build up of Darth Maul in his earlier days etc, in regards to his meanings to the Star Wars Story...

"gar-bran","8","6","13","16 December 2016"," A fantastic standalone Star Wars movie
","I saw this movie at the cinema last night. Overall I think Rogue One is a very good movie. It was certainly more enjoyable that last year's outing, which was in itself pretty enjoyable. Last year's movie was more of a rehash. This movie just feels more fresh, it's a new independent story and that seemed to allow it a lot more freedom. The tone of the movie is also not something we have seen in a Star Wars movie before, especially the latter part of the film. This film shows us more of the realities of war on the ground level, something we have not seen before in Star Wars. I think the story worked very well. As you know this movie is set before 'A New Hope', the 1st Star Wars movie ever made. The story managed to weave itself in and around plots that we are already familiar with, but from this movies perspective have yet to happen. I felt this aspect was handled really well, blending the existing with the new. It passes the baton on neatly to 'A New Hope', so much so I felt like watching 'A New Hope' as soon as I got home. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the performance of all the lead actors. There has been some rumblings around the leading lady, Felicity Jones as 'Jyn Erso', I had no qualms with her performance at all. She is not going to win an Oscar but it was a good performance, she was believable, sincere and rugged when needed (which was a lot). The same is true for the other main characters in the Rogue troupe. Specific mentions to Diego Luna as 'Cassian', the mentally tortured rebel soldier, Donnie Yen as 'Chirrut' who brings some real charisma to the role of a blind Jedi with martial arts skills and also to English actor Riz Ahmed as 'Bodhi', the Imperial pilot defector with a conscience who mutinies for the good of the alliance. Very solid all around. We are introduced to a lot of different characters in here, some of them we get detail on, others not so much. The director did as much as he could in the 2hr running time. There is a lot of witty one liners and good humour, mostly from the new droid K- 2SO. I think he is going to be a firm favourite with most. He is a reprogrammed Imperial droid, so he looks quite menacing, however he is witty and quite cheeky. Echoes of C3PO, but in his own way very different. He is certainly not bound by the polite protocols of C3PO. He made me laugh out loud quite a few times. There are brief cameos by established characters here and there, just enough to make the hard core fans smile but this movie is really about the characters contained within the story.<br/><br/>The film starts of at a steady pace, setting up the plot, then grows steadily as the movie progresses, finishing in a massive crescendo at the end. For the first 2/3's of the movie I thought to myself 'this is a solid movie', however the final 1/3 of the movie takes this film to another level. There is lots in the final 1/3 that will be familiar to Star Wars lovers, epic battle scenes in space and on ground but what is very different is the tone, these are scenes of a real gritty war. This movie takes us to a place that no Star Wars movie has ever taken us before, and for me this is what makes this movie so special. I will not say any more as I do not want to spoil anything for others but the last 1/3 of this movie takes it to a whole other level of drama and intensity. Very surprising and refreshing. There are a number of standout scenes throughout the movie that will please the hard core fans. Epic battle scenes with the Death Star, Star Destroyers, Scout walkers, Terrier walkers and so on. Arguably one of the best 'big battle' scenes in Star Wars happens in this very movie. There is lots to get excited about. This brings me to the special effects which were magnificent. I saw the movie in 2D. Quite often in modern films the special effects are overwhelming, it sometimes feels like you are being hit over the head with visuals until your eyes are spinning in the sockets. No so with Rogue One. There are scenes where everything on screen is special effects but they make it work in a more believable way. Its not over the top like 'Attack of the Clones' or the other movies from that Trilogy. The sound is also really good. They have added lots of new sounds to the space crafts, low, guttural bass heavy sounds as they take off and land. Sounds you will be familiar with from modern sci-fi movies that work really well here. We are also introduced to a new musical score which sounds very similar to the Star Wars theme but it not quite the same. It's familiar in a nice way but also refreshing that it is new.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I would give it 8 out of 10. I intend to go see it again in 3D to see how that affects my enjoyment of the film."

"MartinHafer","8","7","16","15 January 2017"," An enjoyable film with a zombie in one of the leading roles.
","Back in 1977, Peter Cushing starred as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original ""Star Wars"" movie. ""Rogue One"" is set in the Star Wars world just before ""Star Wars"" and the studio decided to have Tarkin as one of the major characters, even though Cushing died in 1994. So instead of re-casting him, they did something that only modern technology could allow them to do--create a CG Tarkin that actually looks and sounds like Cushing!! It really is amazing and lifelike and for this reason alone, it's worth seeing the film. Now I pray that this sort of thing does not become the norm. Think about it...they COULD start making new films starring Clark Gable with Jennifer Lawrence or The Three Stooges and John Gielgud using CG-- it's getting THAT good!<br/><br/>As for the movie, it's NOT as wonderful and perfect as many of my friends have said nor is it a bad film in any way. Instead of recapitulating the plot, I'll just say what makes this movie different from most Star Wars films. This is NOT a cutesy film. Aside from a tiny appearance by R2D2 and C3PO, the characters, including the droid, are not designed with cuteness and marketability towards children in mind. I really appreciate this-- and thank God there is no Jar-Jar!! Additionally, unlike the previous films this one is a downer with an ending where pert near everyone dies! I mention this because I would NOT advise folks with very young kids to bring them to see it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a well made film with a lot to recommend it. My only gripe is that you KNOW what will happen because it is a gap-filler and the audiences already know what must happen in the next film. I might be inclined to say more, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this blockbuster...so I'll end it here."

"bob-the-movie-man","9","7","16","22 December 2016"," Putting the ""Wars"" back into ""Star Wars""
","Expectations have been sky-high for this first in the 'add-in' series of Star Wars films. But with director Gareth Edwards at the helm, whose past movie track-record includes just the low-budget ""Monsters"" and the less than memorable ""Godzilla"", I was frankly concerned.<br/><br/>But the English guy (with the Welsh name) has seriously delivered!<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" (I have omitted the inane and irritating suffix "": A Star Wars Story"") tells the story behind the story of the original Episode IV: ""A New Hope"". Felicity Jones (""The Theory of Everything"") plays Jyn Erso, daughter to Imperial weapons expert Mads Mikkelsen (""Doctor Strange"", ""Casino Royale""). An interrupted childhood leads the delinquent Jyn on a personal journey to become a leader in the fragmenting Rebel Alliance, as a small band of heroes battle to obtain the plans for the Empire's planet-zapping Death Star. Will they succeed (this is hardly a question worth asking given the start of Episode IV!) and at what cost?<br/><br/>I'm throwing it out there. this is the best Star Wars film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The story (John Knoll and Gary Whitta) is almost Shakespearean in its scope, leading to a moving and memorable finale. As a standalone episode within the Star Wars canon – chronologically positioned as it between ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" – the film marvellously knits the two together bringing in cameos from Episode III as well as (very surprising) cameos from Episode IV, now nearly 40 years old. The screenplay (by Chris ""About a Boy"" Weitz and Tony Gilroy, writer of the ""Bourne"" films) is whip-smart with great lines.<br/><br/>For Star Wars fans the film is also chock full of 'Easter Eggs' from the original Star Wars. All of these are great fun but – frankly – some don't make a lot of sense: for example, a chance encounter with a character in the streets of Jedha City doesn't gel with what happens an hour or two later. <br/><br/>After Rey in last December's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" we again see another kick-ass heroine and a further cinematic nod towards girl-power in the movies. But this is a nuanced heroine with more than a hint of darkness about her. Felicity Jones plays her perfectly, reflecting her transition from teenage rebel to rebel-leading teen. <br/><br/>In general, the darkness continues throughout the supporting cast with some of the heroes – notably the impressive Diego Luna (""The Terminal"") as Cassian Andor – managing to do some very anti-heroic things at points in the story. The rest of the cast, and especially Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang as dynamic martial arts duo Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus, generate the warm fuzzies enough for you – as the audience – to really care for what happens to them. This even extends to the lump of metal in the frame – the droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) – who could be the film's Jar Jar Binks but manages instead to steal the best comic lines in the film.<br/><br/>Elsewhere Forest Whitaker (""Arrival"") is underused as rebel guerrilla Saw Gerrera; Mads Mikkelsen adds gravitas to a key strategic role; and Ben Mendelsohn makes for a memorable Imperial villain. The only slightly irritating character in an otherwise stellar ensemble cast is pilot Rodhi Rook (played by Riz Ahmed from ""Jason Bourne""): more for the rather pointless way his character is written than for the Londoner's portrayal per se.<br/><br/>An equal member of the cast is the sublime music of Michael Giacchino, having the unenviable task of following John Williams into the Star Wars franchise. But he does a great job. After the shock of the non- traditional opening (and an abrupt and rather out of place Title shot) the style settles down, with some of the swelling music in the closing reel adding tremendously to the emotion of the finale.<br/><br/>The film is not quite perfect though. The first half of the film could have moved on a bit quicker to get to the breathtaking finale. And even though CGI has moved on significantly from the stick men and women walking around on the deck in ""Titanic"" in 1997, the state of the art (no spoilers, but you'll know what I mean if you've seen the film) still has room for some improvement. (Perhaps the first of these scenes could have been as subliminal as the last for better effect).<br/><br/>An outstanding effort, and one I definitely want to watch again. The Bluray version will also be a 'must-buy' when it emerges, since – with 4 to 5 weeks of re-shoots done in the summer, and many scenes in the trailer not appearing in the final cut – there must be an enormous number of deleted (original?) scenes that may tell a very different story from the one we saw this week. <br/><br/>Disney must be so, so pleased at their very expensive investment in Star Wars, and fears that the Mouse would trash the brand seem to be – thankfully – unfounded.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, please visit http://bob-the- movie-man.com.

Here we see characters who are jaded and war weary. Characters who believe in the ends justifying the means. Rogue One did for Star Wars what Deep Space 9 did for Star Trek. While some will criticise the film for this I personally think it was necessary to allow for the continued evolution of the series. <br/><br/>Nobody wants to see new Star Wars films be nothing but a hollow rehash of previous films in the series (Hello Force Awakens). Nor do we want to see a Star Wars film completely destroy what came before it in a nonsensical and childish way (hello The Last Jedi). Rogue One skillfully skirts between these two traps and shows Disney exactly where the franchise should be headed.<br/><br/>Ultimately Rogue One gives us enough familiarity to keep us in the Star Wars universe, while simultaneously giving us a reason to watch new films in the series.

","Visual story-telling takes over for clunky dialogue in what is surely the most mature ""Star Wars"" entry since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" -- the first of many planned off- shoots for the rejuvenated franchise -- goes back in time to tell the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and a crew of rebels who are tasked with finding the plans to the original Death Star, all leading up to the franchise's ""proper"" beginning, ""A New Hope."" Not your kid's ""Star Wars,"" this story is a little deeper and a lot darker than the fare we've grown accustomed to since ""Return of the Jedi"" and the cartoon-ish prequels.<br/><br/>Stepping into the director's chair is Gareth Edwards, who brought us the revamped ""Godzilla"" just a few years back. His strong visual sense serves ""Star Wars"" well. While the script doesn't always deliver much for surprises, the lush landscapes and mind-bending special effects more than make up the difference. Unlike, say, ""The Force Awakens,"" this is the sort of movie you could put on mute (or, better yet, isolate the soundtrack) and still get sucked into. Showing a restraint with CGI that few filmmakers in this day and age understand, Edwards even somehow manages to make CGI renderings of two iconic but absent actors -- a dicey proposition -- without slipping into some Playstation 3-grade graphics (think Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""cameo"" in ""Terminator: Salvation"") or offending the viewer's intelligence. As always, your mileage may vary, but to the unbiased eye, this is as good as it gets. It helps that these elements are used sparingly and only out of necessity.<br/><br/>The merry band of rebels here are a varied bunch. We get Forest Whitaker playing a kook and loving it, while Mads Mikkelsen works towards shedding his typecast role as a creepy villain. Fittingly, the best of the bunch would be Alan Tudyk's turn as the droid K-2SO, who steals virtually every scene he appears in. We also get a taste of Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and cameos from C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee stepping in for the late Kenny Baker). Heck, we even get Bail Organa, as played by Jimmy Smits in the much maligned prequels. There's just enough fan service to whet our appetites but not so much as not to distract from the main story. Likewise, keep your finger on the pause button for all of the visual callbacks and sight-gags sprinkled throughout.<br/><br/>While it's true that the film has a built-in audience, it is definitely not for everyone. It has humor, but goes darker than ever before, which may be off-putting to some. However, if your love for the series begins and ends with the original core trilogy, this one's for you. Lean, mean and a feast for the senses, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is more than just a distraction or a place-holder until ""Episode VIII: The Last Jedi"" comes out later this year. It's so good, you'll almost forget there were other prequels."

","To be fair, it IS the same Death Star from ANH, so technically there've only been three of them out of (now) eight movies. Yes, this is a prequel (Episodes I-III being prequels *wasn't* what the problem was with those movies), but thankfully it's the GOOD kind. Though you more or less know what's going to happen, it's the journey that matters...and it's one hell of a journey. Felicity Jones, as always, is absolutely lovely in her performance here as Jyn Erso (to those haters: bite your tongues, heathens!). Her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen, making the most of his screen time and sharing some emotionally effective scenes with his daughter both young and grown-up), finally addresses the exhaust port ""plot hole"" in the Death Star from the previous movies that was subject of much parody. <br/><br/>Jones, who was done a disservice in Inferno, is given better material to work with here (though I'd hoped for a different ending with her this time around). Her ability to convey the emotional/physical sides of Jyn convincingly shows why she was cast as the hardened 'badarse'. Jyn isn't 'perfect', doesn't do 'everything'/things nobody else can; she's flawed/makes mistakes and doesn't save the day all by herself. She's supported by a diverse group of characters who each bring something to the table, starting with Diego Luna's character, Cassian Andor, who's equally the hero Jyn is. They play off each other well; they fight/argue, rescue each other, and save the day together. Both actors do a remarkable job of giving their characters complexity, depth and building a believable relationship in enough time that by the end it truly resonates on an emotional level. <br/><br/>The same goes for the rest of the 'Rogue One' team. The best of which is robotic K-2SO, brought to life by Alan Tudyk. His dry line deliveries provide much of the movie's humour, but his character's also useful, his different relationships with Cassian and Jyn allow for many good moments, and he's definitely a character you'll care for by the end. Donnie Yen is also excellent as Chirrut Îmwe, who is ""one with the Force"" (and the Force is with him). Plus, he got the biggest laugh in my theatre. Rounding out the team are Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus and Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook. Each one's important and given time to shine, their camaraderie is earned over the course of the movie so the ending has maximum impact (people in my cinema had obviously grown attached to these characters, given their reactions). The movie truly feels like an ensemble piece. Those with less screen time, such as Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera and Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma (the spitting image of the original actress), are also good in their roles. Meanwhile, Ben Mendelsohn clearly knows exactly what type of movie he's in with his portrayal of Orson Krennic. <br/><br/>There're numerous character cameos (from both the OT and PT), some de-aging and even resurrecting of certain actors from the OT (which is quite the feat/impressive, although over-use of the latter spoils it a bit), and shout-outs/callbacks to the previous movies. Stormtroopers still have their classic bad aim. Darth Vader's in a small scene partway through the movie (he has a castle!), not reappearing until much later, but when he DOES...it's glorious/all you've ever wanted to see from him and *then* some. Watching him go to town with his lightsaber will make many fans happy, I'm sure. It's good to see him being scary again (the incomparable voice of James Earl Jones is as awesome/menacing as ever) after the PT nearly ruined him. Thankfully, there's no one word exclamations that make him sound like a sad cow this time. The directing's exciting (Gareth Edwards uses scale well), the action's thrilling, there's some great set pieces, the scenery on the different planets looks amazing (especially Scarif) and it's so good to be in this universe again, as Star Wars does 'space opera' like nobody else can (my audience was made up of a variety of different people, all clearly Star Wars fans, who cheered at various points throughout the film and applauded when the credits rolled, commenting how great the movie was). However, I wish that not such a significant portion of scenes/lines/moments from the trailers were missing from the actual movie. The music/score was also a bit much at times.<br/><br/>To those with issues regarding Jyn Erso as the film's 'lead', comparing her to Daisy Ridley as Rey, and/or whining about the use of more than one British brunette female character in the new SW movies, Felicity Jones said it best: ""They both have dark hair and talk funny to you Americans and they're both in Star Wars...but, yes, remarkably two young British women CAN exist in the same cinematic galaxy. I know, CRAZY!"". The ""Is Jyn Rey's mother?"" question is also answered definitively. As for the ridiculous claims of ""too many of the same 'type' of woman"" in the new movies, I'm sure there being two American males as the leads spanning across six movies wasn't regarded as ""repetitive"", so why so here? Why are there those threatened by women playing fictitious lead roles in movies when it's so often been men previously? Does the anger stem from there being CHANGE from what you think Star Wars 'should' be? And anyone who disagrees with your assessment has the same lazy over-used terms such as ""Mary Sue"" (apparently used for female characters who are skilled at more than one thing or get any sort of focus) and ""Social Justice Warrior/SJW"" tossed at them in place of actual solid justifiable arguments. There's this thing called 'confirmation bias' where, once you've made up your mind, everything will feed into your existing beliefs/theories/interpretation and you'll ignore anything you don't wish to hear. A word of advice: get over it. In the end, this is a movie about hope, and as for the naysayers...I find your lack of faith disturbing."

","This is definitely a very spectacular movie, some scenes are breathtaking, the photography and special effects are superb. I liked the dark atmosphere, slightly different from the typical StarWars one, You can find all along the movie several references to other cult movies of the past, on top of some nice cameos from the previous StarWars: Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner to mention only a few.

"TheLittleSongbird","8","7","17","2 August 2017"," A rebellion well worth saving
","Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Personally actually loved 'The Force Awakens', despite the vitriolic hate it's got.<br/><br/>The latest 'Star Wars' entry, which is somewhat of a prequel, 'Rogue One' is a worthy prequel but seems to be intended as a standalone chapter and it actually fares even better in this regard. 'Rogue One' is not as good as the original trilogy, not being as much as a genre landmark or as influential but is certainly better than any of the prequel trilogy films combined and along with 'The Force Awakens' one of the better 'Star Wars' films since 'The Return of the Jedi'. With this being said, 'Rogue One' is going to be reviewed as if considered a standalone chapter.<br/><br/>'Rogue One' has so many good things, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4/10 at least. For one thing, the production values (with a couple of exceptions) are amazing. Particularly good are the special effects, which are not only of outstanding and astonishingly real quality but actually drive and enhance the story and helps provide some great visual story-telling. It's wonderfully shot too, the cinematography being some of the most memorable and beautifully composed and transitioned of the year. 'Rogue One' similarly boasts a rousing, sometimes dream-like and atmospheric score from the always dependable Michael Giacchino, one misses John Williams of course and having a different composer takes some getting used to for someone who grew up with Williams' iconic themes, but Giacchino is a worthy replacement.<br/><br/>Also impressive is a script that treats its audience with respect, rather than talking down, being bland and soulless or so dumbed down that it lacks brains. Tension, humour, action and pathos are beautifully balanced, the references and nod a delight for any 'Star Wars' fan and written in a way that is affectionate rather than shoe-horned. The story never felt dull (to me), maintaining a snappy pace and with a lot of heart and tension. There is a great combination of what made the original trilogy so great, something that Gareth Edwards fully understood, while having its own identity, this is not a re-hash yet there is an affectionate nostalgia reminiscent of the original trilogy's spirit. It makes sense, and is darker, more poignant and richer than the whole saga has been in a long time.<br/><br/>Then there is the action, which is thrilling and has a real sense of purpose. The last forty minutes in particular are thrillingly epic. Nice to see footage of Peter Cushing and even more wonderful was seeing one of cinema's most iconic villains Darth Vader making an appearance magnificently voiced as ever by James Earl Jones.<br/><br/>Mainly the cast are strong, with a feisty and likable heroine in Felicity Jones' Jyn, terrific support from Diego Luna and especially Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn's sterlingly played villain. The best characters are K-2SO, the wisecracking robot played with terrific comic timing and gusto by Alan Tudyk, and Chirrut, beautifully realised and 'Rogue One's' most interesting character characterised splendidly by Donnie Yen.<br/><br/>Not without its faults by all means. Some characters are underused and underdeveloped, a few like Forrest Whittaker's (pretty wasted) Gerrera being pointless. Some of the pacing is jumpy and rushed which comes at the expense of making a cast of perhaps too many characters more consistently interesting.<br/><br/>Design and CGI for Tarkin is ropey and distractingly artificial. While it was nice to see younger Leia again, it was cheaply recreated and like Tarkin sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the visuals, which were otherwise amazing as said.<br/><br/>Overall, worthy prequel and a very good standalone chapter. A rebellion well worth saving. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"laurenknight-58650","2","7","17","31 December 2016"," Tedious and Underwhelming
","I had quite high expectations for this film. I enjoyed the original Star Wars films. The title character was portrayed by a well known actress. People I know have said that they really liked it. It had good reviews on this site. However, when I actually saw this film, I was very underwhelmed.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons was that I found the plot really hard to follow. It seemed like one minute the characters were on one planet, then they would fly to another. In a film where the whole galaxy is open, the filmmakers really need to narrow the setting down to avoid confusion. One would think that the names of the places on the screen would help, but since those names were gibberish to me, they did not at all. It just ended up confusing. I never new which planets the good guys were on and the bad guys and I did not know why they were on certain planets at certain times and it was all just a mess.<br/><br/>Another reason was that the character simply were not developed enough. Do not get me wrong, I am not having a go at the actors, they were fine. I just felt that I did not necessarily like any of the characters besides the comic relief robot, K2 which really spoiled the experience for me. Jyn was not developed enough and her partner lacked depth and their development was far too rushed. I did not get time to get to know any of the characters and that makes it difficult to enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is not dreadful, however flawed and it did not gain my attention. I ended up continually checking the time to see how close it was to finishing. That is a red flag for me when it comes to viewing films. It really had the potential to be a great film, it just needed a simpler plot, better character development and less coincidences when it comes to plot, especially at the end."

It might even rival or be better than the original Star Wars.<br/><br/>It's the first Star Wars film aimed at adults (although smart kids will enjoy it as well). The characters are the most realistic we've seen in a Star Wars film, but the characterizations are subtle and you have to actually pay attention to the film to truly appreciate it (which is sometimes a problem for modern audiences).<br/><br/>The effects are pretty easily the best we've seen yet and the space battle is the first space battle to rival the one in Return of the Jedi (amazing considering that film was made in 1983).<br/><br/>The last act of the movie is incredible, arguably the strongest act of any Star Wars film and the final sequence is simply amazing.<br/><br/>If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't seen Rogue One stop what you are doing and watch it now."

And they kept their British accent after 2000 years intact. That is ridiculous and very off-putting. I personally live in London and the dialogues sound like some people talking down at the pub...Just couldn't get over it.

"Semisonic","5","4","8","24 March 2017"," Looks solid, but feels uninspired
","Not a long time ago, in our very own galaxy, the filmmakers decided to create a prequel to Star Wars: A New Hope. And they really wanted to do it by the book: by putting in a list of recognizable actors, a plethora of characters and locations and tech, old and new, making the story emotional with the force of family bonds and the sense of duty. They even showed us a glimpse of Darth Vader as a cherry on top. Sounds cool, right?<br/><br/>True, on the surface Rogue One looks very grand. But, as we have learned from the case of Death Star, even grand things may have very small flaws that ruin everything. And for Rogue One those flaws are characters and pacing.<br/><br/>Indeed, with so much bound to happen and with only 133 minutes of running time, you must move quick to cram everything into the timeline. But for some reason Rogue One doesn't feel consistent in its density. At times it's painfully slow and almost boring, with people talking and arguing and debating some more. And at other times it flicks through characters and hops planets like a mad rabbit, causing a degree of ""what is this place/person again?"" frustration even in a prepared SW viewer, while outright alienating the freshmen (although the same freshmen could digest The Force Awakens just fine).<br/><br/>Another stone pulling Rogue One down is the main characters, or rather the actors playing them. I don't mind Felicity Jones or Diego Luna at all, they are fine actors per se. But they are not fit for the action figures. Jones may deliver a sharp punch at times, but mostly she makes that sad puppy face - and you just quit buying into her fighter spirit. Same with Luna: no matter what he does, he looks awfully tired and overwhelmed, dragging our mood down with him.<br/><br/>Maybe if we had characters as vivacious and fierce as Rey and Finn as protagonists, the whole story would feel different. But we have what we have, and despite all the graphic lushness, a number of nostalgia-inducing moments, characters twisted and conflicted inside, and actual space fights, Rogue One feels like one major drag, where everyone does something, but only the bad guys actually believe in their cause. The space fights are overly long and tediously repetitive, the graphic lushness mostly resorts to cold space or desolate deserts, and even the character twists and development, with an unexpected sense of common purpose and a timely remorse for the former wrongdoings, have a whiff of generic movie psychology. Two slightly redeeming points of this film are the blind monk, but even he gets annoying towards the end with his repetitive chanting and inconsistent potency, and the Ben Mendelsohn's character, who is a typical Mendelsohn's not quite good but not entirely evil guy. As a mirror character of Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux from The Force Awakens, he's done a much better job. Too bad it wasn't enough to salvage the whole enterprise.<br/><br/>When The Force Awakens turned out to be a soft reboot instead of being an independent story, I was hoping that maybe it was for the best and that way the filmmakers would be able to expand on the original story and give us additional depth, the chance that was skipped back in the time of the original trilogy. Rogue One is definitely an attempt to fill the blanks and deliver some background. But so far it's more of a miss than a hit. So hopefully it will be a lesson learned for the SW film crew: that spin-offs require as much effort as the main story films. You were inspired enough to bring the Star Wars back to life - now use that inspiration again and put it to good use."

","""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is every bit as good as you've heard; even this non-""Star Wars"" geek had great fun with it. I'd cheerfully give it a 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend you give it a try even if you don't typically enjoy the franchise.<br/><br/>Die-hard fans are currently noting all of the things that make this film unique in the series: it's the first ""Star Wars"" movie without a Jedi, the first without the trademark opening text-crawl, the first one without a lightsaber duel.<br/><br/>Casual fans might be more impressed with more general differences. Two stood out for me.<br/><br/>One, this is the first Star Wars film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) that seems aimed mainly at adults. Yes, the fairy tale elements are still there — we have an underdog orphan searching for her father, the requisite anthropomorphic aliens, and a humorous robot mascot (which surprisingly worked quite well). But those elements are absolutely upstaged by a bona fide war film, complete with tactics, strategy, panic, collateral damage and casualties. I remember thinking during a surprisingly gritty urban warfare scene that it was as though some filmmakers had taken a scene from a film like ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) and set it within the ""Star Wars"" universe.<br/><br/>Two, I think that this is the most human Star Wars movie we've had since ""Empire."" It wouldn't be ""Star Wars"" without the aforementioned aliens and robots, and plenty of references are made to the Force and the Jedi. But this is a movie about ordinary people. Yes, there is one larger-than-life character who appears  force-sensitive? This universe's equivalent of Marvel's ""Daredevil?"" (This was a confusing story element that didn't always work for me.) But we are presented primarily with all-too-human anti-heroes who feel fear, suffer, and die.<br/><br/>Isn't that more exciting than watching cartoonish aliens fight armies of equally cute battle-droids? In this film's better moments, it made me feel like a was watching a ""real"" war with ""real"" people, and I was surprised to find myself actually rooting for the good guys in a ""Star Wars"" film — this has been a series that I've long half-dismissed as being essentially children's stories.<br/><br/>Seriously, this was a good movie.

But based on the recommendation by a co-worker, I gave this one a try and boy was I pleasantly surprised! Rogue One has everything the other post episode VI attempts lacked. It's original, but not overdone. It's intense, unpredictable and holds this delicate touch of surprise. The funny character (K-2SO) is witty, yet not annoying. And its finale might be even compared to some of the original SW episodes, also with a connection to the beginning of the episode IV. so fluent and fitting, the other new SW films can only dream about. There were some cringe-worthy moments, like the cliché and somewhat chaotic start of the movie, which eventually moved along into very nice cinematic experience though and there's also the much debated CGI characters of Tarkin and princess Leia. While the later mentioned was done much better (has also just about 2 seconds of screen appearance), Tarkin's face has this classical ""CGI look"" of a computer game character and in my opinion the effort of bringing the original character didn't add up the desired value for the whole picture. Apart from that, Rogue One is a great Star Wars film and restored my faith in the force. ;)"
"inkblot11","10","4","8","9 January 2017"," I laughed, I cheered, I cried for this FABULOUS new entry into the Star Wars Saga
","On a remote farming planet, a gentleman named Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) lives with this wife and young daughter Jyn (later Felicity Jones). They are part of the rebel alliance, trying to stay away from the Imperial forces, for Galen is a brilliant scientist and they want him to work for their destructive Empire. Its not known how long this family has been in hiding but they have schooled their daughter on where to hide if the BAD FOLKS come calling. They do. Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry) flies in and Galen tries to face his team alone. All too soon, his wife is shot as she tries to save her husband and Dr. Erso is captured. The forces fail to find Jyn but, instead, a friend of her father's, Saw Herrera (Forest Whitaker) rescues and raises her. Flash forwarding several years, we find that Jyn is in a prison work camp, somehow abandoned by Saw. When a transport she is riding in comes under attack by rebels, she escapes and soon matches up with Cassian (Diego Luna). Initially, they save each other as they maneuver this outpost of a planet. Yet, soon Cassian's plan is spilled. He must go to Saw Herrera's planet so he can FIND details of Dr. Erso and learn the fate of a trader pilot sent to talk with Saw as well. With his trusted ""re-programmed"" Imperial Droid, K-250 (Alan Tudyk), they are amazed to find that Jyn is his little girl. Off they go. It is on this sacred planet that they discover a monastery is in ruins and the whole place turned into a giant mining establishment, collecting fuel for a new, deadly weapon of the Empire. You guessed it, its for the Death Star. Two monks, one blind, help Jyn and Cassian locate Saw, where Jyn views a holographic message sent from her father, explaining his ultimate triumph. Despite having to build the Death Star, he has put in a secret spot of vulnerability, where the massive weapon can be destroyed. They must go to the planet where video blueprints are housed and retrieve it for the Rebels. Oh, is that all? When they make it back to the Rebel base, Jyn and Cassian are stunned that the group is ready to surrender, having witnessed the power of the Death Star. But, a small group, including the two monks, the rescued pilot, and K-250 are ready to risk all! Will they be successful? There's no question what this answer will be, but there is much sacrifice involved, sadly. This FABULOUS new entry to the Star Wars saga is exceptionally well done. The new characters are amazing, with Jones and Luna making a fine pair, and the rest so endearing, so brave. As the cast boasts a wide variety of alien creatures, as well, it is a great joy. Next, the sets couldn't be better, with an absolutely amazing creation of different planets to feast your eyes upon. Add on the great costumes, superb special effects, terrific story and never-lagging direction and here is a film to cherish indeed. George Lucas himself is most likely thunder-struck at the connection to his own first story, as this one takes place right before the actions of A New Hope. But, a warning, this is probably the most tear-generating entry of the series, so bring tissues. There is even a scene which hearkens back to another great film, Deep Impact, and is equally poignant. But, in truth, don't go rogue and think you can miss this one. Get off your behind now and rush to the theater!"
"karakovacs47","5","4","8","8 January 2017"," Am I the only one who didn't like it?
","I've seen all the Star Wars movies, and while I'm not a massive fan, I can definitely appreciate the old ones after seeing this new addition to the saga. The original three (and following prequels) had a certain heart that was inherently missing from Rogue One. While the CGI wasn't as good, and the fighting wasn't as badass, it just connected viewers to the storyline a lot more than Rogue One did. Even the prequels had a certain charm, because you could see how hard they were trying to please Star Wars fans, and continue telling the story. This movie was trying to be cool and gritty, but it ended up ruining everything that Star Wars is known for. <br/><br/>What it lacked in charm, it also lacked in Star Wars-ness. You easily could have swapped out ""death star"" for any other futuristic sounding weapon and you'd have had your run of the mill action movie. It felt more like Avatar than Star Wars, especially since there were so many human characters and so few aliens/droids. <br/><br/>EFFECTS Rogue One was purely a money grabber, and you could see that all their energy had gone into the effects (although Princess Leia looked crazy fake). <br/><br/>You also couldn't really appreciate the CGI, because it just looked like live-action shots. Also, seeing the same things for 2 hours makes you pretty numb to it by the end. <br/><br/>SCRIPT The script was the laziest piece of garbage I've ever heard, and the part where Jyn finds the secret plans labeled ""Stardust"" could be seen from a mile away. The plot was so simple, yet I also found it hard to understand what was going on since the pacing was so choppy and there were so many irrelevant characters.<br/><br/>They repeatedly tried (and failed) to add comedy to the film, one example being the cringy banter between Jyn and the robot that no one cared about. <br/><br/>The fighting sequences were also too frequent, and it felt like the last 45 minutes were pure action. It made for a rather anti-climatic ending, since we'd already seen 100 explosions throughout the duration of the movie. <br/><br/>ACTING Everyone was fine. Literally no person stuck out in my mind, and no one had a developed enough personality to even distinguish a single trait. All the team mates on Rogue One were so blandly portrayed that I don't remember any of their names. The blind guy was actually quite annoying, and the praying thing got old after 2 seconds."

","After last year's mildly entertaining yet sometimes frustrating TFA, I was ready to give up on modern Star Wars. However, I saw the trailer for this film and I said to myself, ""why not give it a second chance?"" and I bought a ticket for a night showing the day the film was released into theaters. And I'm very glad I did. Rogue One is a fresh new take on different characters that are developed to be loved by the audience, although the same classic Star Wars feel is present with plenty of charms. For example: instead of the irritating Jar Jar Binks that doesn't fit in a Star Wars movie, a new comic relief named K-2SO is introduced as a sarcastic yet hilarious droid that doesn't need to incorporate childish fart jokes to be funny, providing the sassy humor that all OT fans adore. The CGI is absolutely seamless; everything blends in incredibly realistically with the actors and props, and the action sequences are some of the most creative I've seen at the theater this year; remember that glorious airport fight scene that Civil War showcased? Well, Rogue One tops that in as many ways as possible! Oh, and the Easter eggs, cameos and Darth Vader are just the icing on the already delicious cake- they will leave you jaw-dropped. Go see Rogue One, but make sure it's in 2D, as 3D will ruin the already amazing visuals. Have a blast!"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>After the Empire kill her family and destroy her home, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) escapes and finds herself stranded in a prison. However, her father Galan (Mads Mikkelson) survived and became a Federation officer, secretly devising a weakness inside the structure of the mammoth Death Star that will make it susceptible to an attack. Meanwhile, Erso and a ragtag group of warriors, including Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and sassy android K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) must hatch a plan to grab the blueprints for the DS, as the diabolical Commander Krennic (Ben Mendolsohn) marches forth with his destructive plans.<br/><br/>The Force Awakens re-igniting the fan base for Star Wars at the end of last year is a debatable argument, since with or without this thundering revival of the franchise, it would still be one of the most enduring in the history of motion pictures. With the first film entering its fortieth year this year, the SW saga provides a service to the art of motion pictures like no other, a thunderous, colourful assault on the senses that will always be suited to the big screen and understandably has an enduring fan base. Now another big screen instalment takes the story back before the start, for fans of the series obviously, with unsatisfying results.<br/><br/>An all star cast comprised of hot young talent and older, experienced hands have all ploughed into this venture, but the result is something with big ambitions, but no sense of direction or genuine engagement with the audience. Director Gareth Edwards, getting a name for making big screen ventures of established franchises, simply doesn't have a strong enough plot to guide this effort, nor the material to create character development that makes you care about the characters. As a result, none of the cast turn in performances that could be considered their best, and you may struggle to stay awake during the none spectacular bits.<br/><br/>Visually, it's as amazing as ever, a swooping, swirling adventure that could beat any theme park ride, even if some of it feels a little 70s esque. But, standing on its own, it really leaves wanting. **"
"jahleelpridgenbiz","3","4","8","6 January 2017"," meh over hyped ...
","OK where to begin , this movie was visually stunning but sadly not too original i find this movie to be boring and just so long and lame. i find myself not liking the hype i hate when a movie gets hyped up for nothing, Disney already knows the fan base for star wars is immensely huge and easy to sell a star wars story to and make a huge profit. so the story itself was not action packed mainly just talking and boring in dept star wars fillers so i realized that the movie isn't for movie goers it's for star war die hard fans . overall this is for a fan boy anybody with common sense will find this movie absurd and unnecessary. so yes 4/10 stars seems fair at least it had good visuals and a Darth cater cameo/scene."
"niko-stolwijk","4","4","8","4 January 2017"," A movie without surprised and mediocre acting
","I was very disappointed by this movie. The story was one cliché connected with another. No surprises. Only action and more action. It is very predictable. I expected at least a reasonable story but halfway this movie I thought it was a waste of money. I have seen all the star wars movies in cinema and this one was the biggest disappointment! If you like action watch it! If you like a story with it turn around and go home! My son of 16 agreed with me about thus episode. Sad how they can destroy a franchise! Only one character jumped out : Darth Vader The other characters were extremely blunt and did not make an impression on me and my son. At the end the two main characters die! My son remarked that this was good because he didn't want to see them again in a next episode. So I don't agree with the majority of the reviewers who adore this movie. The only reason why I gave it at least 4 stars was the quality of the special FX."
"connorbayne","7","4","8","2 January 2017"," Overrated, but not bad.
","Many are praising this movie saying its the best star wars yet and its better than the force awakens but sadly, i disagree. i don't believe it was bad but i don't believe it was great. <br/><br/>I would like to start this review with the positives. I loved the entire Battle on Scariff. It was ruthless and intense, like a ""Saving Private Ryan"" feeling but star wars. I also enjoyed K-2SO's sarcastic humor and Ben Mendelsohn played an amazing bad guy. Lastly the ending was so intense i couldn't move as Vader just slaughters rebel troops. Even though I knew the rebels eventually get the plans i still received goosebumps during the scene. <br/><br/>The negatives to Rogue One mainly fall in the first hour of the movie. You are introduced to the new characters but it felt off putting switching to a new location every so often and having many useless scenes. It feels like the first hour of the film was a mixture of introduction and filler and the real movie starts when they get to Scariff. Another factor that falls on the negative is the CGI characters that are actually getting praise. The CG Tarkin looked OK until he stood by someone and it stuck out pretty bad. The Leah wasn't so bad but i would have really enjoyed the scene better if they didn't show her face at all. The final negative to this movie was the score. After viewing the film the first time none of the music in the film called out to me at all. In the force awakenings i felt the score was more star wars. But the score for Rogue one wasn't bad but most star wars movies have amazing scores. <br/><br/>Rogue One is a good movie, not a great movie, not a bad movie. I enjoyed the last 45 minutes a lot but still fell to my expectations."
"chadflaherty-223-324308","5","4","8","23 December 2016"," Fun, but flawed
","I went into this film with high expectations based on the internet hype and I must confess I was disappointed. The high use of CGI, especially on character faces, was something that should have been flagged and eliminated. As one who grew up watching the original films, the use of practical effects was what pulled me into the world of Star Wars. The CGI effects of the prequels were everyone's biggest complaint and that trend detracts from some great performances. Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, and Mads Mikkelsen are fantastic, and Alan Tudyk easily has the best lines of any character in the film. I think Forrest Wittaker character was wasted in this film and more could have been done with him. But my biggest disappointment was the tease of the Kyber crystal that Jyn Urso has in her possession and nothing comes of it. I had hoped there was some latent Jedi hidden in her, which may have another been a reason Urso hid his family from the Empire. But after the hype has died down and we sit down to watch it again, the CGI will bring back the pangs of disappointment, just like Jar Jar does for episode one. Tarkin should have been re-cast. Plain and simple. The AT-AT's in combat looked like a video game battle and the Leia cameo at the end was completely unnecessary. By all means, see it. It is Star Wars after all and the story is worth the viewing. It has a lot of heart, character diversity and depth."
"jm_sanfilippo","6","4","8","22 December 2016"," No depth to the story, too much humor, and overall unnecessary
","So I saw ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" the other day, and I will say that it was exactly how I expected it to be. I was not disappointed, but I also was not excited. I feel that this film was over-hyped, and if compared to the hype, it under-delivered. The film was not bad, just unnecessary. The acting and special effects were great, the story wasfine, just unnecessary. All of the main characters died at the end, something I knew going in to the film, as they do not appear in later films. I felt like the movie was a waste of screen-time and a waste of money (on the film-makers part). This story would have made a great book, but putting it to film was a waste. As a movie in general, I give it a 7/10knowing that it was a Star Wars movie and having seen the movies coming before and after it chronologically, I give it a 6/10. <br/><br/>This also brings me to my view on modern Star Wars. I really enjoyed Star Wars episodes IV-VI and even episodes I-III. I feel like the whole saga told a great story. Then Star Wars was bought by Disney. I was one of the optimistic people, I thought Disney would do some cool films, but after seeing Episode VII and Rogue One, I'm disappointed. I think the main Saga should have stopped at Episode VI. Episode VII was just a copy of Episode IV, but with new characters and it's adding to a story that could've and should've ended already. I still have high hopes for a solo Boba Fett Film (one of the few extended universe films that I think will actually be interesting), but I'm even worried for that because of my next point. Something especially seen in Rogue One, there is way too much humor in the modern Star Wars movies. Don't get me wrong, I like humor in movies, but the humor was almost gross, how in-your-face-obvious it was, very typical of a live-action Disney movie, something I don't want in a classic like Star Wars or Comic Book Movies (but that's a whole 'nother story). This cringey humor contributed to me lowering the score of Rogue One. The film, I think, should've covered more material, should've made the audience have to think more; it was easy to watch the film without having to think deeply about it, removing some of the fun of film-watching. Lastly, I'm brought to the music. It sounded like Star Wars, but it wasn't Star Wars. Is this a bad thing? I'm not sure yet. <br/><br/>I'm still digesting this film, so my opinions may change over time, but I doubt that they will change much. When it comes to story, there wasn't much there to digest anyway. I think this film would've been better off as a book."
"tiparrish","8","4","8","21 December 2016"," Way to bring Star Wars back !
","Star Wars Rogue One, a story that takes place just before New Hope. This movie the best Star Wars movie since the original series. It hearkens back to a story-line and story feel of what the franchise historically represents. A good mix of comedy (without the antics of the Ewoks or JarJar Binks),drama and action. The last 30 minutes of the film was pure awesomeness with an unexpected, unpredictable ending. I loved the good mix of on location cinematography and digital-FX. Great appearance of ""Lord Vader"" who owned the last few minutes of the film. Great story and character development This is a must see over the holiday break, ""Two Thumbs Up""!"
"themovieparadise","10","4","8","19 December 2016"," Absolutely Incredible!
","This film is the epitome of a fan's movie. Director Gareth Edwards has been a fan of Star Wars his entire life, and has described making this movie as being able to play with his action figures again. And let me just say that this movie is the visual representation of that statement. I was in awe of just how spectacular the visuals were. The third act of this movie consists of the Rebel's attempt to retrieve the plans, and it turns into an all out war, and it's absolutely magnificent. We are really at the height of Star Wars, simply because we now have the technology to portray the audaciousness of the idea of the franchise. We can show space battles and X-Wings and AT-ATs in the true way they were meant to be shown, and it makes for some of the most visually compelling and gripping imagery ever shown in a Star Wars movie. I cannot stress enough just how great the third act truly is. I will say in full confidence that this film has the best action sequences from any Star Wars movie. Others in say A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back are more impressive because of what they were able to accomplish with their means and limitations, but Rogue One has the greatest looking sequences Star Wars has ever put to screen."
"mannofrey","10","4","8","18 December 2016"," Whether you are prequel hater or a prequel lover you have to back this film with your vote. Come on guys, get it together!
","I've watched the other Star Wars films hundreds of times but I'd have to rank this in the top 3 at the least. Now everyone saw there was a space battle in the trailers but it gets much better than the trailers give it service . This has to be the best space battle ever and every actor exceeded expectations. Most of the music for the film wasn't that good it seemed to try and mimic John Williams trumpets and repeated notes and that was kinda stupid. I was hoping they would mix it up a bit. <br/><br/>Whether you are prequel hater or a prequel lover and have noticed that the OT is no where near the god level trendy people would have you believe. This is a Film that we should all be able to agree exceeds the expectations of Disney  (all though I'll admit it has more to do with Gareth Edwards directing it) and the actors themselves did far better than many would expect. I will now explain why every real Star Wars fan should rate this a solid 7 to 10 , no exceptions (just look at all the other trashy films rated at least an 8).  Felicity Jones especially surprised and actually looks like she trained for this and enough to beat down actual soldiers , honestly. Donnie Yen ( IP man) closely rivals his performances in IP man and other great acting jobs. Diego Luna surprised me as well in the trailers he seemed very dull and a boring character overall but that was definitely not the case they clearly showed him to have great depth even with subtle mannerisms. Even the droid was much better than what the trailers would lead you to believe. <br/><br/>Now some cons: first off Gareth Edwards could have made sure the trailers were better made and marketed toward people , that's one thing good about JJ Abrams he literally got TFA trailers to be as intense and interesting as some of the best films ever. Again the music could have been better but that's hard to judge at first. The Rebel counsel meeting that you see in the trailers and in the movie it wasn't that epic either but it's understandable. The beginning was a bit rough and possibly could be confused with being choppy editing. That's really it and I doubt anyone can come up with any significant negatives in reviewing this movie."

","Rogue one is outstanding. The story is the best of all the Backstories that needed to be told. The movie has everything going for it. The pacing is remarkably done.

Action suspense comedy Tragic events and even a hint of romance everything has the right amount and the right touches. Even the CGI is done wonderfully . The director and story writers studied Episode 4 very well and captured its spirit. The movie comes off as a triumph and it is. It's simply a Star Wars Tale told from long ago from before the Adventures of Luke Skywalker even began. And When Han Solo was the king of the Smugglers. A quick tossed away line in episode 4 When Mon Mothma tells our heroes how they got the plans. A group of Bothan Spies died getting those plans for us she told them. Rogue one is that story.

","I'm not the hugest fan of Star Wars but I still consider myself a fan of the movies. I love the story, I love the characters and I love the cast (yes, even in episode 1, 2 and 3). When I heard that Rogue One would be a prequel to episode 4 revealing how the Rebells got the Death Star's plans I was excited and interested. The inexistence of the opening credits left me insecure of what was going to come. The first scene of the movie, where the Ersos are being chased was completely stupid in my opinion. Why don't they all leave? Why do they leave their daughter alone and stay? Why does Lyra come back and pratically suicides? Well, I tried to forget that, since it was the first scene. Then the first scene with Cassian was extremely confusing and I still can't understand what happened there. Where was he? Who was the guy who gave him the information of the pilot?<br/><br/>I feel like the whole movie was: we have a problem > there is a risky solution for the problem > we're solving the problem > damn, there is a obstacle right when you were about to solve the problem > someone saves the situation and you solve the problem > well damn, there is another problem. And this is repeated throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>It was extremely disappointing to be honest and even though I liked to know how it all happened that led to episode IV, I just think the movie was not done in the best way possible but rather in a mediocre way."

Granted nothing can be worse than the whole Ja Ja Binks mistake but still just stop now with the continuation with the story heavily laden with CGI. It's time to put it to bed.

I mean really? She gets found by Saw Gerrera, played in Razzie winning fashion by the usually great Forest Whitaker. We don't really know what happens after that because it's glossed over very glibly, but somehow she turns into a criminal, etc.<br/><br/>So much of the movie is just a gloss coat of story. I would have liked to hear the characters telling of their back stories at least, but there really wasn't much development there at all.<br/><br/>The story itself was OK - we see our hero gathering together her rag tag band of heroes, and off they go to make the ultimate sacrifice.<br/><br/>Did I care that they didn't make it out? Nope, didn't really care about any of them at all.<br/><br/>Did I care when Han Solo got killed by his douche of a son in The Force Awakens? Hell yeah. I was like NO!!! <br/><br/>The best parts of the movie were when Darth Vader was in it (briefly) and when R2D2 and C3PO made an appearance. Those parts cheered my Star Wars fan's soul.<br/><br/>It wasn't like it was a bad movie, it was quite good - but will I buy it when it comes on DVD, well maybe to complete my collection, but I doubt I will watch it over and over like the others.<br/><br/>The music was great and the special effects were stellar as always.<br/><br/>The casting was ho-hum, but mostly it was the 2 dimensional scripting that bothered me. I like to have back stories, I like believable motivation in my characters.<br/><br/>Mostly, I expect to give a damn who lives or dies.<br/><br/>This latter point bothered me the most, and to be totally frank, when Forest Whitaker's character died, well, it was a relief because his over-acting was awful and his character's arc made little sense.<br/><br/>I gave it 6/10 because I wanted to be honest, as a Star Wars fan of 39 years and counting, that it wasn't as great as I have been hearing from everyone else."

","I wanted to love this movie. I had high hopes that this spin off would leave the franchise feeling grounded again and make a little more sense than the last flick... oh boy did it NOT.<br/><br/>While some of the visuals are certainly cool, overall the film is gray and bland, much like the story it aims to tell. The plot couldn't go wrong... rebel spies stealing plans to the Death Star certainly is a story worth a feature length motion picture, definitely a story I wanted to see fleshed out... but now that I've seen it, I changed my mind! The musical score is loud, obnoxious, and distracting. The CGI is pretty unconvincing. The special effects range from ""awesome"" to ""please stop"". The movie flows like paint dries. There are some interesting ideas in there, but anything remotely so is executed with the competency of a 12 year old boy's fan fiction. The acting is all around hammy and cringe-worthy with the exceptions of Papa Erso and the charming Imperial droid that most certainly deserved a better movie and script to work with, the lovable K-2SO.<br/><br/>Not a single one of the characters has a clear motivation. I was constantly left wondering, what does this person want? What little information I received came through vague theatrical self-important dialogue that didn't seem to reveal anything substantial as much as provide loose context for why characters were going from point A to B. The bad guy wanted to stop the rebellion, and the protagonist wanted to find her father... but beyond that, I was never quite sure why anything was happening other than, ""save the rebellion!"" and ""rebel scum!"" for the sake of violence.<br/><br/>The plot is a vehicle for shaky cam style action and haphazard fan service... much of the fan service creating all new plot holes to make up for the non-existent plot hole this movie promised to fix. At least C-3PO being owned by Uncle Owen in Episode II can be explained by ""oh, he just forgot... racism against droids or whatever."" The plot holes here are just baffling... leaving me wondering if whoever came up with this ever actually saw the original 1977 film, or if anyone involved had half a brain to question the blatant contradictions to the already shaky continuity. <br/><br/>Maybe nobody really cared. Gotta get dat money.<br/><br/>This movie is boring at best, and utterly infuriating at worst. There's one insanely awesome scene between this heap and a 0 rating. The Force Awakens stumbled with its derivative revival of the franchise. But this movie completely ruined everything it touches. If you like Star Wars references, puns, shaky cam action scenes, archetype characters cut outs, the Empire's fashion sense, or religious chanting, this is the movie for you. Don't expect the rich in depth story telling Star Wars is known for, and don't expect to see the deep reflection of war and sacrifice the delusional fans will insist this is... don't listen to them! Ahh! They're delusional, it's a trap."

I also have to say that after seeing 'Rogue One', I will never be able to watch the beginning of 'A New Hope' the same ever again, knowing the story behind the plans. Now, to address the controversial animation of Peter Crushing, I do not see what is wrong with it. Using CGI to bring back to life a deceased actor, if anything, says that he is irreplaceable, there is no disrespect for him. So, what I have to say for 'Rogue One' is that it defiantly deserves its place in Star Wars and in 20 years time should be thought of as one of their greats."

And it was not because of the X-wings or the Death Star or the lightsaber fights... It was because of great characters, which Rogue One is completely lacking. These characters are empty shells pretending to be characters and it makes the story feel stale and uneventful. Why should I get invested in these action scenes if I don't care what happens to the characters? Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments, particularly near the end. But these moments would have been so much stronger if I felt even the slightest feeling for any of these people. You can wait for the blu-ray with this one."

","It is an okay film, for you can't expect much from something whose story line serves the purpose of filling a gap between two well- established ones. Rogue One is Disney's new cheese product from its cash cow that is Star Wars. <br/><br/>The American film industry's current business model is, of which Disney is no exception, to rehash, remake, and salvage old successful films to make as much money as possible. They worship money. That's their whole religion now. So, they will never give us a good film that can excite us about the future. Gaming is surely becoming more fun than watching films these days. <br/><br/>1 star for grittiness and visual executions. <br/><br/>1 star for Tarkin CGI -- very well done! <br/><br/>1 star for the final battle scene -- felt like Star Wars indeed. <br/><br/>2 stars for Felicity Jones. She's nice to look at! Had the right materials been given to her, she would've shone. Rooting for her next film instead!"

","I caught myself, as the final battle of ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY was enfolding, smiling to myself.  I had a warm feeling in my heart and realized that THIS is the Universe I wanted to spend more time with.<br/><br/>You can have your MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE or your DC UNIVERSE or even your HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE, for me the best universe is the STAR WARS UNIVERSE.<br/><br/>And, following the bright return to this universe of THE FORCE AWAKENS,  ROGUE ONE is a welcome addition and really gives me A NEW HOPE for this expanded world (see what I did there?).<br/><br/>Telling the story of how the rebels stole Death Star plans just prior to the original Star Wars movie (now called STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE), Rogue One follows plucky heroine Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) who leads a rag-tag group of misfits (is there any other kind) who plan a daring raid to steal the plans to the Empire's newest weapon THE DEATH STAR.<br/><br/>Jones is fine (if a bit bland) as Erso (but I think it is the way the character is written), HOWEVER,  it is the band of misfits around her that really shine.  Diego Luna is solid and stalwart as gung-ho Rebel Leader Cassian Andor, Riz Ahmed is sensitive and caring as Bodhi Rook, an Empire pilot who defects to the Rebellion and Baze Malbus and (espcially) Donnie Yen as friends and compatriots Baze Malbus and would-be Jedi Chirrut Imwe.  These 5 are fun to watch together and I, for one, would like to see more of their adventures.<br/><br/>But, stealing this movie from all of them, is the 6th member of the gang - Alan Tudyk's marvelous motion-capture droid, K-2SO - an Imperial droid that has been reprogrammed to work with the rebellion.  <br/><br/>But these heroes wouldn't be worth it if it wasn't for the villains they are up against.  Ben Mendelsohn is at his Ben Mendelsohn-y best as opportunistic, ambitious Imperial Director Orson Krennic, the mastermind behind the Death Star.  Also, the filmmakers found out a way to bring back long dead Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin.   I've heard some negative things about this CGI attempt to bring Cushing back, but it worked for me.  And, of course, there is a certain heavy-breathing, dark-cloaked Super Villain that shows up to bring menace, fear and some kick-buttery.<br/><br/>And that is another thing that works for me in this film, the way the filmmakers brought in other elements of the the original Star Wars film and melded it very well into this film.  It was fun the recognize these Easter Eggs when they occurred (though, on 2 occasions, they were jarring and took me out of the film).<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film?  Well...no.  The middle sags a bit and I felt that both Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen were wasted in their roles (the filmmakers could have easily found an interesting ""no name"" to play these roles), but these are nits as director Garth Edwards brings the action at a fast and furious pace, throwing in bits for the fanboys here and there and delivering a story with real stakes that dovetails nicely into Episode IV.  As a matter of fact, we went right home and popped in our well used DVD copy of Episode IV and my 16 year old daughter stated that this film made much more sense to her now.<br/><br/>Which, I think, is what the filmmakers want.  Skip Episodes I, II and III but see Rogue One ""the prequel that always should have been"" - a well made addition to the Star Wars canon.<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) Star (wars) and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"starcrusader","10","5","11","22 December 2016"," Outstanding prequel that rests well with the original trilogy
","Warning, review containers spoilers. Rogue One is the first in a presumably long series of new stand-alone films in the Star Wars Universe. Next up will be a film concerning the origins of Solo, and after that it could be Fett, Yoda or simply anything else. Rogue One (also called Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) is set after the barely tolerable Revenge of the Sith, and immediately before Star Wars, itself renamed to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope in 1981, during its re- release after Empire Strikes Back. The director, Gareth Edwards manages to pull off a film that is darker and grimmer than anything seen since Empire, and manages to combine the latest CGI along with all the charm of the 70s original. It's a difficult thing to do, but Edwards puts in the effort and pulls it off.The story is pretty simple, and follows the rebel operation to capture the Death Star plans, and leads directly to the opening events of Star Wars. You'll recall that the opening crawl to Star Wars:<br/><br/>""It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire...""<br/><br/>Rogue One takes this and skips backwards to describe those events in detail. The heroes are older than normal for this kind of film, with their ages ranging from 33 up to late 50s for the majority, and the subject matter it treated in a grimmer, more realistic fashion. The first two acts introduce the large cast of characters, the dark world of the Galactic Civil War, and of course introduces the villains, principally Governor Tarkin and his arch-rival, Director Kreddic. The Death Star is ready, but what they don't know is that the apparent treasonous weapons designer, Jyn's father, has placed a weakness deep inside the Death Star. It's a simple, perhaps obvious plot point that fixes one of the biggest weaknesses of the original filmthe exhaust port!<br/><br/>The final act jumps in with Jyn and her new-found friends electing to go it alone to retrieve the plans. It's an impossible mission, and they know it. Shortly after landing we're treated to a skirmish that quickly expands to something akin to the Battle for Endor. The space battle retains the feel of the classic trilogy, while bringing in a host of treats for fans. Original unused footage from Star Wars in spliced neatly into the film, along with audio cameos by others. The space battle is desperate, with them buying time for the rebels on the ground. By the time the plans are transmitted, the Death Star has arrived, and begun its reign of terror. The ground teams are wiped out, and it looks like the fleet may not even escape in time when Vader arrives. The last moments of the films are short and violent, and the perfect introduction to the power of Darth Vader. He cuts his way through period perfect 70's era Rebels until they pass the plans to the crew of Tantive IV. It's a short scene, and this isn't Vader's film, yet we can see that he's the right- hand man of the Empire, and he will not stop until he has the plans. Perfect.<br/><br/>There's no John Williams here, expect there is. Michael Giacchino utilizes the fanfares and themes of Williams, but brings in his own particular vibe. It's different, just like everything in this film, and it works. If you want to hear the score, visit Spotify and check it out now.<br/><br/>What a great cast of adults. Like Alien, this film shows what a cast of grownups looks like in a sci-fi story. It looks real, and each has had time to live a full life, with ups and downs. There are no pushy teens, just those that have seen the worst of life. K-2SO is a tough Imperial Enforcer droid, a kind of tough robot with an attitude that we've not seen before. The renegade pilot feels real, and bitter, while Chirrut Îmwe brings mysticism without having to rely on cheap tricks. Gerrera looks exactly as expected, and shows a side to the rebellion that we've not seen before.<br/><br/>Unlike the prequels, the CGI looks gritty and real. No fake green fields and silly monsters. This could easily be the 70s, and that is all to the good. The work on Tarkin and Leia are almost perfect, perhaps spoiled by the fact we know they are not real. No matter how good or bad the work, this would always jar. Kudos for the effort in putting Tarkin at the center of the story. The Death Star has never felt more menacing with Tarkin strutting his stuff. The merging of 70s footage is seamless, and everything just looks and feels right. We even finally see Y-Wings doing their thing for a change! Even better, the Star Destroyers and fighters have a plastic, model-like vibe that is in keeping with the original. This is a league apart from the computerized battles of the prequels.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a fantastic addition to the core films, and continues the Star Wars tradition better than many of the other films in the series. The film finally puts war in into the story arc, as well as sacrifice and terror. The original characters of Star War, especially Tarkin and the Imperial bureaucracy are given more screen time, all for the greater good of the series. The ending puts the sacrifice of the rebels front and center to the story, as well as the sheer power and terror of the Empire. A fairy-tale ending is what we'd expect, but not this time. This ending is about war, and many, many die getting the Death Star plans into Leia's hands. More importantly, Rogue One makes Star War an even better film than it already was. Let's hope she can get them into the rebellion's hands!"

","ROGUE ONE, a Star Wars movie that is so good, it makes the official sequel last year felt so 'rogue'. This is the kind of 'extra' story I want to be told in that galaxy far far away, where here and there I see just a little enough of some of the familiar faces and yet compared to last year's effort which tried to bring back in so many people and things from the originals, failed to be half as connected and nostalgic. Consider just how much you have longed to see that light saber, you will feel enormously emotional to see it again right at the end. The landscapes of dozen of the planets in the movie tonight are breathtaking. Well done!"

","I was expecting to see a movie about rebels, a war drama. It seems that Disney have cut a lot from the original version and have reworked what was originally planned as a darker Star Wars movie. The result - I felt like watching movie for kids. Disney is turning this franchise into a ""Happy Wars"". I hope they reconsider their vision and the way they have headed. Where is the ""I rebel"" girl from the trailers? They have completely destroyed her character! <br/><br/>As final word - not bad, but we all expected darker, more mature Star Wars. We did not get it. If Disney wants to make money, they should make Star Wars cartoons and theme parks. But they should leave the Star Wars movie darker and suited for mature audiences."
"DarkVulcan29","10","5","11","19 December 2016"," Please don't hate me,but I liked it more then The Force Awakens
","Don't get me wrong I was very entertained by The Force Awakens and all the rest of the Star Wars films, yeah including The Phantom Menace, which I did not think was terrible has others has said, despite the flaws it was still entertaining. A bunch of young rebels discover that the planet killer known has The Death Star has a weakness, and the rebels must get the information back to the alliance before it's too late.<br/><br/>I was really entertained by Rogue One, It does take place in the star wars universe, but at the same time it does stands on it's own, and avoids being clichéd, like most star wars movies would be. Felicity Jones is awesome, I mean she is quite the bad ass here. Donnie Yen is also very memorable, has a blind fighter who fancies himself as a Jedi Knight. And Alan Tudyk has voice of the robot K-2SO, who is quite the scene steal er. All the other characters are also good. Some CGI effects are pretty descent. Darth Vader is in this, not much, but you feel his presence when he is. I hope Star Wars fans will find this quite amusing."

","This film was amazing! If you're a fan of SW this is the film you've been waiting for. After leaving this film....on a high of course, I couldn't decide if this film was better or Empire Strikes Back(Empire is still better, don't worry). I'm telling you it's very close though. The acting was great, the film was dark and gritty. The ground and space battles are some of the best Star Wars has to offer. Darth Vader was limited, but absolutely fantastic and his scenes are pretty much worth the price of admission alone. Vader is more chilling than ever!! I Really hope they expand on him and show him after Episode 3 going around eliminating the remaining Jedi. He was terrific in this film. The ONLY negative have for this film is the first act....to be honest it's a bit slow and jumps around from place to place a lot, but on the other hand what Star Wars film doesn't have those moments. Amazing film, better than The Force Awakens, although l still do like The Force Awakens. I give this film 9.5 out of 10, taking only a half point off, because l felt the beginning was a bit weak. Aside from that this film is a must watch. GO SEE IT! NOW!"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","8","5","11","18 December 2016"," Overall, a solid effort!
","I have been generally critical of the recent Hollywood trend to remake or reboot old franchises to make a quick buck, but sometimes even a snobby curmudgeon like me isn't immune to the charms of nostalgia, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hit all the right buttons. When I saw the first trailer for Rogue One I was actually concerned the movie would revisit explored territory, and when news broke that they were re-shooting large portions of the film, I was very worried. But I am happy to say that Rogue One does take the Star Wars franchise in a new direction. I was so thrilled with the end result that I did not care about its flaws, and there are admittedly quite a few. This movie marks a real shift in tone for a Star War movie, and gives me confidence that the new Star Wars franchise won't just feel like a retread. <br/><br/>Rogue One begins with scientist Galen Erso being recruited by the Empire against his will to aid the Emperor's warped dream to bring about peace through tyranny. Before the Empire can take him away, Galen puts his daughter Jyn in the custody of Saw Gerrera, an extremist rebel, to protect her from the Empire. Years later, the rebellion receives information that Galen is building a super weapon for the Empire, and Saw Gerrera may have information vital to the survival of the rebellion, they recruit Jyn to help them. She embarks on her mission with Captain Cassian and his battle droid, the wise cracking K2SO, who can really pack a punch. Little does she know that Cassian has been given orders from his superiors that she won't particularly like. (don't want to give away any spoilers so I will leave it at that).<br/><br/>This brings me to the film's main strength – Rogue One treads new ground by drawing inspiration from modern spy/war movies rather than the 40's action adventure serials that the original movies were based on. Captain Cassain and the Rebellion do a few things that are morally shady, in stark contrast to the clean, black and white approach to the conflicts of the previous Star Wars movies. It's a reminder that even the good guys can do bad things in war. It's a refreshing take given that the last Star Wars movie felt so much like the originals, both in story and style. <br/><br/>The film is not without its faults. Rogue One's main problems are similar to Gareth Edward's previous film, Godzilla. The pacing is pretty slow at times and the characters could have been more interesting. The main character, Jyn Erso, should have been developed better. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but her character and the film would have benefited if her feelings toward the rebellion and her motives to help them were spelled out for us a little more clearly. She's a bit of a blank slate at times. In defense of the characters, it's still nice to see a Star Wars movie about the (relatively) normal people who fought against the Empire, as opposed to the elite Jedi. <br/><br/>One of the more controversial aspects of the movie is the use of CGI to recreate beloved characters from the original Star Wars movies. The quality of the animation varies from scene to scene, but I was distracted by it even when the animation was at its best. Honestly I would have preferred to see new actors playing these parts. It worked fine with Mon Mothma, so I don't see why they couldn't have done it with the other characters. I suppose the filmmakers may have thought that these particular characters were too iconic to replace with new actors. I disagree. Still, I got used to the animation, and I learned to appreciate what the director was going for. <br/><br/>Rogue One makes up for its deficiencies with a rousing third act that involves a rebel force storming the beachhead of an Imperial fortress and a space battle that is arguably the best in the franchise. This is where Gareth Edwards really deserves credit. His movies have problems with story and character development, but damn can he direct an action scene. He's really the best action director that the Star Wars franchise has had. <br/><br/>Rogue One really managed to pay homage to the original movies while taking it in a new direction. For that, I highly recommend it. I hope these solo spin off movies continue to find ways to differentiate themselves from the saga movies. I look forward to the next few Star Wars films!"

Absent its Star Wars Stamp of Disney Approval, it is a ho-hummer of a film, a sci-fi battledance with a plot fully known beforehand.<br/><br/>We know this sacrificial suicide mission will succeed, because if it fails, there could not have been a Star Wars. That means there is zero suspense, even if you suspend your disbelief during, or shoot up before, your viewing.<br/><br/>Much ado was made about this one-off having no Force. Indeed. This throwaway is basely in search of holiday- time cash, a way to keep the blockbuster behemoth alive and cast down scraps and crumbs upon the feet of fanboys."
"cchenders40","8","5","11","17 December 2016"," Rogue one is an excellent addition to the starwars franchise, as well as one of the best in the series.
","Rogue one is set before StarWars (A New Hope) and shows how the rebels came into possession of the plans to the death star. Jyn Erso leads a team of rebels to find her father and retrieve these plans so that the rebels can destroy the death star. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards (Director of Godzilla) directs this movie with excellence. Taking his time in each scene and with each shot, whilst not compromising on the overall pace of the film (as this film is paced perfectly feeling like twenty minutes). <br/><br/>Few know that Rogue One director Gareth Edwards started as a visual effects man. Edwards even made the visual effects for his first film Monsters on his home computer, as well as directing and producing. Edwards background in visual effects shines through in this movie as the effects are 99% stunning and seamless. The one percent being a certain CGI character, which looks good but not quite good enough. <br/><br/>Rogue one is also the most gritty and dark StarWars movie ever made. It contains the best action of the entire franchise as well. The characters are well developed and all very likable. There are also several risks that the movie takes that totally pay off, however I will not mention them as they are spoilers.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is directed with excellence, contains incredible action, has likable characters, amazing visual and practical effects, as well as being dark and gritty while still feeling like StarWars."
"allelvesmustdie","10","5","11","17 December 2016"," Rogue One Delivers
","Rogue One delivers a gripping, timely scry into a world that is - and is not our own. World class plot organization, artful direction, and acting finesse come together to produce something original, entertaining, and raw. The powerful emotions of desperation, dread, loss, and hope are heightened - not muted - by the sense of finality and horror that accompanies knowledge of the story's role in a larger saga. This fast-paced, moving work of cinema is appropriate, educational, and relevant for ages 7- 107. There is sufficient tension for lovers of drama, ample battles of multiple styles for the action- focused, and plenty of twists and unknowns. This movie manages to steer clear of several annoying star wars tropes - and is refreshingly canon. A strong cast and solid screenplay makes for an experience free of eye rolls that can sometimes accompany beloved, but clunky performances of the star wars universe."

"joedili","5","5","11","16 December 2016"," Could of been a lot better
","First I would like to say that this movie is better than the worst movie ever created, the force awakens, though it still had its problems. I'll start off with the positives. <br/><br/>First, this movie reminded me of episode IV with the x wings, some of the fighting, and Tarkin. They brought back some awesome lines from episode IV and Tarkin was back and better than ever. Second, K2 was another great droid and was the best new character in the movie. He reminded me of HK-47 from Knights of the Old Republic. Third, they took their time with the story line and did not rush anything like the catastrophic episode VII. Fourth, they brought back a lot of the older characters such as R2, C3PO, and Leia very briefly. Bail Organa was also in it but not as much as I would of hoped. They even brought back the 2 guys that Obiwan and Luke met at the Cantina in episode IV. I'll save Vader for later.<br/><br/>Now here are the negatives. This movie could of been so much better than it really was. First, not all the characters needed to die and it was completely unnecessary. Just because they are not in episodes IV, V, VI does not mean they all needed to be killed off. Some of them could of been in episode VIII. Second, Forest Whittaker's character seemed very pointless. He was not in it very much and seemed to have no point. Third, there were no Jedi. One of the main things I love about Star Wars is Jedi and the directors are not bringing any of them back. They could have brought back Ewan Mcgregor to do a couple of scenes and maybe even Yoda to do one. They definitely could have brought back the emperor. There were so many characters that they could of brought back to make this an awesome Star Wars movie. The storyline was average but could of been a lot better with all the older characters involved. The new characters were okay but they were not that memorable.<br/><br/>Now the best part of the movie, Darth Vader. Vader should of been a lot more involved in this movie. He wasn't even in it that much. He was such an awesome villain like he always is. That last scene was one of the greatest Star Wars moments ever, but it only lasted for a minute. The way he took out his saber was great. Where was that all movie? There could of been so much more of that. The emperor could of played a major part in this movie and use his force lightning. Leia also could of been in it more. The transition into episode IV was perfect. <br/><br/>Overall, the first 99% of this movie was somewhat below average while the very end was a 11 out of 10."
"Equalizer16","8","5","11","16 December 2016"," A very pleasant modern nod to classic Star Wars.
","The prequel sequel spin off movie set before a New Hope, arrives following the journey of the group of Rebels who are on a mission to steal the plans for the completed Death Star.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards (Monsters) executes a perfectly superb Star Wars spin off, the old and new. Bringing Star Wars fans on a history trip back in time to the excitement of Star Wars in the early days, and packing a real exciting punch. With a brilliantly developed ensemble cast, led by Felicity Jones, Rogue One transports us across the galaxy into a fantastically moving and fun journey.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso (Jones) is an orphaned rogue criminal lost in her way, until she is recruited by the Rebels to help fight against the Empire and find out about this new ultimate weapon. Allying with a very diverse group of Rebels, they must all come together to bring hope to the galaxy and face the dreaded Empire.<br/><br/>Now that Disney have brought back Star Wars, they are going to do as much as they can to squeeze as much money out of our pockets. Buts it's worth it if they make dam good movie. Therefore Rogue One very much is an introduction to the future planned prequels on the way.<br/><br/>The main inescapable issue with prequels and sequels, especially if they are part of a franchise that's about 30-40 years old, there is clearly going to be a change in the tone and atmosphere of the films depending on when they were made. So its sometimes hard to believe the events your watching are meant to take place in the same universe as a film that came out in 1977. But Rouge One pulls it off with a sensational final act, expressing the full and beautiful pride that us geeks and fans have in the Star Wars Franchise.<br/><br/>Rouge One is its own story, but is still Star Wars, with a relatively slow and averagely entertaining first act, and second act, the film build us up to the ultimate climax. With the Force Awakens only being released a year ago, Gareth Edwards shows us that they have not forgotten the original series that started it all. Thankfully with an appropriate amount of jokes as well, mostly derived from the obnoxious droid K2SO (Alan Tudyk) I personally much prefer this to Force Awakens, as it captures what I love in Star Wars. I do like the Force Awakens but I have a lot of issues with it.<br/><br/>Although fairly rough around the edges and a final act that makes and steals the whole film, Rouge One is what the fans want, a modern yet classic Star Wars tale, with a several cameos, and the pure pride of being Star Wars. 9.0/10"
"woodgatejack-sfr","9","5","11","16 December 2016"," Damn near perfect.
","I would find it difficult to discuss a problem I have with this film without spoiling a surprise. I'll try not to be too specific as to what happens, but please pay due attention to my SPOILER WARNING. I shall mark the paragraphs that may contain spoilers with an (SW)<br/><br/>(SW) A rather minor bug-bear I have with this is that I cannot get around the fact that one of the characters is a CGI construct. Now, we may have seen CGI characters before, such as Jar-Jar Binks in the prequels, Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, The Hulk in the Marvel movies and countless others, acting alongside real people, and have had ""digital stuntmen"" in which an actor has been augmented or even replaced by a computer graphics. However, characters like Jar-Jar, Gollum and the Hulk are not human, and digital stuntmen are usually on the screen for mere moments, lost in a blur of movement. Rogue One has a character that is portrayed by a CGI construct, modeled in the likeness of an actual human being, an actual person, acting opposite and interacting with real actors. It's very well done, but there's no way getting around the fact that this is a CGI construct and it took me out of it.<br/><br/>That point aside, this is an excellent film and worthy addition to the Star Wars world. Even though I enjoyed 'The Force Awakens' I had to concede with the criticism some had that it echoed the events of 'A New Hope' rather closely. Rogue One, although dovetails neatly into the existing films is very much it's own animal."
"elmdor999","8","5","11","16 December 2016"," Proof that the side story series can be great
","R1's contribution to the Star Wars legacy is that it redeems the franchise after the rancid and soulless release of The Force Awakens. Right off the bat you'll notice that R1 contains something sorely lacking in TFA: acting. Felicity Jones plays Jyn perfectly and should definitely silence the detractors. The pain displayed at the loss of her father and the passion exuded during her exchanges with Diego Luna are all pitch perfect and genuine.<br/><br/>Speaking of Luna he is phenomenal as well. Concerned that he may not be able to pull off a hardened rebel with his smallish physique and that his accent may detract from his performance, I'm happy to report he absolutely owns the role of a special operator and his unyielding and unapologetic exchange with Jyn after her father's death was not just great by Star Wars standards but by some of the greatest war flicks as well.<br/><br/>Gotta talk about Forrest as well. He could have been easily phoned in his performance but instead he somehow manages to imbue his character with more nuance and character than the entire production of TFA combined. His facial animations, voice inflection, and delivery are just spot on man. Giving Forrest a run for his money is Alan Tudyk as a reprogrammed Imperial Droid. The praise you've heard about him well deserved.<br/><br/>Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen portray a pair of longtime friends who throw their lot in with the Rebellion. Wen doesn't have a ton of lines but the ones he does get he delivers in a appropriately understated but competent fashion. Yen, on the other hand, has been tasked with portraying a blind man who nonetheless has a martial prowess far beyond that of someone with perfect sight. The problem here is that it's overdone. Yen is able dispatch throngs of storm-troopers not unlike a Jedi. It absolutely wreaks of Asian martial arts cinema and feels jarringly out of place. Just in case some valiant soul wants to defend his character Yen's Chirrut shoots down a TIE Fighter....with his small arms blaster. Oy vey indeed.<br/><br/>If all that weren't enough, Chirrut is involved in the one scenario that potentially could have derailed a lesser movie. During the combat on Serrif, Chirrut simple walks out, and I want to emphasize the walks part, into heavy crossfire to activate a switch on a console necessary to continue the operation. There's no explanation given as to why he's not instantly vaporized exactly like a soldier moments earlier who tried dashing for the same console. There's no smoke cover laid down to at least make the attempt plausible. <br/><br/>Moving on, Riz Ahmed's Bohdi is played about as well as one can given the constraints of the role. Villain duties fall primarily on Ben Mendelsohn as the Director of the Death Star project. The character doesn't really bring much to the table frankly. He's ambitious to fault as is evidenced by his willingness to openly feud with Moff Tarkin. However he's not a great combatant nor tactician. He doesn't ooze charisma or have conflicted feelings about his cause. He's just kinda...there. He's also suffers a clichéd attack at the end, but his ultimate demise comes at the hand, somewhat fittingly, of the Death Star itself. Still, I would have rather seen him survive only to face Vader's wrath.<br/><br/>Vader, although voiced by James Earl Jones, doesn't come off sounding quite right. This is to be expected to some degree as Jones is much older then when he did the original movies but you'd think they could have done a better job in post matching the fidelity to the originals. In the first scene, physically, he does not look good. His mask looks comically large. His suit looks...like a really good cosplay suit. Not the same fearsome look from the originals. Thankfully the scene does have one of the better exchanges in the movie as Mendelsohn slows his words in fear as he registers Vader's annoyance as displayed by him getting frightfully close to the Director. The scene drags on too long though and we get a not well executed force choke scene that seems, well, forced.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the second scene features Vader in full triumphant fashion in a manner only thus far shown in videos games or described in books.<br/><br/>Rogue 1 also noteworthy for it's prominent use of CGI to display actors from the original Star Wars. Tarkin looks too detailed and older than he does in the originals. The effect isn't awful but I would have much rather have some skilled live actor take on the role even if his looks were not 1:1. Princess Leia and some of the fighter pilots also get this treatment briefly and it produces the same sort of semi jarring not quite natural effect. <br/><br/>Scenery and cinematography is absolutely stunning. In space and on the ground the visuals are just spectacular. There's one rain soaked scene that I particularly fancied with its drenched and menacing cliffs and ledges.<br/><br/>One of the (many) flaws of the despicable Force Awakens was its bland generic music that stood in contrast to the memorable scores for the originals and prequels. The music is such an integral part of the series and I was hoping the Rogue 1 would be able to recapture that. Unfortunately, that proved to be a bridge too far as the music is about as cookie cutter as it gets. <br/><br/>Finally, it's absolutely unfair that this movie is getting about the same ratings as The Force Awakens. Rogue 1 is an infinitely better movie.The movie introduces a grit not seen in other Star Wars flicks. It reveals the unpleasant truths left unexplored in the other movies about the realities of war and provides a sobering context when re-watching the originals.<br/><br/>Edwards has proved that a good Star Wars movie can still be made."

","Still trying to get over how GOOD Rogue One was! It's not about how many well made scenes, fights or best lines were deliveredit's the feeling of satisfaction at the end; as if all the wait was worth it. Like a glass of cold water after a long run, a good rest after sleepless nights, or any other simple yet joyful reward. It's telling an unheard story in one of the best possible ways (like Hamilton Musical did for American History). Also, this movie validates the struggles of A New Hope—an Episode you'll see with a totally new perspective.

","Non-Spoilers Review :) Arriving from my first tasting of the tape directed by Gareth Edward, I can tell you with certainty that we have just entered a new era for the saga, in which there are no limits to the type of stories, tones and styles that can be added to the universe Created by George Lucas and in turn, ""enhance"" the experience of the unsurpassed classic trilogy.<br/><br/>Although the film evokes well-known visual elements, it is far removed from the style of the 7 episodes of the central story. It brings us a narrative comparable to Saving Private Ryan (1998) or The Guns of Navarone (1961). Moving away from the adventurous and cool tone of its predecessors, the film immerse ourselves in a militarized and ruthless universe, which shows even more than the original trilogy, the coldness of the iron fist of the empire and the battle for survival of the rebellion.<br/><br/>The story was interesting, the acting was great, the music was different, the effects both practical and digital were flawless, the tone was on spot, the little fan service was put in elegantly, and Vader was... well, you'll see ;). It has a bit of a pacing problem in the first act (maybe because of the re-shoots) but it gets better as it goes.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe, which manages to entertain, amaze and move! If you have not seen the movie yet, what are you waiting for? RUN AND SEE IT! WJ"
"lewisideson","9","5","11","16 December 2016"," A brilliant, dark and gritty war film that just so happens to be set in the star wars universe
","Rogue one is arguably more of a war film that just happens to be set in the star wars universe than it is an actual star wars film but at the end of the day it is a standalone movie separate from the main saga. While being an anthology film there are a lot of references to the main saga and a number of cameos spoilers!!!!!! (R2 and c3p0, leia, Tarkin and of course Vader plus bail organa and a mention of obi wan)end of spoilers. The tone and feel reminded me of halo reach along with something I'll mention later, it was dark and gritty with characters who weren't all supposed to be perfect (k2s0 and chirrut were standouts but I liked each character for what they brought to the film) and it captured the essence of a war film. What I really liked was the way rogue one portrayed the rebel alliance and particularly cassian andor as in the star wars universe the alliance were terrorists who were fighting a far superior enemy and they have to do anything to survive spoilers!!!!!!!!! (For example when cassian murdered his source who would have been captured by the empire and the alliance ordering cassian to assassinate Galen Erso(who is killed by alliance Y- wings)) end of spoilers. The third act was not only the best part of the film but was also one of the best parts of any star wars film with the rag tag group attacking scarif. The action and emotion was intense as major spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Each character met their end with a brilliant scene in which the death star fired on Scarif killing cassian, jyn and krennic) end of spoilers. The last few moments expertly showed Darth Vader as the villain he is as he spoilers!!!!!! (Boards the rebel flagship he has just disabled and cuts down rebels with his lightsaber) it is true that rogue one finishes just before a new hope as the tantive iv harboring princess leia escapes the system.) If I had to say one thing bad about rogue one i'd reluctantly say the pacing at the start seemed a little off (it felt a bit slow) but I'm not going to go into detail about that because it is a minor problem. Overall rogue one is a brilliant dark and gritty war film set in the star wars universe with enough cameos to please long term fans and an emotional end to interesting characters."

","My faith in the franchise was restored yesterday as I watched Rogue One. I am a die hard Star Wars fan but I hated Episode 7 for so many reasons - I don't want to list them here.<br/><br/>But Rogue One was something else. I mean we all knew the basic story, as it was written in the title screen of ""A new Hope"". But man did they do a great job to make a full length movie out of it. <br/><br/>After about 30 mins of nearly nothing happening I was really upset, as I had great expectations beforehand. But after that the action went from good to absolutely awesome. And afterwards I would have paid the price for the ticket again just to see the last couple of minutes again, as they are the one of the best in the franchises history. For me this film definitely is ""A new Hope"" for the franchise. May the force be with you all."

","I just rewatched Rogue One and this time round the nuances of the acting are even more poignant.

This movie doesn't miss a beat, and I appreciate it even more admist the stale vomit of the new abomination Abrams, Kennedy and Riaan subvert expectations Johnson trilogy. Gareth Edwards should have helmed the new trilogy."
"truemythmedia","6","2","3","7 January 2020"," Middle-ing Star Wars Fun
","""Rogue One"" is the definition of a mixed bag. I find myself in a similar position with this film as I am in regard to ""Solo."" I like the movie but would never dream of defending it as a great film.<br/><br/>It really is a mess. The characters are mostly uninteresting, the connection between father and daughter that should be the core of this film feels anemic, and the progression of the plot from one sequence to the next is done in an incredibly slapdash way so that even after multiple viewings, I found myself having to refresh my memory about basic plot points.<br/><br/>Luckily, this film is not without its bright points to make the ride more fun. The first of which, for me, is K2-SO. Alan Tudyk (""Serenity"") does a brilliant job voicing the reprogrammed Imperial droid with sarcasm, near nihilism, and an endearing love/loathe relationship with Jyn (Felicity Jones, ""Inferno""). In fact, K2-SO has become my personal favorite amongst the droid characters of the Star Wars universe. The most meaningful and moving scene of the film may actually be the sacrifice of this character who is more human than the humans in this movie.<br/><br/>Another character to highlight is that of Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen, ""Hero""). A non-Jedi force believer who harkens back to Blind Swordsman or Warrior Monk tales of Japan and China. His role in the rebellion on Jetta and Scarif is minor but flavorful and brings out the depth that is hinted at in other films when they speak of the force and the legend of the Jedi Knights.<br/><br/>Sadly, this film leaves little more for us to enjoy when it comes to characters. The protagonists are thin and change motivations on a dime. They eat up screen time with their monologues and leave us wishing we got additional time with the minor characters, who are more interesting and endearing.<br/><br/>Another high point of the film is the climactic sequence on the planet Scarif. Not since the assault on Hoth (""The Empire Strikes Back"") have we been treated to a battle so engaging and complex. Ground forces tactical movements, an orbital battle that recaptures the magic of the battle over Endor, and numerous moments of personal sacrifice, twists of fate, and moments of triumph make this sequence one of my favorite Star Wars battles. Period.<br/><br/>I for one am not a big fan of using CGI to insert original actors into new films. I personally think they should get other actors to play the part or even simply write around those characters. That being said, the CGI is remarkably good. A few moments of wavering believability do not erase, for me, the incredible achievement that this film has managed to pull off. Grand Moff Tarkin looks great, Leia, a little less so but still solid and serviceable. Even using footage from ""A New Hope"" to supplement and create the illusion that the fighter pilots from that film are the same as the ones in this battle.<br/><br/>To be fair, though, that is the majority of what I like about this movie. I wish these Star Wars Stories were not so plagued by production, script, and directorial difficulties but they have been and they have suffered for it. Rogue One is no exception.<br/><br/>It has suffered but, if you wade through what is a wildly uneven film, there are truly wonderful aspects of this film to enjoy."

"frankhodson","10","2","3","28 December 2019"," The best SW movie since the original trilogy.
","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy. I honestly assumed beforehand that this was going to be one of the worst of the new Star Wars films, considering the plot - I mean, did any Star Wars fan ever really cry out for a movie telling us how the Rebel Alliance got hold of the schematics to the Death Star? I for one certainly didn't. It's sounds like filler, and a complete cash in. Yet, against all the odds, my prejudices and presuppositions, somehow they managed to make a really enjoyable Star Wars movie, which is more faithful to the style, themes and quality of the originals than any other Star Wars movie to date.<br/><br/>'Rogue One' demonstrates that you do can wonders with a very simple, yet effective storyline provided you make it fun, interesting, well paced with likeable, underdog characters. Heck, they even nailed the comic relief here as well - it's (thankfully) employed sparingly but tactfully, never feeling forced, and generating a genuine chuckle here or there. The battles scenes also don't feel generic like in many special effect driven movies, but felt quite gritty and visceral. And the brief scene with Darth Vader in pursuit of stolen plans in the narrow corridor near the end paid more respect justice to his character than any of the prequels did, which more or less sabatoged his reputation and legacy.<br/><br/>It's the first time since the originals you get a sense of real menace from from the Dark Side (with perhaps the exception of Darth Maul), and that the stakes for both Rebel Alliance and the Empire are high, and the deaths of the rebels actually counted for something. A worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise, which is more than can be said of most SW movies since the original trilogy."

"TheMovieFan16","8","2","3","16 December 2019"," The Best Disney Star Wars Movie.
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does the unthinkable. It makes an already amazing film (A New Hope) even better by fixing decade-old plot holes. The reason for the simple destruction of the infamous Death Star is finally explained. We finally get a movie about the heroes which quietly get pushed away on the sidelines. This movie is essentially the first paragraph of Episode IV's opening crawl. Gareth Edwards proves that he has the eye to produce A-level blockbuster action. Effects are always top notch, acting is good (even though Forest Whitaker seems to be overacting as an older Saw Gerrera), but the movie does tend to jump from place to place. A great tie-novel to read aside seeing the movie is Catalyst by James Luceno. The characters of Jyn Erso and Galen Erso are fleshed out very well in both the book and the movie. It is unfortunate that Bodhi (the Imperial pilot-turned Rebel), Baze (heavy weapons specialist), and Chirrut (blind man who's one with the Force) are somewhat treated like throwaway characters. The relationship between Jyn and the leader of the group, Cassian, left me wanting to see more. Having K-2SO in the mix was a perfect addition to the group and provided rewarding moments. The CGI used to recreate the late Peter Cushing as Tarkin does not always work and seems to be given too much screen time rather than use Darth Vader more. The recently deceased Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia is also brought back to the big screen via CGI and is so brief, yet her 10 seconds on screen may leave you feeling misty-eyed or possibly even in tears. Back to Darth Vader however, his voice does sound a bit off as James Earl Jones does seem to indicate his age. Despite this, Darth Vader's final scene in Rogue One is arguably one of the best Star Wars moments of all time. I have seen the movie three times in theaters and find the pacing improves each time. The music mostly works, but given that the brilliant Michael Giacchino was only given 4 weeks to produce the score (after Alexandre Desplat left the project), it's not very memorable. Overall, this is a great movie (not quite as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion) that deserves to be re-watched again and again."

It's a bit weak in character developement, as very few of the characters feel fleshed out (however, Mendelson as Krennic is a pretty good villain in my opinion). However, the film is technically proficient in every way and the special effects are incredible and convincing. All the ships look real and there aren't many shots that look fake, perhaps with the exception of CGI Leia at the very ending scene. There are plenty of action sequences that are a blast to watch, especially the final battle on Scariff, which is a visual joy to behold. Also, the Darth Vader scene at the end is as amazing as everyone says, however brief it is. These are mostly scattered thoughts but overall, I really enjoyed the movie and it's overall pretty damn good and really feels like Star Wars. I probably will give it a 7.5-7.8/10"

"JTurner82","9","2","3","4 October 2019"," A pleasant surprise.
","What's this? Can it be? A STAR WARS prequel that's actually -- GASP! -- great? Believe it or not, yes. Although technically not a prequel -- it's more of a spin-off ""anthology"" movie -- ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY could very well qualify. It's easily superior to the prequel trilogy (even REVENGE OF THE SITH, good as it was, was held back by flaws, none of which exist here, thankfully). While not necessarily a better made film than THE FORCE AWAKENS, I actually enjoyed ROGUE ONE a lot more than I thought I would. Which was not something I was expecting to say.<br/><br/>But ROGUE ONE works as both a movie and a bridge to the opening moments of the first STAR WARS movie (rebranded as EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE). It's also one of the few STAR WARS movies to actually show the tragedies of going into war -- something that we have not seen from entries in this galactic saga. A new cast of characters propels this tale, of which K-2SO is easily the most successful. Voiced by Alan Tudyk, this droid is very much in the vein of C-3PO, what with his deadpan, dry humor and prissy personality. He's also very badass -- can you name a scene in which C-3PO wielded a blaster to save his colleagues? No. The fact that this robot does makes him a very memorable newcomer.<br/><br/>The most surprising moment of the movie is the return of Death Star Governor Grand Moff Tarkin, as portrayed by Peter Cushing in A New Hope. Apparently CGI was used to make this possible, but honestly, I'd be hard-pressed to know if it were, because the onscreen results are convincingly real. Since the actor has now passed, Stephen Stanton supplies the motion capture work for him. His voice is supplied by Guy Henry, who does a dead-on job of impersonating the character's chilling mannerisms. (The same is true of a surprise cameo at the very end of the film -- you'll have to see for yourself to find out.)<br/><br/>The real jewel is the return of Darth Vader, complete with James Earl Jones' unmistakable baritone. Unlike the prequels, we get to see this iconic villain as his usual nasty self, berating an Empire leader one moment, and at the climax, slashing at rebels with his familiar crimson lighter. Although his appearance is brief, he is still the highlight of ROGUE ONE. In fact, the last thirty minutes are where this movie really dazzles.<br/><br/>Fault-wise, ROGUE ONE has very little to speak of, other than the fact that it starts off somewhat slowly and occasionally dips into lulls. However, performances across the board are very well done all around (a commendable feature of these Disney-produced STAR WARS movies), and while their characters don't register with us in the same emotional way as Luke Skywalker and company did, they are at the very least soulful and believable characters as opposed to anyone in the prequels. And of course, as usual, the visual effects are of the same standard we've come to expect from the STAR WARS trilogy. It's refreshing to have this movie refrain from overusing computer graphics except for necessary purposes.<br/><br/>One could easily ditch one of the STAR WARS prequels and replace ROGUE ONE with the one in question. This movie really is that good."

","I was awed, spellbound, moved and impressed. This movie did what none of the other recent Star Wars films have done. It was one of the best told stories in film that I have seen in a long time, but it also just happens to fit in the Star Wars universe. Like the Force Awakens I felt like it borrowed heavily from Miyazaki films (growth of a young female scavenger discarded by society and forced to live in a world of war that is beyond her power, epic worlds and beautiful visuals, heavy thematics with a focus on environmental impact). And the pace of the story increases and accelerates to a perfect crescendo and ending. I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>I will say I did miss the crawl during the credits but that's really a small quip. But what I didn't miss were the clever winks and nods to fans of the newest Star Wars films. The plot is very dire and grim at times and it doesn't hold back from being emotionally heavy. The action sequences were gripping and the characters were morally ambiguous at first. I thought all of it was very well polished and the final third was breathtaking.

It also features compelling characters who are all flawed yet sympathetic because of the various situations each is thrown into.

","The cinematography is amazing. But not in the way that other films like blade runner are. It looks like it was shot in 1977, which in any other film would show a lack of quality if it doesn't look ""modern"" but my God they put so much effort into making it look like it was part of the A New Hope timeline, which I imagine would be constricting but feels so natrual, so much so that you don't even notice it but it makes it so much better.
To quote Futurama. ""When you've done something right people won't know you've done anything at all.""
It fits in with the Star Wars legacy so well while being something fresh and different so you know it's not part of the main saga. I originally hated the fact that it doesn't have the main roll and it has labels for the planets, which makes it more Star Trek than Star Wars, but on a second viewing it doe a great way of separating itself from the Saga.
Only thing that brings it down is I didn't feel that emotionally attached to the characters as much as I wanted to be."

"theladchadbrock","9","2","3","14 January 2019"," A darker, different, and ultimately brillaint take on the Star Wars universe
","The characters in this film do not start out heroes. They are legends of the rebellion by the end of the film. The choices they make are what makes them heroes, making this the most realistic hero story in this universe: and the gritty realism of the characters doesnt dampen the fun star wars atmosphere. This band of characters are ultimately likeable, especially Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe and Alan Tudik's K2SO. The feel of them all working out together in the end is remniscient of 2012's Avengers Assemble. And when people say this is a war movie, they are right. This movie's action scenes go out of thier way to show you the distress and horror of war, even giving a few emotional seconds to random soldiers on the battlefield. The film shows how the rebellion's attacks, however justified, are dangerous and horrific for the people involved and the bystanders, and shows the extremism that comes with rebellion. I personally love the darker and grittier take on the rebellion- empire war. The music by michael giaccino is something to behold. In the emotional scenes, particularly the peak final one, the music makes the moment and very nearly brought me to tears. And fear not, as this is a seperate story, it ties in excellently and neccessarily to old favourites like Tarkin, Darth Vader (who gets an amazing action scene at the end) and Mustafar.
Overall, this is not a pointless entry to the star wars universe, but in fact my 3rd favourite yet."

","I don't know how it's possible that Disney managed to pull off a decent film here. It has great action amazing cinematography and the characters are all right. There isn't any forced political correctness and all the characters in some way have their merits. And in the end it is a story story about sacrifice for a greater cause. And it pulls it off rather well. Imagine an action movie in the Star Wars universe and this movie hits the mark, I just don't understand how Disney is so hit-or-miss with the quality of its films."

","I guess you would call this an insertaquel as it is inserted between episode 3 and 4 and fills in a couple gaps leading to the very first movie released. There are certainly some characters from previous movies throughout this one. It does take 2 hours of your time to fill in the background on how the information for attacking the death star came about. That could have been accomplished in about 10 minutes. There were some good battles with good graphics and they sure were better shots than any of the other movies. I think the biggest benefit will come in marketing new toys of the new spacecraft that appear in this movie"
"skoobydoo6789","9","2","3","19 July 2017"," Awesome Side Story in the Star Wars Universe
","Rogue One is a great start for the Star Wars Anthology movie series. It's also the best prequel so far in the Star Wars franchise. I was worried Rogue One was going to go the route of Suicide Squad because of the reshoots. After watching Rogue One with a friend and my mother last year, the movie is one of my favorites beside the Original Trilogy and The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>The main thing I like about Rogue One is it does an amazing job explaining how no one in the Empire knew about the weakness in the original Death Star that was exploited by Luke in Episode IV-A New Hope. It's also great in leading up to A New Hope. Also, Rogue One shows the Rebel Alliance in a different light. It shows that the Rebels are willing to do some dark things like killing people. I found that to be very interesting.<br/><br/>Rogue One isn't without its flaws. One of those flaws is some characters don't have their backstories fully fleshed out. We get a bit more info about Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor than the others. The other members of the Rogue One team are just there for the ride. The movie's main villain, Orson Krennic, and K2-SO were the stand-out characters in Rogue One. It was awesome that James Earl Jones returned as Darth Vader. His appearance in Rogue One was a highlight for me. I had issues with certain characters appearing in the movie because of really obvious CGI. It was very distracting when those characters appeared.<br/><br/>The movie's score was another flaw for me. I loved Michael Giacchino's previous works on movies and shows like The Incredibles, Doctor Strange, and Fringe. His work on Rogue One had to be done in three weeks because the previous conductor, Alexandre Desplat, because of reshoots and he was unavailable. It's obvious that the music was rushed because of that.<br/><br/>Despite those flaws, I really enjoyed Rogue One. It added much needed information and background to the Star Wars Universe. The movie had a great cast. Also, Rogue One is way better than The Force Awakens. Definitely worth adding to my movie collection to watch over and over again. It's also worth a watch for any Star Wars and sci-fi fans."
"nodlimax","4","2","3","17 July 2017"," Who are these characters?
","I have seen the movie and either I didn't pay enough attention because it was rather boring or they really didn't focus on the characters. Considering that pretty much all of the main cast in this movie is killed I am not surprised that they didn't go into to much depth. However if the creators of the movie don't care about the characters, why should I as a viewer care about them? The story wasn't very exciting neither. It's just about how they get the plans of the death star. There aren't even any surprises in the story. Some of the effects looked horrifying and I am not talking about the Darth Vader scene. His scene is actually the only thing that was memorable about the movie but not enough to safe this flick for me.<br/><br/>Wasted opportunity..."
"shadowfax73","4","2","3","14 July 2017"," Trite and predictable
","I'd seen the trailer and thought it would be worth watching. Well, it wasn't. The plot is pretty much of a rehash of A New Hope and contains very few original ideas. As has been said, the characters are pretty bland, have no background and nothing to draw the interest. The Jyn character is either tearing up over her father or demonstrating that only her suffering and loss matters. When the Cassian character tries to explain that they have all suffered loses, she stamps her little foot and refuses to accept he has a point. And then later, the scene that really made me want to shoot the TV is the one where the leaders of the rebel alliance are all gathered together to decide what to do next, Jyn starts on a 'rousing' and 'inspiring' monologue that ends with the alliance leaders all going ""Gosh! She's right!"". So all these rebel leaders who have been fighting for years are put to shame by some know nothing humanette. Such a clunky way of making her seem like a redeemer, a leader. From whiny brat to whiny inspiration. The character is obviously aimed at pubescent girls who can easily identify with her. The Rey character in The Force Awakens was a much better drawn and believable female lead plus she didn't go into pout mode every five minutes <br/><br/>I have a confession, after that scene I called it a night. I just could not take any more. I watched The Force Awakens and it was like a breath of fresh air after this stinker."
"derbo73","4","2","3","8 July 2017"," Mediocre and disrespectful of the original franchise
","The main character is unlikable and almost irrelevant. Without about 15 other people she would have achieved nothing. She has no powers, no character, nothing to make her stand out as the hero. I did not expect a new Luke here, but she has nothing at all.<br/><br/>The movie is way to long and packed full with CGI, battle action and all sorts of unnecessary or comedy relief dialogue. The movie had undertones of conflicts of our current time - often you can imagine watching a movie taking place in Afghanistan or some Arab states. Bad idea to bring in these aspects of conflicts that can not be reduced to ""we good -you evil"".<br/><br/>The story is plain and full of logical problems. It's all ""just because"" - the core of it is a problem from the original movies: why build a super-weapon that has a total failure trigger built in that is quite easily accessible? They made an over 2h movie to just explain that - and failed, as the explanation is as weak as none at all.<br/><br/>In their wake of destruction producers ignored just so many things about the Star Wars universe that you can't count them.<br/><br/>The magic is long gone."

","I thought I was going to love this movie, but to me it's average, I wanted to like it, but I just wasn't into it, it felt slow and it was dragging a bit at some parts.<br/><br/>Story: 6/10<br/><br/>The movie starts with Jyn's mother dying and her dad forced to build the deathstar. Jyn hides in a cave waiting for Saw Gerrera, he then takes care of her until she was sixteen years old. Then she was a prisoner of the empire for whatever reason, she gets rescued by the rebels because they wanted her help because her dad built the blueprint for the deathstar. There is so many plot holes and confusing parts in this movie, if they did a better job explaining things a bit more the movie would be better. Also the timeline is before Star Wars The New Hope, it tries to explain how the rebels got the layout for the deathstar.<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10<br/><br/>Jyn Erso: Jyn dies in the movie with all the other main characters, you barely know anything about her, and that's why when she died, it didn't matter to me.<br/><br/>Cassian Andor: Cassian dies too, he's really paper thin and he's just there for whatever reason.<br/><br/>K-2SO: K-2SO is the best character in the movie just because he reminds me of C-3PO <br/><br/>Chirrut ÃŽmwe: Chirrut is an interesting character, he's blind and fights without a lightsaber, pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Baze Malbus: Baze is Chirrut's best friend, nothing is known about him.<br/><br/>Saw Gerrera: Saw Gerrera isn't important in the movie at all, he's just their to fill in some plot holes.<br/><br/>Galen Erso: Galen Erso is the creator of the DeathStar, he later dies in the movie but he's an OK character. <br/><br/>Action: 5/10<br/><br/>There was little action in this movie, the only action was in the first act and the last act, all these fight scenes are pretty boring because the action scenes are so short.<br/><br/>This movie lacked in character development and a boring second act, if they fixed those problems the movie would've been batter."

","A fantastic movie with a sad ending, I loved the whole concept of this film and after the full Star Wars franchise this is still my favourite of the whole series, it has a feel to the original unlike most of the sequels. The characters you feel their emotions and you feel attachment, with their choices and their actions. The ending was a real hit because the almost all the main protagonists die in a sad and horrible scene. It really hit when Jyn and Cassian are sitting together as the whole planet is being exploded it's horrible and sad. The movie shows you what the people that worked for the Rebels and there story on how they helped the main protagonist in the main movies, win the war. I liked this and how it showed a whole different side. The movie itself is really good and a must watch and explains how Princess Laila and the Rebels get the plans to the Death Star and to be honest at the end what they did seem pointless at they sat there waiting to be murdered by the Death Star. A MUST WATCH."

","Yay, an original story finally this is the best of the Disney era Star Wars films and I loved how this tied into the 1st (4th) movie perfectly with Princess Leia's ""hope"". Story is solid and follows a ragtag band of freedom fighters including a former soldier turned prisoner, a rebel alliance insider and a blind Jedi who work together to steal the Death Stars blueprints -and, according to the battle briefing in Star Wars we all know how well that worked out for them. Anyways this was super good, what I'd been hoping for all along with these new movies. No real review here just random thoughts.<br/><br/>Fun references to original trilogy throughout, the guy with the face from the bar on Tatooine that bumps into people and picks fights apparently as a hobby, Leia's father Jimmy Smits -had to wrap my brain around the timeline for his character appearance, loved the blind Jedi Samurai dude, the battle on the beach is very Pacific WW2 feeling, Darth Vader's castle and him in the healing bath, cool but they should have shown his missing limbs, the longer I'm watching and the more I get attached to the characters the worse I feel for their inevitable outcome, Diego Luna and Felicity Jones are now in a scene reminiscent of Tea Leoni & her dad in Deep Impact, Vader kicking ass at the end is awesome how I always felt he should be, powerful and super angry, blew my mind a bit actually but he says too much, Vader is better with less James Earl Jones, the ending is 10 stars, Hope line with CGI'd Carrie Fisher, sigh."

I went to see it in theaters and couldn't believe how amazing it was! The characters were awesome and really cool, the story was so original, more original than I imagined, great script, and the whole plot just fits perfectly into the original trilogy. Felicity Jones was perfect, Diego Luna did a great job with his character, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, Forrest Whitaker, Ben Mendelsohn and Mads Mikkelsen are fantastic characters.

"liam_nb","10","1","1","14 May 2020"," Probably the best of star wars movie outside the clones wars and empire strikes back
","This captures everything star wars should be a star war it has a cast of well acted and good but flawed characters who are put up against a superior force and pull off the impossible but unlike the original trilogy it doesn't end well for our heroes which is a great twist on the normal formula where you expect all the good guys to live.
On to the truly great bits the action scenes fast paced and incredible visuals and sound make them very effective unlike a lot in the sequels and prequels and even some in the original trilogy they have a lot of weight to them you feel the harshness of the rebel struggle like in the battle of both, also a rebel ship Rams a star destroy into another one and Darth Vader cuts up a bunch of rebels at the end it's absolutely class.
There are notable bad parts like the underuse of Mads Mikkleson or Forest Whitaker and the weird grand moff tarkin CGI also Diego Luna is a bit bland in it compared to Donnie Yen and Felicity Jones Eve Alan Tudyk as the cool Droid does a damn sight better job than him the pilot guy I can't remember his name is also good got some fun lines nothing to special, overall great acting brings a lot to the star wars brand more than the sequels and prequels do it's no clone wars but it's probably better than return of the Jedi definitely worth watching even if you don't like star wars it doesn't rely on nostalgia to be good like force awakens clearly does."
"ferdey","10","1","1","14 May 2020"," Best Star Wars movie
","I was surprised to see the rating of this movie is not as good as the original trilogy, let alone The Force Awakens. This movie This one fits perfectly between Episode III and IV and fills at least one major plot hole in the latter. This movie introduces lovable characters which I would've loved to explore more and this all happens without any forced cringeworthy love interests (looking at you casual incest and Episode IX). Yes it does benefit
a little from the nostalgia bonus but not far as much as the original trilogy and the sequels do, despite including some original characters. Including those is a necessity for continuity and it isn't what makes this movie great.
The story revolves around Jyn Erso and the tragedy of her family, the conflict between that, the empire, the rebels and the blueprints of the Death Star. Eventually they are lead to Scarif, which is the final destination of our main characters who are once not (as heavily and obviously) guarded by plot armor. The atmosphere created in this whole segment is simply mesmerizing (not only limited to Scarif) with great visuals and the characters sacrificing themselves one by one for the greater cause. When recognizing the rebels' plans, the empire has the great solution to simply destroy the whole planet literally firing all hard working people without notice. They were successful at that but so were Jyn and Cassian, managing to finish the necessary deed before. As the Death Star's ray hit the planet, they were down by the seaside. Knowing that this is the end, they just hugged (not kissed (!)) one last time as the light eventually swallowed them. This was a tragically beautiful end for the remaining characters of this story (while not overdoing it) and what happens next simply serves as a direct transition to Episode IV."

"elvishbagel","8","1","1","13 May 2020"," This movie puts the War in Star Wars
","This movies plot could have just been explained by a novel, but i'm glad it wasn't. This is by far the best of the Disney Star Wars movies and it shows. But there are a couple problems, the first being the lack of Darth Vader. Vader's presence in the film is too short lived. Even though everyone knows who Vader is, it still would have been nice to see more of the Sith Lord. My second problem is Diego Luna as Cassian Andor. For most of the movie he just seems like a stock character with nothing really interesting about him. Otherwise this movie is pretty good. The return of Saw Gerrara was a welcome one, but the real star of this movie was Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic. He is without a doubt the best Disney villain and one of my favorite Star Wars villains. Jyn Erso, K2-S0, Chirutt, and Baze were all good characters, and all of their death were handled well. The action in this movie is some of the best in the franchise, and the final battle was great. Overall, this movie is full of action and (mostly) good performances which makes it without a doubt the best of the Disney Star Wars movies."
"derrickdamewood","6","1","1","30 January 2020"," Yeah I know the gripes and complaints but....
","Really not too bad compared to the other (the force awakens, last Jedi, any of the prequels). It actually delved into the force a little bit which was refreshing. Rather than people having super powers you didn't know they could do until the plot demands it; they had a good look at what the rebels actually want. Not all of them want to be Jedi's some of them just want to fight with laser guns and space ships too. Honestly that's more interesting to me than anything Jedi related. And that's what was cool about Star Wars to begin with! They appealed to people on both sides like Luke and Han! Pretty cheesy speeches, some nonsense scenes, the constant nostalgia tropes and over the top drama earn it a 6 in my book"

","Rogue One only comes very close to being the top SW movie and maybe if I was a bit younger I'd voted it so, but it has some minor moments that hold it back (ep IV and V being top for me).<br/><br/>The movie starts a bit slow, but very quickly picks up the pace, builds its characters very well, so well in fact that every single team member death brings a tear in the eyes of those of us who cry at movies. Action is on point, pacing and storyline as well. What impresses most is the realism, if such a thing is possible in fantasy (SW is in my opinion fantasy in space rather than sci-fi), that encapsulates the entire movie. People, who matter die, just like unnamed innocents, a suicide mission is not just a word to build tension, but actually proves to be just so, and that is rare thing in today's cinema - to achieve a finale where everyone dies, tragic yet knowing that the mission is a success, transitionning smoothly into ""A new hope IV""."

Several references to the Original Trilogy as well as the Prequel Trilogy were excellent additions to the film.<br/><br/>However, the first half of the film had a somewhat ""messy"" plot and unbalanced direction. The pacing was also very confusing and incoherent for viewers to follow. The film also suffers from unbalanced development of some of its characters.<br/><br/>Overall, this film functions well as a Star Wars-based war film, and an Anthology film for the Star Wars universe.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","1","1","8 March 2019"," A film that successfully answered some questions from the original Star Wars.
","Years ago, when Disney acquired Lucasfilm, I had worried that they would ruin one of the most beloved sci-fi franchises ever to grace the big screen. That being said, Lucasfilm's prequel trilogy showed us all how it could happen. Around the same time, I started to notice the quality of Disney's animated fare was drastically improving, even outpacing Pixar. The proof to finally win me over was the way they have expertly handled the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With all this in mind, I was curious how this side-story to the main Star Wars saga would play out.<br/><br/>First off, anyone worth their salt in nerd-cred knows that the original Star Wars is based off samurai films. Gareth Edwards (who directed the Godzilla (2014) reboot) certainly made this influence obvious in Rouge One, especially in the opening sequence and with the inclusion of a Zatoichi-like blind swordsman. At this point, all he needed was to add in the ""war"" to Star Wars, and suddenly we have a gritty plot that ends exactly how those who have seen A New Hope (1977) expect it to. In fact, there were moments where these scenes could have been the beaches of Normandy or the jungles of Vietnam, it was so easy to see the references.<br/><br/>While I found many of the characters to be somewhat one-dimensional (since their main objectives were either survival, duty or revenge), I did appreciate the scene-stealing K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) to lighten the otherwise oppressive mood of the plot. Visually speaking, the battle sequences (especially in space) were phenomenal, and the first firing of the Death Star was a fantastic scene embedded in my memory for its sheer awesomeness. Even so, the CGI Governor Tarkin was still on the edge of the uncanny valley, even if it was on the more realistic side.<br/><br/>A film that successfully answered some questions from the original Star Wars, I give Rouge One 3.5 stars out of 5."

I told people I didn't like it, but the strange urge to see it again kept coming back, again and again.<br/><br/>Rogue One is the first movie since the original Star Wars to make me well up with tears out of inspiration. <br/><br/>The first act is a mess of loose, seemingly unrelated plot threads, and this is a detriment to the first viewing. But upon subsequent viewings, these threads are the beginning of something beautiful.<br/><br/>The tone is the thick, oppressive cloud of the Empire and its forces looming around every corner. Characters are walking on eggshells to avoid attracting attention, vigorously going about their business or solemnly complying with invasions of their privacy... all this in the background as plot rolls forward. This movie is dense, the setting is alive.<br/><br/>The pacing starts out at a jog, but slows into a brooding strut when things escalate and subtle characterization becomes more prominently noteworthy.<br/><br/>The second act sees our ensemble cast through their devastating ties to the project and the devastation it leaves instigates discussion and a time for deliberation and action. There is some great character drama here. There is a gray moral area our characters must navigate, but it bears little consequence on the final act... but rather it serves as a tool for character growth.<br/><br/>The structure between the second and third act makes for a cause and effect rather than a direct consequence. The second act is all about the events and character growth that will decide whether or not the third act is even going to happen. The third act is very much a rich emotional payoff to a crowded yet kinetic busy second act. <br/><br/>The first act, for me at least, is given value through exposure to the second and third acts, which facilitates or necessitates second viewings. The threads scattered throughout the first act are merely plot elements being teed up at first glance, but in actuality, it will become retroactively apparent that there is a lot of subtle character set up here as well. So the structure is weird in that it folds back into itself. It is built to be watched again and again.<br/><br/>I can't express how touching I find the main lead Jyn Erso's plight. The ending of this movie inspired me and moved me to tears. Every element of a classic Star Wars film is present and accounted for, and amplified to modern standards. This is Star Wars at its absolute best. It won't stand up to saga films, since it stands alone, but it is the best Lucasfilm has given us since the Disney regime started up.<br/><br/>New characters will insert themselves at the drop of a hat, and it seems like this is nonsensical and lazy until you think about why it happens. It becomes clearer the more familiar you are with the film, which gives each viewing a new layer of information uncovered. The writers injected something I value immensely from the prequel trilogy, which was layered story-telling. Every time I watch it, I notice something new. This movie is a phenomenal middle ground between two divisive trilogies and a perfect bridge between Episodes III and IV.<br/><br/>Visually, Empire and Menace were artistic monsters that pale any other installments in comparison. But in my humble opinion, this movie blows either film out of the water. This film has excellent framing and some truly unique points of reference that Empire really only touches once. The once stunning CGI cityscape of Menace's Coruscant are dwarfed by the mixed digital and practical set pieces in this film. The worlds in Rogue One are living and breathing, a true testament of the power of modern film-making.<br/><br/>The side characters are charming once you get to know them. The themes are wonderfully illustrated through natural dialogue and action. The plot is solid. Any oddities in plot that one might notice upon first viewing will be ironed out with small details or simple imaginative thought the more small details are taken into account.<br/><br/>Compared to its formulaic predecessor, this film is a masterpiece. As for where it fits into the episodic saga, it is a classic. This film alone is worth the Disney sell-out. Even if all the new trilogy films flop for me, I'll have one more phenomenally crafted film to add to my collection.<br/><br/>I consider this film to be flawless."
"theclusters","10","1","1","3 January 2018"," A lot better than Episode VII
","I don't get the hate on this movie. It actually poses a great chance to introduce people who aren't Star Wars fans yet to the world, as it is the first completely independent movie, that introduces all characters seen. At the same time it does a great job at delivering the Star Wars world we fans know and love. <br/><br/>The major reason why Episodes VII and VIII are bad in my opinion, is because they completely mess up the continuation of already existing characters from the original movies, they do a poor job at creating new characters and they consistently made the wrong decisions with the design, making everything look more cheap and childish. Don't even get me started on the horrible ""hero moments"" and ""punchlines"" that felt out of place.
On the other hand, Rogue One didn't do any of these mistakes. It perfectly delivers the feel of the Star Wars Universe, with more flashy effects of course, but without fundamentally changing parts that shouldn't be changed. Funny scenes are only placed where they are appropriate. Character development and behavior is the way we know it from the original Star Wars movies, but with new Characters and a new Story of course.<br/><br/>The bottom line for me is: this movie is great for both people who have never seen Star Wars movies before, and for the people who have seen Episodes 1-6 and are curious what Disney has pulled of since buying the franchise. They managed to do a much better job on this one, than on Episodes VII and VIII."
"yahia_moh","Null","1","1","28 December 2017"," Incredibly Underrated
","I'm surprised how many viewers were disappointed that the movie lacks any real existence of the Force, the Jedi, or saber fights. How can they exist when they were almost wiped out in Revenge of the Sith, sparing Yoda and Obi-Wan? Yoda is in exile, and Obi-Wan is on Tatooine with Luke. Rogue One takes place before A New Hope, in the darkest hours before the Rebellion really gets into high gear. It's a story of sacrifice after sacrifice, following a small band of rebels who venture into what they very well believe is a suicide mission. They believe they have nothing left to lose. They dart into the enemy's grip with little else but hope, and inspire their doubtful comrades back home to take up arms and join the battle to retrieve the plans of the Death Star. <br/><br/>""One fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day."" And so they have. The movie concludes with a scene set immediately moments before the opening scene in A New Hope, with the Rebels receiving the blueprints of the Death Star, and with an animated Princess Leia on the verge of starting the adventure that first kicked off the franchise. <br/><br/>I believe this film is very well made."
"LaVenturedeSolo","8","1","1","28 December 2017"," What Episode 7 and 8 should have been.
","I'll be plain with this review: this film fills the void that was created by Episode 7, and now Episode 8.<br/><br/>To point out some of the negatives, the script is pretty basic, but on par with every other Star Wars film, so it works. The use of CGI characters may annoy some viewers as it is done quite a bit, but thankfully it is done well enough to not stand out. In fact, I would say that it would not be noticeable other than the fact that we know the actors are deceased or just older than what the film portrays. Finally, there are a few ""Easter eggs"" and nostalgic elements which makes the film a little too self-aware at times, but far fewer and more relevant than what we see in Episode 7 and 8.<br/><br/>With that said, the rest of the film is excellent. The plot is solid, the characters are interesting and unique, the film is well paced, the humor is actually funny but fitting for a Star Wars film, and the seriousness of the story is never lost. The action sequences are well choreographed and fun to watch, and the ending leaves the viewer feeling satisfied. Some actors/characters that had been part of the prequels made an appearance, which was nice to see; I don't like the idea of ""forgetting"" that the prequels happened. <br/><br/>I remember feeling a bit speechless and shocked when the credits rolled, because I had actually set my expectations really low thanks to the ""Episode 7 Effect"". Once I came back to reality, I felt a sense of hope that a fantastic Star Wars film was still possible. I personally believe that this is one of the top 3 Star Wars films ever made."
"misties","10","1","1","25 December 2017"," The best Star Wars movie I have ever seen
","I have, in the course of a year, already watched this movie around 50 times. The Force Awakens shocked me by being a borefest. All of the bitterness was erased when this movie was released. It more than lived up to all the praise with stunning attention to detail, excellent acting, and a screenplay that never at any point disrespects the series. From the opening sequence to the thrilling climax there is never a dull moment. <br/><br/>An extended version would be an added bonus. I hope to see one in the future. I am so glad that this film was made. Not just because it was great but also that it instilled confidence in knowing that a new Star Wars can be crafted properly and respectfully as opposed to one being done basically just to be the next ""Highest Grossing Film"". I want to see a good movie when a Star Wars film comes out. I really don't care how much money it makes.<br/><br/>This one was brilliant."

Let's say that the story sits right to the Empire Strikes Back, but in my opinion, Rogue One is a better movie.
For me, it seems that Disney want to close Skywalker saga and to concentrate to new movie in Star Wars universe. We will see more about that when Han Solo will hit theaters.
Nevertheless, I will go again in cinema to watch The last jedi."

But on second and third viewing I found the characters and story to be highly involving - surprisingly so given the context. If there ever was a SW tale of good vs evil, people acting despite the odds stacked against them and a story that, even if you know what happens in the end, how it happens is perhaps the most important part - then this is a film that stands out in its own right."

What can I say here? Not much than was already said or written or speculated about. This is a very fine take with that inmistakable 70's look, Felicity Jones being a very cool main hero along with a stellar cast of many including Forrest Whittaker or Mads Mikelsen. The movie is long and loud, and sometimes it lack a certain depth or psychological development but it worsk okay and goes on at a great pace so the 120 minutes are not that excrutiating at all. 
I do recommend this epic movie as a part of a huge Star Wars mosaic"

","I had very high hopes for this film but was very disappointed.<br/><br/>The original trilogy (ep 4,5,6) has a look and feel that IS and WAS Star Wars.<br/><br/>Even the horrible prequels (ep 1,2,3) had that look and feel. Sadly Ep 7 the force awakens lost that look and feel.<br/><br/>I did not think it could get worse. Rogue One is even worse.<br/><br/>The acting was mediocre at best. Half the time the musical score was terrible and at times it was starwarish but not enough.<br/><br/>The worst character by far was the imperial Droid K2SO. In the entire STAR WARS universe there has never been a droid that did not act droid like until now, very poorly done Disney! This movie is mindless fluff, but does have lots of action and battle scenes and should appeal to children and the mindless tween crowd. If you forget this was supposed to be star wars it can be entertaining.<br/><br/>Star Wars fans especially those who sat a theater in the seventies will be horrified by what has become of the Star Wars universe and may find it a disappointment.<br/><br/>In sort if you loved The Force Awakens you'll love this, If you hated ep7 this one is the worst Star Wars yet.<br/><br/>I would not waste money on the DVD or BLYERAY it will be on TV Soon."

This movie is completely different it treats the franchises fans with respect. And has a fantastic story-line to boot. There is a lot of action sequences and a great story( something I felt was lacking from awakened). The tie in between this film and star wars a new hope is fantastic.

If as an audience member you keep that in mind at all times you'll follow the plot and enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Because there are lots of other bits and pieces that get in the way of this, some useful as lead ins/call-backs to other entries in the Star Wars saga, and others that are really just filler.<br/><br/>It's a decent story being told though, and beautifully links in with 'A New Hope'. It was a risk to introduce so many new characters, but for the most part we engage with them. There are a few familiar faces that pop up along the way too.<br/><br/>For me it isn't a better film that 'The Force Awakens', but it's a good entry in the saga.

I really appreciate Diego Luna and Donnie Yen so it couldn't be all that bad.<br/><br/>Well, it wasn't to my sheer, utter surprise, but simply great and entertaining. I was half expecting to be disappointed again but not at all, it's a fresh, new movie which is of course set in the Star Wars universe so you have all the familiar setup yet you don't hear the word Skywalker, Han Solo or Leia at all. Talking about this I just realised last night in the movie how fed up I am with it after TFA - please don't ruin it more for me with dragging my childhood legends through the mud.<br/><br/>I loved how dark it was. I mean if you have listened to what Mon Mothma said in A New Hope you were quite aware that it was a Kamikaze mission and I do appreciate it that it was no and-they-lived-happily-ever-after stuff. That was simply great and made it even more a not-so-much-for- kids movies (Jar Jar f***ing Binks is still haunting me).<br/><br/>As for Jyn I was maybe a bit disappointed - I didn't expect a Lisbeth Salander but I wish they would have given her a bit more depth and bad ass behavior or at least some character but well...can't have it all.<br/><br/>CGI effects - stunning!

Surprising, because I was doing my best to turn my seat into a reclining bed. <br/><br/>But why did I have this reaction? <br/><br/>I saw the first SW in the theatre decades ago, and I've seen most of the movies since. Without being a SW geeks, I have as many viewing hours invested in the Star Wars universe as the next guy. But to be honest, I'm just not that interested in it. A lot of it is confusing to me now. It isn't intellectually exciting.<br/><br/>Everything in, and about, this movie seemed artificial to me. None of it felt natural.<br/><br/>I wasn't engaged with the characters at all. There was absolutely zilch in this movie to move me. I want emotional engagement, and this movie failed to deliver. Child separated from her family. Nothing. Young woman reunites with dying father. Nothing.<br/><br/>There was just nothing new in this movie. It lacked originality. I felt like I had seen it all before. Am I too jaded for this film? <br/><br/>Although I keep going to fast-paced action films, I'm not particularly into them. I dislike movies with hardware, explosions, gun fights and chases. This movie was all about that. Annoyingly, the theatre was full and I went to the movie with a friend who was sitting beside me. I couldn't play on my phone during the chases and shootouts.<br/><br/>How is it possible that this movie has done so well in the box office? What phenomenon am I missing? I suppose action-craving boys and young men are most of the voters on IMDb. I think maybe I'm just in the wrong demographic. But even many of the critics like this one though. What did they see in it??<br/><br/>Strangely, I loved Passenger and Arrival -- two movies that are not as well received as this one. It boils down to me disliking the action element. I wonder if this has to do with me never having played video games. <br/><br/>If I remember correctly I think I had pretty well the same reaction to the previous SW movie."
"laptoppclaptop","6","4","9","14 January 2017"," Not too bad but nowhere near Lucas own films
","Well, it was not as bad as Force Awakens, it was quite watchable. However, I agree with all those who say that this film has not recreated the original magic in the films written, directed or at least produced by George Lucas himself. Whoever makes the film puts the stamp of their mind and imagination on it and neither of two films made by Disney has the feel and magic of George Lucas Star Wars world. In spite of any flaws that Lucas films had, he created a huge gallery of very interesting, unique, memorable characters and different worlds in universe. His films were always full of surprises. It was easy to remember all the main characters. Both in Force Awakens and Rogue one we have a bunch of greasy looking fellows, and they always come in a big pile and are hard to remember as most of them are quite boring. A lot of places in the universe look too much like Earth. Rogue one was definitely better and more intelligent out of the two made by Disney, but still, it had too much confusing, all-the-same looking action, predictable and clichéd storyline. Still, it was OK to watch at Saturday evening."
"phoxytwicks-11543","10","4","9","11 January 2017"," A new hope - truly
","I've always been someone that went to see a film I wanted to see at the cinema, after the buzz had died down, when the seats were more empty and I had the space to take that film in more. It hasn't changed.<br/><br/>I grew up on re-runs of the original trilogy and I loved them. Then in my 20s I saw the three new prequel films which were fun, less dark and seemed benign of any real classic moments (save the fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-One Kenobi - which in all honesty was brilliant, the birthing of Darth Vader and death of Anakin which should have been far more, was completely cringe-worthy). Quite a different set of films to the original trilogy but had their own merits. By no means classics though that Empire was or A New hope. Still, seeing the original films, I remembered how I felt as a kid towards all of it, it was a universe I very much wanted to be a part of and watching them, I did for the brief hour or two, it attracted me to play the old X-Wing games on my older brothers PC (when he was out!).<br/><br/>I then, in my 30s, went to see The Force Awakens which, it tipped the proverbial hat a few times in acknowledgement to the other films and was somewhat respectful, it was still a very different film to any of the other six and I can only compare it to this decades set of Super Hero films in how it was directed, built up and let down. Still, it was better then the prequels, full of action and romanticised some of the old characters in how they were brought back into it. If this film was a torpedo aiming for an exhaust port 2 meters wide, it missed, by a good foot or so but a try none the less.<br/><br/>Then, when it seemed all hope was lost by many including me. This film, really... was... a new hope. I could only complain that it was too fast paced for some characters to develop but other than that, it is gold, truly in line with the A New Hope, as it needed to be. Everything felt fitting for the whole universe and whilst I do agree Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher were not spot-on recreations of themselves, they were pretty flawless. This film made me feel like a kid again in all kinds of senses, the rushes of the alliance and even the appearances of a matured, menacing Darth Vader (yes, its James Earl Jones!). The main heroes and villains play their part but its important to remember this is a spin off film so I think its fair to understand why they are not developed too much but enough to warrant their places. This film made me tear up several times not just for nostalgia but it just felt right, the space battle scenes were perfect as were the various land battle. The environments, the characters, the Death star, the original Star Destroyers, all of them exactly in keeping with the original universe (now the time line is neigh on the same as the New Hope, I suppose that was obvious to expect).<br/><br/>As you can tell, I really liked it. I wish the main villain and heroine in this film had more development or were just a little more memorable to set this film more on this own than just a add on to a legacy but I still rate it as 10. Star Wars needed a real comeback film and this was very much it."

","Shallow characters you don't really care about, long, boring political dialogues among aged men, clichéd dialogue and action scenes. I was incredibly disappointed in Rogue One. But what can you expect from a director who's greatest film to date is Godzilla. <br/><br/>All I wanted for Christmas was a good Star Wars movie. Instead I got a mediocre war drama. <br/><br/>Replace the Tie Fighters with airplanes. Replace the Death Star with a Nazi base. It's just a run of the mill snatch and grab flick with little soul, lore, or the magic that Star Wars is supposed to capture. <br/><br/>How this film is rated 8.1, along with the terrible Force Awakens, is beyond me. How could this film be as highly rated as a Stanley Kubrick film?<br/><br/>Mediocre. I actually fell asleep in the theatre, as did my brother, and many others."

","I went into this movie with great hope. That being said, I was very let down. The pacing of the movie was slow. The music was terrible. <br/><br/>The CGI actors looked terrible. I understand that Tarkin is a central character, but they really missed the boat on the CGI. Look to LOTR movies and Gollum for how to do it.<br/><br/>The lip service paid to the fanboys was not needed. Several scenes in the movie were nothing more than fanboy material. Darth Vaders castle scene in particular. As was the last part of the movie with Darth Vader. <br/><br/>They tried with the tiny blurb of a screen crawl to make a full fledged movie, but it felt tired. And trying to please the fanboy crowd of Star Wars fans is a bad thing."

","As a die hard Star Wars Fan(atic), I can finally say the guys at Walt Disney and LucasFilm finally got it right.<br/><br/>Rogue One mixes the best elements of an original story, great fight sequences and absolutely little or no cheesy scenes. It reminded me a lot of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>All the actors did an amazing job and the film was exciting even without the presence of any Jedi Knights. There was a lot of easter eggs and fan homage throughout the movie. The only single gripe I had was with the special effects used on Peter Cushing. In this time and age, I thought we had the technology to do anything! The actor looked pretty fake, but this does not ruin the movie in ANY way. Some may not even notice.<br/><br/>I hope we get to see more of these types of Star Wars movies that are original and geared towards mature audiences. Star Wars has amazing material and you have to try really, really hard to screw up a movie. <br/><br/>I'm quite pleased with Rogue One and recommend it to even non-die hard fans."

","It's not star wars anymore, that's for sure. George, it's as if a million voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. That's what star wars fans are feeling right now. It's not a bad movie, but it has no feel of a star wars movie. You can probably rename it to ""random sci genre movie"" and you won't feel any difference. Also, if we are moving away from Jedi characters then at least get a lead character as interesting as Han Solo. Like the previous movie, I felt no attachment to the characters of this movie. The only interesting character was that of Jet Li. Rest were run of the mill random people, nothing gripping about the lead or the supporting characters. The movie delivers only on one promise, the Darth Vader sequence. It was without doubt the only gripping scene in the movie. George, hear the voice of your fans, save star wars. It's already on life support, save it before it dies."
"sqwrll","10","4","9","20 December 2016"," Awesome and Perfect
","Finally not disappointed! Best film since Star Wars. It was fun, gorgeous, witty, and deep. Real Star Wars as it gets. I think this one would make George Lucas proud. This new director and the screen writers are true gems. As a fan I feel they get it. I am happy to say there is character development, fair representation, solid strong female lead and truly enjoyable relationships and satisfying characters. They nailed it without the force too; but there it was woven throughout the whole movie. It's essence and presence always there. I also liked all the jokes and references without it being too cheesy or over done. Basically I usually like to find a strong critique, but I can't. The only one I could think of is it could have been longer as I wanted to get to know some of the side characters a bit better. Also I think one brief CGI characters acting was bad, but since this is a spoiler less review I will leave out who. I am looking forward to what this team does again and hope they make the next one."
"LILITh-12","9","4","9","20 December 2016"," Almost perfect, should have been Episode 3.5
","Rather than repeat what other reviewers have said, this review focuses on something very special about this film that no one has been mentioning in the right way. <br/><br/>That is, I focus on discussing the degree to which this motion picture achieves the degree of cinematic spectacle for which the original Star Wars films were so famous. <br/><br/>Many people don't remember what it was like to watch Star Wars projected off of a true 70mm print, on a huge, towering screen. Quentin Tarrantino does, so he has been pressing lately for 70mm to make a comeback. JJ Abrams shot part of The Force Awakens on 70mm IMAX film. But most fans haven't seen a good 70mm projection in forever.<br/><br/>It's only recently, with the dawn of 8k movie cameras and 4k projectors, that movies are finally starting to appear close to how they once looked, if you go to the right cinema. <br/><br/>However the problem with the Force Awakens is that JJ's style of cinematography and shot composition does not really take full advantage of the full scale spectacle. He still has a TV director's mentality, so in The Force Awakens the shots focused in on close shots of the actors, with the ongoing battle action mostly relegated to digitally motion blurred background goings-on. <br/><br/>In TFA, almost none of the action scenes involving space ships actually took place in outer space. And almost none of them were much more than highly unrealistic seeming combat with crazy chase cameras and the characters pulling off ridiculous, super-hero level maneuvers on a consistent basis, without even really trying. <br/><br/>The over-the-top-ness of TFA's space scenes and seeming invincibility of friendly pilots honestly detracted from JJ's film as spectacle. All the extra motion blur required for JJ's style also seems to make 4K rather pointless. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the original Star Wars trilogy featured hyper-realistic, high-resolution 70mm projections of extremely detailed hand-made models of Star Destroyers and the Millennium Falcon, etc. Space battles took place mostly in outer space. There were plenty of wide shots showing the whole massive battle in RoTJ's final act, with huge ships colliding and fighters all over the place. <br/><br/>But the key quality of the originals was the hyper-realism of the ships. You felt fully convinced they were REAL. They did not look the slightest bit fake, and the action that played out always had enough good guys dying all around you, that you genuinely felt the main characters were in danger, which made it a truly exciting space battle spectacle to watch.<br/><br/>RoTJ especially did an amazing job of interweaving space battle footage with the goings- on on Endor and in the Death Star, brilliantly portraying various simultaneous plot lines in a way that kept the excitement at a fevered pitch. All that is only possible when the viewer's disbelief is properly suspended, which is contingent upon everything seeming REAL and PLAUSIBLE as opposed to ridiculous and cartoonish.<br/><br/>Enter Rogue One. <br/><br/>Rogue One somehow manages to finally capture the hyper-realism of space battles that made the first trilogy great, while doing it digitally in an almost seamless manner (only the digital characters were a bit of a let down, but it was darn close to fooling me, and it didn't bother me that much). And it does this while cutting between four simultaneous plot lines that dovetail into the most perfect ending ever in a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>This movie is proof that digital effects have now finally become capable of the realism of the originals.<br/><br/>It also handles the ""seedy crime-infested spaceport town"" better than any of the films. It introduces a bevy of new types of aliens, ships, and bad guys without seeming like it was really trying to. We see a host of various planets, all extremely distinct, including one really awesome scene that was pure fan service for Sith lovers everywhere without feeling like forced fan service.<br/><br/>All in all, this director needs to do more Star Wars, including hopefully the final Episode 9. I felt this flick combined the best qualities of all the Star Wars films and tells a truly tragic and sad tale that had me choked up at the end. And it really puts the ""War"" back in Star Wars.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give it 10 out of 10 is the digital actors were obviously digital, and one or two of the supporting cast just did not really pull their weight. But those aspects can be overlooked as the performances were still not bad, they just weren't extraordinarily memorable. But it's still better than the digital characters and supporting cast of the last four Star Wars film releases, so 9/10 feels appropriate to me."
"sentient-74528","10","4","9","20 December 2016"," Good Star Wars film!
","Star Wars Rogue One is a prequel to A New Hope. The plot revolves around Jyn Erso, the daughter of scientist Galen Erso, who is forcefully hired by the Empire to develop the Death Star. Galen was working for the Empire before and decided to hide with his family, but he knew eventually they would find him, so he prepared a contingency plan to have Jyn free. Jyn eventually meets the rebels and realising they are not so united as they seem, she seizes this one opportunity to get her hands in the plans of the Death Star on her own, which results in the name of her team: Rogue One.<br/><br/>I can't say more without lots of spoilers. This film is similar to the prequels in the sense that we know more or less how it will end. And probably that is precisely what many people think is wrong with it. But I don't see a problem because I didn't watch the film for its conclusion, I was interested in what was Jyn all about. And I was pleasantly surprised: Jyn's story is an original one, not the same old boring Star Wars receipt of ""silly stormtroopers vs typical hero friends"" kind of story. It can sound cheesy, but it is about.. hope. Disney will make sure you know it: they say several times the rebellion exists because of hope, and yet they really delivered the message in this film.<br/><br/>I will try to explain: Jyn finds herself in a really oppressive regime. Here we don't see much in the sense of comic relief moments and outrageous luck. Here we watch how creepy the imperial army can be, parading with a tank to intimidate people, enforcing ""law and order"" and how rebels can be easily put in the position of terrorists. Of course most of these messages are not tossed at your face, but they are implied.<br/><br/>Rogue One is different because it is a sad story. Don't expect happy endings. If you are a great fan of the original Star Wars, you are in for a treat: here you will see what princess Leia means by ""this is our most desperate hour"", and you will understand how Darth Vader knows she carries indeed the plans to the Death Star and has to dodge bureaucracy to have her arrested her crew killed. You will understand why the Death Star has such convenient weaknesses and you will see the last of Senator Bail Organa. All of that respecting some Star Wars cannon most people don't even know.<br/><br/>I must also point out the fact that some characters are brought back to life with CGI, most notably Grand Moff Tarkin (this is hardly a spoiler since he appears early in the film). It looks somewhat fake though, I guess the jaw doesn't move as it should, or perhaps the skin around the lips is not convincing enough. Maybe we still don't have technology for that, but I respect their effort. Apart from this weird impression, it was otherwise very well done. When Tarkin walks about and is not speaking, it looks like Peter Cushing is alive and well. Even his voice is convincing.<br/><br/>All that said, I don't understand why people are so annoyed about recreating the original Star Wars universe. Some people say that liking these films is like clinging to the past and refusing to change, to move forward, to create new stuff. But hey, what's so bad in reliving the old Star Wars experience? If you don't want to, feel free to not watch the films and carry on. Sure, some things in life are meant to change and move forward, but this is cinema, don't take it too seriously. Also, character reconstruction like Grand Moff Tarkin to me seems like a very new initiative. That's called experimenting. I see no problems in attempting some new tricks with good old stories and watch the results. So, it is an old-fashioned look at Star Wars? Yes, I suppose. Is it a new approach? Yes, I think it is also a new approach. The story is good, give it a look.<br/><br/>About the other characters.. admittedly there's isn't much there I suppose. Probably because there isn't enough time. But Jyn is the focus of that story (all others serve the purpose of giving her a team), and I think her story is well done, so I'm happy with it. I am giving this film an 8 out of 10, because it lacks some character development and the CGI is not mature enough for a 10. I'd risk saying this is probably the best Star Wars after Empire. Fascinating."

","Without doubt, the best addition to the franchise since 'Empire strikes back'<br/><br/>I was skeptical about this film because the amount of hype and following disappointment of 'The force awakens' left me with no hope at all for any upcoming star wars films... but Rogue One, you've given me a New Hope!<br/><br/>The whole structure for the film was thoroughly constructed, nothing dragged on, and each scene played and important part. I was constantly on the edge of my seat that my partner had to tell me to calm down every so often! If you're a huge fan of the franchise, you will notice a lot of great nods to the original 3, but ill let you discover those.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, I didn't cringe once from any line given, but out of every character, K-2SO won my heart! <br/><br/>You don't want to miss this one in the cinemas, so grab a ticket before it's too late!

"duckmushroom","7","4","9","19 December 2016"," A long time ago... there were some real Star Wars films. Rogue One is the Return to form!
","I have to say, and fans will be eager to discover, this is the first real Star Wars story since the original three. While the prequels were a badly executed re-envisioning of the Star Wars world, and episode VII was a poorly acted rehashing (almost pastiche) of the other stories, Rogue One manages to plant a firm foot in the Star Wars universe without kicking anything over. This is an enjoyable episode that really tastes like Star Wars.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are a couple of flaws to be found. It lacks characterisation. Han, Leia, Vader, Luke, Obi Wan, Yoda, C3PO, even Jabba - all of those characters carved out clear archetypes for themselves that have stayed in the pop culture subconscious. Rogue One is not so rich. I've already forgotten the lead character's name. Then there was Captain Endor (I think? like the moon?). The take-away character from R1 is the CGI robot K-2SO, so that tells us something.<br/><br/>Also, a lot is crammed in, meaning plot development points are rushed perfunctorily. When they take the captured pilot to whatever Forrest Whittaker's character was called (ok, names not my strong point), it's a clear set-up for a Han-brought-before-Jabba style moment, and could have served for great character development and action. But it's just, ""take him to the beast."" We see the beast, it's got tentacles, cut to the next scene. Let down. Nothing is paused upon, nor considered.<br/><br/>Final tiny gripe that you're going to see everywhere - CGI Tarkin and Leia. Distracting, if interesting. But let's not dwell.<br/><br/>Having said all that, none of it distracts from the overall cohesive adventure and excitement that you expect from Star Wars. The characters are likable and follow-able, the worlds are rich, the battles entertaining and for a space opera it does an excellent job. Worth a watch."

","""These Star Wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays. This one has new names for basically the same characters, played by different actors...the same bad guys. How many times can they make the same movie and get people to pay?"" read a review in Rotten Tomatoes. This is the exact opposite from the truth, and shows that the critic didn't even bother to watch it. While The Force Awakens felt overly repetitive and disappointing moments after I left the theatre, Rogue One completely outperformed my expectations.<br/><br/>I thought it would be just a mish-mash of poorly connected CGI battle scenes and overly choreographed, ridiculous jedi combat scenes, with a recycled, overly simplistic, uninteresting plot.<br/><br/>Instead the movie delivers a simple-yet-captivating plot with its fair share of well placed, well made twists, a fair share of good CGI mixed with action scenes, and characters with sufficient depth. It has lots of action, comedy, drama (the good kind) and tragedy. It also provides good answers to one of the most recurring questions of the Star Wars universe regarding the Death Star.<br/><br/>And speaking about the Death Star, after the underwhelming superweapon from TFA and knowing it will be destroyed in A New Hope (and again in Return of the Jedi), I stopped seeing it as threatening. This movie surprised me showing it in all its terrifying glory, bringing a sense of dread that A New Hope and Return of the Jedi didn't have (also taking advantage of the obvious improvements in CGI to make it look truly awesome). You probably read about how they brought back Peter Cushing, and it's not just his face, it's all about him, including his technological terror.<br/><br/>As obvious as it is that this movie draws its inspiration and ovrall soul from The Empire Strikes Back, it's not just a recycled plot (like TFA), but a new movie, with its own story and a new set of heroes and villains, rightfully taking its place as the prequel to all Star Wars movies (because they never managed to make episodes I, II and II, and nothing you say is gonna make me think otherwise)."

If you need Jedi masters and Sith lords doing the impossible, there's not much here for you.<br/><br/>If everything absolutely, positively has to be all right at the end credits, you probably should stay away.<br/><br/>If you're prepared to face the reality that evil sometimes becomes strong and the only way to fight it is to fight to the death, literally to the death, you may find this as good a movie as I did.<br/><br/>Right from the first, there is no blaring fanfare, no yellow letters running diagonally back, back, back into infinity. My first reaction was, ""Hmm, that doesn't sound like John Williams music."" And it wasn't. Michael Giacchino, who gave us the fine music for the latest Star Trek movies, scored this. There are the necessary referrals to John Williams' music, but no more than is necessary.<br/><br/>Then there is egregious murder and ruthless Imperial bullying. There is the gritty life of the underbelly of those who either resist, or at least don't cooperate with the great Empire.<br/><br/>So much has been made of the blind monk Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen. He's a great character. He's no Yoda, but he doesn't need to be. In fact, for this story he needs NOT to be.<br/><br/>The great revelation to me was K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, whose voice is provided by Alan Tudyk. I wish that had been C-3PO's character! I can show his character in one line, spoken with that flat, almost-depressed tone: ""I'll be there for you."" (Jyn looks surprised) ""The captain said I had to.""<br/><br/>Most blessed of all, there is no one who has never had any training but who, suddenly, miraculously, is a master of the force, and no one is more surprised than she/he. There are none of the rabbit- out-of-a- hat surprises that Star Wars has done better than any other franchise. For instance, when suddenly the grim, grizzled veterans look to pretty young Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) for leadership, it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>Lastly, in order to defeat an almost-omnipotent Galactic Empire, somebody's going to have to die. And it may be somebody you love. <br/><br/>Be prepared.<br/><br/>This may be the best chapter in the Star Wars saga, because, beyond all hope, it is the most real."

That being said Rogue One is easily the best movie of 2016.The millons of Star wars fans who waited in lines,spent crazy money,and had high hopes for The Force Awakens, your memory of that trash has been Erased. From the characters,storyline, and the fantastic visuals, this movie is grade A. Rogue One is long lost- Real- Star Wars Movie that fans have waited over 20,25 ,30, well any year to be released .

","Yesterday I went to this movie without any high expectation but with a certain level of hope to avoid any disappointment. I was surprised to keep watching and consuming new information about places, characters and plot itself. I would really recommend to all no-fans: watch all other SW movies first before enjoying Rogue One. Otherwise there might be some 'not-understanding-gaps' because the movie does not really explain the background story and 'assumes' that you already know it. Of course, for real SW fans this one is not a problem at all.<br/><br/>Rogue One qualifies to reach (or even be on) the level of episodes Hope, Empire and Jedi. Visual effects are outstanding, space fights are not forgotten and there are some funny (droid) moments present as well.<br/><br/>Negative for me: That the emperor was not appearing - I would survive. But as much as the character of Donnie Yen was enjoyed, the only thing I was still missing - a real jedi combat. Only because of this I am not ranking this movie with 10. Everything else is outstanding.<br/><br/>Positive for me: Darth Vader. Especially when I started to think that the creators could produce more than just a long battle - Darth Vader saved the day within 1 minute! As a true SW-fan I almost happy-cried when Darth Vader engaged and demonstrated a true masterclass of himself.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a must see for real fans and definitely a good visual entertainment for non-fans.

Some passable on purpose mistakes like... why do you land an assault ship one mile away from a house your are going to search? Or, on episode 5 Walkers were really tough and Luke had to take care of them personally , the Rogue One walkers were kinda version 1.0 with weak knees. But this is not important, the good stuff (No Millennium Falcon here!)is that you get to see again some faces that spiked your adrenaline 40 years ago. X wing leaders are here... yippee!

","First, I am a big Star Wars fan. With that said, Rogue One is so different than the other Star Wars movies. This movie did not have the struggle with top rebels or Empire leaders, this is a war movie. There is a plan and you watch the team try to accomplish their mission. I found it to be refreshing and exciting to watch.<br/><br/>The film filled a gap from the first (Episode IV) on how the Alliance acquired the plans to the Death Star to learn how to attack it. I always had a thorn in my side about the weakness they found with the Death Star - that thorn has been removed now. <br/><br/>This is not a jolly adventure, it is more real and serious than previous films. Not much levity, one line here and there. This is more of a dirty, gritty movie. <br/><br/>If you are a Star Wars fan, you will like the film. Even if you had never seen any Star Wars movies, you could still enjoy this film - knowledge of the history is not necessary. <br/><br/>Rate it 8/10 mostly due to action, but the script is solid and the storyline above average. The acting was also good, but not outstanding."

I really enjoyed all the references to the prequels and the originals but I won't go into what happened because I don't wanna spoil or ruin the moment for anyone. this film had a surprisingly dark tone to the story which really worked. This movie really showed the ""war"" side to star wars that have never been done before. in previous star wars films a lot of the battle scenes seemed a little cartoonish and didn't come off as like a life or death type scenario where as to this movie all the battle sequences were dark and gritty and even though you know how the overall story is going to end you still have that feeling of is it going to work out or not sort of thing. This has got to be my favorite star wars film since empire. I have seen this movie about three times now and every time I'm finding more and more reasons to like it. Overall I really enjoyed this film, I liked how it connected the prequels to the originals nicely, and it brought back that classic star wars feeling that hasn't been around in a long time. If you are a fan of star wars you will love this movie."
"jerome-stampe","6","4","9","18 December 2016"," Not bad but not good either
","I did not know what to expect when I went to see Rogue One. I heard fairly good reviews, notably that this new movie was better than the Episodes I, II and III but that's not hard considering how lame those were. While Rogue One turned out to be not too disappointing, it really lacked originality: you still see stormtroopers walking around all Imperial premises (to kill time I presume), the rebel base sees plenty of activity with ground crew running around the X-wing fighters although there is no battle to prepare for (yet), the characters go from planet to planet at the rate of an organized tour, all of which have a different climate/atmosphere, etc. Another thing which also disturbed me was the amount of new uniforms, spacecraft, all of which will not appear in Episode IV which follows directly Rogue One.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the movie starts without the traditional scrolling text, John Williams' music is not too present although you hear at times themes which were written for the original trilogy (saddly Michael Giacchino's new score goes unnoticed). The story is simple and straight-forward, unlike the prequels which had too much blah-blah and subplots without much to care for. I also like how a few short scenes manage to tie this episode to A New Hope (although they could have been slightly longer and ultimately leave the impression they were rushed in for transition purposes).<br/><br/>To summarize, Rogue One is not a bad movie but it lacks true originality to make it a memorable Star Wars franchise film."
"ghatfield69","5","4","9","18 December 2016"," Meh!
","Seen the movie on opening night and had great expectations from all the reviews! The Bad- The movie took too long to get moving, I did like the casting of the main girl, she seemed natural in acting and likable, as for the other characters very forgettable. Forest Whitaker was absolutely horrible in this movie, very brutal to watch him act. Comic relief was the new robot which made the movie somewhat enjoyable. A Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher CGI replacement looked very bad! I would have liked to of seen a stand in or look a like. Peter resembled a video game! Most of the cool action scenes were in the trailer and not much more added. The Good- The 5 minutes of Darth Vader, new creatures, Familiar old faces, AT AT beach battle and the tie in to A New Hope 1977. Half to 3/4 of this film was very dry and slightly boring. The space battle was very predictable and seen before. They did a good job on the retro costume design and technology. For me this is a one time watch. The charm, humor and magic is not here. I believe a lot of people expected this formula. Even though this story is meant to be a downer and everyone dies at the end, there should still be something good to take away with this film but there's not. Even the Empire Strikes Back was a downer as but it sure had a big impact on you, Rogue One doesn't. I watched a New Hope last night to see how well the 2 tied into each other, the space scenes were believable but the Empires mountainous locations and Vaders castle did not seem to work for me in the Star Wars universe. Maybe because its never been seen or mentioned in prior movies. If mention in the books or comics I wouldn't know. This would be my honest review being a life long Star Wars fan! Didn't love and didn't hate it!"

","I went to see this film without seeing any trailers and knowing only a bit about the plot and I was so pleasantly surprised! I think the movie had just the perfect combination of action, humor and other components important for this kind of a ""space adventure"".<br/><br/>The casting was on point, I think Felicity Jones was just the perfect choice for Jyn's role, and all of the other roles were also well cast. The characters were also easy to ""like"" and no death felt pointless in a sense.<br/><br/>The film was of course very different from the previous Star Wars -franchise entries, but I think that was a good thing. This film felt so fresh and left me on a high walking out the cinema. Definitely recommended!"

","I think it was one of the best films in series.Because It filled a biggest gap in the original series.Of course i m talking about weak side of the death star.It is always absurd the us because engineer that planning must think the this weak side.After 39 years from the ""New Hope "" in the rogue one we got the know it was plan of the Galen Erso. Although i loved the film,the soundtracks is disappointing because the soundtracks didn't made by John Williams.One of the most loved sides of the Star Wars its soundtracks. The classic soundtrack has to be use in the other movie. Briefly Rogue One has some differences from other movies but it was a great movie and it should be watched."
"chapsmydog-241-735308","6","4","9","16 December 2016"," Star Wars falling away from Star Wars
","Rogue One: A horrible Star Wars Story.<br/><br/>First lets start with there being no crawl at the beginning of the movie. Have the writers of Rogue One never seen a Star Wars movie. Chris Weitz & Tony Gilroy wrote the screenplay, and they dropped the ball! Every Star Wars story starts out by letting you know what's going on and sets the mood. I thought this movie was in-between episode III and IV the ENTIRE time until a poorly computer enhanced Leia came onto screen. Second: Darth Vader.... HIS EYES HAD A RED TINT!?!?! Why can you not get his suit correct? Did they think it was a smart idea to change it? It wasn't! I understand James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader but it did not sound like him at all. They can make the Admiral look the EXACT SAME but they can not match Vader voice? Pathetic! Just watch the original three movies and you can get a concept of how Vader talks. You notice how Anikan towards the end of episode III talked? Short and to the point. Never saying anything cliché. Well that changed in this movie. The way he fought was not the way Vader usually fought. Third: We only see one person who has the force and that Vader, why did we not see Mace Windu? He did not die in Episode III so why would he not be in this movie, it makes me think they just forgot about the greatest Jedi ever. Remember he was the one who originally defeated the Emperor. He was the best of the best but yet they just forget about him? He killed the the Mandalorian descendant bounty hunter aka Jango Fett. I am so disappointed that Windu was not in this movie. Fourth: Where was Boba Fett? Why would he not have a single appearance in this movie? The last of the Mandalorian bloodline just doesn't deserve an appearance? Someone just dropped the ball on this movie. Rogue One was a horrible movie, worse then Episode VII by far. Never in my life have I been so disappointed. It simply lacked George Lucas. He knew how to tell a story in a way no one else could. I hate how dramatic they made it also. One lightsaber is seen, that's it. I get it's not supposed to be about the Jedi and what not but isn't that what Star Wars is about? The never ending fight between the Jedi and Sith? I honestly feel like the people who wrote this movie, the director and the producers have only seen Star Wars one time. I hope they don't screw us over on Episode VIII. So many things could have been done differently to improve this movie. Disappointment is all I have for this movie."
"adrongardner","6","4","9","16 December 2016"," Clone Wars
","This is the biggest fan fiction job ever pulled off. <br/><br/>And sometimes it works. I mean, if you're OK for constant self-aware fan jokes and CG people, then this is your movie. Rogue One is wish fulfillment that will carry it for a few weekends at the box office, but will fade more or less as quickly as any of the prequel movies. And let's just say it, if you're going to do a cheezo prequel for Star Wars, this is all you need really. But does it work as it's own movie? Not really. It might as well have been a two hour episode of the Clone Wars TV show. <br/><br/>Aside from the non-stop call outs, the trove of interesting characters and fantastic actors portraying them, are mostly forgotten very quickly in the second half of the movie. We get the perfunctory space and land battle but little else. Wen Jiang and Donnie Yen as the Star Wars Zatoichi were crying for more screen time and I hope someday they get their own deserved movie. While the computer generated actors feel really bad to me, and I cringed every single time they came up on screen, KS the Droid really works. In fact, his physical performance and effervescent humor carry large portions of the film when the actors are going through the motions. <br/><br/>I'm glad if you enjoyed what amounted to two hours of wish fulfillment and curtain calls. But Rogue One was also a missed opportunity for a true Star Wars Gaiden, a side story of it's own."
"luccewada","8","4","9","15 December 2016"," 17 years after The Phantom Menace, Gareth Edwards and Tony Gilroy have delivered a sophisticated Star Wars prequel the franchise deserves.
","It's enormously telling that, when Darth Vader makes his entrance midway through Rogue One, one is taken aback by the sheer cheesiness of his iconic costume and speech. While Vader remains one of cinema's most enduring villains, the late 1970s-aesthetic of the character is at such sharp odds with the dusty realism of Gareth Edwards' new spin-off that the contrast is truly shocking. Star Wars has come a long way, not only from the sand dunes of A New Hope, but from the infantile comedy of Phantom Menace and clustered CGI cityscapes of Attack of the Clones— George Lucas was clearly not the best person to direct Star Wars prequels; Edwards (and co-writer Tony Gilroy, who oversaw much of Rogue One's last-minute re-tinkering) have managed in one film to tell a more coherent, human story and establish the groundwork for the original trilogy better than Lucas could in 7 hours of the prequel trilogy.<br/><br/>The existence of Rogue One highlights the divide in the Star Wars mythos between the story of the Jedi and their spiritual battle with the Sith (an undeniably fascinating subject, but one that Lucas horribly mishandled) and the on-the-ground Star War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. In Rogue One, there is nary a lightsaber in sight and The Force has evolved into a vague philosophical concept, spoken of by warrior monk Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen). The choice to focus on the 'real' side of the Star Wars world facilitates, and somewhat obligates, the filmmakers to tell a compelling story of politics and war set against the backdrop of the Imperial superweapon: the Death Star. What Lucas and co. were forced to paint and sculpt in 1977, Edwards can create with layers of CGI: Rogue One in many ways does justice to the ambitious vision of the original Star Wars: a vision too grand for its technical era. While the constance of thrilling set-pieces in JJ Abrams' The Force Awakens, occasionally at the expense of quieter character moments, was grating, in Rogue One it feels justified: this is, after all, a war movie. Also, while several of the film's characters (Îmwe and Sheldon Cooper-esque droid K-2SO) are superbly-realised, the band of misfits at Rogue One's core feel neither deserving nor necessitating a great amount of those ""quiet character moments"": these are simpler figures than a Skywalker or a Solo, a Rey or Finn, and these are figures whose strongest moments of character development emerge on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Though the poster-girl for the film, Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso is undeniably the least interesting protagonist a Star Wars film has ever had: despite Jones' best efforts, Jyn remains frustratingly one-dimensional throughout. She's not unlikeable, and her motives are noble, but- as the only significant female character in the film- she fails to stand out from the otherwise-male team as a memorable hero. Diego Luna's Captain Andor is drawn far too similar to Jyn, sharing her stone- faced resolve but possessing none of the wit of the great Star Wars male leads: Han Solo, Finn, Poe Dameron, Anakin Skywalker (we may be lying about that last one). Riz Ahmed's Bodhi Rook is, at the beginning of the film, incredibly energetic, but after spending some time with ""Rebel extremist"" Saw Gerrera (a distractingly wheezy Forest Whitaker) loses much of his personality: Ahmed, a superb actor, is never truly given a chance to shine. Jiang Wen's Baze Malibus, meanwhile, serves primarily as a Butch Cassidy to Îmwe's Sundance Kid. They're a formidable duo who could probably have led their own spin-off, and provide tremendous insight into the impact of Imperial rule over the unsung citizens of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>The film's most impressive performance, unsurprisingly, comes from Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic: a character of subtle villainy, highlighting further Revenge of the Sith's missed opportunity at exploring the Dark Side's complex appeal. Mendelsohn excels in every scene, particularly opposite both Mads Mikkelsen and a certain other actor in a stunning surprise appearance. His scenes with Darth Vader are the highlight of the film: the Sith Lord has never been filmed nor framed so beautifully. Michael Giacchino's score, though largely a generic mashup of John Williams' classic motifs, is at its best when introducing Vader.<br/><br/>Rogue One's third act, much of which was reshot and reedited (several shots from the trailer are nowhere to be seen) is essentially a hybrid of the Original Trilogy's most beloved action scenes: there's an AT-AT attack, a break-in involving ladders, forest fight and the most impressive X- Wing battle in the franchise's history. The outcome of the Rebels' mission, if you've seen Star Wars, is predictable. Rogue One's final sequence is as breathtaking a tribute to Lucas' 1977 film as we'll ever see, presenting a magnificently terrifying realisation of one legendary Star Wars figure and an utterly joyful appearance by another. However, Rogue One doesn't need nostalgia and foreshadowing to succeed: as a standalone product with few links to the familiar elements of the franchise, this looks and feels like Star Wars in a whole new way. Breaking free into the Galaxy, this film establishes a new era of the Star Wars world: one of uninhibited exploration and imagination. We're hopeful for the future: after all, Star Wars is built on hope"
"pdmajumder","9","4","9","16 December 2016"," Star Wars 3.5, well done.
","**NO SPOILERS** Another feather to add to the cap, for the Star Wars franchise, Rogue One satisfies and thrills entirely. With engaging character- building and location development, this movie seamlessly ties together pace, emotion and realism. True human flaws are depicted with delicacy, however without the loss of that grand, old valiance and righteousness that we all love, in our leading characters. Despite being introduced to them for the first time, through the course of the film, we connect and empathize with the characters and feel like we've always known them-- which is a tough feat to achieve, especially because the movie had to bear the burden of not having anyone(much) from the Episode Films. This had me wishing, (although unjustly, I know) for the ending to be different.<br/><br/>But the little that we do get to see of our old beloved characters, is enough for at least the hardcore fans' hearts to feel content. Darth Vader is given to us in just the right quantity with it feeling neither like a repetition of Episode 4 nor a completely detached story. Jyn Erso is the perfect rogue-turned-hero and her rebel allies are just as sharp and driven. Cassian(Diego Luna) is a warrior in the true sense of the word and the war that he and his team fight is gritty, convincing and unpredictable, just like it should be. It would be unfair to leave out K-2SO from this review, as he is a delight to watch, perfectly balancing the mechanical features of C- 3PO and the sass and persona of R2D2 (**Minor Spoiler**both of whom, I'm happy to say, are given a couple of seconds on screen). <br/><br/>It is a much required ""prequel"" and is important to the saga to bridge the events of Episode 3 and 4. The visuals, as expected, are worth watching in 3D and IMAX and reach their full peak towards the end of the movie resulting in a spine-tingling climax. For someone like me, who never really is out of the Star Wars spirit, this is just what I needed. If this is any indication of the future spin-offs to come then I can say that things are looking very bright ahead, indeed. And now, begins the wait for Episode 8 (hey, that rhymes!)."
"assassin-42523","9","4","9","15 December 2016"," This is the prequel we're all looking for
","From visual to storyline to soundtrack, this is overall a much better experience than The Force Awakens Visually, this movie uses the same color blend as A New Hope, making the assimilate of old unused footage to be as natural as possible, it also stay true to the effects of old, from Death Star's lasers to explosions by blasters. Furthermore, the use of incredibly advance CGI, reviving Grand Moff Tarkin and PRINCESS LEIA, is so perfect that you wouldn't even be able to notice the difference without a trained eyes. Combine all that with tons of awesome action sequence that showcase the true power of the Empire and the Dark Side, enhancing the sense of horror and hopelessness of the Rebels cause Soundtrack, bringing back the sound effects and timing of 80s movies, but not just that, they also uses all of the original soundtrack by John Williams, but with minor tweak here and there, from Major to Minor scale, different tunings, different notes, different pacing, etc. according to the scenes. However, I'm most impressed with the dark storyline. It showcase the complexity of good and evil, instead of the old "" Rebels are good, the Empire are bad"", this movie actually shows that for a good cause, man can be led astray and do horrible things. Moreover, it doesn't shy away from death ( like oh so many Disney movies ), spending each moments, each seconds to build up each characters so when they sacrifice for others to live, audiences will actually care and wept for them. Overall: A magical movie for trve fan, a satisfying prequel for a cultural phenomenon that is Star Wars"

I would like to see this director, plus script/story writers, do all the Star Wars Movies if this is the result. The the essence of good vs evil ( the force) is brought back with new characters. The fact that so many of the characters died in the movie gives it more realism, grit and impact. The way it tied into the story line of previous first Star Wars release was cleverly done with appearances of past and present actors cleverly (CGI) done.

","When I heard the reviews for Disney's first standalone Star Wars film, I was sure I was going to adore it. After I watched it, though, I didn't exactly feel that way.it was good, but it was not nearly as good as everyone praised it to be. It looked beautiful, that's for sure. The tone and atmosphere was awesome, because such had never been seen in a Star Wars film before. That in my opinion was the best part. The characters had the potential to be awesome and unique to the franchise; instead, they were flat without much development, some even feeling wasted (I'm talking to you, Saw). It was hard to feel their pain and like their chemistry, because we didn't have a reason to and they didn't even have much chemistry. The character with the most personality is K-2SO (who was awesome by the way, and probably the most redeeming quality. By no means is Rogue One all bad. The Darth Vader scene was amazing (the second one, of course). The scenery and character designs were awesome, and the call backs to the other movies were expertly done. I simply think overall this film is overrated and could've been a lot better."

"kaledolfin","4","3","6","14 April 2017"," Who would have thought that a Star Wars film could be dreadfully dull?
","After the disappointing fan-ficish feminist retread that was TFA, I for the first time had no anticipation for another Star Wars film. It wasn't so much that I was determined to boycott the franchise, as much as there just didn't seem to be much of anything to interest me in it anymore. So when Rogue One came out, I felt no desire to see the film. It came to the theaters and went with little notice from me.<br/><br/>But I read many reviews that claimed this one was significantly better than TFA. So I decided to give it a shot on RedBox, and I'm sorry I spent the money. It was indeed better than TFA, but not much.<br/><br/>This film did do some things well. The art direction for one. In TFA, the warmed up Ralph McQuarrie leftovers made the franchise feel like it was cannibalizing itself. Here though, the McQuarrie designs are welcome since they go a long way to depict this particular period in Star Wars lore. <br/><br/>I would also argue that visually, Rogue One does capture the epic nature of a galaxy wide war, in contrast to TFA which visually felt like a small made-for-television effort.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, and the battle scenes are well done.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot and characters fall flat.<br/><br/>I have to admit here, that the unthinking political rants from the screenwriters biased my viewing, so I was expecting empty social justice drivel. Thankfully there's little of that, but ultimately the plot was a story that didn't feel like it needed to be told. Stealing the Death Star plans. It seems that the few lines in Episode IV that summed this up were quite enough. A 2 hour film to flesh out a detail just doesn't feel necessary here.<br/><br/>The characters were intensely uninteresting. There's an eye rolling moment where Jyn beats down about a half dozen armed, trained, and armored stormtroopers with a stick. Apparently this was where we were supposed to hear Jyn's womanhood roar, and there really doesn't appear to be more to her character than that. There's a couple of scenes where Jyn is lecturing the older and wiser leadership of the Rebellion, and giving a speech to some grizzled soldiers in an attempt to inspire them. Why wasn't anyone asking who let this naive inexperienced girl into the room? Why would anyone listen to her?<br/><br/>The robot attempts at humor fell flat. The blind Jedi wannabe would have been far more interesting if he had been made a last remaining Jedi with an actual lightsaber. What is with Disney's obsession with having heroes bringing sticks to a blaster fight? Cassian felt like a poor man's Biggs Darklighter. Forest Whitaker was there for gravitas apparently. The rest of the characters were just...there. Oh, and the evil Empire was a bunch of old white men. Surprise, surprise.<br/><br/>The last Darth Vader sequence was pretty cool, we never really saw DV in full action like that before. But I could have waited for that clip to come out on YouTube.<br/><br/>This diminishes my interest in Episode VIII, which I just saw the trailer for today. It looks like Rey is still wearing her stanky Jakku fatigues. Pew!<br/><br/>Behold; you are witnessing the death of a franchise in slow motion."
"SteveResin","8","3","6","11 April 2017"," Star Wars Suicide Squad
","Director Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job with the slimmest of story lines, which consists of the rebel alliance stealing the plans for the Death Star that lead into the original Star Wars, A New Hope.<br/><br/>The Good: The cast is excellent, and the new characters are hugely likable. The best of these are Baze and Chirrut, one a badass warrior and the other a blind monk with some serious skills and a love of The Force. I could easily have watched a whole movie featuring just these two as the protagonists. Felicity Jones is believable as Jyn, the daughter of the Death Star's chief architect who joins the rebellion to lead a rag-tag team to retrieve the plans for the Emperor's ultimate weapon. Diego Luna and Riz Ahmed also bring their A Game. The droid K-2SO is also a welcome addition to the crew, a classic Star Wars droid if ever there was one. Ben Mendelsohn is a decent villain, if a little one note, and both Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen provide good support.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are fantastic, possibly the best I've ever seen in the Star Wars universe. Even the smaller street battle scenes are masterful and expertly crafted. The Death Star has never been better or more fearsome. Its destruction of a city is just visually stunning. The space battles are pure old skool Star Wars and full of excitement and tension. There's one scene in particular where a ramming ship pushes one Star Destroyer into another and it just looks incredible. But all this eye candy aside the ultimate scene is towards the end when Darth Vader makes a last ditch attempt to retrieve the stolen plans and takes out a whole squadron of rebels single-handedly in a small corridor, in a scene so badass it will surely become iconic.<br/><br/>The Not So Good: There's not much here I didn't enjoy, and it feels harsh ragging on such a great movie, but it wasn't the greatest idea to include a CGI Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin. He just isn't convincing, and it was giving me bad flashbacks to some of the terrible CGI in The Phantom Menace. If they'd used him for one small scene maybe shaded in darkness it could have worked, but he appears in quite a few long scenes and it really takes you out of the moment. Princess Leia looks even worse, and again was there really any need to show a close up of her badly computerized face? Maybe a long distant shot would have worked better. Small complaints though, and they don't spoil an otherwise hugely enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Leia's final words in Rogue One are ""hope"". Well this movie has given me hope, hope that those soul destroying prequels are fading into the ether and the Star Wars franchise is back on track."

The music, its not John Williams but the composer for Rogue One did a good job, only one problem, the songs he did I remember that well but John Williams songs I can remember, even non Star Wars songs, I don't like how the songs change some of the John Williams songs. Original Characters, I like how they included characters from the original trilogy like: Mon Mothma, Princess Leia, Tarkin, Red Leader, Gold Leader, The two guys that would to kill Luke in A New Hope, That Old Rebel Captain or General, C3PO and R2 D2 and most of all...Darth Vader. The Ending, who didn't like Darth Vader killing rebels, cutting them in half and choking them to death, it is the best scene of Darth Vader and Rogue One. Let's go throw negatives: Less Darth Vader, I really would Darth Vader to be in the film longer, even if it a minute longer, I would love it, I think they should done less Tarkin and More Vader. Deaths, I like the idea of everyone dying but I think that one or two people should have survived. Like K2 and Baze. The battles, okay just to let you know I love the battles but the final battle in Rogue One didn't fill right, they keep cutting to an other scene, one point it Jyn and Cassian and the next it's X wing and then it's Baze and then K2 and then......, there is too much going on, too many stories in the battle. The last negative: Darth Vader's joke, I don't think I have to explain this one. So there my review of Rogue One, it was awesome, I recommend this film."

I was simply astounded by the gripping nature of the action (similar to Edge of Tomorrow) and depth of the story development.

","Well, I re-watched Rouge One and I must confess - I guess I am too old now for the Star Wars franchise. What most annoys me is the fact that the Stormtroopers most of the time just produce hot air by their shooting, their armor is good for nothing (even with a stick you can knock them out - well, I know even the little teddybears in Episode VI did it with stone axes) and the inconsistencies in the movie(s) are countless - a planet-sized shield breaks down because two star destroyers hit it... Also, they still use discs for storing data :D And a little group of ground troops of the rebels engage a whole imperial garrison - I mean common, at least an outflanking maneuver should be included in the training of the storm troops if they already cut down the target exercises and spend money on fake armor. <br/><br/>Some more examples!?<br/><br/>1. If the building of the Death Star is such a secret operation why use human pilots for transporting crystals and other stuff. Aren't there droids in the universe (or maybe just spaceships with an autopilot-system!?)<br/><br/>2. Why the stormtroopers transported the crystals with the tank through the (hostile, rebel-infested) city instead of using air transportation as vertical takeoff is standard there should be enough space for that kind of maneuver or you just make SPACE.<br/><br/>3. Why killing the engineers!? If the Deathstar is flawed I would use that team to find the weakness. And really 6 engineers!? I guess you would need for whatever system you are planning and engineering for a project big as the Deathstar dozens if not hundreds of engineers. Even the toilet/waste system for the Deathstar would be a great challenge to manage.<br/><br/>4. Last but not least why using Stormtroopers at all and not just Droids (ofc not those dumb ones of Episode I to III)!? I mean K-2SO is a droid specialized on tactical analyzing and he alone killed over a dozen stormtroopers - how many a killer droid programmed and equipped just for one purpose: for killing would have finished off!? Hundreds!?<br/><br/>I just listed those as a few examples because I could go on and on and on - the mistakes and logic-bending issues are countless (no counter-espionage, the rebels can move and do whatever they want, the Imperial Army is always surprised, even bases with thousands of rebels are possible etc. pp.)<br/><br/>Star Wars imo is highly overrated - if I compare this with classics like the first Alien movie or Blade Runner this is nothing more than storytelling on a level of John Wayne movies (his mediocre, mass output movies). Yes, the first 2 Star Wars movies were epic (the 3rd to a certain degree, I always hated the Ewoks-part) and I re- watched them countless times, but all the other movies and series were just disappointments. And as I watched the first trilogy I was of very young age and the (for that times) epic visuals may have clouded my judgment a little. Even Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe!) or the first movies/show of Battlestar Galactica are Noble Prize worthy masterpieces compared (storyline, construction of the respective ""worlds"").<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong on a technical level Rouge One is superb, but the story and the ""world"" itself are at most mediocre and with every additional movie it shows more and more that there is not much substance to it - just compare it with the Star Trek universe (I am no Trekkie) and you see easy which one is a more coherent and interesting universe. Rouge One is better than The Force Awakens but still nowhere near to be a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Final words: if my country would be ever threatened by such incompetent invaders like the imperial forces I would take my pocket knife and maybe a stick too and start a revolution and by tea time I would have defeated them - alone ;)"
"arcticdragon340","5","3","6","12 February 2017"," Enjoyable, but overrated. So much potential lost.
","In layman's terms, I feared this movie would be Jurassic Park 3, an unnecessary sequel that adds nothing to the series. But it turned out to be like Jurassic Word, a fairly entertaining sequel that does add something, had bland characters, and an exciting new world that became unexplored scenery, but it did end with a pretty entertaining climax. Rogue One was better than I feared, but not as good as I hoped. It had so much potential and wasted nearly all of them.<br/><br/>It tried to be a war movie in Star Wars, but fell into that trap of trying to be serious but just coming off boring. Ironically, when the real war started in the climax, it became less the ""war movie"" it's been trying to be, and more a standard Star Wars movie, where battles were fun and exciting to watch, not horrifying and grim. The ending was a mistake. The main characters died, and the movie rushed forward and pushed the rest of the movie behind it, diminishing the movie as a standalone movie with its own ending. It was just a big set up for A New Hope.<br/><br/>This movie has too many new planets. It jumps from one planet to another, hoping to make the universe appear bigger, and tried less to make each location actually interesting. The Phantom Menace had a beautiful planet that needs to be protected, a desert planet with chariot races, and a city planet, capital of the Republic. Each location plays a role in the main characters' actions. All other Star Wars movies did this too. Rogue One did none of this. On Jedha, the only interesting planet, the giant statues and remnants of an old Jedi-like culture were pushed to the background and became nothing but scenery. No exploring ruins, no interacting with the culture, nothing. <br/><br/>Most of the characters had some pretty good story ideas, but also fell short. Like many movies before, this movie had too many new characters, and struggled to make all of them interesting. <br/><br/>In A New Hope, Han Solo was a self-serving outlaw antihero, and this personality echoed throughout everything he did in the movie. Unfortunately, in this movie, the characters introduce themselves, and then audiences have to carry this first impression with them throughout the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso lost her family, yet there was little to show she missed her family and hated the Empire. The scene with Jyn in prison, suggest that she is rebellious and antisocial, but in the movie, she showed little memorable attitude.<br/><br/>Cassian shot an innocent man out of necessity, introducing himself as an antihero who represents the dirty side of the heroic rebels. This is the only controversial act we see him do in the whole movie. He had a chance to assassinate Jyn's father on orders, and he ultimately chose not to. There was so little prior character development for him, that it's hard to tell if he was a changed man, or merely adapted to the changing situation. <br/><br/>K2SO, the reprogrammed imperial droid, was arguably the only character with an interesting personality. I could close my eyes, and he was the only character I enjoyed listening to. He was the only one who provided some much needed attitude.<br/><br/>Chirrut Îmwe, AKA the Asian guy, was unfortunately a token stereotypical Asian guy. He used martial arts against the bad guys, never does it again, and just mutters one quote about the Force throughout the movie, establishing himself as deeply religious. The movie never used him as a teacher/mentor-figure to the others, or anything. We don't know why he followed the other main characters. He got swept up for the ride, and never left. <br/><br/>Baze, Chirrut's friend, whose name I had to look up, was just there to grieve for Cirruit's death at the end. <br/><br/>The ex-Imperial pilot who defected from the Empire, well, there's really nothing else to say about him. We don't know why he defected, and I never did remembered his name. <br/><br/>Saw Gerrera was an extremist in the Rebellion. Like Cassian, he could have represented the murderous side of the rebellion. And yet, the most grim things he did was put sacks over people's heads (like terrorists?), and interrogate the pilot with a silly tentacled creature that reads minds(?). <br/><br/>And the main villain had more personality than most of the cast. Unfortunately, the film did very little to show how evil and menacing he could truly be. He was responsible for the death of Jyn's family. And yet, when these two enemies finally face each other for the first time, the villain was swiftly shot down by somebody else besides Jyn, and the confrontation ended with no real climax. <br/><br/>This movie started a lot of bold and innovative ideas, but stopped after barely dipping in. It was a serious war movie that dragged for the first half, then became a standard Star Wars movie with an exciting climax. It created a bigger but less interesting world. It introduced the main characters and made them interesting quickly, and then forgot to actually KEEP them interesting. And it couldn't decide if it was a standalone film, or an overly long introduction to the next movie. <br/><br/>Much of the genuinely deserved love and praise for the movie depends on the exciting climax, where most of the content was less original and more familiar. And it really was a pretty damn good climax. Whether or not the audience can take the excitement of the epic climax and walk away from the movie with that same impression is up to each individual viewer. As for the rest of the movie, if anybody finds the characters and story just as strong, interesting and compelling to watch, I would really need an explanation why."
"destinylives52","9","3","6","5 February 2017"," The Best Star Wars Offering Since Return Of The Jedi
","Mostly taking place days before ""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope,"" ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" puts us at the tip of the spear of the Rebel Alliance. Said tip is headed by two rebels (played by Felicity Jones and Diego Luna) who volunteer to infiltrate a heavily defended, Imperial base to steal the plans to the Empire's dreaded, new weapon, the Death Star.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is the scene when Darth Vader boards a Rebel ship. Invisible within the dark hallway, his breathing can be heardthen the red light saber ignites. Vader straight up murders dozens of rebel soldiers within a span twenty seconds, an unstoppable, evil force moving forward as he kills. It is Darth Vader's most terrifying moment in all of the ""Star Wars"" movies.<br/><br/>What makes ""Rogue One"" more satisfying than the last four ""Star Wars"" movies (Episodes I, II, III, and VII) is mostly due to a tight screenplay that does not contain many head-scratching moments that put off ""SW"" fans; and a more brutal depiction of combat where characters that you grow to like may not survive. The ""dogfights"" are also faster paced, have better dialogue, and have great choreography. And last but definitely not least: the numerous characters from Episode IV that are brought back, either through CGI or from unused film footage from the 1977 movie.<br/><br/>My ticket to ""Rogue One"" was money well spent, and this title will be part of my Blu-Ray library in the near future.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","Star Wars: Rogue One was a movie I watched in the Odeon, Dec. 2016. I believe the Mask that Darth Vader had was way too small, and the cape did not look good either. In the past SW movies, Darth Vader looked very powerful, but not this time. This movie seemed to be about good versus evil; about war and peace; and about destiny. However these themes and their challenges were not properly developed. There could have been a lot more suspense, plot developments and character development. It was very hard for me to like any of the characters, and I could not attach myself to the characters, like I once did with Luke Skywalker for example. SW is not only about Science Fiction Futures - but it is about current day triumphs over political evils in our world. SW is supposed to teach the audience that fighting hard, believing in ones dreams and aspirations gets rewarded - not destroyed. Like in this movie when 2 main characters perish at the end. Furthermore, the visual of Rogue One seemed too polished. It was that self-developed innovative style of brand new ideas that I loved about SW. This movie, did not have anything new in it. It was reproducing the same themes, visuals and ideas - SW is not about repeating the same ideas - but growing with the times, expanding into new modern philosophies and helping the audience to know that good triumphs over evil at the best of times."
"swilliky","8","3","6","22 December 2016"," First of what I hope are many Star Wars spinoffs
","The first of what is presumably many to come of Star Wars spin off films explains the structural defects of the Death Star that made destruction so simple in the original film and the plot to steal the plans that allowed the climax to happen.The story follows Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the daughter of scientist Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped construct the Death Star and a rebel that is almost even too rebellious for the Rebellion. Jyn is freed from prison to help enact a plan to discover a message that has been delivered by an Empire defector, the pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed).<br/><br/>In order to find the pilot, Jyn teams up with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and the droid K-2S0 (voiced by Alan Tudyk) to seek out her old mentor Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). The story bounces around from planet to planet creating an even larger galaxy that fans always assumed was out there but now can see and apply names. The shots of the various planets are beautiful and Gareth Edwards does a great job directing these expansive shots like he did with the Godzilla remake. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"ericrnolan","9","3","6","21 December 2016"," A short review of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (2016)
","""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is every bit as good as you've heard; even this non-""Star Wars"" geek had great fun with it. I'd cheerfully give it a 9 out of 10, and I'd recommend you give it a try even if you don't typically enjoy the franchise.<br/><br/>Die-hard fans are currently noting all of the things that make this film unique in the series: it's the first ""Star Wars"" movie without a Jedi, the first without the trademark opening text-crawl, the first one without a lightsaber duel.<br/><br/>Casual fans might be more impressed with more general differences. Two stood out for me.<br/><br/>One, this is the first Star Wars film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) that seems aimed mainly at adults. Yes, the fairy tale elements are still there — we have an underdog orphan searching for her father, the requisite anthropomorphic aliens, and a humorous robot mascot (which surprisingly worked quite well). But those elements are absolutely upstaged by a bona fide war film, complete with tactics, strategy, panic, collateral damage and casualties. I remember thinking during a surprisingly gritty urban warfare scene that it was as though some filmmakers had taken a scene from a film like ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) and set it within the ""Star Wars"" universe.<br/><br/>Two, I think that this is the most human Star Wars movie we've had since ""Empire."" It wouldn't be ""Star Wars"" without the aforementioned aliens and robots, and plenty of references are made to the Force and the Jedi. But this is a movie about ordinary people. Yes, there is one larger-than-life character who appears  force-sensitive? This universe's equivalent of Marvel's ""Daredevil?"" (This was a confusing story element that didn't always work for me.) But we are presented primarily with all-too-human anti-heroes who feel fear, suffer, and die.<br/><br/>Isn't that more exciting than watching cartoonish aliens fight armies of equally cute battle-droids? In this film's better moments, it made me feel like a was watching a ""real"" war with ""real"" people, and I was surprised to find myself actually rooting for the good guys in a ""Star Wars"" film — this has been a series that I've long half-dismissed as being essentially children's stories.<br/><br/>Seriously, this was a good movie. Check it out."
"alfiemachin","9","3","6","19 December 2016"," New yet Nostalgic, Surprisingly Brilliant.
","Rogue one is a perfect addition to the Star Wars saga and is exactly what it needed. It fits perfectly in between Revenge Of The Sith and the original (A New Hope).There is only a couple of iconic characters shown, which I believe was necessary and they were not over used which gave the film great in dependency. Although Darth Vader is shown within the trailer, he is seen as much as The Joker is within Suicide Squad. The main villain called Orsen Krennic played by Ben Mendelsohn was fantastic! He portrayed a great balance of fear through anger and was clearly shown as a coward too. Also, the great amount power he is given, gives him unpredictability which leaves you constantly on edge. The heroes show concentrated amounts of courage and bravery which brings you quickly emotionally attached towards them. There acting was tremendous and a lot better than the new characters in The Force Awakens in my personal opinion. The beginning is quite slow but certainly not boring and most certainly necessary as it develops story and character thoroughly. And as gets towards the final battle it becomes extremely epic and will give big Star Wars fans Goosebumps! One thing I was disappointed by was that they did not include the infamous opening credits giving a small back story. Chirrut Imwe, a blind and wise warrior played by Donnie Yen and K-2SO voiced by Alan Tuydk were very memorable characters for there brilliant lines and their awesome fighting skills. The scenes were visually stunning and the story was very well plotted. I most definitely recommend this film to anybody even if you have never seen a single Star Wars film in your life."

","For me the music has very much impact on any film. Here I had a WTF feeling right from the first accord. :( And most of the time it was not just mediocre but outright annoying. Bad where used ""original"" theme and even worse where used the excellent originals. In the whole 2 hour movie maybe less than 5 minutes of the score was okay level.<br/><br/>Beyond that the movie was not really good either. Especially compared to all the hype and expectations. Yeah, the visuals are great and the casting too. But pros stop there. The plot made little sense and the execution was not engaging so you sat there wondering why this or that happens. Also many deviations stood out from the original universe that should be made properly.<br/><br/>With a neutral track I could give it 5 maybe even 6 for a ""see once and forget"" experience.<br/><br/>The whole thing would be much better fit as cartoon.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I'm sure it will bring in enough money anyway so we can expect more repeats of the same approach sending the bar ever lower. For which we, the spectators supplying the money are actually responsible. From here on Star Wars is no longer on my list of auto see, I'm putting it on suspect list and will wait out promising comments on there was improvement."

"stefikov95","9","8","24","14 December 2016"," ""A redefined approach to a well known franchise""
","""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a redefined approach to a well known franchise. It marks the beginning of a new type of Star Wars movies - the ones told from a different perspective. ""Rogue One"" puts you in a place of more ordinary, everyday struggle of people living under the terror of imperialism. But, it does it with a twist; no longer is everything black and white, with clear villains and heroes, but it is rather more grey.<br/><br/>And this is one of the things the movie sets up perfectly. It shows us how people adapted to a new order and how they developed within it. It shows us the grit of the galaxy far, far away. Connections that have been established between people of different species, united under the same goal. Their thoughts, their motivations and their conflicts. And it usually nails those. And the reason sometimes it fails to properly deliver becomes apparent as the movie goes on. <br/><br/>As a standalone film, it is faced with a difficult challenge - it needs to set up a lot of new characters and tell their stories in a relatively short time (compared to previous trilogies). Hence the reason why you might end up feeling that you haven't seen as much as you wanted to. <br/><br/>That being said, the fresh faces in the new cast were up to the challenge set before them, and delivered their roles perfectly. They successfully establish their relationship and motivations, although I would have preferred if I saw more of each character's backgrounds, which is again a sacrifice that had to be made due to shorter running time. Performance of Alan Tudyk as K-2SO was brilliant and I can honestly say that he quickly became one of my new all-time favorites in this universe. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is also well executed - there wasn't a single time I felt discomfort or boredom during its run-time. Story pieces were set up properly, but at times felt rushed in order for everything to be wrapped up by the end. The movie might have benefited from leaving certain elements of the story unanswered, but as it stands, it still brought us a satisfying conclusion. <br/><br/>Action sequences were intense and incredibly filmed, mixing both real life sets and props with CGI, creating some of the most memorable moments in Star Wars saga. Those moments show us the ingenuity of both sides that are fighting and steps they are willing to take in order to succeed. <br/><br/>""Rogue One"", despite having some of these issues, still manages to bring to life an epic story filled with gorgeous worlds, interesting characters and memorable moments. A story that is going to be remembered."
"odinghosh","9","5","13","16 December 2016"," It is a Star Wars film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
","Rogue One is a fantastic and well directed movie.<br/><br/>The cast have done an amazing job in playing all the characters of the movie. The droid KS20 was probably the most lovable character, with his dry and sarcastic humor. The fantastic acting and development of the characters made their deaths extremely saddening.<br/><br/>The visuals were top of the line. The space battles were planned perfectly, with subtle nostalgic moments in them, but not to the point where the scenes became a carbon copy of scenes from other Star Wars films(Yes I am referring to the force awakens). <br/><br/>The innovative use of CGI to bring back old star wars characters to the movie was really well executed. I honestly had a hard time trying to figure out whether Grand Moff Tarkin was computer generated or not. Though, Leia, who was shown at end of the movie, looked a bit unnatural, perhaps the budget for her CGI appearance was reduced significantly, as her face was only shown for few seconds at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The only reason I did not rate this film a 10/10 is due to inaccuracies of Darth Vader's suit in the film. While people who had seen the original trilogy many years ago might not notice the subtle changes in his suit. People who have even recently looked at a picture of Darth Vader in the original trilogy, will realize that his suit in the movie was not designed well. It looked very cheap and generic. Like the ones you could buy from ebay; not something that belongs on the set of a movie.Although, I am willing to forgive the producers for this small mistake, as Darth Vader honestly does not play a significant role in the film, thus he appropriately was not shown much in the film. Furthermore, the scene where he fought Rebel soldiers looked amazing, even if did not make too much sense.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that Rogue one is a stunning film. With the right balance of action packed,jaw-dropping scenes and dramatic, tear- jerking scenes. I would go as far as to say that this film is better than the Force awakens. For the younger generation, this is probably the best star wars film to date. A stupendous feat for a film that has nothing to do with the Force,Jedi,or Sith."

"magnusmax","6","4","10","13 May 2017"," Rogue One: (A Semblance of) A Star Wars Story
","Right off the bat, I am going to clear up the major issue Rogue One: A Star Wars Story presented for me: despite its claim to fame as the story of a fully-fledged suicide mission, it failed utterly and entirely due to the lack of empathy I felt for the Rogue One crew. Despite the heavy-handed 133 minute running time, this movie devoted such little time and attention to character development that it has sadly forced me to dub it ""a generic echo of something once great"". I was certainly apprehensively excited for this latest installment in the Star Wars universe; however all hopes for an equal to The Force Awakens had fallen flat by around the halfway mark. It meshed well with its predecessors, yet lacking the heart that it so sorely needed, I felt the tons of money poured into visual effects were wasted. Considering the effort, both financial and physical, as is always the case, it definitely fell short.<br/><br/>First off, I'd like to talk about characters. Not only are they integral to every story, but they are especially integral to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The rebellion is built on hope, and the film is built on its characters. My pre-sentiments of the movie, gathered from spoilers and marketing, left little to imagination as to the pain and sorrow which surely must swamp its viewers by the final, heartbreaking scenes, detailing the brutal fates of our dearly beloved cast. Yet, surprisingly, not only did the supposedly tragic end disappoint me – it bored me. I read someone's thought someplace that the movie did not rush through its plot – yet I would argue it rushed so much that by the end I felt no connection with the characters! Somewhere else, I read another person's view: ""All the characters were introduced very quickly all in one movie and yet by the end I still loved them enough and felt the significance of their sacrifice enough to cry a bit."" I wish it had been so, but I sympathize with the first eleven words more than the remainder. It was only too brief. Having seen the film, I barely know any of the characters' names, and why? Because they lacked matured, developed personalities. And so they meant nothing, when they should have meant everything. I should add that I generally disagreed with the cast choice; however, that is my personal preference.<br/><br/>Related to the subject of characters is plot. I find its lack of soul disturbing. I can't personally fathom how many decades of inaccurate storm troopers, smouldering Death Stars and falsely christened nostalgia moments humanity can or will stand – I, for one, am tiring of rehashed synopses. As is wont to happen in real life, people never tire of returning to historical events from all number of viewpoints, and that is essentially what this film does. However, I consider the plot to either lack sufficient material or utilise what it has poorly. The film felt generic, non- engaging and dry. I would suggest that Rogue One: A Star Wars Story manifests Disney's true nature – an avaricious company concerned not with producing original, momentous pictures, but rather with mass- producing template-made blockbusters that draw on cheap emotions in place of deeply rooted tales of virtue and vice.<br/><br/>A great lesson I wish movie-goers would learn: Visual effects, however expensive and impressive, never guarantee a movie's success. This is also true for Rogue One. Surely a large portion of the budget was expended on spaceships crashing into one another, and while that is all nice and well, I consider such efforts wasted and vain in contrast with the film on a whole. Peter Cushing's digital resurrection was a lovely piece of artistry, to be sure – victorious to the degree of convincing unsuspecting viewers of its authenticity – and sometimes the movie- makers use their incredible capabilities for better purpose, such as when they animate the droid K-2SO.<br/><br/>Finally, morals are dangerously dubious. Obviously nothing explicit or obscene is shown throughout the duration of the film, yet disturbingly (and irritatingly) enough, the ""spreading of the Force"" goes on. I am always relieved when these erroneous religious principles are kept to a bare minimum, yet this story is replete with a conversion to the religiously dualistic belief in the Force, utilitarianism in Cassian's ""pragmatic"" murder of his friend, and general selfishness on the part of every character. These are subtle, yet mind-altering details.<br/><br/>Altogether, I give Rogue One: A Star Wars Story six stars for good production, a decent if forgettable score, effects and a clever touch of comedy. If I were feeling harsher, I could rate it lower, but I hardly have the heart. Flawed morality, token characters (especially Vader), something trying hard to be nostalgia, and a soulless watch in its entirety see the removal of four stars. I think people need to realise that classics cannot be re-lived in our modern day and age, but rather we need to be forward-thinking, creating original content appropriate for our place in history. I appreciate the ""war"" element, but largely we are seeing nothing new in this film. Slipping, the Star Wars franchise is."

","This was just excellent all around!! I was literally on the edge of my seat, more and more as the film progressed, right up through the end.

It sure did this long-time ""Star Wars"" fan's heart good to see maybe the BEST ""Star Wars"" movie since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - and it was about time! <br/><br/>How anyone can say this movie isn't part of the ""Star Wars"" canon is beyond me - but in the long run, I don't care because *I* will always consider ""Rogue One"" an INTEGRAL, canonical ""Star Wars"" story. Jyn was probably the best female protagonist I've seen in an action film since Princess Leia and Ellen Ripley (of the ""Alien"" series). Also loved seeing a certain Sith Lord kick some SERIOUS butt, even though he's the ""bad guy"" - didn't matter to me - it was awesome! <br/><br/>Lucasfilm & Co., thanks for FINALLY giving us the prequel we've been wanting so badly to see for a VERY long time!!"

"robl-4-298110","9","4","10","22 December 2016"," The best Star Wars flick since the originals
","First and foremost, see this in 3d.<br/><br/>Perhaps my high rating was influenced by low expectations. I and my son were vastly underwhelmed by the prequels of recent years. Part of the downfall of those movies IMHO was due to stacking it with known actors, e.g. Samuel Jackson, Natalie Portman, etc. and bringing back original cast. Fail. The actors here are largely unknown and therefore have to stand on their own and the story has to stand on its own. Although there are ties to the original moves, it's a natural fit, nothing is forced, and the originals aren't milked.<br/><br/>The story is coherent, flows, and keeps moving along. The music helps with that and keeps the sense of excitement going. No forced romances, and the epic moments come and go without being overstated. Little if no one scene character development.<br/><br/>There are minor humor angles, which were limited to a couple of scenes and done really well. One made me and the two kids bust a gut. No spoilers here, sorry.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones nailed her part as did others. The worst of them rated a B, which is saying a lot.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 as Diego Luna could have been just a bit better in a couple of parts, nor does he have the charisma/engagement of Ford or Hamill.<br/><br/>Go see it, very worthwhile."

","I was in for a big surprise when I went to the theater, expecting something very similar to SW The Force Awakens. And I was in for a bigsurprise! There were no Jedi mind tricks and Sith force lightning. There was no love story with couples kissing in the middle of a gunfight. The conflict between armies and within them was not reduced to a mere 1 on 1 boss fight. There was only WAR. Blunt, grim, terrible WAR raging throughout the galaxy in all forms and sizes, from urban to space. And I loved every minute of it!<br/><br/>Especially nowadays with all the dirty little (or not so little) civil wars in which it is not clear who is fighting who and why, this movie shows that nobody is innocent, and suffering and loss can blur the line between right and wrong.

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","10","19 December 2016"," The Force is strong with this one. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was honestly pretty good.
","Although this franchise is popular with fans of all ages, this first stand-alone film in the 'Star Wars' Anthology series is quite dark, violent and downbeat. It's painfully clear that this movie takes the 'Wars' from Star Wars, very serious with high death count and casualties. Even the final of this movie is surprisingly bittersweet, brutal and pessimistic. However, while, it might upset some parents, that the action is too intense for young viewers. For the most part, Rogue One is still an impressive dark and grittier film that mature audience would love, even if it lacks some charm & humor. Not everything, has to be market for general audiences. Sometimes, people loves, when mainstream film go a little edgy. 1980's 'Empire Strike Back' & 2004's 'Revenge of the Sith' are some good examples. While, some critics might dislike this, I love it. It's very uncommon. I like the dark side of the force, sometimes. I have no problem with the enough of violence in this film. At least, the writers try to lighten up the mood at parts with cool cameos, funny one-liners, and references. If you still hate that, then I find your lack of faith disturbing. Maybe, this movie is not for me. However, for me, I was very pleased with this installment. This film is exactly what Disney needed to do from the outset. Fills in the plot lines of the original trilogy and built something unique out of them. Because of that, director Gareth Edwards and his crew made the first Disney produce Star Wars film that actually felt somewhat new in its story, rather than a film depending solely on familiar story-line, nostalgia and fan-service to drive the narrative like the recent rethread (2015) 'Episode VII: The Force Awakens"". Set before the events of 1977's 'Episode IV: A New Hope', the film tells the story of a group of rebels trying to stop the development of a super-weapon that could destroy an entire planet. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while it still have the same old-tiresome planet destroying plot line as other 'Star Wars' movie, I didn't find it, as bothersome as other films. However, I did wish, the movie did have more to tell with its story than that. After all, I thought, the relationship between main character, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) & her missing father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) was a bit underdeveloped, but what do, I know, maybe it's supposed to be that estranged. It was still awkward to see her go from being impartial about the war, to upright, leading the rebellion. That arch wasn't well-delivered. On the other hand, she goes a great job in both the action scenes and emotional parts of the film. Better than Diego Luna as squad leader, Cassian Andor whom a lot of people found, underwhelming. In my opinion, I think, his character was somewhat written that way, as a quiet, trouble-assassin. Complicated, yet layered. If anything, the rest of the Rogue One crew including smart-ass reprogrammed Imperial Droid, K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk), blind warrior monk Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen), weapon expert, Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang) and Bodhi Rook, a former Imperial pilot (Riz Ahmed) save this movie from being dry. I honestly care for all of their safety. Not so much for Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera, a veteran of the Clone War who I felt was hamming it up. I love the refreshingly diverse cast, even the producers is trying to better market the film for Chinese audiences. Also, I love all the surprising familiar cameos from recurring characters from the other films, even if some of the de-aging CGI was kinda janky. Unlike some people, I did like the work, they did with Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). It really look like the actor return from the death. The visuals and special effects were good for the most part. The world-building really did look retro and familiar, while giving us, something fresh to look at. I was impressed with it. Because of that, I thought, the story structure and editing could need some more work. The first half was very slow with all the quick cuts. It really didn't establish, much. Felt too much of a fan-film. Seeing, no opening crawl was also a bit weird. The music by composer Michael Giacchino, that play in the background was just as distracting, however it did get better as the film went on. The second half of the film was a mixed bag for me. I can watch it, but it was a bit challenging to watch at times, due to the themes, they were, going for, with the desert world of Jedha. Too much current real-world metaphors in that part, for what is supposed to be an escapism movie. The third act, felt a bit rush, but yet again. It's a 2 hour movie. Yet, there were also a lot of extensive re-shoots during those final moments, which was pretty jarring to see old scenes from the trailer, missing from the final product. Plus, I thought, they could fit the inconsistencies between what is establish here in this movie and what happen in 'Episode IV', a lot better. There were a lot of things that still, didn't make sense to me, mostly with what was Tantive IV was doing at an open warzone in the first place. Still, Rogue One's strengths far outweigh any trouble spots. Overall: The film is intense, exciting and emotional, with its last act building to a crescendo and offering one memorable moment after another. Gareth Edwards has shown, with the first of these spinoffs movie can still have plenty of life in them, adding even more excitement to Star Wars' huge modern resurgence. Now, go head and witness the power of this fully operational battle station, firsthand."
"UltraMega77","10","4","10","17 December 2016"," Best since Empire!
","This is my first review on IMDb, here goes nothing!<br/><br/>The bottom line is that Rogue One captures the essence of the Rebellion. The spirit, sacrifices and urgency of events are serious and as a watcher of the film, you do feel connected to the characters and their cause in fighting the Empire. <br/><br/>This film to me was finally a return back to the gritty, believable elements that my personal favorite Empire Strikes Back, and A New Hope covered so well. The characters, there actions and the feel of the film was realistic and natural. It was not forced (no pun intended!!), gimmicky or glossed over with that Disney type feel so nobody's feelings are hurt. Even the comic relief is delivered in a very believable, well thought out way. <br/><br/>I hope they don't change the Rogue series formula! Great job by everyone involved to keep to the true roots of the original Star Wars films. <br/><br/>If you liked the original Star Wars Movie ""A New Hope"", and felt for each of the Rebellion Pilots (such as Red Leader) as they attacked the Death Star, you will love Rogue One! If you liked Empire Strikes Back and felt for the Rebellion fighters on Hoth (such as Dak Ralter), you will love Rogue One! Finally, a film fully dedicated to the ""normal"" men & women of the rebellion. Enjoy!"
"JasonT413","10","4","10","17 December 2016"," Hands Down, The best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back
","What can I say?... AMAZING. THE (in capital and neon letters) Star Wars film that upholds that standard of greatness that is associated with the original trilogy, mind you, I Liked the prequels, but yes, they were CGI overload, which frankly did not help their cause but they DID create a rich mythology from which sprang the Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels series and continues on to this day. It was fantastic to see the characters of Bail Organa and Mon Mothma return as played by the same actors whom played them in Lucas' prequel Trilogy. Another wow factor goes to the uncanny portrayal of General Tarkin by Guy Martin. Many high points here and I won't get into anymore. If you are a Star Wars fan, this will restore your faith in the series. The Force Awakens was good, this is GREAT. The perfect lead-in to Star Wars Episode Four."
"mrsmiley-03590","7","4","10","17 December 2016"," An improvement after Episode VII, but not without a cost
","I went to the theaters with a skeptical thoughts because I certainly didn't like Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I almost hated it, but not because of production values (in that aspect, it's well done), instead I think it had too similar plot structure as Episode IV, too much nostalgic pandering, old characters we know looking tired and depressed, poor world building and there were too many idiotic moments that took me out of the movie. Also, Rey. I hate overpowered characters and she was most likely given that because otherwise, it would have been offensive and sexist. But anyway, as a movie, Episode VII was for me 6/10, but my enjoyment level were more like 4/10. With this in my mind, I guess I'm not a Star Wars fan and I'm not going to be one of many people who praise the way Disney goes with our favorite franchise. Apologies, if my review is messy. I'm a really messy person, you see.<br/><br/>This is a first (official live-action) spin-off Star Wars movie we have and next one is coming at 2018 if I'm correct (after Episode VIII in 2017). Yearly Star Wars. It's really sad for me, because it seems that Disney does it just because of the money and the people who just take it without any questions. But is the movie good? The answer is; yes, but it's not as ""good"" as some people will say. For me, it's better than The Force Awakens for different reasons. I'll do my best to not spoil the movie and tell what is good and what isn't. I prefer not to into the route some people go as to just say ""My review: It's good. Go watch and see it."" I don't consider those as reviews.<br/><br/>I'll start with the positives:<br/><br/>Scenery, backgrounds and set designs are all well done. Sure there are some moments where you can tell what is CGI and what isn't, but overall, there isn't really anything wrong in it. If there something Gareth Edwards does right, it's the huge backgrounds and action. Shots look great and it's easy to see whats going on, not to mention the fact, everything looks big (for example: AT-AT's). This movie is going to be compared to Godzilla, which is directed by the same guy. It's a good thing and most likely it's going to be a trademark of Gareth Edwards directing. I really like the fact that all references and other nostalgic elements are kept subtle. They are not thrown at the audiences and are just a part of the movie. They clearly took a lesson from The Force Awakens. I liked some characters in Rogue One. The imperial Robot was good. The pacing is OK for the most part. I knew what was going on at least at the final moments. This is however the problem with the first act. The feeling of Star Wars was there compared to previous entry. Stormtroopers have their old voices and behavior. The set designs also have a part with this. Action was pretty standard but at the final 3rd, it got really good So...the final 3rd is the best part due to many things happening, keeping me interested. I guess you can figure it out yourself, what's going to happen, if you have watched any movie ever.<br/><br/>There are other things that kept me interested in this movie, but It's hard to mention other things because being precise is important for me and I don't like to spoil too much. There was certainly some scenes that I even loved, but I think you'll understand why. This review is mean't to be read by an average person who wants to find out if the movie is good or not with reasons. (I mean, without shouting that movie is garbage or that it's the best Star Wars movie)<br/><br/>Now, here my negatives. Rogue One was at some points boring. There wasn't much happening despite having a chance to develop the characters. While acting wasn't bad really, but they didn't have that much emotions to make them believable. It wasn't the only problem. The characters didn't have much screen time and they are not likely to be recognized for their personality. They were lackluster. Now that I think about, the writing was not that great. Some things were explained pretty well and can be considered well explanations for the Episode IV. They were contradictions though, which were annoying. While CGI was good, there are a few scenes where it was too obvious and distracting. While Vader is not the main point, I think there should've been more scenes with him, since he's one of the best movie villains and all scenes where he appeared, were amazing. There are too much planets with scenes that are only like two minutes long. What was the point of crediting them anyway? It's not suppose to be a standard Hollywood movie. IT'S STAR WARS!!! There were a few distracting moments and even some weirdness. You are going to hate the sentences when it comes to The Force. At the end, there were some ""forced"" scenes too. Contradicting as I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>But really at the end of the day, the movie is good and I consider it a part of the Star Wars saga, unlike The Force Awakens. I might write a review for that movie later when I'm not lazy. I walked out of the theater satisfied and happy. Not sure if my thoughts are the same when I watch it again from Blu-Ray, but who knows. I recommend Rogue One to anyone who likes Star Wars movies, games and books or any other form of entertainment. Most people love this movie and I understand why, but please....you should accept that not everyone has a same opinion as you have. <br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>The future looks better with this one"
"riordantheking","6","4","10","16 December 2016"," Good Star Wars prequels DO exist!
","Well, that was a neat surprise. I went in expecting maybe some nice action, some great special effects and perhaps one or two good actors. What I got blew me away. I'm not a fan of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and this movie blows all three of them out of the water.<br/><br/>Firstly, this movie looks fantastic. The cinematography showcased is beyond great looking. Rich colours, great backgrounds, just wonderful. The sense of scale in the movie is really great too. When Chirrut and Baze are being chased by an AT-AT, you feel the size, and the danger the characters are going through. The story is really good. The makers got the backstory of A New Hope, and went more in depth to create a story that is at the same time funny and deep. I hear a lot of people saying that the characters weren't explored in depth enough, and didn't get enough backstory. I vehemently disagree. In Pulp Fiction, did we know the backstories of Jules and Vincent? No, and we didn't have to. The dialogue and acting showcased makes us root for the characters just fine. The same is present here. All six of the main cast are very likable and interesting, and I appreciated that each of them were killed off. Some of the deaths had me nearly tearing up, though others, like the death of Bodhi Rook, kind of came out of nowhere and had no fanfare. The CGI recreation of characters Tarkin and Leia were unexpected, and I think looked pretty good. I could still tell that they weren't real, but they looked very good nonetheless. I also liked the cameos from classic OT characters. Some were expected, like Vader and Mon Mothma, but others were very pleasant surprises, like C-3PO and R2-D2, and Dr Evazon and Ponda Baba.<br/><br/>There are a few things wrong with this film, but they are very minimal. The scene at the end of Vader cutting down rebels felt like a bit too much. Vader certainly didn't have that ferocity in the OT. The start of the film felt choppy, with scenes cutting away to other scenes very fast. The musical score was good, but it didn't hold my interest and ends up being the least of all the Star Wars soundtracks. But really, that's it for negatives.<br/><br/>I hope the rest of the films to come in the future are of this quality, because if they are, we could all be in for a real treat."
"ilcool90","10","4","10","16 December 2016"," George Lucas directed this movie ( there is no other explanation )
","After the total train wreck of Harry Potter - Star wars cross over that was Episode 7 this was the star wars movie that put the smile back on my face. <br/><br/>The only explanation I have is that George Lucas has locked up Gareth Edwards in a closet, gathered several actors from Episode 3 ( Senator Bail Organa ) and 4 ( Grand Moff Tarkin ) and directed this. <br/><br/>This movie is such a great mix between Episode 3 and 4 ( both directed by Lucas ). A note to the prequel trilogy haters who didn't liked the detailed political talk, well it's back in this movie and that makes it even more good, because it actually explains all the stuff that is happening. <br/><br/>Ship and location designs are again all Lucas and look a lot like in the prequel trilogy. Unpolished and raw like Tatooine and polished like Coruscant great mix. <br/><br/>Also this movie really shows why there is a rebellion against the Empire. The repression of the Empire is shown in all it's anti-glory. Seeing Darth Vader again is such a great experience. The most memorable characters of the movie is in my opinion is Chirrut Îmwe and the very sarcastic android voiced by Alan Tudyk <br/><br/>Can't wait for this movie to be released on Blu-ray because watching this and immediately afterwards Episode 4 will be quite the experience and I will just pretend episode 7 never happened."
"Solnichka","10","4","10","16 December 2016"," Best SW film since Empire and maybe the best one ever?
","Just stunning how good this film was, making Episode VII look like the lame film it was. Why? Two specific things: 1) Character development; and 2) Original narrative. The handful of main characters are very engaging, and the audience CARES about them, much more so than the cardboard cutouts from Episode VII. The narrative, while everyone knows the end game (for the most part), is lively and active, with no pacing problems whatsoever. It's not bogged down by bad dialogue from bad characters (Shut up, Finn! Go away, Poe!); instead, the unique characters and action sequences are refreshing, without any snark or condescending nods to the audience. The film pays its respects to the original trilogy, for sure, and the surprising CGI character presence of an old favorite was just awesome (no, not Darth Vader!). Overall, this was the best Star Wars film since Episode V, and it actually might be a better film. As a standalone entry in the canon, it's different, and that's not a bad thing. A few edits left promising moments from the teaser trailers on the cutting room floor, unfortunately, but this film was just stunning overall -- can't wait to see it again!"

","Non spoiler Rogue One review: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Rogue One. It's simply amazing movie. Battle scenes are most amazing battle scenes in any STAR WARS movie, because you feel for characters and even for soldiers you don't even know. Characters are very unique and lovable, also, not every character is good or bad, characters have their flaws, and they are not perfect, and that's what it's so amazing about them. Last 10-15 minutes are my favorite minutes of STAR WARS movies, space battle is best space battle in any STAR WARS movie, and Vader is simply amazing. I couldn't even dream to see what he did in last 5 minutes, even he has only 5 minutes of screen time, You won't be disappointed by Vader. Score is not so great, and especially one character feels weird to look at (You will know why) but after all, after first viewing yesterday, For me it is better than The Force Awakens, because they gave us something new, and they are not afraid to risk, while TFA played on nostalgic a lot, even I liked it a lot. There are some cameos I loved, some Rebels vehicles and characters appear or they are at least mentioned, humor is great for the most part, and nothing felt forced. You can literally watch Rogue one, skip A new hope opening crawl, and watch A new hope, cause it ties perfectly together. I would give Rogue One 9/10. Going to watch it today and tomorrow again, so we shell see if I like it even more."
"ttobin-34654","3","5","14","29 July 2019"," Boring Cash Grab that lacks the soul of the franchise.
","I don't understand the positive reviews for this SW film? The characters, plot, dialogue, well, everything is slow, uninteresting, and dried out. The robot was the only character with any personality. I was happy to see these boring characters die off at the end. I've never fell asleep in a movie but I literally dozed off 20minutes into this expensive snooze fest. The fact that I think takes me off is that they shot it digitally (didn't use 35mm film) which breaks continuity AND they did not use an opening crawl. I don't care if this is a spin-off, it's Star Wars rules must be followed or it doesn't work. This film is a sacrelig to the franchise and has about as much soul as a piece of wet cardboard drying out in the sun. If you're a true fan of this series, stay away from this pile of junk that wants to cash in on fan boy service by being all serious and I guess ""adult.""

The visuals were spectacular. Giacchino's score was amazing and as close to Star Wars as you can get.

It's just a fun one-time watch, and something I don't think I will try to see again, or buy on bluray, despite owning the entire Star Wars franchise on it. It's fine. Just a little sideline story that should have come out much sooner for it to be relevant. If you like Star Wars, watch it. You won't regret it, but it's not quite as good as getting a full-on sequel."
"deetya","9","3","7","15 November 2017"," Epic movie.
","This is how a Star Wars film should be; an independent free-standing movie and not just a copy/ re shoot/ of older Star Wars movie(s). This movie is obviously a ""fan- service"" movie, but it is able to stand on its own enough to be a regular, non-Star Wars movie. <br/><br/>As war/ combat action-adventure movie, the pace is very quick, with nary a breath of respite in-between scene and location changes. Things happen so quickly it is easy to miss the details. For example, on Jedha, Cassian tells Jyn that his contact went missing. His contact isn't missing, Cassian kills him in a previous scene when escaping some Storm Troopers. <br/><br/>There are a few sour notes. The use of CGI for Tarkin and young Princess Leia, for example, is absurd and pretentious. Why? It would've been better if they had real life, flesh and blood actors portraying Tarkin and the Princess. Do the filmmakers think audiences are so stupid that they have to be spoon fed a character that looks exactly like Tarkin or Leia? Or did they do it just because they could? That's an Empire-type arrogance, right there. <br/><br/>Another sour note is Diego Luna's performance. He didn't quite gel to the character of a tough, vicious, hard-bitten, cynical, warrior. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a good first step in reviving the franchise. Instead of retreading the old Skywalker story, this movie begins to open up the Star Wars universe to a broader feature film world, not just comic books and novelizations"

","Just watched on blu-ray DVD and was very impressed (I didn't see it at the cinema). I liked the disparate group of characters so much that I almost felt as though I didn't need any glimpses of the original cast (CGI versions and robots).<br/><br/>Some of the 70's design sat a little uneasily in this 21st century effort - the plastic cubes representing rank for example and of course the computer graphics - although necessary -looked very old school - but were charming all the same.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were very well played out - and extremely violent - so this was not a kids film like the 1977 classic. If I have a small criticism of the war scenes I thought the editing was a bit perfunctory in some sections - it could have been more inventive along with the score. It was as though - this is what a Star wars battle should look like - so we'll edit it this way.<br/><br/>Overall though a very enjoyable - and dark - film. I would have liked to have seen more of this group in another adventure - but alas it cannot be."

"EatMyWords","4","3","7","24 January 2017"," Peter Cushing: Resurrection
","Expanding upon the opening crawl in George Lucas' ""Star Wars"", director Gareth Edwards and Disney opts for an overwritten plot verging on incoherence. A simple enough premise (Rebels winning their first battle against the empire and spies making off with plans of the Death Star) spread out over a big loaf of father-daughter drama, stepfather-daughter drama, defecting imperial pilots, off-shoot rebel factions, Imperial politics, remorseful intelligence officers, Darth Vader fan service and much more. One Murky establishing shot after the next, depressing planets and facilities one after another, Edwards struggles to find a momentum.<br/><br/>The cast is rather flat--demographics clearly the biggest concern here--Some talent slips through for sure, but their skills are mostly wasted, the characters a group of bland ciphers with hardly more than their look and weapon of choice to distinguish between them and lacking any chemistry or interesting dynamic. Ironically, the most ""human"" character in the film is a robot, a ""funny-droid-character"" that feels very out of place. It offers a big chunk of the humor (admittedly humor of low quality) and compared to its human comrades comes of as a living thing.<br/><br/>A positive about the film would be its aim to create an overarching theme of self-sacrifice. A neat idea if you ignore the complete lack of investment in the characters. It's interesting considering George Lucas' six films (nor ""The Force Awakens"") struck me as having a straightforward, unifying theme for each picture, but felt more sprawling with its widespread allegories and homages. Perhaps a byproduct of this being a standalone affair while the others all part of trilogies?<br/><br/>Proclaimed as a ""war-film"" and lauded for being different to earlier entries in the series, the film nonetheless soaks in fan service, winks and callbacks which compounds on the tone. What at times feels like the lighthearted space adventures we've seen before, sometimes feel like a darker and more somber story about ""good people"" committing atrocities during time of war and oppression. Among other things, there's a blind, stick-wielding force user with a sidekick gunslinger, completely out of place in a supposedly ""gritty war-film"". Stuff like this reeks of studio control and careful reverse-engineering for the sake of accommodating the crowds.<br/><br/>Edwards' action on the ground is what you might expect considering the war-film-tag: A pseudo-documentary style approach using lots of hand held camera work that computes with the supposed gritty tone (it feels like you're really there on the ground with these people!). What doesn't compute is the continuation of the terribly inefficient troops in the Empires' employ. The ability to eventually hit something is there, but considering the amount of shots missed and all the Storm Troopers mowed down it feels like a contradiction. In space things are naturally more fun and light (if only because its really hard to feel that something is ""gritty"" when dealing with laser-shooting space ships) yet lacks tension and a great score by John Williams (Michael Giacchino's score in contrast feels incredibly bland and derivative).<br/><br/>So despite its pretensions to being fresh and different I think it's easy to spot how limited the film is in that regard. True, we don't have a John Williams' score anymore, just someone else trying to make something similar to what he did, an opening crawl isn't needed anymore because we're making movies from previous crawls and CGI-Tarkin has now replaced Governor Tarkin.<br/><br/>----Dull characters, convoluted plot and shaky tone mixed with lots of explosions and nostalgia----"

","Like most on opening weekend, I went into ""Rogue One"" fairly blind. It was known that the story took place in between Episodes III and IV, but the characters were all unknown. As such, there was a lot that I was unsure of. How would this fit into the chronology? Would it be a completely standalone film, with no connection to the other movies at all? That was pretty much how the previews made it out to be. <br/><br/>That being said, as it turns out, ""Rogue One"" is the immediate prequel to Episode IV, the original Star Wars movie, ""A New Hope"". It absolutely is directly connected to that film, but tells its tale through a cast of characters that are mostly new (Vader and one imperial commander and a couple of reprisals of rebel leaders being the exceptions). And, the story and film are exceptional on the whole. The style is a bit more serious and gritty than the other episodes, and the first half of the film goes by a bit slow at times--but by end it gets very good!<br/><br/>About the only drawback to this movie is its use of what I like to call the ""Bourne"" camera-work. At points the camera wobbles incessantly as figures are in battle. That was annoying, but not so much that it completely took away from the movie. And so, all things said, I have to give ""Rogue One"" 9/10 stars. It's fantastic, and falls just short of being a perfect ten. You definitely should see it!"

","star wars has war in its title, but the films really deal more in faith. I am not saying this is bad, because there really are not a lot of mainstream films dealing with faith in the way star wars is. However, a franchise with the title star wars should include stars and be about war. Although stars are included, no movie has really talked about war. Now, with the Star Wars Anthology series existing, we can expect films with different style than the main episodes. While Han Solo film is supposed to be an action- adventure film with a western feel, then Rogue One is a film about war and its price. Not only is this film gritty, dark and includes colorless visuals, it also deals with the fact that in war, even the good guys have to do bad things, like be assassins and spies, which is not as honorable as being Han Solo or Luke Skywalker. But without this there would not be victory. In fact, one of the good guys gets killed by the rebels as a mistake. Also, all of the films main characters die. But they gave the Death Star plans to the rebels and so, victory comes. In fact, if they would have failed, Luke Skywalker would not be a legend after all. Also, I like how the film acknowledges that Darth Vader is a broken soul and does not shy away from using material from the prequels( they are part of the canon) and uses both Coruscant and Mustafar. But at its heart, it is a gritty war film bout war and its price."

"fredschaefer-406-623204","9","3","7","1 January 2017"," A solid piece of entertainment.
","ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY clearly did not set out to be the greatest STAR WARS movie and by lowering its sights, succeeds wonderfully as a solid piece of entertainment. There were stories that Disney had not been happy with the finished product and had stepped to make post production changes, if so, then the tampering is not evident in that the movie tells its story pretty seamlessly, with a fast paced narrative that dispenses with a lot of the exposition, while introducing and defining the characters well. I know many STAR WARS fans will come to this movie with very high and differing expectations, but I think most of them, will be pleased.<br/><br/>The plot of ROGUE ONE answers one of the great plot holes of the original trilogy, why was the Death Star built with such a glaring defect that it could be so easily destroyed at the end of A NEW HOPE? It turns out that the head scientist, Galen Erso, had been forced to work on the Death Star project against his will and had deliberately built in a weakness that could be exploited by the Rebellion if only they could get their hands on copy of the design plans, which of course are stored in a heavily guarded fortress. It will take the efforts of a rag tag group of Rebellion fighters, led by Erso's daughter, Jyn, to steal the plans if they are to have any chance of bringing down the Empire's ultimate weapon. <br/><br/>In essence, ROGUE ONE is a classic impossible mission movie, a 21st Century GUNS OF NAVARONE. And it does a good job of laying out the story in a three act arc, where in the characters come together in the first act, define and take on the mission against impossible odds in the second, execute their plan and meet their fates in the third. It's a great formula, and when done right, never fails to deliver. The movie gets off to brisk start, especially in the execution of Jyn Erso's story, which also introduces Orson Krennic, the villain of the piece. The second act may drag a bit at times, but for the most part, ROGUE ONE dispenses with the boring council meetings that in the past have served as a way to dump a lot of explanation and back story on us. And I will give director Gareth Edwards and the screen writers credit for not pulling their punches at the finale, and giving us an ending for our heroes that makes sense in the reality of their world. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones as Jyn, and Diego Luna, as rebel fighter Cassian Andor, make us believe that their characters have lived in a world at war for many years, and that they have seen and done some less than admirable things in the past. My favorites among the crew were Donnie Yen and Wen Jaing, as blind would be Jedi and his dubious sidekick. They play a couple of great bad asses who are quite funny and moving at the same time. Ben Mendolshon makes for a great villain in Krennic, another one of the Empire's endless Nazis. Alan Tudyk is the voice of K-2SO, one of the Empire's droids who has been reprogrammed without a filter; his lines are the funniest in the movie. Forest Whitaker gives another one of his patented swing for bleachers performances as a rebel outlaw, and Mads Mikkelsen plays a good guy for once, as Galen Erso. It's a diverse cast, but we never consider it diversity for diversity's sake like some other productions.<br/><br/>The most emotional parts of the film for anybody comes when ROGUE ONE ties itself to the larger STAR WARS universe, especially in the appearances of some familiar faces. If it's the Death Star, then Grand Moff Tarkin has to be three and so does Peter Cushing by way of some very well done CGI. Cushing actually interacts with the contemporary actors and fully convinces us that he will soon be ordering the destruction of Alderaan. Best of all, Darth Vader shows up and gives us a scene that might become my favorite from any STAR WARS movie, where he breaks bad on some rebels who have gotten their hands on the Death Star plans and reminds us just why he is maybe the greatest villain in the history of movies. A certain pair of droids turns up as well, along with more than a few pertinent cameos from the first trilogy; there are also plenty of references to the many STAR WARS books published over the years that added to the saga. It's a feast for the true fan.<br/><br/>Is ROGUE ONE better than THE FORCE AWAKENS? That is a tough call since the former is only meant to be a side story to the real saga that the main movies tell. It's a self contained tale set in the STAR WARS universe and not an epic chapter with beloved characters we all well know. But I think for many, it will be the most satisfying STAR WARS film since EMPIRE, one that brings us full circle back to where we first stepped into this marvelous world. And due to recent events, the finale is sure to be a heart breaker."
"ssnape3","8","3","7","28 December 2016"," For Carrie Fisher
","I watched Rogue One today, the day after Carrie Fisher died, so of course my thoughts were of her as I watched it and I hoped she'd be included in the film in some way - suffice to say the final scene and the word 'Hope' made the movie for me and will forever cement Rogue One in Star Wars lore.<br/><br/>The film itself is a prequel of sorts to the Original Star Wars Film - A New Hope - I thought the film stumbled at the start with an unfocused story and unfamiliar characters, but as the story continued the film gains its footing as a small band of rebels goes in search of the blue prints of the dreaded Death Star - the best part being it finally puts to rest the reason the Death Star had a rather large design flaw - the film has a darker, grittier look than the other Star Wars films and the battles have the look of a WWII movie, especially with the colorful band of characters in the rebel band.<br/><br/>One of the problems I had with the film was that the lead character, Jyn, was to much like a pale imitation of Rey in The Force Awakens, but as with the movie as a whole she grew on me as it went along until I was really rooting for her by the end - but while Rogue One held up well as its own movie, my favorite parts of it were the call backs to previous Star Wars films - from Darth Vader (Thank the maker that James Earl Jones is still with us) to Death Star Commander Tarkin (his digital recreation was impressive, but must be a little disconcerting to working actors) to Jimmy Smits return as Organa and of course a brief cameo by R2D2 and C3PO - the only characters to be in every Star Wars film.<br/><br/>Even with a darker grittier look, the climatic battle was pure Star Wars with battles on multiple fronts and was thrilling to watch - and the way everything tied together in the end to the beginning of A New Hope was brilliantly done - so while not perfect and a notch below The Force Awakens - Rogue One is must viewing for any Star Wars fan and is a worthy addition to the franchise - also I can't say how much fun it is that after starting to believe Star Wars would be just a wonderful but distant memory - we now can look forward to a new Star Wars movie as a glorious yearly event."

","Ever wondered exactly how the Death Star plans were stolen? Well, look no further than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story About Dead People.<br/><br/>Rogue One starts off a little dull. We're introduced to Jyn Erso and her family, and they're boring. Then we are introduced to Prince Caspian, and he's a boring protagonist that kills people. We also get to meet some other human characters that don't matter: Forest Whitaker on stilts, kung-fu man, kung-fu man with a gun, Hitler with a white shirt and a cape etc. Truthfully, the only character in Rogue One that is actually interesting is not a personand that's K-2S0, a sassy Imperial droid that says whatever's in his circuits. He's genuinely entertaining.<br/><br/>There is another ""not a person"" character in this movie that's entertaining too, but for the wrong reasonsand that's General Moff Tarkin. You're not reading that wrong, by the way. Moff Tarkin is not a person in Rogue One. He's a Tupac Hologram, Young Jeff Bridges from Tron: Legacy, computer-generated piece of garbage. Who in their right mind gave the go ahead to include a phony Peter Cushing so much in this movie? I get that he has long since passed away, but why did he need to be turned into a cartoon for this film? It would've been much more respectful to just hire an actor that looks close, or just not include Tarkin in the film at all.<br/><br/>Luckily, Rogue One meanders to a decent final act. It turns into Saving Private Ryan, but set in space and with AT-ATs. Now, I can't imagine how Disney approved that, but they did and it worked. Plus, we get to see Darth Vader do some bad stuff. Yay, Rogue One for seemingly ending on a good note until *SPOILERS* Right before the credits roll we get to see Princess Leia and SHE'S A ****ING CARTOON! I literally laughed out loud in the movie theatre when she reared her jarring, computerized face. Upon reflection, that might have been perceived as poor taste because Carrie Fisher had literally just passed away that morning. For shame.<br/><br/>To be fair, Rogue One is an okay prequel. It is definitely not the best Star Wars; it's not even close to being as good as IV, V and VI in terms of storytelling, characters and tone. It loses points for just way too many unnecessary fan-services, and only just passes for containing a thrilling final-battle. I would have gladly accepted a cameo from an Ewok in a cage over the walking horror shows of Tarkin and Leia, which as you can hopefully tell by now, largely ruined my enjoyment of an already shaky film.<br/><br/>6/10, baby."
"sosmetallin","8","3","7","28 December 2016"," An important movie for the franchise
","SPOILER-FREE review: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (or Star Wars: Rogue One or Star Wars: Episode 3.9 as some people on the Internet want to call it ) is the 8th installment in our favorite sci-fi franchise and tells the story of how the Death Star plans end up on princess Leia's hands. It is directed by Gareth Edwards and I am happy to tell you that he knows well how to direct action and drama and this film has a lot of these elements, all well-made(almost). If you haven't watched the movie yet then let me confirm that Rogue One is as good as everybody says. If you are a sci-fi/action fan, it is totally worth your time even if you have never watched a Star Wars movie before (wow, where have you been all this time?); the movie explains everything you need to know. Also, I am really sorry, but this will be a spoiler-filled review, because there are so many things I feel the need to discuss.<br/><br/>SPOILER review: As you read above I consider it an important movie for the franchise. That's due to all those things that Rogue One, in my opinion, adds to the Star Wars mythos. First and foremost is the correction of the ""A New Hope"" plot hole: why cinema's most memorable weapon of mass destruction has such a serious weakness? Episode 3.9 answers that it was a conspiracy! And we couldn't be more thankful. I mean, A New Hope is even better now because of another film. Apart from this, there is something that I really appreciate about Gareth Edwards' direction and unfortunately not enough people point it out. After so many years of discussion about Star Wars and after so many times we have watched each episode (and we'll keep re-watching), we've forgot the awe Darth Vader and the Empire inspired back then. Now, after all these years I feel again intimidated. And how does he manage this? It's all about some details in the cinematography and the plot that emphasize on how the whole rebel army views the battle and not only our protagonist. I am talking about moments like: an impressing shot of Death Star in space showing us its size, Death Star hides the sun before it destroys Jeda, AT-AT walkers appear from inside the fog and everyone runs for his life, while they are shown from the rebel's point of view for us to comprehend their size compared to humans, Darth Vader force-chokes another person (Krennic). And of course, the most intimidating, violent, intense scene of Darth Vader we've ever had, a scene that comes out of nowhere, because you think he is going to find Leia's ship, but suddenly you hear him breathing in the dark hall...then his light-saber shines red and an epic massacre follows(I didn't say the best scene, I said the most intense). It is directed just perfectly. It doesn't get better than this or at least much better. However, it is not only the Empire we get to know better. We also see a different side of the rebellion. A side, where possible enemies are tortured to prove their innocence and its members argue with each other and the best decision is not immediately taken. Some other smaller additions/changes are the fact that the name of the planet our heroes are approaching is shown on screen to remind us that this is a large world and the fact that the movie doesn't begin with the classic exposition text (which I think respects the original trilogy, the prequels and the sequels by saying ""this is not exactly a Star Wars Episode""). Of course, this is not a perfect movie and the main complaint is about the characters. By the way, I have no complaints about Darth Vader's limited screen time, because I expected that (Edwards did it with Godzilla as well) and this was not really a movie about him. While all characters are likable, badass and with a good sense of humor, we still don't really understand or feel their motives; we hardly get to know some of them, actually. Because of this, we can't get 100% invested in the action scenes. Jyn is the only one we really get to know, but her relationship with Cassian isn't explored enough. That's why their death brought no tears in my eyes. Another weakness is surprisingly the music score (Later, I learned Michael Giacchino was given only a month to compose, so I respect his attempt); Furthermore, one could say the first act is kind of slow-paced, but it doesn't really bother me. I think it is needed to set up the story. I almost forgot to talk about the CGI: perfect, beautiful, well- combined with practical effects. My only complaint is about Leia's CGI face (not too bad-It was just the most obvious CGI element among perfect CGI elements). Tarkin's was OK I think. All space scenes are incredible, including the space battle-one of the best we've ever seen. <br/><br/>All in all, I really liked Rogue One. Its existence is a blessing for Lucas' universe and I am looking forward to the next ""not official"" Star Wars episode. 8/10 (almost 9/10)"
"vl-13630","7","3","7","25 December 2016"," Good effort, but missed opportunity
","I'm a huge Star Wars fan having seen all films in the theater and was involved in the 501st Legion for a while. So it's a good time to be alive right now when it comes to the steady stream of Star Wars films. I generally did like this film's visuals and direction. The set design right out of the mid 70's still work all these years later and there's a sense of reverence to making sure this was done right. Spoilers- The film worked well enough, but they didn't get much mileage of the death of the mother for dramatic effect in the first scene or establish any relationship with Jyn and her father before then. So if comparing female leads to EP VII, Rey comes of as a much more interesting and endearing character. Forrest Whitaker's character added confusion to the story and should have been written out entirely or re-written to join the group. His death served no purpose and Jyn's relationship with him was surprisingly cold considering he's her adopted father. The male lead character, Cassian Andor doesn't seem to be too memorable and his look merges with the other bearded dark completion of the Imperial pilot. The Droid and Asian cohorts seem to bring all of the life into the cast. The blind guy's final scene would have been more dramatic if he started to get shot half way to the swicth and used the force to absorb the blaster bolts. Then in a dramatic end, he could have summoned the force to move the switch and then died in a dramatic ending like Elias in Platoon. So a good backstory, with bland acting and not as much fun as it could have been. Probably given the tone of the film they made a decision to not allow us to get too attached to these characters. I could go on re-writing and editing this all day, but the fact remains we're left with a pretty good effort. I'm glad the made this film and much prefer the grit of it over the childish cartoonish tone of EPI"
"iYases","6","3","7","23 December 2016"," Rogue Below Zero
","By December 22nd I have watched Rogue One twice, and I can't understand how can a movie be so boring and exciting at the same time. Rogue One is a 2h 13min, where 1 hour of nothing and the other hour with almost everything except for Yoda & Jedie, lightsabers (beside Vader's lightsaber), R2D2 & C3PO (not just a 3 seconds), Millennium Falcon, and John Williams music.<br/><br/>Do you guys have to replace such an iconic music with some kind of get-over-it soundtracks. And what happened to the Opening Crawl? we are talking about basic stuff here, SERIOUSLY.<br/><br/>I mean what kind of a Star Wars movie has the epic 'War' but not so much 'Stars'<br/><br/>I think 'Stranger Things' referenced Star Wars more than Rogue One. It really saddens me to give a Star Wars movie a 6/10."
"shearerk-78921","10","3","7","22 December 2016"," Great movie
","It fills the gap between third and fourth episodes and it totally worth watching. The story line was a epic because of the camera angles and the way the camera focused on the action that they wanted you to see. The story still had some stuff mbolism to the Cold War such as the imperial and rebel forces, which represents USSR and US, but the movies were created in the 1970's. Otherwise, it is action packed and follows the content of all other Star Wars movies. One thing, I wish we saw more of was Princess Leila but that's okay because they was like a love story of the two protagonists, so that compensated for the lack of the main characters of the original Star War movies."
"ThatAnimeSnob","8","3","7","19 December 2016"," The darker, more realistic version of A New Hope
","So, I watched Rogue One, and it was a rehash for A New Hope again! Isn't it ironic how Disney threw to the bin whatever ideas George Lukas had for the new trilogy, only to reuse the old ideas again and again? The Force Awakens was more of a remake that a sequel, and the same applies for Rogue One as a prequel. Only difference, it's bloody amazing.<br/><br/>For me, the worst thing in the Star Wars universe was always the plot convenience of the force. It doesn't play a role in this movie. They talk about it, Darth Vader uses it a few times but it otherwise doesn't conveniently control the plot in any way the author likes. Major positive.<br/><br/>A silly thing about the classic Star Wars movies is how black and white they were presenting the characters. In this movie there are imperial agents who don't act like 1 dimensional villains and help out the rebellion, as there are rebels who are doing some really nasty things for the sake of defeating the empire. Without the mystical bull of the force separating everything into good or bad, the characters are acting more realistically by default. And I love it.<br/><br/>Another positive is the risk/reward ratio. The reason many consider The Empire Strikes Back to be the best of the old trilogy is because the good guys suffer great loses without scoring a big victory at the end. I personally don't like as much because it was riddled with force nonsense, which is absent in this movie, yet still feels like it's the same situation of great losses / small victories that helps the tragedy of war to feel far more significant than it ever was before.<br/><br/>They even made the destruction caused by the Death Star to feel more impactful despite causing a fraction of the damage it does in A New Hope. It doesn't just fire a laser at something, makes it blow up, and that's it. It causes such a shock wave that is forcing the character to run away from it before it envelops them. And you even see the cloud of debris it causes for an extended period of time, which was brilliant.<br/><br/>They even fix one of the nonsense of old movies. Remember how silly it felt for Death Star to have a little hole as its weak spot? This movie explains it as a booby trapped position that the creator of the whole contraption placed there which then recorded it in the specific schematics the rebels are supposed to use. A very positive retcon.<br/><br/>There are also a ton of references, cameos, and Easter eggs from the old trilogy, which in this case they are not that much fan service, as they are foreshadowing things to come. It's not like they were out of context, the events in the time line are taking place a few months before A New Hope, so every familiar face and catchphrase was supposed to be there.<br/><br/>In the negatives of the film, I would say the characters were very forgettable, which is to be expected since they are all essentially small fry members of both factions. The second a cameo appears, they are instantly overshadowed. It also has to do with the fact that none of them survives in the end so we can see them for 2 more movies and get to like them more.<br/><br/>Another negative is the slow having a mostly empty first half. The buildup is not engaging but when the climax arrives, it is totally worth it. In the long run, it's even a positive, since it keeps your expectation low, only to surprise you with how much more entertaining and tragic it becomes later on.<br/><br/>By the way, I kept hearing complains about some characters being CGI instead of using look-alikes. I didn't have an issue with that, they looked OK, mouth motions were meh but whatever.<br/><br/>So as a whole, The Force Awakens is the boring kid friendly version of A New Hope, whereas Rogue One is the darker more realistic version, and I loved it."

There were gritty scenes that made this feel different than the other movies in the series.<br/><br/>The beginning was slow. These were all basically new characters that needed to be developed. The ending could be an issue for younger audiences due to massive death of said main characters. <br/><br/>The movie ends with an optimistic line that ties it to the fourth movie ""A New Hope."" Seeing it on a big screen is a definite plus. I would see it once, but not purchase it for my collection."

","Lets start off with what is good. Special affects for anything not a person. Attention to detail from the original Star Wars film which I saw 12 times in the theater as a child. So there were some nice moments of nostalgia. And Alan Tudyk as K-2SO.. By far the best character, with some solid character development arc for a supporting droid. Loved him!!<br/><br/>What was bad: That it appears they never wrote of cut some key character development to keep this a 2 hour movie so they could turn more theater seats and make more money faster. At times especially with the fast cuts and planet / city names it felt more like <br/><br/>""Rogue One"" A History Channel Dramatization of the Death Star Incident"" <br/><br/>There were some characters I wanted to understand that were just used as supporting roles and tossed away. Chirrut Îmwe and Saw Gerrera both just begged for more development and more back story vs being lazy plot devices.<br/><br/>And there was a poor job of understanding the character arc of Jyn Erso<br/><br/>But in the end it feels like there was a pact made with those who now own the main Star Wars saga story line. ""Don't create anything in this movie we have to deal with later, got it!""<br/><br/>Like the odd numbered Star Trek films this one stinks of studio strategy vs a passion for story telling. It had a lot to do in 2 hours and no more.<br/><br/>* Launch the idea of ""Star Wars Story"" movies - Check maybe? * Shows us lots of things that feel like the original Star Wars - Check * Plug an attractive actress into a formula tragic story. - Check * Show off how we resurrect some key characters from the original film - Check * Make the original Star Wars universe more diverse - Check * What ever you do, don't create any real ties to the main story line for any of these one-off characters - Check * Make us money in-between ""real"" Star Wars movie - CHECK is in the mail.<br/><br/>It was not worth the $15-$20 a person or more one spends to see a movie. I wish I would have waited for video. It is the first Star Wars movies I feel that way about. It was better than the ""Star Wars: Holiday Special."" But it felt like it was born of the same crass greed that misses why we love Star Wars.. because we love the characters.. and when they are designed to be disposable.. well one might feel cheated at the end.<br/><br/>I think one change at the ending would have made this movie feel like we got a buried treasure rather than a lump of burned out crystal.<br/><br/>Scene ""Rebel Base just before attack run on the Death Star""<br/><br/>Setting: It is controlled chaos as every one of the remaining fighters is readied after so many have been lost recently.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso: My father died to give us this chance. You have to hit that port.<br/><br/>Mon Mothma: Many died to give us this chance. These are our best and bravest.<br/><br/>Camera Pull back: Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are seen from the back, but where know them and their voices.<br/><br/>Luke: Who is she?<br/><br/>Han: Forget it kid. She is out of your league?<br/><br/>Luke: Maybe, maybe not<br/><br/>Close Up: Jyn Erso she looks Luke's Way and smiles.<br/><br/>Fade to black... <br/><br/>Now we have a possible hint about Rey's parents that we can debate for a year... vs well...The Red Shirt Fire Storm.."
"TheDevilsNotetaker","6","3","7","19 December 2016"," This is getting out of hand!
","First things first- this is far better than the sewer water that was The Farce Awakens. Far better.<br/><br/>But still the lack of a true visionary in the vein of Lucas is evident in almost every single frame. Making up for this by grabbing everything from the original trilogy- mostly Return of the Jedi this time. And banking on nostalgia by doing cameos of previous characters and situations.<br/><br/>And coconut trees on an alien planet? Seriously??? And where the hell was the Star Wars logo and theme at the beginning??? That put me right off straight from the start.<br/><br/>The acting and characters have about as much depth as tissue paper. And the dialogue is totally stupid, retarded, and yawn inducing, like it was written by a bunch of adolescents. Add to that some cringe-worthy situations and reactions by the totally miscast actors and you get ZERO emotional impact once they all start dying (to my relief). Annoying would be the best term to describe the characters. Plain effing annoying.<br/><br/>Another problem with Rogue one is a lack of strong lead actor or two to anchor the film. The Prequels had Liam Neesen and Ewan McGregor and and Ian McDiarmid, Original Trilogy had Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. This has none. The lead character Jyn is utterly forgettable and her horrible dialogue does not help. Her budding romance with the castrated-Han Solo-rip-off-dude is ( I cannot even remember- I was wishing I was somewhere else other than in that darkened theater). As stated before the characters are just annoying and Donnie Yens character is the most annoying of the lot. And you actually feel relieved when they die off. Its that bad.<br/><br/>Lack of a proper bad guy does not help either- Vader comes through in the end but somehow feels like its not enough- like he belongs in another movie and has been lent into this to make it feel better.<br/><br/>However the space battles are far superior to anything in The Farce Awakens and even though a total rip-off of Return of the Jedi are a welcome respite to the boredom before it. At least they are coherent and easier to follow than the stupidity of the Farce Awakens; however they pale in comparison to any of the Lucas directed space battles. They keep the same look and design of the original ships and combat displays and call signs, even taking footage from the original movies for the Red Squadron members. However its just too little too late.<br/><br/>Saving graces are the deaths of the two leads in an embrace in the pillars of the Death Star destruction wave having managed to beam out the battle station's plans back to the rebel fleet at the last moment- which I did not expect and which lent a small emotional crescendo to an otherwise dead movie.<br/><br/>As I had already feared without Lucas Star Wars is truly truly dead. Disney will never be able to do anything totally new without the God-like imaginings of George. This is getting out of hand. Instead of making crap Star Wars movies after another maybe Disney should (as another Disney princess sang) just let it go."

","ROGUE ONE : A STAR WARS STORY - Review<br/><br/>I was not so keen on this installment of the Star Wars franchise as from the trailer, it seemed an off-shoot story to me. But, man am I glad I booked its tickets on a whim on a late Friday. <br/><br/>The movie delivers on every aspect congruent to its trailer. It exhibited the same war tactics and scenario as portrayed in the trailer. It has its great funny bits coming from the new robot K2 which exhibited some uncannily human characteristics. And it had great characters without any unnecessary baggage bogging down the plot. Everything in this movie is clean-cut and presentable - there is no ounce of unnecessary ornamentation and the length of the movie is just perfect.<br/><br/>Every character had an explainable plot, and the actors did a great job playing them. Felicity Jones is surely a great find for Hollywood as she delivers so subtly but effectively - one consciously feels for her character. It is a bit reminiscent of the character Rey from the Star Wars- The Force Awakens movie. <br/><br/>So it all comes down to the plot. The story is set just before/during the incidents of the Star Wars - A New Hope movie. The Rebellion acquired the knowledge and the plans of the Death Star weapon being developed by the Empire, and this movie focuses on how the Rebellion got the information regarding such weapon. It beautifully connects the dots and the plot to the incidents of 'A New Hope' - so much that you are in for a nice surprise in the end when the information is finally transferred! <br/><br/>And yes, you see a lot more of Darth Vader in this movie than what you saw in the trailer - and it was awesome! All in all - a fine plot, great special effects and CGI, very endearing characters and an awesome climax and ending! The only negative aspect of the movie could be that it is a bit clichéd and formula driven.<br/><br/>Rating : 4/5<br/><br/>Verdict : Entertaining, hilarious, realistic and a great connecting link to the whole saga. Loved it."

The heroes don't just come out ahead, like Rey suddenly beating Kylo Ren after he had been kicking butt. <br/><br/>What was that? Did that remind anyone else of Darth Maul's stupid death?<br/><br/>Rogue One reminds me of Empire Strikes Back, the best of the original trilogy.

You know how the movie ends but getting to that point will blow your mind with some of the best effects, scenery and action that have yet to come out of a SW movie. Keep an eye out for quick cameos, they are all over during the movie as well. This movie is far superior to ""The Force Awakens"" which was minimally decent at the most.

","An unlikely group of freedom fighters team up to steal the Death Star schematics.<br/><br/>An interesting mix of exciting heroic and tragic characters. Director Gareth Edwards Monsters, Godzilla) and team are careful not to take anything away from the iconic 1977 classic Star Wars and successfully add to it, i.e the Death Star here doesn't blow up planets in this instalment not to take any impact away from its destructive powers in A New Hope. Still it shows it's immense firepower as Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso goes about finding her father in a sea of defectors, rebels and insurgents including Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). With great Star Wars action setups and battle scenes, that one could only have dreamed of recreating with toys as child this Star Wars story has plenty of thrills.<br/><br/>Loaded with nods to the series and standing on its on two feet. The costumes effects and sets are fantastic and it captures the feel of the originals and bridges the prequels, Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) adds to this. Michael Giacchino's music complements John Williams' previous scores. Edwards creates a sense of urgency here which helps reinforce Episode IV stakes including the famous first '77 on screen appearance of Darth Vader. It's also co-written by John Knoll, who joined Lucas Industrial Light & Magic 30 years ago and worked on Willow (1988). J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens captured the original trilogy's spirit holistically, but Edwards manages to conjurer up the feel of the 1977 Star Wars Magic.<br/><br/>The CGI characters of dead and favourites while not technically perfect are executed well enough too excite fans, namely the appearance of Tarkin (a resurrection of the great Peter Cushing's character) and a pivotal female favourite who appears in the closing. Some X- Wing pilots, Red and Gold Leader have clever cameos. As well as an array of droids, littered throughout are the likes of the Cantina's Ponda Babba and Dr. Evazan, R2D2 and C3PO. Extended purposeful meatier character appearances included General Dodonna, Mon Mothma, Vader himself (in three important scenes) who does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Director Edwards doesn't get hung up on on these cameos of sorts and keeps his eye on creating a wonderfully crafted grittier Star Wars film. The acting arguably surpasses its predecessors with too many actors to mention. Hardened rebel Andor played by Diego Luna cements a place in Star Wars history but Donnie Yen's Chirrut Îmwe steals scenes as a blind warrior. There's plenty of heart courteous of Mads Mikkelsen and lead Jones' Erso. Notable is Alan Tudyk's K-2SO who provides some great one liners as well as a memorable emotional moment. The star though is debatably Ben Mendelsohn as villain Orson Krennic, with the bureaucratic gravitas and emotional depth to leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is that Edwards like Lucas manages to put on screen a Shakespeare-like tragedy mixed with Flash Gordon wonder that has all the familiar simple themes which makes stories great.<br/><br/>Solid Star Wars entertainment all the way."

"bardia-moose","6","3","7","17 December 2016"," Rogue One: A ""Star Wars"" Story
","This was my most anticipated film for 2016. I was more excited for this film than most people were, which is why this is so heartbreaking. I know I'm in the minority for this; a lot of people are enjoying this movie and I hate to rain on someone's parade, but I've got to be honest; I didn't think this was that good of a movie. <br/><br/>The first trailer they released back in April (the one with the chill-inducing Empire sirens), before the re shoots, include like 50% of footage that didn't even make it into the film. Where are they? I get it though, re shoots are common; most big-budget movies do them. However, re watching that trailer again and remembering how f'in excited I got from the possibility of seeing a hard-hitting, war-central Star Wars movie with a dark, ominous tone just made me even more disappointed with the film we actually got. <br/><br/>I loved 'The Force Awakens'. Yes, it borrowed excessively from 'A New Hope', but at least it felt like a Star Wars movie. ROGUE ONE on the other hand feels like a number of different things all thrown together; at times it was a gritty war film, other times it was a lighthearted comedy, and then we also got a space opera in there as well. This inconsistent and, honestly, incongruous mesh of tones ultimately brought the film down, which is frustrating given that when it focused entirely on one of the three aspects, it worked to a tee. <br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers, there was a certain CG character that, when you first see, is really quite shocking and uncanny. But my issues with it are more than just how it was done; it's why it was done. Personally, and this is just me, I thought what Disney/Lucasfilm did was unethical and wrong. <br/><br/>If I were to rank the strengths of this film, Ben Mendelsohn would end up quite high on that list. He was such a different, yet remarkable Star Wars antagonist; if there was one character I wanted to learn more about, coming out of the theatre, it was without a doubt Orson Krennic. Other standouts included Donnie Yen, who has more than a few character-defining moments, and Diego Luna, who added a lot more depth to an otherwise underdeveloped character. In fact, I found most of the characters here underdeveloped and rather two-dimensional. I guess it's my fault I didn't take the time to read 'Catalyst', which is a novel in the Star Wars canon that apparently leads straight into ROGUE ONE. But then again, a movie should stand up as a movie and not rely on additional material. Do I really need to spend an extra 20 bucks and invest in hours of homework to 'get' this film and care about the characters? <br/><br/>Apart from a couple scenes where she's actually quite good in, Felicity Jones just didn't do it for me; she consistently felt too one-note and passive in critical moments where I wanted her to step up and just blow the roof off the place. Someone else that was disappointing was Forest Whitaker. I love the guy as an actor, but what on God's green earth was he doing with his voice? It was so cringe and off-putting that I was pulled out of the film a number of times. <br/><br/>Death Vader isn't featured much in the movie, but his looming presence is certainly felt. It's just; I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed by his minimal involvement. But I understand why he was used as sparingly as he was.<br/><br/>One thing I thought ROGUE ONE did better than 'The Force Awakens', and absolutely deserves credit for, is expanding on the universe and enriching it rather than playing off it and making it feel smaller whether it be with characters that are not the obligatory Skywalkers or Solos, gorgeously imagined worlds, and novel thematic explorations. <br/><br/>This is a Star Wars movie I believe kids won't enjoy as much; this is definitely more tailored to adults. And while that may have originally been a good idea, now having seen the movie I realize that was the wrong move. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a different change of pace. But Disney, if you're going to put the ""War"" in Star Wars (I hate myself for using that phrase) then don't half- ass it. Don't get cold feet halfway through and re shoot the movie in order to lighten up the tone because then we end up with a film that doesn't know what it's trying to be. <br/><br/>With all that being said, I have to admit that as many faults as this movie had, the final act is pretty incredible. They made some bold choices I didn't think they'd make but that felt right for the story, and I applaud director Gareth Edwards and Lucasfilm for that. In fact, the last few minutes are some of the greatest minutes in any Star Wars movie, leading into and tying very nicely with 'A New Hope'. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie I don't feel inclined to rush back and watch on the big screen. The only reason I ended up investing (kinda) in the characters is because of the actors playing them; the writing under services everyone except for a select few like Krennic and K-2SO. I appreciated the tone they went for with the 'war' aspect, but the constant tonal clashes pulled me out and the action, while some of the best we've ever seen in a Star Wars movie, got repetitive pretty quickly. If for nothing else, the last thirty minutes of ROGUE ONE is something to cherish. Now that's a movie I'd watch over and over again."

","First things first: I liked this movie way more than Episode VII. That out of my chest, let's proceed. Since we heard about the project and watched the trailer, we already knew how the movie was going to end, because that is how the original movie starts. And don't forget what appears in the crawl of the original Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>So we know what will happen but we don't know the how, which is really important in the Star Wars movies, how the story is told. The story starts presenting the new characters, who they are and their backgrounds. It continues a bit weak for a moment. And then there is the fantastic final part where it really makes you feel like when you watched the original trilogy, eager for more and more.<br/><br/>The movie keeps the spirit of the old movies. There are maaaaany references and Easter eggs not only nodding to A New Hope but also The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. So true and devoted Star Wars fans can go on a quest trying to find all of them.Besides the clear references, there are also scenes that are filmed the same way that in the originals movies because the situation that they describe resembles that of the old ones. Yes, we remember that copy paste and do it bigger that happened in The Force Awakens, but this is not the case (thank God!). Although some scenes from Episode IV were, in a fantastic way, reutilized for this one.<br/><br/>Another important aspect that was lacking in The Force Awakens was the music. Much better than the one in Episode VII; there are memorable tracks and even references and new versions of classics, like that Imperial March coming back to us. Then we have those CGI that bring back old characters into the story, which might shock us at first but then we get used to them. We might be conflicted whereas we like it or not, but we cannot deny that they are part of the story and we like feeling nostalgic.As for the characters, they are solid characters very well-played by their actors. I specially like Felicity Jones as she is a great actress and here she delivered a brilliant performance in terms of Star Wars.<br/><br/>It is needed to mention that if you are going to watch the movie just for some lightsablers fights, you better turn around and there is almost to none Jedis and no sable fights. Remember, this happens way after Revenge of Sith and right before New Hope, so the Jedis are extinct. The movie is more like the Battlefront video game and separates itself from the rest of the saga. But that doesn't mean that is bad, quite the contrary, it is something different that might inspire you as a non Jedi. We must remember that is a Star Wars story, not a Star Wars Episode. Therefore, it might lack aspects like space fauna and as said the jedis, but it keeps having the Force around it, the spaceships, the Empire, the Rebellion, and it is an interesting story to learn as it gives some answers regarding the original movie. Answers that we might not want to know or that we didn't care at all. But answers that are the excuse to make this entertaining movie.<br/><br/>You will leave the cinema wanting to join the rebels and fight against the Empire. As that is (sadly) not possible, you will have to settle to rewatch A New Hope, because of course that is what you want to see, how the story continues (although you already know that). And of course once you start with Episode IV, you will have to continue with V and VI.<br/><br/>#JoinTheRebelion<br/><br/>And now we wait 365 days for Episode VIII."

","Rogue One is...good. Not great, not bad, just a point or two over ""meh."" While the action is sure to entertain most (except for the lull in the second act), the screen writing is just not on par with the likes of the Original Trilogy or The Force Awakens. On walking out of the movie, I turned to my girlfriend and asked: ""Can you name all of the main characters in the film?"", to which she could not. While all of the characters are likable, (especially K2, the droid, voiced by Steve the Pirate!) the film fails to delve any deeper into the characters. All we know of the characters is their basic backgrounds: who they are, and one or two character traits. Instead of getting rich, developed characters, i.e. Empire Strikes Back, we as an audience receive more of the ""Suicide Squad"" treatment: characters are clunkily introduced and not treated with the screen time and care to create a new memorable cast of adventurers. The fan-service was welcomed in my theater, however I couldn't help thinking that that time spent was time that could have been spent on fleshing out characters. If you are any kind of Star Wars fan, you will enjoy this movie. <br/><br/>May the Force be with you."
"tymbus","8","3","7","16 December 2016"," Less Flash Gordon more R2-Daesh
","Ignore today's nit-picking newspaper reviews, Rogue One: A Star Wars' Story exceeds expectations and delivers fans everything The Revenge of the Sith and The Force Awakens wasn't. The movie wrenches the Star Wars franchise away for its fairy tale past and relocates it on the contemporary battlefield that audiences will be familiar with from TV news. Gone, for the most part, is the landscape of Disneyland princesses and evil emperors to be replaced with a conflict between an all too recognizable alliance of resistance fighters, rebels and assorted na'er-do-wells. The result is less Flash Gordon and more R2-Daesh. <br/><br/>In effect an elaborate example of fan retconning, filling in new past continuity from the point of view of the present, Rogue One takes no prisoners when it comes to the fine detail of the Star Wars universe. A lot of the significance of the locations and plot elements all but sailed over my head. I struggled to recall that, as Wookepedia tells me, Jedha is the spiritual home moon of the Jedi knights or that it is also the source of Kyber crystals that power light sabers and the Death Star alike. Desperately trying to recall dim and distant continuity, my mind jumped a track, merged Samuri Jack and the first season of the Clone Wars and left me imagining that I had already seen Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) in cartoon form. But don't despair. Even fans get it wrong. So, Wookepedia also tells me Jedha is a frozen desert world. It certainly didn't look like that.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, you will need a basic familiarity with the plot of Star Wars: A New Hope. Rogue One deftly takes all the cards in the Star Wars game and adds a booster pack of its own. There's enough nods to scenes and dialogue from Episode IV to bring a smile to the those familiar with that film, but Rogue One adds characters and space craft that are totally new but feel that they belong. <br/><br/>British audiences of a certain age will not similarities between Rogue One and Blake's 7 in which a small group of assorted outcasts are, through force of circumstance united against an totalitarian 'Federation'. And a climactic scene of heroes climbing a radio transmitter tower reminded me of Blake's 7 creator Terry Nation's script for Genesis of the Daleks. But the Blake's 7 was itself created in the wake of Star Wars and drew on the legend of Robin Hood so it's all pretty generic stuff. But Rogue One also has a similarly doom laden - no-one-gets out of- here-alive vibe that resonates more with British dystopian taste. From the outset you know that most people you are seeing on screen never made it to Episode IV. It is remarkable that the film makes you care for a fictional cast who we follow, in the case of Jyn Erso (felicity Jones) from childhood to her untimely end. <br/><br/>Although sandwiched among the other Star Wars movies, Rogue One plows its own course. The music, for instance, cleverly recalls various established themes but veers off in unexpected directions while remaining true to Lucas's vision of a World War Two movie in Space. As the Rebels attack a portal to the world of Scarif, where the Death Star plans are stored, Michael Giacchino's score pays homage to the theme from 'The Dam Busters' (1955). <br/><br/>Some resurrections aren't so happy. Peter Cushing is dug up as the Grand Moff Tarkin thanks to CGI but the effect for me was just creepy- and not in a good way. As was the surprise appearance of Carrie Fisher before the drugs. It won't be long before an entire movie is made of departed Hollywood stars brought to life by photo realistic animation. I am still not ready for it. <br/><br/>But a greater sense of unease was caused by the all too plausible desert city under occupation scenes, particularly where a young girl is caught in the cross fire. The original Star Wars trilogy stood at the threshold of celebratory recollections of World War II heroism and the nightmarish threat of nuclear Armageddon. As such, its breezy representation of warfare was all too easily assimilated into the ghastly fantasy of Reagan's so-called 'Star Wars' defense program. Today, with the Syrian refugee crisis and the evacuation of Aleppo still front line news, I felt reluctant to fully engage with a film that is still a glorified war as entertainment story. At least Rogue One doesn't end with medals all round."
"sd-forum","7","3","7","14 December 2016"," The movie has definitely structural issues.
","I went into this with an open mind, wanting to love it more than The Force Awakens. Unfortunately I did not.<br/><br/>One undeniable positive is that the effects all look very real and good except 2 things that you will understand.<br/><br/>The movie has structural problems. It's beautiful to watch but it has no heart, no character development. You don't care about anyone that much even Jyn Erso. Now I understand why the had to do re-shoots, it needed it and it was not enough.<br/><br/>Also the score by Michael Giacchino was not very memorable. What can you do when you have to do it in 4 weeks.<br/><br/>******* Very small spoilers follow: They should not use CG humans. It looks bad especially in a movie that is going for gritty and reality.

","Rogue One was so boring, I fell asleep 2 times before being able to watch it all. I hated this movie. But at least unlike The Last Jedi, it didn't crap all over the first 6 SW films.<br/><br/>Jyn, Cassian and the gang were not memorable or interesting, except for the blind guy. Whittaker & Mikkelsen were criminally underused in their roles.<br/><br/>
The best parts of Rogue One were K2SO, the over the top & wonderfully hammy villain, Krennic, and the final Vader scene. As a Vader fan, however, I was disappointed with the Mustafar scene, as it looked nothing like Hell-planet it did in RotS. And Vader's dad joke was so cringy. It's blasphemous to say this, but James Earl Jones's voice is too old for Vader. It may be age, or dentures, but he did not sound menacing in the least. CGI Tarkin sounded scarier.<br/><br/>I know I'm in the minority, but this was not a good movie. It came off as bad fan fiction."

Alan Tudyk absolutely killed and stole every scene as a K-2SO - can't remember more funny robot in this franchise yet. Script was involving and kinda surprising in ... i won't spoil anything but i surely didn't expected to see so many endings (lets call them that way) in a ""Star Wars"" movie. And this is where the ending comes - absolutely amazing and surprisingly gritty but at the same time - hopeful. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Rogue One"" isn't a perfect movie, but it is surely not to be missed one especially if you are a ""Star Wars"" fan. Very entertaining movie with the perfect ending."

","I don't need to compulsively hyper analyze it to hate it it. It was stupid from start to finish. I really hated the movie, could not wait for it to end. I wasn't sure what Disney would do with the film but it is the usual useless routine prequel."
"Parks","9","5","15","15 December 2016"," Disney Do What Lucas Could Not
","There were so many negative comments about Disneyfication of the Star Wars universe - making it more child-friendly, more merchandise- driven, more bland, more blah, more nothing.<br/><br/>This film feels like a one-fingered salute to all of that criticism.<br/><br/>The fact is that ""Rogue One"" is a brave experiment and a film that really steps away from the tone - if not the setting - of Star Wars in a way no other film in the franchise has dared. It's the boldest move since ""The Empire Strikes Back"".<br/><br/>Feeling more like ""Where Eagles Dare"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" in space, this film paints a more complex picture of the rebellion. Not a united group of like-minded, high-minded freedom fighters, but a group of zealots with mixed motivations, underhand methods and no lofty ambitions.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones makes an excellent heroine, without Jedi powers or especially strong with the Force, just with a desire to reunite with her father (Mads Mikkelson) whose existence manages to explain really neatly a major plot point in ""A New Hope"". <br/><br/>To save her father, Jones' character has to team up with a disparate group of rebels and from there it's an action-packed race against time to once again thwart the Evil Empire.<br/><br/>Is it entirely successful? I think so. I think it sets out what it intended to do, which is make a war movie in space, complete with ""Battle of Britain"" style dogfights and ""The Dirty Dozen"" style battles. I've read criticisms that the cast isn't as charismatic as the original trio of stars - that's probably fair. But they compare favourably to the new leads (Ridley, Boyega and Isaac) and they blow Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman out of the water. <br/><br/>But a note of warning - if the film fails it is because this is in no way a movie for kids. The characers and settings aren't so colourful. Parts of it look like footage from Beirut in the 80's. Plus, it strikes the bleakest end note since ""Empire"" and that may be unsatisfying for those expecting happy endings from Star Wars movies. <br/><br/>It's a brave move, a most un-Disney move, and I hope that Disney continues to make non-Star Wars films in the Star Wars universe."
"MissSimonetta","6","4","11","18 May 2017"," No good characters means little emotional investment
","While some might claim a movie about the theft of the Death Star plans is pointless, it need not be if we can get involved with the characters. Rouge One (2016) was a nice enough theater experience, but I am shocked by just how bland the cast is, particularly Jyn.<br/><br/>There is no reason why Jyn should be such a dull character. This is a young woman who shuns political activism because of what it cost her family, who feels abandoned and bitter. Her journey from passive to active rebel should have been moving, but it isn't. What is she like outside of the line of duty? I have no idea! It's much the same with the other rebels, who are one dimensional: spiritual monk, cynical gunner, reluctant pilot, the rebel dedicated to the cause. We don't know much about anyone's past in a movie where the past seems to hang heavy over our heroes and gives them additional emotional fuel to fight the Empire; they don't have any inter-team chemistry. This lack of a memorable cast really dragged the movie down and I admit I was bored for the whole first half. When the characters met their tragic ends, I cared little. This movie was a wasted opportunity and it makes me skeptical about the SW spin-offs to come."
"lesleyharris30","8","4","11","20 December 2016"," Stands On its Own, as well as Being a Great Prequel & Spin Off,
","Rogue One is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is the first of Disney & Lucasfilm's planned Star Wars spin off movies, and I think it kicks it all off terrifically, telling a story I believe any fan of the series would want to see, as a group of Rebels try to stop the development of the Death Star. It works out well as a movie that beloved fans of the series will enjoy, as well as being a great standalone science fiction film, I believe people who have not seen Star Wars can still enjoy this and certainly understand it.<br/><br/>As a fan of the Star Wars films myself, I can not help but point out its flaws, mainly that it is a very slow moving film, the first hour and a bit is somewhat tedious, dragging on with character development and heavy dialogue when we are dying to get some action. I also found Jyn to be a very boring character, she was unengaging on screen and her backstory never managed to intrigue me. I do not blame Felicity Jones for this, whom I really enjoy as an actress, but the writers for trying to shove so much information about her down our throats, instead of naturally allowing the character to develop, that I began to resent Jyn being in this movie at all. <br/><br/>Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen also felt wasted here, they did their very best with these characters but they were simply poor roles. Their dialogue was cheesy and, once again, only used to develop Jyn, so they never felt like fully rounded characters themselves. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film, for me, was Cassian and K-250, Diege Luna portrays the character with excellent depth, and Alan Tudyk delivers the voice of yet another very lovable android for the franchise, they had a sort of Han Solo & Chewbacca quality to them that made me smile whenever they were on screen, not to mention plenty of dialogue that had me in stitches. <br/><br/>Although the very best moments that make this film a huge recommendation for fans of the franchise have to be the return of a particular villain. All his scenes had me in chills, suspense and by the end in tears as I felt so much genuine joy to see him on the big screen. <br/><br/>It stands on its own, and maybe in some cases, works out better when not comparing to other Star Wars films, it has no opening scroll which clarifies that it wanted to be its own thing, which I think it achieved. Action packed, well acted and developed, Rogue One is not without its flaws, but I would still certainly recommend it to any fan of Star Wars and Sci-Fi. <br/><br/>A group of rebels come together in order to put a hault to the development of the Death Star. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Diego Luna"

","So let's get right into it.<br/><br/>Last year we were expecting an awesome movie with The Force Awakens. Sh*t man we didn't got that ! <br/><br/>But this year it's right on the mark with Rogue One. I was expecting nothing but greatness, and I got nothing but greatness. There are some minor flaws but we will get into those right away.<br/><br/>First the bad, bad-ish:<br/><br/>1) The first scene with Vader feels kinda forced and pushed. I expected more here. The scene just feels wrong. Luckily Vader makes up for it at the end :)<br/><br/>2) The scene were Krennic goes to meet Galen Erso, and asks him ""How do I know it is ready"" man give me a break. The guy just finished the death star you just tested it. Do you need more confirmation ? Why? Don't you have dozens of scientists who can assure you it is operational ? The dialogue was wrong here, and unnecessary.<br/><br/>NOW the good, the amazing:<br/><br/>1) The setting is amazing right from the beginning, the scenery is beautiful all throughout the movie. CGI wise everything is top notch. The most amazing and life like effects which I have seen in a while. And most importantly the effects don't steal the show. I mean the movie is not driven forward by the effects.<br/><br/>2) Full of action scenes but these also do not steal the movie, you don't feel that the action drives the movie !!!<br/><br/>3) The actors did a great job with the characters, as in you actually care about them, even in a ""if they suffer you feel sorry for them"" way. Here I would like to point out Diego Luna's character Captain Andor, Donny Yen for the blind guy, Krennic and also the Jones did a great job !!!<br/><br/>4) K-2SO, the robot has some amazing lines, which give the occasional laughter which eases the movie's tone.<br/><br/>5) The movie has a dark tone which is very good. It feels like a serious enough for you to care what is happening.<br/><br/>5) The ending will literally blow you away !!!<br/><br/>All in all it was nothing short of AMAZING ! Sure there are some bad-ish scenes, but who cares ???!!! It is full action and with an amazing story line which ties up good with a New Hope. It kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the credits rolled. This movie is worthy to set the tone for A New Hope, and eventually for The Empire Strikes Back !!!<br/><br/>This movie is real STAR WARS !!!<br/><br/>My new personal star wars fav's are in this order: Empire, New Hope, Rogue One !<br/><br/>9.50 / 10"

","I went to the theaters yesterday and i was stunned by this movie, my expectations were low and i even didn't expect this to be a prequel. I was constantly on the lookout for characters from TFA but as the movie went on i understood it was a prequel and got dragged in the dramatic story-line, i couldn't help it. I started cracking my knuckles hoping the good guys would win but it always felt like the odds were against them.<br/><br/>They did a great job making you care for a large amount of characters and every time someone dies, either a main character or just some random rebel i actually felt sad for them. It made me feel for every single rebel, even those i didn't even know their name. They matter here. Also the storm troopers have a very militaristic feel, they actually behave like forces from an oppressive empire, forces that should be feared instead of just cannon fodder for the heroes. The heroes of the story really have to watch out for them.<br/><br/>And then of course you have the classic space battles, believe me, they are awesome. When the large battle starts i just got goosebumps, the leader of the rebels acts like a real admiral, he is very tactical and actually feels like he is in his place being the admiral. He also has an awesome warship, actually all the warships look bad-ass, like large machines of destruction. If you haven't seen it, go see it. It's really that good!"

Some people seem to think the lack of Jedi is a slight problem, but at this time in the star wars universe jedi were a myth and legend and people believed in the force like you believe in a religion.

","This film was by far the best Star Wars film I have ever seen (besides Empire Strikes Back). The way everything was shot was so defining and showed the immensity of every battle and emotional moment shown on screen. Star Wars took a dark turn with this movie and did it right. Gareth Edwards has definitely redeemed himself from the overly- narrative scenes from Godzilla (Which was also a great film). The film has just enough narrative and a hell of a lot of action. The Death Star shots are immense and they show the intensity of the power it wields. The Darth Vader reveal was just so powerful and gave off the ""Grand Entrance"" vibe and pulled it off so well! For those of you want to see more of Vader, you wont be disappointed. This film is a must-see!"
"Thekeybaldemasterrises","7","4","11","16 December 2016"," A triumphant prequel worthy of the Star Wars name
","The hype has once again awakened with the next Star Wars film in Disney's latest entry. Rogue One, the backstory of how a brave group of rebels transmitted the evil Empire's Death Star plans aboard the rebel ship in what we know from the opening of Star Wars (aka Episode IV). I want to start off by saying I really enjoyed Episode VII last year, I thought it was a good spring board for Disney to find their footing in reinvigorating this franchise that was considered dead by the majority of fans. I can understand why they wanted it to feel similar beat wise to Episode 4. To really introduce us to that familiarity of Star Wars we remember. One of my biggest problems however with the film was knowing that the First Order, will never be like the Empire, Kylo Ren will never be like Darth Vader. It just didn't give me that feeling of a new threat, but rather a less interesting impersonator. My first positive about Rogue One is that there's a sense of warmth and familiarity seeing the original Empire again with their variations of armor like the classic white, or the scout troopers from Endor. Whether you enjoy this movie or not, you gotta give props to the people who designed the sets, the costumes, and whoever cast the old characters from the original trilogy because wow. All these factors felt like it just never left the 80's and it makes the world feel timeless and authentic, Garreth Edwards already gets a gold star for doing that. The performances are another strong point, the obvious standouts were Donnie Yen as Imwe along with his partner and Alan Tudyk as K2SO( holy cow was he fun to watch). However I have to say both the film's leads I feel like aren't getting enough positive feedback, Felicity Jones plays a relatable scoundrel in Jynn Erso who understandably has depth with the amount of weight on her shoulders. I don't want to spoil it here but it just goes to show how Disney isn't just giving us perfect female characters with no strings attached, Jynn has a lot of blood on her hands and understandably so. Diego Luna as Cassian Andor was a surprise for me because he brought an interesting spin on someone you expect to be this daring hero of the rebel alliance. There's a moment in the film that genuinely made me question if the rebels were always in the right, the Empire ruined the lives of many people and this movie did a good job of showing how much the alliance was willing to put on the line no matter what it took. It gave me a sense of truth that maybe these guys weren't always perfect and that they made decisions they weren't always proud of, especially through a character like Andor. My last major positive of the movie was indeed as everyone is saying, the third act. It puts the War in Star Wars and contains some of the best action in the series to date. It's explosive, it's exciting, it feels urgent even though you know what's going to happen. And the finale is just so well done it's almost alone worth the price of admission. Now unfortunately as the movie has a lot of good, the film is flawed but then again so is the original Trilogy no movie is without sin. The absence of John Williams is really noticeable here and I can tell Michael Giachino tried his best emulating the Williams sounds and beats, but it most of the time just lost it's way and didn't provide any really unique pieces like Episode VII did. The film's plot got a little muddy in the beginning because I was really lost in the first act with all the character introductions. We jumped from one planet to the next in a guardians of the galaxy like montage with a small title telling us what planet it was. This was just super distracting to me because not only was it moving too fast for the first act build up, the montage just didn't feel Star Wars like at all. They already got rid of the opening crawl and just gave us the opening title which was fine, but there was something off by introducing the planets through subtitles that seemed unfitting for me. Like ""Yavin 4, headquarters of the Rebel Alliance."" Like really? How could someone not know what that is if they've seen episode 4? Anyway, so where does this movie stand for me compared to the others? Well I would say it's fantastic and enjoyable enough to be in my top 3, better then 1-3, and I will say I liked it better than 6-7, but not better than 4-5. I think the hype might be getting to much to people, I'm looking at you Kevin Smith. Overall though Rogue One was one hell of a ride and the important thing is I felt the Star Wars, it had this emotional punch that made me want to go right back in and see it again the third act was unfreaking believable. Even with the absence of a Jedi hero, the Force was strong with this one. It just goes to show me Disney is continuing to give the fan base the good stuff, hopefully this movie will open doors for them to explore more characters and potential stories that go beyond the Skywalker family because it's such a magical world that always sucks you in no matter what movie it is. It's not a perfect movie, but it deserves that 10/10."
"sixstring-1","10","4","11","15 December 2016"," The Fifth Star Wars Movie
","Warning: MAJOR spoilers ahead!!!!! ***** Dammit, Jim, you've been warned!!! ***** <br/><br/>So... After watching ""The Force Awakens"", I said: now, I have the fourth Star Wars movie to watch all over again. Just to be clear: those atrocious insults, piles of garbage that some call the 'new trilogy' do not even classify as movies, let alone as Star Wars movies. Those are merely rubbish, waste of money and time. So, having that stated, let's see what I have to say about Rogue One: To start as simple as possible: it is a very good movie, all by itself. Excellent production value, great cast, good acting, good cinematography, excellent editing, excellent score, great sound, never-before-seen, groundbreaking, breathtaking special effects. Very, very good directing: Edwards is a FAR BETTER storyteller than Lucas, this movie is 'Empire Stikes Back'-good. It hits you in the face with straight forward, honest, decently paced storytelling, and never before seen character development, without giving away the (somewhat predictable) fates of all the lovable new characters.<br/><br/>And the characters... my good g*d... this movie in my opinion is the best example of perfect character development, within limited boundaries (timewise).<br/><br/>******* WARNING, F-ING HUUUUUGE SPOILERS AHEAD ******* <br/><br/>After seeing all the trailers, it was absolutely clear for me, that Jyn Erso will die in this movie. I suspected, that none of the major characters would survive, it was a rather clear hint by the makers since none of the characters were present in any of the now known original canon, nor the extended universe. All of you, having thought otherwise, please do your homework...<br/><br/>Now, the pros & cons: <br/><br/>All the main characters were very cleverly created, and developed, leaving room for development (successfully) and given a very meaningful, or moving death. Yeah, all of them die, get over it. It was a very, very powerful tool to show the audience how great, and how gruesome the struggle of the Rebel Alliance was, and how important the whole cause was. Lucas had attempted to show the audience, how horribly awful the tyranny of the Empire was, and how epic, and sacrificious the struggle of the Rebels was against it... but he failed. Standing on the shoulders of the TV shows ""The Clone Wars"" and ""Rebels"" (both of which have given more to the saga as any of the movies) Rogue One succeeded in depicting the horror, and desperation the whole Galaxy suffered because of the Empire. This is where this film's true strength and merit is: showing the audience, why the Rebel Alliance is such an important thing... showing, how, and why standing up for your rights is so important... showing, why too much power in too few hands is the most dangerous power in the Universe...<br/><br/>This movie is the very first in the Star Wars universe, that carries a really greater message, than just being a piece of excellent entertainment. The struggle, the suffering, the will to fight back, the will to be more is very much present, and pronounced, which gives the film a ""larger than life"" frame, and provokes thoughts far beyond the Star Wars universe...<br/><br/>It's not flawless, not by a long shot. The use of the Force Theme by John Williams for the first time in the film when Bail Organa appears, a character, who has absolutely no correlation with the Force, is downright stupid and insulting. Using basically unaltered cut-ins from the New Hope, in picture, and in audio, is totally over-the-top, and absolutely unnecessary, they gave me a ""why? Just WHY?"" feeling, more painfully so, used in the most thrilling, action packed final act of the film.<br/><br/>Honestly, I could go on for hours, but I think I have to come to some kind of conclusion: This is one of the best movies, that I've ever seen. Probably the best one in the Star Wars universe. This movie showed, that good casting can do wonders: Felicity Jones is beyond marvelous, her performance is absolutely outstanding. Whitaker is over the top, his character demanded the performance he gave, but it was out of place. It did not require the acting genius he possesses, and it showed. Special effects: the third breakthrough. First: New Hope. Second: Jurassic Park. Third: Rogue One. This movie has the very first completely blend-in presence of CGI characters (K2-SO was always ""there"" never gave a hint of being a post-production addition) and it features the very first believable, and human-like CGI human (Tarkin). It was very obvious for the keen eye (such as mine) that Tarkin was fully performance-capture-CGI, but the result was nonetheless remarkable.<br/><br/>A very well deserved 10 out of 10, but beware: this film is not perfect, not by a long shot. But if this was the worst movie ever made, I would be very happy indeed. An excellent piece of artistry, this is."

","A few years back when the surprise announcement was made that Disney would be buying Lucasfilm and acquiring the rights to make episodes 7,8,9 as well as spin off every alternate year, people were blown away but a lot of skepticism was present. A lot of that was dulled after The Force Awakens returned to a base practical effects and brought the fun back to the Star Wars Universe. Now however we have the first of the spin-off anthology films which has its share of production problem rumors and will have us following a group of rebels trying to retrieve plans for the Death Star that will take us bumper to bumper with the original Star Wars from 1977. <br/><br/>For a start I will tell you that whilst there is a few old John Williams tracks merged into the score, the Michael Giacchino score takes you out of the universe as it pales in comparison to the scores of all the other films. John Williams music is an important piece of the feeling you get when you watch Star Wars and I would much rather they cobble together music from the previous 7 films than try and imitate it (poorly). The film is also not shot in the classic way all the others were but I guess these anthology films are going to take some risks and stray away from the Saga formula. After getting used to the look and score of the film you can still feel enjoy it somewhat as it still has the costuming, set design and sound effects we are used to.<br/><br/>The films first act introduces the characters and does so a little clumsily, in fact the structure is a little all over the place. The characters are all likable though and well acted with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna being the stand outs the rebels. The second act has its moments but often stalls but the third act is quite excellent and even though this film is not a patch on The Force Awakens it does have much better aerial battles.<br/><br/>The effects were as strong as you would imagine even with this one being a little too cgi heavy compared to The Force Awakens. Luckily though there was no cringe worthy Snoke cgi moments. However ""Mild Spoiler"" the computer generated version of the long dead Peter Cushing once again playing Moff Tarkin from the original film, whilst getting much closer still has that uncanny valley effect that may be off putting. ""Spoiler finished"".<br/><br/>There are a few Easter eggs in the film and a couple of Holy sh!t moments but I never felt as engaged as I wanted to. It did not quite live up to the promise but it is certainly a solid effort and no disgrace to the franchise. I still enjoyed the film and plan to see it again on IMAX."
"goldenslayer","9","2","4","7 April 2020"," The perfect portrayal of a gritty war movie
","This movie wasn't perfect all-around, but it is a perfect portrayal of the ""wars"" in ""Star Wars.""<br/><br/>Let's start off with the few problems with the films:<br/><br/>1. Pacing - The first part of this film was kind of lacking in pacing, but I won't bug about it too much because this is a film that you need to be emotionally attached to the characters, hence it would be difficult to do that for just a standalone film.<br/><br/>2. Jyn's Story - I feel like the way of portraying Jyn in this film was kind of off. They put too much effort in explaining Jyn's story such as full-on flashbacks (didn't mind the opening scene though) which aren't always needed when they could've done it in more subtle ways.<br/><br/>Let's move on to the many strengths of this film:<br/><br/>1. Cinematography - This movie takes cinematography to Star Wars in a whole new level and is not even challenged by the cinematography of the other movies. Every single shot of the Death Star or its victims are purely outstanding, and The Devastator (Vader's Star Destroyer that came in late into the Battle of Scarif) exiting hyperspace was both aesthetically pleasing and stroke fear into the viewers.<br/><br/>2. Portrayal of the Empire - The Empire in this movie was portrayed to perfection. In the Originals, most Imperials, especially the Stormtroopers, were portrayed as a weak force in comparison to the heroes of the Rebellion, which is fair considering Stormtroopers are grunts of the Empire against heroes of the Rebellion. However, this film really portrays them as a scary force, and they are even portrayed as elites that are much more skilled than the rebels (an example being the Death Troopers).<br/><br/>3. Portrayal of the Rebellion - The Rebellion in this movie was portrayed as a group of hopefuls and not an unbreakable shield. The Rebels are also portrayed as literally terrorists (i.e. Battle of Jedha) and would favor guerilla attacks regardless of the risk of civilian casualties. They are even portrayed as ""just an alliance"" who would constantly argue on things.<br/><br/>4. Battle of Jedha - The Battle of Jedha was a perfect portrayal of the Imperials as Marines on-duty and the Rebels as actual terrorists. It shows how Rebels would naturally prefer guerilla attacks and would favor hiding within the civilians instead of going head-on against the Empire. It also shows us how Stormtroopers should genuinely be able to hit their targets and actually use their scopes unlike in the OT.<br/><br/>5. Battle of Eadu - The Battle of Eadu was a great mid-movie battle to keep you interested. It even gives you that gritty war theme due to the battle being set on a rainy evening. The X-Wings flying through the rain is a beautiful scene before the start of a short but satisfying battle.<br/><br/>6. Battle of Scarif - The Battle of Scarif is, hands-down, the best battle in all of Star Wars (both ground and space). The fanservice of rebels exiting hyperspace was a good way to start the battle along with the appearance of Red Leader and Gold Leader. The Star Destroyers in this were portrayed as extremely menacing but had a vulnerability, which is nice. The fleet of TIEs exiting the hangars was absolutely outstanding, and Vader intercepting the rebels' escape with The Devastator was a great portrayal of him.<br/><br/>The ground battle really nailed the portrayal of how much better the Empire is than the rebels. The Stormtroopers can actually hit targets. The Death Troopers jumping out of the TIE-Reaper was also a great show of Imperial intimidation. It also shows how rebels shouldn't really be able to win a fair battle against the Empire without them all dying in the process, and they usually just retreat after succeeding at their goal (in this, it would be stealing the Death Star plans)<br/><br/>7. Vader's Portrayal - The use of Darth Vader in this movie was so good. He was advertised a lot, so he wasn't just some cameo character, unlike another villain we know from the Sequels. However, they didn't use him too much to the point that he wouldn't steal the show until all the heroes were dead. He was even portrayed as pure evil with the final scene and shows why he's really worth fearing.<br/><br/>8. Krennic's Portrayal - Krennic is the perfect example of a man who just wants to earn recognition within the Empire. He isn't a ruthless dictator like Tarkin, isn't a glorified warrior like Phasma, isn't a Sith like Vader. He's just a man who wants recognition from the Emperor but is stopped by his superiors (i.e. Grand Moff Tarkin) The way he's portrayed is actually kind of sympathetic. You could actually feel more sorry for his death than most of the heroes' death. Ben Mendelsohn did a great job with him."

","Holy Kenobi, this was awesome!!!!! I do acknowledge that ""Force Awakens"" was a remake of ""A New Hope."" No worries here. This is a story we haven't heard before. The characters are awesome (and without giving anything away, let's just say it pays off if you watched the Clone Wars tv series), the action sequences are amazing, and it feels like classic Star Wars while at the same time providing something new. The comic relief character is extremely well written with how a bit too honest he is. This has some new genres being explored in the Star Wars universe, which was something I liked about the Clone Wars tv show. My only complaint is that at times the CGI used to make some of the cameos of characters from the Original Trilogy look young looks a bit fake, like you could tell it was CGI. It's not as bad as young Jeff Bridges in ""Tron: Legacy"", but it looks a bit too shiny and at times like it's from a video game cutscene.

"paul2001sw-1","6","2","4","17 December 2019"," Another Star Wars movie (yawn!) - but another Peter Cushing movie too!
","""Rogue One"" is officially a ""Star Wars Story"", which means we get many familiar elements: a rollicking (and explosion-filled) adventure in outer space, almost human androids, switches to pull, chasms to leap and weapons to destroy, and dehumanised stormtroopers to kill (the fact that stormtroopers are hidden behind protective uniforms including face masks makes them more frightening adversaries, but also removes any moral complexity associated with their annihilation). The original Star Wars movie was partially filmed in the North African desert, and a desert environment has also featured in some subsequent movies in the series; in this one, a substantial section seems more inspired by the experience of American troops attempting to police Baghdad. The film contains various other nods to previous films in the series, without recapitulating their plots as shamelessly as 'The Force Awakens' did; as an immediate prequel to the 1979 film, it also uses digital technology to resuscitate now dead actors to reprise their roles, including Peter Cushing (brilliantly) and Carrie Fischer (less successfully) - perhaps the fact that Cushing's character has aspects of the undead in the original makes it easier to bring him back to life. The ending is nicely judged in theory but marred by the failure to lift the digital Fisher out of the uncanny valley.<br/><br/>The film features a feisty female heroine, praised by many for providing gender-balance to the previously masculine Star Wars world, but she's a bit too perfect for my liking. One of the things that made the original work for me that none of the naÃ¯ve Luke, the money-grabbing Han nor the sarcastic Leia are obvious role-models. We also get one character who channels the force to become a martial-arts superhero; I much preferred the subtler demonstration of the force's power shown by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original film (and indeed, the theme of the force is much stronger, to my reckoning, when presented as the power of self-control and focus than when it appears to confer mystical powers).<br/><br/>'Rogue One' is considered by many to be their favourite 'Star Wars' movie since the original trilogy; for me, the shtick has grown a bit tired (I loved 'A New Hope' on release, but I was seven years old at the time!). Still, the film mercifully lacks the over-busy aesthetic (and tedious dialogue) of George Lucas's later films in favour of something closer to the mood and spirit of the original; it works as entertainment, even if I suspect this fictional universe doesn't really have much new to show us beyond what has already been done."

In all, Rogue One is fantastic with an ending that will leave you breathless! The Force will be with you...always."
"byrann_gowan","8","2","4","30 August 2018"," A rebellion built on hope
","In between the events of Episodes III and IV, it seems like all hope is lost for the rebellion when they find out the existence of the weapon known as the Death Star, which is well-known in the movie universe as a weapon that can destroy whole planets. However, when it is learned that there is a weakness in the Death Star plans, the rebellion - led by Jyn Erso (played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones) - go all out to get the plans to the Death Star so that there can once again be hope in the galaxy.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie! The actors are all great in their parts. Felicity Jones plays off the plucky, rebellious hero well; she is dealing with the absence of her father, who was taken by the Imperial forces when she was a young child. Diego Luna is fantastic as her right hand man, while Emmy Nominee Alan Tudyk (who by now is well known for his voice over roles) provides comic relief as K-2SO. We also get some accomplished veterans that join the Star Wars universe; Academy Award Winner Forest Whitaker plays the wise Saw Gerrera, while Mads Mikkelsen portrays Jyn's father.<br/><br/>While the only well-known director in the Star Wars universe used to be George Lucas, in recent years, it has gotten more well-known directors in the directors chair, such as J.J. Abrams, Rian Johnson and Ron Howard. This time, it is Emmy Nominee Gareth Edwards, who is well-known for his direction in Monsters and the big monster blockbuster Godzilla. Here he takes the Star Wars direction to new places, and while I did miss the lightsabers, it was a refreshing change of pace for the Star Wars franchise. He focuses more on the war aspects of the story and not just the characters or the flashy moments.<br/><br/>All in all, a great Star Wars film! Go and watch it!"
"yaxleycratler","10","2","4","7 August 2018"," Just wow!!!
","This movie was amazing!!! I was kind of concerned over what was going to happen in here, wondering if we wee gonna have a crappy movie, but nope. It yells the story of a bunch of rebels fighting to get the plans. The entire movie was a non-stop thrill ride and the ending with the battle on Scarif and Darth Vader. The Scarif battle was very cool and showed each member's job and how they completed it so that the rebels got the plans. But the ending is what sold it to me. Nobody knew who the rebels were and they all died which explains how you don't hear about them in other movies. Them there's the Darth Vader scene where he goes through the ships slaughtering the rebels. It was fantastic!!"
"retriple","10","2","4","4 August 2018"," Best Star Wars since original trilogy
","This movie instantly recaptures the spirit and tone of the original trilogy - it manages to seamlessly fit itself into that unspoiled universe, and after you've seen it, you'll swear it had always been there.<br/><br/>It has amazing characters that you actually care for. The story of Jyn and her father is genuinely touching. The rebels are wonderfully portrayed as ruthless, morally ambiguous, and very unsure of themselves. Don't forget, this is all before Luke Skywalker emerged to give them an idealistic leader. Best of all, you get a chance to witness the buildup to the events of New Hope, experiencing the Empire as it was coming into its might.<br/><br/>Forget the prequels with their CGI spectacles, forget the sequels with their flaccid, simpering emo crybaby villain, Kylo Ren. Rogue One is the Star Wars movie we've desperately craved since Return of the Jedi."
"scottbeaudette","5","2","4","19 July 2018"," Let down
","Without comparing this to anything else in the Star Wars universe, Rogue One lacked a lot of story and character development. It could have been two movies, if written with more care by a creative storyteller. There was absolutely NO character development at all. Everyone played a two-dimensional role and dialog was boring. The story was rushed to give us just enough to see what happened without putting us into the people and places that made it happen. As a result, the acting felt like a bad script reading.<br/><br/>There was a lot of visual nostalgia, for sure. The effort put into the CGI was astounding. The idea for the story was great. Challenging, because everyone knows this story. Everyone who's familiar with Star Wars knows exactly how this ends. But this story deserves a character study. It needs to make the audience want to be involved. Instead, we got an epic 2 hour commercial for more Star Wars merch. It was beautiful, it was big, it ended with a shrug."

"thepriceofpayne","9","2","4","29 April 2018"," Disney Does it Again
","Many were skeptical of Disney's take on the Star Wars saga, but after the stellar Force Awakens could they do it again, the short answer YES-Rogue One is interesting as it is the first in the Star Wars anthology series, these films won't take place in the Skywalker Saga, but instead tell other stories that have happened in the universe filling in the glass. Hence Rogue One the tale of a band of rebels who discovered the Death Star plans, many people have sighted this as one of the best Star Wars films, and I think it's great, but it's not perfect. So let's start with the good, the characters are fantastic from our leads Jyn and Cassian to the scene stealing favorites K2-SO and Chirrutt, to the fantastic performance from Ben Mendelsohn portraying Krenic. The effects are fantastic and Michael Giaccinno's Score is very well done, I'm also a huge fan of the darker tone in this film, it doesn't go super dark, but it's nice to see another film with a tone that compares to ""The Empire Strikes Back."" So let's talk about some of my least favorite parts, the film is written quite well but it drags a little in the middle which would be fine if the direction left something to be interested there, and while I definitely don't hate Gareth Edwards direction (I mean I love his take) he just had a specific tone (evident from Godzilla-2014) like I said the darker tone is fine but sometimes that can stray into a dull feeling. There is also some unessesary fan service moments, upon first viewing it's really neat, but after you've seen it a few times it can feel awkward, some of them work and are really cool to see (C3-P0, Darth Vader hallway fight) and some of them just feel weird (The bar fight guys from Episode IV) All in all I love the film and think it's another solid Star Wars entry that I'm proud to call one of my favorites."

I saw most of the others in theaters, but this one only on my computer screen (Netflix), so it wasn't the immersion factor.<br/><br/>I generally dislike the whole Small, Beautiful Amazon Who Can Beat Up Lots Of Big Strong Males trope that seems to be filling our screens lately. The not-quite-yet-ready CGI tech on the dead actors' character faces was annoying. The ending was a bit too predictable for my tastes (although I guess I should have known going in ....). And of course the whole ""The FORCE"" nonsense is annoying throughout the series.<br/><br/>Also, a bit of rank cowardice somewhere in it might have spiced it up some, setting a contrast to the unrelenting self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>Still, I liked it.

","So Lucas tried to update his ugly muppets and restored the original series. But it seems they needed Disney to bring the visuals up to date. So you have about the same story line. With about the same decors. Luke's planet is a desert (talking about a simplistic approach), this time it looks like Ireland. Luke is on a remote farm, farming sand as we can see. Here they are farming moss for unknown reasons. But everything is about the same, only looking better. As usual the physics are cheap comic style version, meaning if you can draw it, than this is how it happened. This way a shuttle leaving can blow anybody alive over the landing dock, but not the dead. Which makes perfect sense as the dead can't hold on one hand over the abyss.<br/><br/>As usual, the story is not the best part of a Star Wars movie. And the dialogue is also way below the story. Which does not mean this is not better than most of the movies in the series so far. And I do appreciate the toning down of the comic character.<br/><br/>Actually, there is nothing beyond the visuals. Probably this is an overall issue with the rigidity of Hollywood in general. An advanced civilization that can cross the universe and build these huge ships, some sort of transport cities. Yet, people battle with swords and people are in badly need of mobile phones. Well, maybe the roaming is excessive. The military strategy is a bit beyond the Napoleonic Wars, yet certainly below 1914. With laser weapons, the best Lucas' team could imagine back in 1977. As for communication, they can do cross galaxy radio, yet moving data needs some homing pigeons.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"

I really was excited for this, i mean everyone who loves the originals must have wondered what happened before that amazing opening to one of the greatest films ever!. But now i feel it was pointless to even make it. If you actually go back and watch New Hope after watching this film you would be confused. It doesn't even coincides with the original film(s)! Let me get this, so The whole rebellion attacks the whole planet and it got wiped because of that yet in New Hope Lord Vader says it was ""spies"" that took the plans? Honestly why? (i asked my self when they attacked the planet). Look i know they had to do a pre-equal to the originals but did it have to be so mediocre and so feminists!(yes you read it right). But one very positive about the film is the CGIs of the old characters, it was very brave thing to do and they did it well.

He has been living hidden on the planet Lah'mu with his wife Lyra(Valene Kane) and his daughter Jyn(Felicity Jones).<br/><br/>Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star.

Realizing the enormity of destruction this weapon would unleash upon the universe, he implements a flaw in the design of the Death Star whereby it would be destroyed by a single lazer blast at a specific point.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook(Riz Ahmed) defects from the Empire, smuggling a holographic message from Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon Jedha. Rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor(Diego Luna) frees Jyn from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader Mon Mothma(Genevieve O'Reilly), who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered by General Draven(Alistair Petrie), an Alliance military officer, to kill Galen rather than extract him.<br/><br/>Watch the film to find out what happens next... This film has incredible action sequences you have to see to believe. The very latest of CGI imagery is used to bring the character of the late Peter Cushing, the Grand Moff Tarkin to life. Sound effects and background music score are spot on. Gareth Edwards who has worked on such movies as Monsters(2010) and Godzilla(2014) has managed to keep standards the visual brilliance of the Stars Wars saga alive.<br/><br/>Verdict: Though The Empire Strikes Back is still my all-time favorite, this entry is my third choice, whereas Revenge Of The Sith is my second.<br/><br/>More Space Movies To See: 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, 2010 The Year We Make Contact 1984, Alien 1979, The Black Hole 1979, Nightflyers 1987, The Last Starfighter (1984), Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991).<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper."

","Although I would rate this episode very high in terms of visual effects, cinematography and production value, however, it was difficult for me to place the story on the time-line of the Star Wars series. As we were given to understand that it's a prequel to 2015 release ""The Force Awakens"" – I was expecting something like the background of characters like Rey – or a story that would extend into the near past of episode VII. However, the plot is completely disconnected with the latest episode and there is an entirely new set of characters whose relation with the existing set of characters, as we know in the Star Wars saga, is at best unclear and vague.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of science fiction movies and love to watch fancy space ships, humanoids, droids, friendly alien species, interplanetary warfare, then you must watch this movie.<br/><br/>However, as a Star Wars fan, you will find absolutely nothing that would qualify as any meaningful addition to the original tale. Nor there is anything you could expect to see in any subsequent episodes.<br/><br/>After enchanting us with The Force Awakens, Disney has given us Rogue One as a filler, perhaps with a message: ""Hey, we're working very hard on the real one – The Last Jedi – till then, here's a Star Wars story you might like"""

","I just wanted to say a few words of my own we had the first trilogy which was a epic, then we had the second trilogy which again was epic (failure), then there was this part VII which was a dash of everything in the old franchise, now we have a standalone which is a prequel to how the rebels got hold of the Death Star structural plans & flaws therein, did we really want to know? I mean this is nothing but blatant money making scheme on a good franchise but guys you have milked it all for whats its worth please stop dishing out nonsense and stop insulting our intelligence. 6 out of 10 is just because i am a fan of the franchise."
"fjk1138-731-161881","7","2","4","24 March 2017"," Good but not great (Spoiler warning)
","People can say what they want about Ep 7 but I enjoyed it far more than Rogue One. While I liked the darker aspect of Rogue One, I wish we could have seen it before all the reshoots were forced (heh) upon it. <br/><br/>Ep 7 was more fun and developed it's new characters better, and there was some great humor in the movie. By comparison, there is very little humor in Rogue One, save for the new droid (probably the most entertaining character to me).<br/><br/>In terms of this movie, I personally didn't care about not seeing the opening crawl, but more jarring to me was the use of titles explaining the planets/locations, which I didn't need (it was never done in any previous Star Wars movies - why start now?). <br/><br/>The music didn't feel like Star Wars at all (I understand it had to be composed rather quickly, but sorry - not my problem). There was very little use of the main themes and even when they did appear it was like ""hey, you know it's Star Wars - here's the music to say so"". <br/><br/>The CG actors were OK but still not 100% convincing enough for me. They could have been referred to in the story and I would have been fine with that. At best they should have been shown from afar or as one of them is first shown in a window reflection and left it at that.<br/><br/>In terms of new characters, I liked Jyn but the other lead actor with her had too thick of an accent to be that much in the foreground. His voice should have been dubbed, and his character was generally unlikable to begin with. It seemed like there may have been a subplot to show him turning around (character-wise) or at least being morally ambiguous, but the final cut makes it clear that any potential for this will never see the light of day. The other characters were all throwaways and was no point in getting attached to them. Watching them get killed off later on has basically zero emotional impact because of this. Also, there is no Han Solo type of character, and all the fun interplay between them (like in Empire Strikes Back) does not exist here whatsoever.<br/><br/>I did like the rebels vs rebels idea, and the new Droid was fun without overdoing it. The new villain was good, though indirectly undermined by including two old characters along with him. One neat idea that did work was that you get to see the Death Star's weaponry being used and it's not perfect off the bat. <br/><br/>There is little combat to be found for the first two thirds of the film, so the battle in the last part by far has the most action and felt the most ""Star Wars""-ish. However, the combat is all shot in that completely overused and overblown shaky cam style that is just revolting to watch at this point, and it felt completely out of place for a Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>The scenes with Vader were the highlight of the film by far, as short lived as they were. I found his last scenes to be the most entertaining....And then the film basically just ends. A rip off if you ask me. There was a perfect opportunity to have him appear sooner, more often, or even just make him the main villain again - none of which happened sadly.<br/><br/>Overall, it really didn't feel that much like Star Wars, but more like a war film disguised as Star Wars with just enough fan service to get by. I really didn't expect much, but there really was no point in this movie being made in the first place. In the long run, it serves no real purpose in the story line considering you will never see these characters ever again in any other movies. Personally, I'm getting tired of Hollywood feeling some need to explain backstories to characters or story events (stop doing it, we need some mystery in our lives), only to be done so in a completely lackluster way. That, combined with boring characters that ultimately serve no story purpose. Had this been a short film, or done in a short episodic format like the Clone Wars cartoon was years ago it would have worked far better.<br/><br/>In the end, it's not a horrid film, but it will be the first Star Wars movie in 40 years that I will not buy a physical copy of. As a result, I have no faith in the upcoming Han Solo movie. <br/><br/>Nice try Disney, but you better step it up if you intend to milk the Star Wars cow for all it's worth."

In fact, if they could erase the other 4 star wars movie and just leave this one and the original 3 and that would be perfect. Rogue One is a great movie, no doubt about it. The only thing I didn't really like is the choice to use Diego Luna as one of the main characters. I've never seen him before but I wasn't impressed. He seemed like a one-dimensional character throughout the whole movie and was not up to the standard of everybody else in my opinion. He just had this annoying grumpy face in every scene and weird accent which was a bit annoying and monotone. But apart from that, I'm very happy that we finally get to see a great star wars movie after all these years. Well done to everybody, especially the director. Bravo."

A very befitting title to end on the high note."
"FabledGentleman","7","2","4","17 March 2017"," Well i'll be damned
","Not going to be much of a review, just some quick thoughts, right after i just saw the film.<br/><br/>To be honest, i didn't think Gareth Edwards could pull it off. After i saw the god awful Godzilla, which i consider to be the worst movie of all time if you count in production cost, i saw no hope in this movie, what so ever. Also i didn't like ""The Force Awakens"" which i gave a 4, and it's top 3 most rated review for that movie here on IMDb.<br/><br/>So the way i saw it, failing director meets failing franchise, what can go wrong?. Well apparently, it went surprisingly well. This is in fact one of the best Star wars movies to this date, probably the third best only beaten by ""Empire Strikes back"" and ""A New Hope"". And wow, that was not what i expected at all.<br/><br/>Where ""The Force Awakens"" leans too much on nostalgia and has very little fantasy and originality, this movie stands much better on it's own feet. And i criticized ""The Force Awakens"" for having yet another Death star in it, they do have that here as well. But in this movie it's different, as this is the direct prequel to the original Trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie has surprisingly well made battle scenes, i just had to get that off my chest, it's made the right way. I feel i get to see what i need to see most of the time. The camera angles, the view of the battles and the pacing, is all well done. It feels like the director really knew what he was aiming for, not just throw in mindless explosions whenever they feel appropriate.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a breath of fresh air. Not a masterpiece my any means, the movie has to much of the usual stuff to be called that. There are few surprises in the story. Except the ending, which was quite nice, i could not predict that one. :) Everything else is just as you expect. It's classic star wars, it has good acting (for the most part anyways), it has a good plot, it has great visuals, a flamboyant soundtrack, impressive spaceships, immense action scenes, awesome villains and some nice surprises.<br/><br/>This movie could probably have been lifted up one more star if it dared to be a little more original. But hey, it's not a big deal, for many kids watching this movie, what they are seeing is completely original and never been done before.<br/><br/>7/10 - Quite Good"
"roxerone","6","2","4","17 March 2017"," Not bad but very far away from being great
","This so called Star Wars movie is definitely not bad, it is an OK story telling, filled with good actors. Compared to Star Wars - The Force Awakens (Star Wars - The Force falls in to a deep sleep and may never wake up again), which is on top of my most worst movies I ever had to watch in my entire life list, followed by the 2015 Fanatic 4 movie, it took me a week to watch that unbearable two hour nonsense of a movie, directed by Jar Jar Abrams, Star Wars - Rogue One is quiet entertaining. This movie suffers a lot from the fast cuts. In one scene you are on this planet and on the next scene you are on an other one. And this happens about 10 time or so. That is really hard to handle. The characters on this movie are a little bit flat too, even they are played by great actors. So over all this movie is watchable. But for me, Star Wars what is used to be, do not exist anymore. The magic is gone, only the commercial part has been left."

","I'll warn y'all when I start dropping spoilers, so if you're interested in what I feel about it first, feel free to read until then.<br/><br/>Soooo, I've just come from from seeing it in the cinema. I know, I'm late. Poor uni student, blah blah blah. I had a free ticket that was going to expire tomorrow so I dragged my housemate out into this blasted heat and went to see it.<br/><br/>And oh my google. My face leaked from every orifice.<br/><br/>Both joy and sadness, mind you. I'm a long term fan of the movies (sorry television and written work, I'm just not that into you), so whenever there was even the slightest throwback it hit me in the feels. For fans of the franchise you won't be disappointed in this installment and it can stand up next to the original series as a great.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the other Star Wars, don't worry. It's a 'stand-alone' meaning you don't have to have seen any of the others for it to be a complete story to entertain and thrill you. However, this *is* a linking story so there is a before and after that you may wish to explore after dipping your toes into a universe far, far away. The story arc is not dented as it sometimes is with add-ons and it's satisfying on it's own.<br/><br/>SPOILERS INCOMING.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment with Rouge One was actually in the very first minute. There was no rolling text. Something that every movie has had so far. It was jarring and the fan in me was waiting for that big trill of music and the story so far. It never came.<br/><br/>In this way, I also became a little disorientated with the fact that they messed with the original score of the films. It was like walking into your best friend's apartment drunk after they'd moved the furniture. I get what they were going for, pairing off from the older films but in my opinion it didn't work.<br/><br/>These are trifling things though. In the big picture the story was complete and contained, embellished enough for the fans and understandable enough for the newbies. The CGI for the old characters who have ages or passed on (Carrie, I love you) was superb.<br/><br/>While my brain knew how the ending must go (having seen the movies after it) I was still shocked and amazed at how it panned out, the ending was amazingly tense and choreographed and yes, I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.<br/><br/>In all, 8.5 out of 10 in my opinion. I love it, I will watch it endlessly and K2 will forever be the sassiest of droids, but there is room for improvement. A classic, entertaining and endearing watch I recommend for all."

","The biggest fear I had for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was that it would lose the propulsive and mythical identity the rest of the saga carried. At every point in the seven film franchise, regardless of quality, Star Wars was about finding your place within the context of your life. Whether it be Anakin, Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia, Han...even Rey or Finn; everyone sought to identify and accept the role they felt was offered to them. The seven films were tied together by a vague thematic connective tissue; a powerful thru-line of mythical narrative beats and rousing spectacle. So how does Rogue One fit into all this? What story could it tell to find a place among those giants?<br/><br/>Turns out I underestimated the flexibility of that connective tissue; because Rogue One is right at home within this franchise. Here we find Jyn, another brilliant heroine lost in the world offered to her. It's made apparent that she is indifferent to that which doesn't directly effect her; apathetic to all things not immediately down her path. As the film progresses, she finds a reason to fight and to believe in the power of hope. That's a key word in this movie, hope. Another fundamental thru-line to this entire saga. The hope to become the person you aspire to be. The hope to resist a dangerous tide of tyranny and maintain systematic order. The hope to remain faithful to a diminishing religion. The hope to overthrow a tyrannical superpower in hopes of equality and justice. As the film blatantly asserts, this is a franchise built on hope. Misguided or not, Rogue One taps into that sincere yearning, that basic bravery required to oppose that which towers over you.<br/><br/>Rogue one includes just as interesting characters such as, Diego Luna's comedic and assassin-esque Cassian Andor, Donnie yen's blind staff wielding Chirrut imwe, Ben Mendelson's villainous Director krennic, hell even K-2SO is a well written character. Each and every character strives on their unique features and combine to make a perfect cast, Donnie Yen outshining them all. The child-like brilliance of George Lucas' original Star Wars returns in Rogue One as it brings new and enriching characters throughout.<br/><br/>It's action is amazingly done, combined with set pieces so beautiful, Rogue One brings an action/sci-do film for the ages. The final beach scene was both fantastic and emotionally satisfying I cried. I didn't know what they would do to have it end, but the entire last half of the film is worth seeing this alone. Packed with depth, emotion, and love, Edwards made a final sequence unprecedented by anything else. The conclusion to the film was also satisfactory in its connection to the original film; Darth Vader's brilliant murder rampage, the destruction of the planet, Princess Leia in all her GCI, was so beautifully done.<br/><br/>In my eyes, Gareth Edwards' masterclass of Star Wars comes from it's enriching story, flowed beautifully, excellent character development and end, and above all his brilliant way of telling a complete story without nostalgia or a sequel. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story took me by surprise, I loved it. It's possibly better The Force Awakens, damn this film was phenomenal."
"MrTeaNCrumpets","8","2","4","22 February 2017"," A brilliant spin-off
","Seeing the classic era of the Empire in Star Wars being brought to life by modern technology was so nostalgic, the CGI was stunning, action scenes very memorable and simply a must see for all Star Wars fans. The worst thing that really drags the film down from a higher rating was the extremely long build-up, it felt like nothing of significance was really being done until the final acts. When it does picks up, it goes all out and you're left with the film rapidly improving right until the final scene."

","Star Wars Rogue One puts the ""war"" in Star Wars. It is gritty, dirty, and a dark trail that eventually leads to hope. It starts without a crawl, but we quickly meet Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and her parents on a remote ring world. An Empire Officer known as Orson Krenic craves the power and grandeur behind the building of the Death Star and forces Jyn's father, Galen Esro (Mads Mikkelson) back to the Empire to help build it. Jyn was raised by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) for several years. One day, he disappears, seeking to join an extreme wing of the Rebellion against the Empire, and she is now on her own. Another faction of the Rebellion liberates her from an Empire transport and she finds herself flung into the Rebellion. Her two allies, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and a droid K2SO (Voice of Alyn Turdyk) are on a mission to find an Empire pilot who has defected. He has knowledge of the Death Star. On their way to find him, they find two more allies, Baze Mallbus (Wen Jian) and Chirrut (Donnie Yen). A series of events leads our rebels to a lonely planet where Jyn is reunited briefly with her father, to find out he has a plan of his own. Once they return to the Rebel Base on Yavin 4, rebels contemplate deserting their cause out of fear. Jyn, Assian, Baze and Chirrut cannot walk away from it, though. Finding a group of rebels determined to forge ahead, they make a run at stealing the plans of the Death Star. First out, this has good action, paced with some character development and story development. It is a dark side of the rebellion that has soldiers who have gone to extreme measures for their cause. Moreover, they have been hardened by the gritty, dark side of war. And this is the troops part of war, lacking the Force, light sabers, and duels. the closest we get to the Force is Chirrut, a blind man who would rather chant his way with the Force instead of emptying himself. Of course, the sinister Darth Vader is back, with the voice of James Earl Jones. He did have ample screen time and a pretty good battle scene against some rebel soldiers. The best part was the epic battle between the Rebellion and the Empire in the effort to steal the Death Star Plans. And for all the nitpickers who griped about the design of the Death Star will find a very satisfying answer. The characters are not fleshed out as well as the original trilogy, and the CGI used for the return of Grand Moff Tarkin was used way too much and will likely kick an audience out of the story for a while. Still, overall, this has it all for Star Wars fans: fights, space combat, droids, and decent stories, decent characters, and the perfect cameos."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","8 February 2017"," The darkest Star Wars movie so far
","Rogue One, detailing the story behind the theft of the original Death Star blueprints, was a pleasant surprise for me. It's the first major Star Wars film ever made that is not part of the original saga of trilogies and thus it was a bit unclear just what niche it was going to fill. And don't get me wrong, I like the plot for this movie. It was alluded back in the original Star Wars that there was a mission to steal the blueprints that eventually allowed Luke Skywalker to destroy the Death Star, so why not tell it. Plus, I'm not at all bothered by the fact that I already kind of knew how the film would end, like some complainers have been. It's like complaining about the fact that a Disney movie is going to have a happy ending no matter what.<br/><br/>But still, it was a bit unclear just how much effort was going to be put into this, and luckily they didn't disappoint. I'd say that this is just as good as Force Awakens. It's instantly recognizable as Star Wars, broadens the universe and gives us exactly the kind of action adventure we want. The final battle especially, over and on the garden world of Scarif, is one of the best battle scenes we've yet seen in Star Wars. It's creative, easy to follow and filled to the brim with tension. It also contains one of the best Darth Vader moments in history. That alone was worth the price of admission, in my mind.<br/><br/>The story is also very good. It's a lot darker than the trilogies, by which I mean that it's told as a war story. The Rebellion versus the Empire feels like a proper war, with both sides willing to commit atrocities in the name of their cause. There are casualties aplenty and people don't come out unscathed.<br/><br/>The movie is not without its flaws, however. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the main character, is unfortunately a bit flat, as is the main male character Diego Luna (Cassian Andor). Neither of them is terrible, but they're not all that identifiable either. The supporting cast is very strong, however, which makes up for this failing. I especially like the droid K-2SO, voiced by Alan Tudyk.<br/><br/>Some have also complained about the fact that the first half of the movie drags a little bit, but personally I didn't notice.<br/><br/>All in all Rogue One is more than a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga. If you liked Force Awakens, you're going to like this one just fine."
"barbagvido","4","2","4","31 January 2017"," Rogue One:A Well-Thought But Poorly Executed Story
","Rogue One is a first spin off in a Star Wars franchise and a first movie in Star Wars Anthology series. It's set right before ""A New Hope"" and shows how the rebels stole the Death Star plans. It's directed by Gareth Edwards, the director of Godzilla (2014), which I loved, bit still I didn't feel a lot of excitement going into this, but I did expect it to be pretty good. And it actually managed to disappoint me.<br/><br/>It's not entirely bad, I will say what I liked about it first. Darth Vader, he shows up in only two scenes, but boy does he make an impact in those two scenes. We are reminded of why he is one of the best villains ever and the scene near the end, shows us the Vader we all missed since episode VI, but never got. Well, we've got it now and that scene at the end may quite possibly be the best in the series. The movie has some visually wonderful moments and the action is well- handled. The story helps close a plot-hole about Death Star from a New Hope, I really appreciated that. And now I have a new favorite droid in the series - K-2SO. That guy is brilliant. If you love sarcastic and sassy characters like I do, you will love K-2SO.<br/><br/>The sad part is, those are probably the only good parts. Darth Vader is great, yes, but he's barely in the movie at all. Instead we get an extremely uninteresting and paper-thin villain. And why waste such a good opportunity? I'm not asking for Vader to be a main villain, but if you have a chance to put him in the movie, use it a bit more. That's too good of an opportunity to miss. And yet they miss. I just talked about uninteresting villain, and the rest of the characters aren't much better. Some of them may actually end up being interesting if they aren't immediately killed and we're moved to the next plot point. I didn't even care about the main character. We barely knew who she was too. We're just watching things happen before eyes, but we don't feel it. At least I didn't. And how could I? The story itself is good, but it's so poorly executed and fails to grab any interest. Except if you only want to see action. The movie also had re-shoots. And it shows. It really does show. Everyone complained about Suicide Squad for that, and no one complains about this. I'm not a DC fanboy, so if I sound like one, I apologize. But I liked Suicide Squad. It was choppy, yes, but it wasn't terrible. It had the charisma, it had the appeal and it was a lot more fun. Here, nah. There is barely anything interesting about this movie and how this story was executed. We just jump from a plot point to a plot point like nothing happened. <br/><br/>The movie just doesn't have any soul. It has a few highlights that don't stop it from being a disappointment. If you just like expensive action sci-fi movies, let alone the quality, sure, enjoy. But this was not my cup of tea."
"chrisbalfour-44698","9","2","4","29 January 2017"," Gets better with every viewing
","I have seen the film 3 times since it came out. Twice on standard screens of varying quality and once on IMAX in 3D. As expected the IMAX experience was the best by far and enhances the film even more but the main thing that has come out of the multiple viewings is that my estimation of the film is far greater. This is my first review on IMDb and sitting during the thrilling climax it came to mind to do it. I am going to try to get across what i had in my mind at that time to make me want to take this step and do the review.<br/><br/>I am a Star Wars fan for sure. Not an obsessed one but it's purely down to seeing the first film at 10 and then growing up with the films in those impressionable years. I wasn't particularly bothered about episodes 1-3 and didn't even see Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith in the cinema, but The Force Awakens was a superbly constructed episode. I was intrigued when i heard about Rogue One when i heard about it, and once the main story line was announced we knew the point of the film, but it was all about how they told the story.<br/><br/>In the end we get a film of 2 hours 13 minutes and to me they couldn't of dispensed with any of that time in order to do it properly. The pacing is great and the film builds and builds to the fantastic climax which shows the director knows a bit about the elements which make Star Wars films so great. Not that it's not evident in the whole film, but that climax is outstanding, with snappy editing so we go through swooping fighters in space, to gritty battles on the ground. Some people have likened it to a war film, going from battle to battle and I can see what they mean for sure. <br/><br/>I don't agree with people saying the middle bit is hard going, and not sure why people sometimes just say things for the sake of saying something when reviewing films. I suppose there are bits which don't match up to the rest of the film but films need those bits for the overall story. All the best films in history have suffered the same.<br/><br/>I won't go into detailed views of the cast and performances but a shout out to the portrayal of K-2SO by Alan Tudyk. A classic Star Wars robot character. Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe is also excellent, and Ben Mendelsohn plays a nasty Krennic well. Also a mention about the score. Not John Williams this time but Michael Giacchino's music is brilliant and every now and then pulls in some of those classic themes from the old movies.<br/><br/>During that final 30 minutes the emotions were stirring inside of me. Some tears and a few deep intakes of breathe. Then I realized that on each viewing i had been pulled in the same way each time and it takes a good film to stir the emotions two more times when you know what's going to happen. It's at that point that i decided i needed to review it, and i hope this makes many more people want to see it. Don't go in expecting it to be up there with your favorite film of the other seven, but give it a chance."
"mjplysaght","8","2","4","25 January 2017"," We all know what's coming, but this film still delivers
","So, any Star Wars fan can pretty much connect the dots in deducing what takes place in this film. It's literally right before the original Star Wars begins so it doesn't take a genius to figure it out.<br/><br/>We're introduced to an ensemble of entirely new characters, half of which, you'll forget their names as soon as you finish the film. To give you an example, here's my roll-call of the main protagonists without consulting Google: Jyn, Cassien, K-2SO, Blind Jedi Follower, Buddy and Asian Machete.<br/><br/>So Jyn Erso has more or less lived through her developing years as an outlaw. You could argue that there are many parallels between her and Rey from The Force Awakens, even down to a complete copy of the scene where she takes down a team of assailants single-handedly while the male sidekick looks on impressed.<br/><br/>While this is officially Star Wars canon, it takes a couple of new approaches, such as not having a title crawl at the beginning, travelling to several new planets and captions describing the planets. Even the traditional John Williams score is nowhere to be heard.<br/><br/>Despite all this, it's serviceable as a film. One distinction is that it is considerably more darker than the traditional Star Wars film. Their use of CGI is both impressive and questionable. Trying to portray characters previously played by deceased actors is tricky, so I was unsure what to make of CGI Peter Cushing as Governor Tarkin. I wouldn't have minded it as much if he was a recurring character but there are numerous scenes where he appears and every successive time he appears, the illusion gets more and more broken. The same can be said about CGI Leia at the end. I know that Carrie Fisher was still alive at the time this film was released but it's just something haunting about the glossiness of CGI Carrie Fisher circa 1977.<br/><br/>The action in this film is amazing, especially the space battle; clearly a homage to Return of the Jedi. A number of unexpected cameos appear as well, which is a complete surprise. If there's one aspect that could be described as a weak link, it's the character chemistry. I know that these actors are good (hell, Felicity Jones was Oscar-nominated), but the overall delivery isn't quite to that same standard. For example, Jyn Erso sees a hologram of her father, whom she hasn't seen for about 10-15 years and starts crying her eyes out. She meets her father in a later scene as he dies. No tears, just ""Noooo!"" That didn't quite work for me.<br/><br/>Also, no point getting emotionally invested because these characters all meet the same fate. K-2SO is probably one of favourite Star Wars characters now, though.<br/><br/>This film also gave us the best Darth Vader scene ever, making me wish that we had more scenes to that degree.<br/><br/>Overall, this film makes a great addition to the universe of Star Wars. However, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who has never seen a Star Wars film before, otherwise they would be completely lost."
"bobbo204","8","2","4","21 January 2017"," Gives me a new hope for the Star Wars franchise (pun intended)
","I went into this movie with no expectations. Having been left utterly dismayed by the abysmal Episode VII (which I'm apparently in the minority in opinion) I was worried that this would also be a quick cash-grab for Disney. Instead, I was amazed by the leeway that this director was given and by the respect that he showed the original series given that this film is a prequel to Episode IV.<br/><br/>The story - nothing too complex here but it's an entertaining story that pulls you in and keeps you interested to find out what happens next. The intro sequence felt a little forced (not sure what the mom was thinking when the storm troopers showed up). The first few scenes jump around a bit too much for my taste, they're meant to introduce characters quickly but it takes a few scenes with each of them before you start to get immersed in their world and struggles. Once the movie hits its pace the characters do a great job playing off of each other and making you care for them. <br/><br/>Alan Tudyk's robot was the highlight of the character reel for me, and his jokes were well-timed and provided a welcome comic relief without being overbearing or forced (a la Jar Jar). Donnie Yen did a very strong job in his role as well with a few nice action scenes. His side-kick Wen Jiang also did a nice job in a supporting role. Felicity Jones did admirably as the lead. The ""main"" villain, a high up Imperial official was a little over-played and never felt very imposing. Diego Luna's character was just OK, I felt that some of his character development was forced (not necessarily the actor's fault on that).<br/><br/>Pacing - the movie is fast paced and action focused and seemed to jump around a little too quickly. I think it could have used a few more slow character development scenes to break up some of the action. <br/><br/>Being primarily an action movie this had its share of battle scenes and I was very happy to see someone finally do some homage to the original trilogy's great space battles. Donnie got a scene or two to show off his martial arts abilities, but it fit into the mythos well. All the ground battle scenes were typical star wars fare, but done well with some tense blaster fights.<br/><br/>A few mixed bag items. The director used quite a few real sets, which I always appreciate and I think should be used more often than relying on CGI backgrounds as default (my personal preference there). However, while he did this for some of his backgrounds he decided that for some Episode IV characters he wanted to show in his movie he would just bring them back as fully CGI characters. Moff Tarkin is back as a fairly main character and very painful to see, it was a shame they couldn't have just done him as a hologram recording when needed as every time he came on scene I cringed. There's many ""easter eggs"" in the movie or overt references to things from the original trilogy. Some felt organic or at least humorously done (like two characters from the bar scene in episode IV), but then others felt forced like when the ""main"" villain reports to one of the higher ups because he wants credit for the death star being built.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful homage to Star Wars and a worthy prequel to Episode IV. If you were scared that Disney would ruin star wars after seeing VII, then this should assure you that there may still be some gems to come out."

","The movie was exciting from start to end. I was always on the edge of my seat. It's dark, intense and very well made. First time watching I didn't notice that Tarkin was CGI, and that should give an insight in just how good the visual effects were.<br/><br/>One of the things I appreciate most about this movie is that it avoids the typical cliché many Hollywood movies have, especially the ending. It is everything I wanted it to be without any unnecessary nonsense.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very well written, the characters are interesting and dynamic, the story is intriguing, and it is not only loyal to the previous movies, it also ties-in them in a beautiful way.<br/><br/>With that being said, this is now on the top of my favorite Star Wars movies list.

"sandykemp","9","2","4","16 January 2017"," Yes there is a lot of Fan Service here...but it's been done so well it actually works!
","This film certainly puts the WAR in Star Wars! Action is not something lacking in Rogue One. In fact in some ways there's SO much action that the characters back stories do suffer a little from it.<br/><br/>That being said its a really enjoyable movie and wastes no time at all in getting to the action and the main plot points. The characters are well written and sufficiently complex enough to do the story justice. However there are parts where you feel there should have been more done to flesh the characters out a little so you care a little more about their struggle in the long run.<br/><br/>For fans of old-school Star Wars though there are plenty of moments that will have you grinning from ear to ear! From the return of classic ships and vehicles to some very unexpected but welcome cameos. (Not the ones getting the most press I might add.)<br/><br/>Like The Force Awakens it really benefits from a physical and hands on film-making style. It definitely expands and builds upon many things we first saw in A New Hope all those years ago and since watching Rogue One a re-visit to Episode IV now seems to give many scenes and occurrences within that movie take on a more intriguing and deeper meaning.<br/><br/>It has its faults however I was willing to let those little niggles slide simply because this was one roller-coaster ride of a movie! (Especially the last third of the story.) Hopefully with the success of Rogue One Lucasfilm will go ahead now and make more ""Star Wars Story"" movies that give die-hard fans like myself more of an insight into this vast and rich galaxy of heroes, rogues and villains."

","Rogue One is a good movie, and delivers a good story with great visuals and action.<br/><br/>However, it feels like that it relies on filling in already set plot- points and holes, and in the end, feels like a straight up fan service.<br/><br/>This is a movie meant for those that care about the laughable plot holes in the original trilogy and want closure on that.

"JimD73","6","2","4","29 December 2016"," Rogue One, unlike any other Star Wars picture, is just a movie
","The release of a new Star Wars film is never just another movie. Through their relative rarity, a Star Wars movie is a major event, taking over the cultural conversation and, of course, the toys and adverts for the season. It worked last year, when the prospect of a new Star Wars lit the world on fire, aided by the fact that is decidedly didn't suck. Disney's decision to slot canon but non-saga films in between Episodes at first seemed promising, a chance to explore the universe in interesting ways. Instead of giving freedom to filmmakers to tell original stories, however, Disney has instead greenlit a young Han Solo movie and Rogue One, the story of the theft of the Death Star plans. While the former really seems like a shameless cash-in with no reason to exist other than an easy couple hundred million, Rogue One had a bit more potential, telling the story of the rebels who didn't quite have a Chosen One status to protect them. While Rogue One mostly works as entertainment and does keep a lot of the necessary Star Wars feel, its indebtedness to its predecessors and lack of focus keep it from ever really popping. For the first time in the franchise, Rogue One really feels like just another movie, something that passes two hours effectively enough but doesn't leave you wanting to explore more or spend more time in its world. Instead, it left me wishing for what it could have been.<br/><br/>There are at least three great ideas within Rogue One that could have been expanded to make their own movie, but instead get stuffed into a planet-jumping escapade. There's a movie about Rebel spies gathering intelligence, and defections from the Empire. There's a movie about extremist factions in the Rebellion, and how they interact with the more moderate yet still militant Alliance (and what extremism even means in these circumstances). And, most prominently in the last act, there's a Star Wars version of Saving Private Ryan, of Rebel soldiers on a doomed mission. The hints towards this last idea make up the best act of the movie, and there does seem to be some juice in making more movies about The Star War itself. Instead, Rogue One tries to keep the bones of a normal Saga film by having the main characters move all over the galaxy, but continually loses focus in the process.<br/><br/>Having the main characters mobile works well for the Saga films, but the central crew of Rogue One isn't developed or interesting enough to pull the same trick. For a movie with such a welcomely diverse cast (although still overwhelmingly male), the actual characters in a Rogue One are pretty bland and inseparable. Most pass without much impact, notably Diego Luna's Rebel captain, while others try to make up for it with hammy performances, notably Forest Whitaker's extremist leader Saw Guerrara. While Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso isn't quite a Chosen One in the vein of Luke, Anakin, and Rey, her familial tie to the Death Star plans makes her feel more like a plot device than a character. Although he does get some of the best lines of the film, droid K-2SO feels like a factory-approved fan favourite rather than an inspired creation, answering the question of what a more homicidal C-3P0 would look like. Riz Ahmed's presence makes up for his character's complete lack of definition, but there's no comparison of this batch to Rey, Finn, and Poe in Episode VII. Poe similarly had little definition, but the little touches the script and Oscar Isaac's performance gave him made him feel complete with relatively little screen time. Outside of K-2S0 and Donnie Yen's force-sensitive preacher, I can't say that any of the characters in Rogue One are half as memorable with twice the screen time.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I have with Rogue One, though, is how enslaved it is to A New Hope (some mild spoilers follow). As the Death Star is an obvious connection, certain characters make sense to bring back, such as Grand Moff Tarkin, Mon Mothma, and even Darth Vader. But Rogue One doesn't stop there, and bringing back the likes of the two Mos Eisley bar thugs serves only to distract from the story at hand. In order to bring back Tarkin, a CGI Peter Cushing wanders around. This might have been convincing as a hologram but is directly at the nadir of uncanny valley among flesh-and-blood actors, robbing him of his authoritative presence. Rogue One's reverence does give it some strength, reinforcing to a more convincing degree than the original saga the connections between the Death Star and the nuclear nightmare. It also nails the run-down aesthetic in the same way that The Force Awakens did (an inner-city ambush is a highlight for this). But its a necessarily lesser picture because of its indebtedness.<br/><br/>The first shot of Rogue One mirrors the first shot of A New Hope almost exactly, but with a fantastic fake-out that announces itself as reverent, but different. Unfortunately, it overloads on the former and underperforms on the latter. Whether the infamous reshoots had anything to do with it or not, Rogue One is more concerned with comforting its audience than being its own thing. That's not to say its without merit, though. Star Wars is a fantastic universe to be comforted in, and the final forty minutes of the film deliver on the promise of a story of forgotten heroes, of sacrifice and slim hope. The audience's knowledge that said hope is fulfilled by a farmboy from Tatooine is the only thing that keeps it from being completely depressing, and I could have done without the constant winks toward that. The finale sequence still stands as both exciting entertainment and a promising launchpad for future side stories in this universe."

","Well, at least we now know how THAT happened... I'm not sure what it means when all you can illicit after a film like ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" has come to its crashing, thrashing, resounding finale, is a shrug - a frown and a meekly appreciative nod of the head at how far special effects have come along, but it can't be good. Look, I don't necessarily dislike ""Star Wars""; I just came to it too late on in life to be able to adore it. But is a film which bridges the gap between the events of the first trilogy and the second of the famous filmic brand really what the die-hards wanted? If what transpires therein ""Rogue One"" was any other science-fiction war drama, would we really be all that interested?<br/><br/>It strikes me that the mind behind Star Wars, George Lucas, did neither himself nor the name of Star Wars many favours when he decided to sell it on to the Disney corporation, a brand name more synonymous with child's films, or at the very least entertainment for children. That is not to say that all of Disney's output has necessarily been made for the youngest among us, but there is something inherently childish about ""Rogue One"" - it is a film for people who like noise and colour; its nucleus of heroes battling villains (toward an outcome we already know) is strikingly simplistic. By the end, I was struck by just how uncomplicated it all was.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards' effort here is, as stated, the conduit connecting the first three episodes to the latter three - that seemingly dead filmic space between the coming of Darth Vader and the evil empire he seeks to use to command the galaxy, and the plans of a weapon of mass destruction being stolen from one of said empire's bases. I cannot say that said dead-space, never mind the events that transpired therein, especially captured my imagination having actually seen all six episodes, but I cannot speak for other people - one assumes they are not the same as those who were desperate to learn about what Hans Solo was like as a younger smuggler, or what the origin-story of Vader himself was.<br/><br/>Principally, there is a thematic in ""Rogue One"" somewhere about morality and good vs. evil. It is epitomised in two characters whom both work for Vader's Empire: Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a technician who has first developed the Death Star and then gone on to develop second thoughts, and Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic, who works with Vader and is very much in love with the idea of a WMD. Anyone who has seen Mendelsohn's work in other films, particularly his native Australian ones, will know that he is probably one of the best actors working today, but is wasted here in being asked to snarl into the camera and pull exasperated expressions. Galen should be, and I suspect probably was in an earlier draft, the film's protagonist with Krennic the principal villain. This, I would surmise, was changed at some point to encompass Felicity Jones, who plays Mikkelsen's daughter Jyn Erso, as the lead - a move which was probably supposed to have an eye on feminism or diversity or something, but actually hurts the project.<br/><br/>As ""Rogue One"" rolls on, you can see what the initial, more interesting film, might have resembled: two men working for the same organisation seeing things from different sides; both working to thwart the other and building to a climax whereby these ideas blossom into a tense finale atop a skywalk, as all-out war unfolds around them. This is not the film we are presented with, but we get something instead with enough going on to engage us - the being taken to new worlds; the thrill of a pursuit; the quirky supporting acts which bump us along the road - commendation is in order for Edwards for refusing to pepper the opening acts with differing robots; aliens and other idiosyncratic creatures for sake of selling them on the shelves of toy stores.<br/><br/>Jones, as a young girl, is hiding on her parents' farm when Krennic comes calling for her father so that he may finish the Death Star. His refusal causes a tiff, a tiff from which Jones escapes into the world of underground resistance led by the eccentric Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), whose mob is far from wholesome, and we appreciate how the film is trying to paint good in characters associated with the dark and bad in those synonymous with the alliance. Again, these ideas seem left over from a different, better, project and eventually come to nothing. Eventually, Jones takes it on to seek the Death Star's weak spot her father purposely created by way of the plans hidden in the depths of an enemy base. Tossed into the mix is a defecting Empirical fighter-pilot played by Riz Ahmed, which is an interesting idea, but we had seen this line of attack executed more efficiently the previous year with the John Boyega character in ""Force Awakens"".<br/><br/>For almost its entire runtime, ""Rogue One"" consists of hits and misses until its head-banging climax: the Death Star, when we see it, and despite knowing exactly what it's capable of, still manages to awe us when it gets going, which is good. One particular character, an ally, is a blind Chinaman whose forté is that he is good at marital arts and spouts Eastern philosophical tidbits, which is bad. Ultimately, Rogue One is an expensive diversion; a project Lucas probably wishes he himself had thought of when he had the rights to this pandemonium; an answer to that annoying question fans and whoever else like to ask pertaining to the Death Star's weak spot and how someone could be so stupid as to put it there in the first place. Well, after much thrashing about, that has now been buried. Congratulations..."

","At the same time that Disney started a new trilogy with the main saga in ""The Awakening of the Force"", it also decided to invest in parallel stories that take place in the same universe of Star Wars, and may even collide directly with some of the main stories seen in the series until today. ""Rogue One"" is part of and is the first in a new series of spin-offs produced by Walt Disney and its narrative is established between the events of ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope"", beginning thirteen years before the explosion of the first Death Star. Six years had passed since the extinction of the Order of the Jedi Knights, the disappearance of the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker, the appearance of the cruel Sith Lord Darth Vader as well as the fact that Emperor Palpatine transformed the Galactic Republic into the fearsome Galactic Empire. In a few minutes, the story moves forward and runs almost simultaneously with the events of ""A New Hope"".<br/><br/>In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) was estranged from her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), as a child, due to director Krennic's (Ben Mendelsohn) requirement that he works on building the most powerful weapon in the Empire, the Death Star. Created by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), she had to learn to survive on her own when she turned 16. As an adult, Jyn is rescued from prison by the Rebel Alliance, who wants access to a message sent by her father to Gerrera. With the promise of freedom at the end of the mission, she agrees to work alongside Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and the K-2SO robot.<br/><br/>The idea of the film was born from a detail present in the classic ""Star Wars"" of 1977: in the initial signs, it was said that the plans of the Death Star had been stolen by Rogue One, allowing the Rebel Alliance to have new hope. Who they were, none of the films released responded ... until now. Director Gareth Edwards brings many of the much loved elements of the universe created by George Lucas. We see different types of beings (many of them are created only with the intelligent use of makeup and prostheses and when there is a fusion of digital effects, they work in a transparent way), robots with their own personality that offer a certain dose of humor and the duality of good against evil encouraged by idealistic issues. ""Rogue One"" brings a heavier climate inherent to the growing threat posed by the Empire, on the eve of inaugurating its most powerful weapon, the Death Star. However, more than just appropriating revisited icons, the script is concerned with bringing new contexts.<br/><br/>Of course, watching Rogue One knowing the original trilogy allows for another layer of appreciation, but in a well-written script sign, no reference to the universe already known to fans is intrusive or in any way disrupts the narrative, something that is a real relief to the world we live in today, where scripts are practically written around references. And the best part of this observation is that Rogue One, if we stop to think, is nothing more than an immense unique reference, but that, so well-structured and developed, works independently. In addition, the Force approach in this film is also quite different from what we are used to. The plot shows the various levels of belief in this almost magical power that is able to influence that universe in different ways and how it can motivate, or not, someone on their journey.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards delivers a true war film, a mission with little chance of succeeding, with constant losses, battles on the ground and also in the stars, defeats and moral conflicts that add much more colors to those who are considered the heroes. The characters in ""Rogue One"" are excellent and assume with all the lyrics that they have already made damn moral and ethical decisions, but assume as part of who they have become and what they are willing to do in the name of a cause. There are good bows for Cassian Andor, a son of war who puts Rebel interests above all else, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), remnants of times when the Force and the Jedi were not just legends, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), the Empire's deserter looking for redemption, and even K-2SO (Alan Tudyk), the sincere reprogrammed droid. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who should unite them all, seems to be forgotten. Felicity Jones is a charismatic actress and quickly manages to overcome her character's conflicts, especially in her broken relationship with her father and how she has a chance to fulfill her greatest desire. Presenting weaknesses, the protagonist is also extremely courageous. On the other hand, Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera also brings new nuances by presenting an extremist rebel, something hitherto little explored within the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, an actor of the Whitaker level is used to put the plot in motion, only, not having a relevant role in the next acts of the plot.<br/><br/>Only two digital appearances are a little uncomfortable for the experience: Tarkin and Princess Leia. Tarkin was played by Peter Cushing in ""A New Hope"". With the death of the actor, the appraisal of Tarkin - extremely necessary so that Rogue One could be ""fitted"" in the mythology already established since the villain was the one who would destroy Alderaan - was all digitally inserted with the result falling short of the expected. The same can be said about Princess Leia, even though her face is seen for only three seconds and at the end of the projection, the moment is a shock to the viewer. And the worst thing is that, unlike Tarkin, his presence was unnecessary to the plot. Your presence from the front, I say. It was enough to have seen the heroine from the back for the whole message to be passed on.<br/><br/>There are excellent action sequences, such as the scenes on the planet Jedha, at the Imperial research facilities and especially on the planet Scarif, where the group of protagonists invades the database and obtain plans that show the vulnerability in the newly built Death Star. The work of the photographer Greig Fraser helps in his composition of the different planets that we travel through the projection. From a green planet in the prelude to a commercial warehouse crowded with people in an asteroid belt, passing through a semi-desert planet, another with rocks and torrential rains, culminating in a Caribbean paradise, we see their work completely change and adapt to the demands of narrative. General plans are contrasted with medium and American plans used to work on the threat tone and the proportion of the military power of the Empire with the small Rebel Alliance.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" does not fail to explore elements and characters well known to fans. Darth Vader's few appearances are always striking, there are several comic situations involving stormtroopers in order to give them some personality and even the Death Star appears imposing, allowing the viewer to follow the damage caused by its destructive ray from the planet itself achieved - something also unprecedented in the series, as well as the combat carried out in the midst of a paradisiacal scenario. The soundtrack, written by Michael Giacchino, wisely uses excerpts from the iconic compositions made by John Williams.<br/><br/>With more action and battle scenes than any of its seven predecessors, ""Rogue One"" serves as a prep for the events of the original 1977 film. It combines nostalgia and ingenuity to fill gaps in the canon and reveal other sides of the galaxy, with soundtrack, characters, creatures, vehicles and new, but familiar planets. While the good guys get more nuanced, the Empire's attacks become more brutal. The destruction is seen much more closely than has already been portrayed, and surprisingly it is more beautiful precisely because of this more personal view. It is not something that is happening only in a galaxy so, so distant, it is something that affects places that have just been visited, that you knew the routine and some of its inhabitants. But what makes it especially special is how it fits perfectly into the Star Wars timeline and connects events we already know by heart with others we've never considered. It makes us question how many other untold stories are in the dark corners of the galaxy far removed from George Lucas. With an electrifying ending, we see exactly how valuable a film derived from Star Wars is. He can walk on his own legs, he doesn't have to worry about leaving countless details prepared for what comes next and he can surprise the audience as it hasn't been seen in the franchise in a long time. It is a meticulously planned film for Star Wars fans, who will have the chance to vibrate with the battles fought by X-Wings and Imperial Ships, as well as connections with A New Hope. There is a clear respect for Gareth Edwards and his team to what the original trilogy represents, not only as a story, but as an ambience, in the sense of delivering something consistent with what has already been produced without sticking to a mere revisit."

","This is one off the star wars movies that doesn't contain any Jedi fighting scene. But it delivers a lot more than that. There is a crew with a certain degree of character development throughout the end. Containing another robot would seem like a ripoff of C3PO, but to be honest it is quite surprising that the movie does not try to copy anything from the previous movies. No unnecessary scenes about wannabe Jedis relying on the force. The only ones handling a lightsaber is the one and only Darth Vader.

Still, despite being just a plot device to fix a major gaping plot hole of the original trilogy, this is one of the most coherent star wars movies to date. Granted that, at this point, no one should really expect good story telling from a star wars movie! So, watch it as mindless fun, as it is meant to be. Star wars is fantasy more than science fiction after all. You'll be rewarded with interesting enough characters that you will not see ever again and with a story so unbelievable, another couple of movies will be made to fix the plot holes of this one.

This movie largely underlines the sacrifices made by the rebellion forces for a larger cause.
Chirrut is shown as an interesting character. Also interesting was the significant role was also played by K2-SO. An emotional story with breathtaking fighting scenes took is enough to take you into it. 
Finally the plan is handed over to Leia, the head of the organization fighting against dark forces. On the horrific side was the entry of Lord Vader who has turned invincible and unstoppable. It would be interesting to see how Jedi manage to restore the balance."
"valimar-88352","9","0","0","6 January 2018"," An excellent movie that is something different for Star Wars
","This is an excellent movie which breaks new ground for Star Wars, focusing for the most part on a band of unknown heroes rather than the Skywalker clan. It is suspenseful, poignant, hopeful and perfectly captures the feel of the era of the Star Wars galaxy just before ""A New Hope"". <br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>1. The Atmosphere - this is difficult to put my finger on, but something about the atmosphere of this movie is spot on for Star Wars. The director has simply done an amazing job of bringing the Star Wars universe to life, and making it authentic and believable. I suspect this has a lot to do with attention to the smallest details of the sort that the moviegoer doesn't even consciously recognize, but would have missed if they were not there. <br/><br/>2. The plot - gripping and suspenseful, it is also great fun as it answers those nagging little questions you might have from ""A New Hope"", such as why did the Empire leave a gaping flaw in the Death Star plans anyway?<br/><br/>3. The visuals - stunning as I would expect from a Star Wars film, including the final space battle which is remarkably crisp and easy to follow visually even though it is all presumably CGI.<br/><br/>4. New characters - from Jyn Erso to K-2SO, we are given enough time with them to get some sympathy for them as they face their destiny. We also are led to understand how much courage it took to be a Rebel facing off against the seemingly invincible Empire. Say what you will about the Rebels, but they all had guts. <br/><br/>5. Director Krennic - one almost feels sorry for this character. Yes, he is a slimy little weasel, but one senses that he began life as an ordinary joe and climbed the Imperial ranks through sheer merit, only to always be one step behind his competition including the icy and aristocratic Tarkin. His struggle gives us insight into the ambition and treachery that permeate the Imperial ranks. <br/><br/>6. The Death Star - a character in its own right, it was thrilling to see the original Death Star on screen again, with a powerful musical score to match. We even get to visit some of the same iconic locations from ""A New Hope"", and the awesome power and menace of the Galactic Empire has never been more clear. This is all the more so since unlike ""A New Hope"", we get to see and spend time on the planets (or parts of them) which are destroyed by this technological terror, which makes the emotional impact of the superlaser's devastation much more powerful.<br/><br/>7. CGI Tarkin - some people didn't like him but I can't understand why. This was a thrilling performance, and it was great fun to see a classic cinematic villain resurrected on the silver screen. Peter Cushing's estate of course fully approved of this, and I am sure Cushing himself would be very happy to know that his performance was so well received and remembered that fans would want to see him return to the screen in this way decades later. <br/><br/>8. Darth Vader's Castle - this is something completely new and off the charts cool! (And also leads one to wonder if Darth Vader and Sauron share the same architect...) It appears to be on Mustafar, in which case it says a lot about Vader that he would deliberately put his retreat on the same planet where he lost everything - presumably so that he can relive his rage every day, thereby strengthening his power in the dark side of the force. This leads to the next point...<br/><br/>9. Darth Vader himself - it was beyond awesome to see this legendary villain stalk the silver screen once again. Vader in this film is as he originally was, a monster feared across the galaxy. The last few minutes of the film as he faces off alone against the doomed Rebel Troopers are fantastic, and by themselves make this great film worth the price of admission. We can also all be thankful that we still have James Earl Jones with us to reprise his voice work, as there is no Darth Vader without that wonderful voice. <br/><br/>The Indifferent:<br/><br/>1. Not exactly different but mixed, was the appearance of young Princess Leia at the very end of the movie. This is meant to inspire hope, and normally would have, but sadly I happened to first watch this film in the theatre on the same day as Carrie Fisher's tragic passing. So, albeit this is a very personal comment, this final scene for me was very bittersweet and caused the film's high note at the end to fall flat. However, this obviously is in no way the film's fault, and presumably over time as the pain of her loss diminishes, future audiences will be able to watch her appearance in the final scene of the movie and feel the hope and optimism it is meant to inspire. I am quite sure Carrie Fisher would have wanted it that way.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1. Really there is nothing bad about this movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion - you don't need to see this movie to make sense of the Star Wars legendarium but that said, if you don't see it you are denying yourself a richer understanding of the Star Wars universe, not to mention two hours of great fun!"

"gavinp9","7","0","0","2 January 2018"," Solid Star Wars film - not mind-blowing, but doesn't detract from the originals
","'Rogue One' (or ""Star Wars Episode 3.5"") is the first standalone Star Wars film (excluding 2008's CGI 'The Clone Wars' film), which is both its strong point and part of it's burden. It's hard to write a review objectively, since Star Wars is one of my favourite things ever, and almost every second scene is a reference to something from the Star Wars universe, so it's hard to imagine it from a context of someone coming in not having seen anything else Star Wars. And frankly, if you haven't seen the original trilogy, you need a good hard look at your priorities in life!<br/><br/>I say this is like episode 3.5, but it's actually more like episode 3.9, with the ending leading directly into 'A New Hope'. The film centres on how the Rebel Alliance obtained the Death Star plans, that allows Luke Skywalker to blow it up. The introduction of Krennic (Mendelsohn), Galen Erso (Mikkelsen) and his daughter, Jyn (Jones) is done well, but there's not that much backstory. Basically, Galen's forced to build the Death Star, explain why there's a clear design flaw, and the rebels are sent on a frantic chase to steal the plans and get them to Princess Leia in time.<br/><br/>There's a decent cast, with Yen & Jiang probably the best (even though I'm not sure you learn their names?), Rook (Ahmed) as the Imperial defector who grows in importance, Cassian (Luna) the rebel pilot who's had to do plenty of unpleasant deeds, and the droid K-2SO (Tudyk), who steals almost every scene he's in. Saw (Whitaker), Mon Mothma (O'Reilly), Bail Organa (Smits) and the CGI Tarkin don't have that much to do. There's obviously a few cameos, with Darth Vader getting two scenes. I did like the film, but I probably wanted to like it more than I did. It tries hard, but it's hard to connect with the characters, especially as we know how it's going to end. The best bits by far are seeing the new planets, the Death Star in action, the set-design/feel of Yavin 4 and the rebel fleet, and the space battle at the end."

"leegato","7","0","0","31 December 2017"," A Poorly-Paced Heist Film with a Thrilling (And Slightly Redeeming) Third Act
","Set shortly before the events of the Star Wars Original Trilogy, Rogue One tells the iconic, yet never shown, story of how the Rebels got those Death Star plans that led to the station's destruction at the hands of them, ultimately igniting one of the most iconic story arcs in film history.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a unique example of a film where the ending was written first, and it became the filmmakers' jobs to write a solid beginning and middle to help ground and justify a conclusion that audiences would be guaranteed to love. Unfortunately, it becomes apparent that this unique obstacle was a challenge for them.<br/><br/>The first and second acts are a mess! The film establishes too many characters at once that would eventually form the core Rogue One team to initiate the Death Star heist, and, due to poor pacing, makes the characters' roles and positions in the storyline so ambiguous and convoluted that it becomes difficult to keep track who is who in the film, and who is doing what in the film's storyline. What was the pilot supposed to do? Who was he sent by again? Not enough time is dedicated to clarifying these details in this complex storyline; the lack of decent pacing leaves unanswered questions about our characters, and makes otherwise important characters appear useless to the storyline (Forrest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera, for example).<br/><br/>It's only with the third act does everything that was confusing about the first and second acts start to make sense. Having said that, this heist film seems more like a mystery given the audience has to piece together the confusing parts of the first parts to figure out how they make the last part make sense. Maybe, by this time, who cares how they got together? We just want to see the heist! <br/><br/>What I love about Rogue One is the fact that it manages to enhance the original Star Wars by providing a compelling storyline; by the end of Rogue One, you feel the sense of urgency that everyone on the Rebel ship in the beginning of Star Wars felt. The Death Stars plans matter, and it was about time we FELT why they mattered. The diverse cast accentuates the sense of ""group effort"" it took to extract the Death Star plans.<br/><br/>The use of CGI to revive certain characters was distracting and unnecessary. I couldn't tell you what happened during certain scenes because I was distracted by the thoughts I had, mostly deciding whether I was watching a film or a video game unfold on the screen. The CGI is obvious and looks like a simple computer animation; no attention to detail could fix it, in my opinion. It was better to leave certain characters as cameos rather than give them full scenes and dialogue. Definitely the most cringe-worthy part of the film.<br/><br/>For the nerds out there, I was blown away by Darth Vader's scenes in the film. Rogue One is finally the film that properly portrays how terrifying Darth Vader is as a villain; he's not just a man, he's a monster.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a film that, from the start, has a fantastic ending. How the film gets to that ending is a bumpy road filled with poor pacing and underestablished characters, but everything falls together with a prewritten conclusion, making Rogue One a decent addition to the Star Wars saga for any film fan."
"nishantravishankar","7","0","0","29 December 2017"," Rogue One
","Rogue One is a standalone chapter in the Star Wars saga. This movie takes place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and is about a rebel group called Rogue One, which steals the plans of the construction of Death Star (previously mentioned in the pre-text of A New Hope). <br/><br/>Talking of positives, this film is beautifully shot. Many scenes and visuals were breathtaking, all credits to Gareth Edwards. His direction, like his previous feature, Godzilla, is fantastic and is probably the best in all of the Star Wars saga. This film continues the use of more practical effects which started with The Force Awakens, and I highly doubt this film will age visually atleast another decade.<br/><br/>This film is unlike any other in the Star Wars saga. It darker, and isn't an ""epic"" film by any means, and I'm happy to see that they didn't try to make one, as it would make the film feel bloated.<br/><br/>Coming to the script, the dialogues aren't wooden compared to the prequel trilogy, although there are some issues with the characters. None of the characters other than Jyn Erso are given a proper back story, so it's very hard to care for the characters. The father-daughter dynamic between Jyn Erso and Galen Erso is cliched, and Forest Whitaker's character, Saw Gerrera didn't impact the story much as he is killed off too early in the film.<br/><br/>Cassian Andor's decision to join hands with Jyn Erso doesn't feel justified, and their chemistry completely fails, due to lack of screen time given for that. The side characters suffer from this as well, although the scenes are highly entertaining with them in it.<br/><br/>Darth Vader's scenes are great as usual, although I wished to have more of him in the film. Since the stakes are much lower in this film, than any other in the Star Wars saga, it makes sense to have a lesser involvement of him in this film, compared to the OT.<br/><br/>This is a pretty good start to the Star Wars spinoff saga, and I really hope they go on to make better ones.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Although I thought Rogue One was ok overall, for a spin-off, anyway, it is among my least favorite Star Wars movies largely because it is the most unnecessary. Rogue One is clearly a better movie than, say, The Phantom Menace; however, in my opinion, Rogue One has the least merit of all of the Star Wars movies due to the fact that it is the most irrelevant to the overarching Star Wars narrative. It's a movie that really didn't need to be made and one that was, ostensibly, only made to cash-in on the Star Wars brand. As flawed as the prequels are, they give the original trilogy much exposition that it, for better or worse, would not have had otherwise. This exposition is nonessential and arguably even detrimental to the original trilogy, but it is nowhere near as irrevelent as Rogue One's, which doesn't shed light on all that much, and which doesn't answer any questions that really needed to be answered. In addition, neither the story nor the characters are very engaging. I can't recall a single moment in the movie where I sympathized or identified with any of the characters, and was disinterested in both the story and the characters during the great majority of the movie. The entire movie seemed inconsequential to me, like it didn't matter whether the main characters succeeded or failed, whether they lived or died. In its defense, I think it would have been extraordinarily difficult to have made Rogue One good. As a spin-off of off and a prequel to one of the greatest movies of all time, which really didn't need a spin-off/prequel, Rogue One was almost destined to disappoint.<br/><br/>To conclude the review, I would like to clarify that I didn't dislike Rogue One. There are a few things to like about it. The CGI is amazing, for one thing, and the ending couldn't have been much better. The way it bridges the gap between Rogue One and A New Hope is perfect. That said, I still kind of wish Rogue One hadn't been made. From a business standpoint, releasing a sequel/spin-off every single year is a good move; from a business standpoint, I don't blame Disney at all; however, from an artistic standpoint, Disney's milking of the franchise and relentless marketing dilutes and cheapens the magic of Star Wars. There's frankly something concerning about the degree to which Disney is willing to capitalise on fans' seemingly insatiable appetite for new Star Wars movies. Rogue One is a stark reminder that Disney has already begun to convert Star Wars into something much like itself: a money-making machine, sleek and durable, but cold and lifeless."

","When I first heard that there would be stand alone Star Wars movies, I was skeptical. But this film left me more optimistic. Seeing a Star Wars story without having to relive the structure/character/pace of the first seven was pretty freeing, actually. It was not necessarily original (plenty of old school westerns and war movies felt similar), but it worked. And just as Winter Soldier imagined super hero tales as a spy movie, Rogue One imagined Star Wars as a classic war adventure. The characters work, the homages are well done and I was sucked in. Plus, it answered some fun questions from back in the day. I just wish we could have avoided CGId versions of actors from 40 years ago."

"ssayers-66318","9","0","0","23 December 2017"," A fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga
","I fundamentally disagree that this movie is a quick cash-grab with overloaded fan service. 
Right from the start, it is abundantly clear that this movie is extremely well directed and written, with an introduction of rich, genuine characters who all have strong plot arches. It feels like a 'star wars' movie right from the get go, with it's 'earthy' feel and focus on the everyday life of the universe's inhabitants. 
Obviously if you watch Rogue One, expecting a dramatic hero-centric Space Opera with 2.5 hours of lightsaber duels and X-Wing v TIE Fighter action you will be a little underwhelmed. This is not a Star Wars blockbuster, it is a Star Wars story - and a very good story at that. However, the battle scenes in this movie are actually really impressive and thrilling, far better than expected given that this movie draws its true strength from expertly capturing the raw essence of the Star Wars universe. To me, it does this so well that it goes above and beyond and you get a rich and exciting story that is genuinely really, really good. The characters are fantastic, all played by actors giving 10/10 performances - with exceptional credit going to Felicity Jones, Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn.<br/><br/>Finally, it is REALLY awesome to see Darth Vader back on the big screen and this movie did it justice and a half. It could have been so easy to overdo this and ruin the character forever. Instead, this movie strikes the perfect balance of really honoring the character - giving fans an amazing scene at seeing him in his role of 'the enforcer' whilst also making this relevant to the story and not going off theme."
"mohammadjyassin","9","0","0","22 December 2017"," A Gritty, Emotionally Powerful, and Dark War Movie that Perfectly Fits into the Star Wars Universe
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a unique star wars experience that gives you the original trilogy feeling. The cast was perfect in all aspects and couldn't play it out any better. The action and conflict build up extraordinarily and set up 'A New Hope' perfectly while also attaching all loose strings together. The best thing is that Rogue One shows the dark side of both sides of the war by telling us that even the Rebels have made murderous mistakes throughout their lives. Unfortunately, the film rushes to some spots quickly and doesn't spend the needed time during certain scenes, which in turn steals development from some characters, who sometimes also felt rushed and didn't develop correctly to become the 'team' we see during the final act."

The only thing I didn't like was Darth Vader's dark tower/castle (I'm nitpicking); in fact there's lots of nitpicky things I don't like about this film (maybe I'm just sick of Star Wars). Rogue One's action packed; you get your money's worth; especially the battle at the end, and the epilogue with Darth Vader kicking rebel arse.

I wanna see that old rebellious spirit shine through the characters, and mostly it does.<br/><br/>Tarkin and Leia, both brought back to life using CGI. Not at the point where it's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes realistic, but a good start, and no I didn't think it was 'disrespectful' to the actors or any of that; it's bringing the characters to life, not the real life people. I like Jyn, but there's nothing really deep or interesting about her.<br/><br/>I liked seeing C3PO, R2D2, Darth Vader again, with Vader having one of the best scenes in the franchise at the end. The new 'engaging' characters, let's talk about them. Cassian Andor, he's just a guy, nothing special about him. K-2S0, the comic relief droic, he was fun. Definitely felt something when he was killed off. Chirrut and Baze; both fine characters. They were there pretty much to remind the audience that the force exists (well that, and to sign off on the diversity quota). I liked Chirrut's belief in the force aiding him through his blindness, and his whole ""giving Jyn hope"" arc. The defected Imperial pilot Bodhi was a little interesting, definitely gives you the realisation that some, if not A LOT, of empire members aren't actually evil; most are just doing their jobs in the face of being killed. That was an interesting idea to include. Forest Whitaker as Saul Gerrera, what a joke. Does nothing, and dies like a chump. A stand out character I guess was Krennic, but by the end I got bored of him, and I knew he'd die by the end anyway. It was also nice seeing Mon Mothma again.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't love or hate this movie. I guess for the longest time fans always wondered ""who was it that got the rebellion the Death Star plans"", so here we are. It's the best Star Wars fan film to date. Could have had any characters or settings fill that mystery, and they did it well. Gareth Edwards did a fine job."

","Rogue One is an odd movie - going in, we all knew roughly what we were going to see: Rebel agents breaking into an imperial facility and successfully stealing plans for the Death Star. So there was no suspense in the outcome - we all know it, we know how the story ends. <br/><br/>The film tries to build suspense in this - will the plucky rebels succeed? - but it is a wasted effort because we as an audience know that they do. Had this been filmed before A New Hope, then I doubt myself and others would be as critical, but it comes decades later and tries to fill a hole that, honestly, didn't really need filling.<br/><br/>Then there are the characters. Oh, what a wasted opportunity they were. Aside from the droid, all are paper thin. The tragedy is that there are moments where you begin to think they're going to really flesh this motley crew out, make us care about them. ""I've been in this fight since I was six years old..."" from Cassian is a good example - they start to flesh him out and then you can practically hear the thud as they drop the subject. The same happens with Jyn, they start to develop her and drop it. <br/><br/>The end result is characters who the audience has no connection with and thus no feelings for when they die at the end. We're supposed to feel sad yet inspired by their sacrifice, but instead because the characters are so underdeveloped there is no emotional weight to the scene.<br/><br/>The story line is also rather weak - it is essentially a series of fetch quests from any generic MMO. Fetch the Imperial Pilot. Fetch Jyn's dad. Fetch the Death Star plans.<br/><br/>And finally we get to the giant, glossy black elephant in the room. Darth Vader. His action scene at the end was fantastic. Some of his other scenes however... Darth Vader telling dad jokes? Really? Ten seconds that did almost as much harm to the character as Episodes one through three.<br/><br/>Now, that seems like a lot of negativity, but the film is still enjoyable. It is well paced and tightly plotted, there is no wasted time here. You do feel the urgency of the time limit, especially in the last act. The visuals are fantastic and Scarif in particular looks stunning. The space battle is probably the best we have ever seen in a Star Wars film and showed the Rebels ingenuity; how despite being massively outgunned superior tactics allow them to defeat their foe.<br/><br/>This isn't a terrible film, it just isn't great. It's enjoyable but has some very serious flaws, many of which could have been averted simply by investing the time to make us care for these characters."

","Try and stay with me now...<br/><br/>Rogue One departed from the classic look we have all learned to expect, throughout the years, but in this case it isn't a bad thing...this is a more subdued look at what I believe real space warfare would look like...all scenes are darker, both in tempo and presentation. Even the brightest daylight scenes are physically darker...oh, there were one or two bright scenes, but they actually detracted from the overall look. The acting is slower paced than all the other movies, and only vaguely fits into the Star Wars genre...<br/><br/>This could be a stand alone movie, for none of the story really ties into the Star Wars Universe, as we would expect. Darth Vader does show up, but this time he is presented more as a Drath Veddar kind of character, heh heh...<br/><br/>All in all, I did kinda like this one, simply because it was ultimately better than The Force Awakens...try it out, you might just like it..."

","Another year, another Star Wars film. Only this time it's a spin off, a story relevant in the overall context of the Star Wars saga, but it still doesn't directly fall in line with the Skywalker stories in the episodic films. Let's first talk about what I liked:<br/><br/>First of all, I have to somewhat admire Disney and Gareth Edwards for trying to do something different. 'Rogue One' certainly does feel different from the other Star Wars films, both visually and tonally. The word 'dark' gets thrown around quite a lot nowadays, but this film certainly does have a darker edge to it in comparison to the others in the series, although the seriousness does get undercut from time to time whenever some teddy bear-like or frog- like creature appears on screen with a blaster in it's hand, but to be fair that has more to do with the inherent juvenile nature of the Star Wars universe as a whole than this film in particular. Even though there is some fan service in it, at least 'Rogue One' doesn't completely play out like nostalgia porn(like Force Awakens did at times) for viewers who only want to watch scenes that overtly rekindle their memories of childhood and their experiences of watching Star Wars.<br/><br/>Secondly, the concept of the specific story that this particular film explores is interesting. A film that shows the process by which the rebels somehow steal the Death Star plans and thereby adds a bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy, is actually a creative idea.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the action scenes in 'Rogue One' are really well executed. Gareth Edwards showed in 'Godzilla' that he has a knack of not only staging huge magnanimous action brilliantly but also making them look weirdly grounded. In 'Rogue One', Edwards skillfully juxtaposes the aerial space battles and shots of Starfighters colliding in space, with the battles being fought on the ground and the beach where the camera remains at eye level, giving the viewer a proper perspective of the chaos in motion. Gareth Edwards' visual style and flair in terms of action sequences is truly on show here.<br/><br/>Having mentioned what I liked, I'll move on to what I didn't and that's the characters. There is not a single character in the entire film that I can say I truly connected with emotionally. Whenever there is a film involving a group of individuals coming together to accomplish a mission, an argument can be made that it is difficult to give depth to each and every character. But I think an easy solution for that is to focus on one or two of them and give them depth and layers while the rest of the group gets certain individual personalities and characteristics to enrich the squad. In Seven Samurai Kurosawa focused on Mifune and Shimura's character and their interactions with the other members of the group with their own distinctive personalities made Seven Samurai have thematic depth and emotional resonance apart from the badassness of the action scenes. The two main characters of Gyn Urso and Cassian Andor are really bland and are not given any scene to add any personality to the film. Gareth Edwards found it very difficult to get good performances out of his actors in 'Godzilla'. It's pretty much the same here. Unlike the charismatic Daisy Ridley in 'Force Awakens', Felicity Jones and the rest of the cast are extremely unmemorable and nothing about them jumps out as something we can hold onto to like them. The lack of personality and the lack of attachment to the characters actually ended up diminishing the satisfaction I derived from the climactic action scenes even though they were expertly executed. The somewhat romantic entanglement that the film hints towards between Urso and Andor is extremely unearned.<br/><br/>'Rogue One' is a solid action film, it has great visuals, great action scenes and it tries to do something different with the Star Wars franchise. However the lack of any sort of character depth and emotional density taints the film's overall effect. It could have been something great, but in the end it's just good, but in a dispensable way."

"dball-61330","8","5","16","14 December 2016"," A Solid Addition to the Star Wars Universe
","I am writing this review just after seeing Rogue One at a midnight premiere in Australia.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards, the emerging director behind small indie film 'Monsters' and blockbuster 'Godzilla', has crafted something truly unique here. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, as its formal title, is a welcome addition and successful 'filler' movie which helps to connect the missing pieces between episodes three and four. It is not a perfect film, by any means, and perhaps only true Star Wars fans will appreciate it. But there is no doubt in my mind that, despite its flaws, Rogue One is a great piece of cinema. <br/><br/>What makes this Anthology movie so captivating is its gritty tone. From the opening scene, it becomes clear that Rogue One is indeed on its own here - a standalone installment. There is a unique feel to it, with due credit to Edwards' distinct visual style. The camera work is more close-up with characters, giving the film a more modern appeal, yet allowing room for fresh air - something different in what has previously been a 'traditional' Star Wars landscape. The cinematography is also stylistically divergent. Opting for more natural, hand-held (not shaky) camera movement, which is more reminiscent of a modern war film, especially in action sequences. <br/><br/>In terms of visual effects, Rogue One is spectacular. This feels like traditional Star Wars. The CGI-driven effects are bold and beautiful - superbly rendered and stunningly energetic. Use of more practical effects couldn't have hurt either, with the potential to pay an homage to the original trilogy. But for what we get and what we see - it truly is magnificent. The only personal gripe I had (pretty much inevitable) was the inclusion of CGI human characters. The CGI itself was not by any means terrible, but the slight animated feel with the facial expressions they conveyed stuck out as quite weird, once I realized which characters were digitally altered. <br/><br/>In opposition to that, the other technical aspects were pretty-much faultless. The sound effects were great, the makeup and costumes were stellar. The production design, more notably, was sublime. The sets felt big, real and inspired. Something which familiarized Rogue One with the aesthetics of authentic Star Wars. The locations were fresh and inspiring, the base camps were new and intriguing. The set design here was outstanding, further enriching the Star Wars universe we know and love. Not to mention Michael Giacchinos score, which was surprisingly vivid and lively, considering the short notice he was given to compose for the film. The music really feels inspired by the original Star Wars episodes, with sweeping orchestras driving the film forwards, detailing each scene with a brilliant sense of mood. Yet there is enough differentiation to make it its own. It sounds like Star Wars, but not quite the one we're familiar with. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Rogue One is in many ways a fitting piece in the continually-expanding Star Wars universe. It feels like both a prequel and original movie, which is what makes it so distinct, yet such a suitable addition to this fantastical saga. It bleeds perfectly into episode four, allowing an appreciation of the hard work and sacrifices the rebellion gave so that, in the near future, good can overcome evil.<br/><br/>But, as I reiterate, despite the many appealing aspects of Rogue One, it may not be for everyone. Die-hard Star Wars fans will love it, as will most likely those who are enlightened with moderate knowledge. But Rogue One is not a mindless action movie. It cannot be enjoyed that way. To appreciate it, you must be thinking while watching, listening to the dialogue so that motives in the film remain clear. <br/><br/>I recommend you go and watch Rogue One for your enjoyment and appreciation of Star Wars. Do not watch it, however, if you feel the need to switch off and chill. Rogue One is good, show it some respect. <br/><br/>8/10"

"loydwood","10","4","12","18 December 2016"," How can you not love this?
","OK, it's a Star Wars movie and as a fan since childhood I'm going to be biased right? Wrong. After all I was one of those who bitched about Force Awakens, quite a bit. However, after watching this movie I felt like I did when I first saw films like Casino Royale or Batman Begins. These were movies that you thought could only go wrong or could only disappoint those who loved these ""franchises"". But I loved the way they could take the movie to a new setting, create an escapism yet still respect the ""fans"" desire for that place they recognised - not so much a home but a story that has mirrored them for each life stage. My proof was my 13 year old left Rogue One feeling like I did when I first saw Star Wars. Good overcoming evil, how people make big sacrifices and even go to war for things they believe in. How to cope with loss? Yet this is juxtaposed with the amazing backdrops of sci-fi and space which create a sense of wonder. You know why Disney bought this and all the crap about their interference can be put to bed on this one. The action is closer to Saving Private Ryan than Jar Jar Binks juggling bombs (jeez), the set pieces are awesome, the pacing superb, the story is engaging despite fans knowing its destination and the characters are able to draw emotion almost akin to scenes when Obi Wan died - this ain't bad for a spin off!! I fail to see how true fans would be dissatisfied and even my wife who is not a fan liked it. It is not deep sci fi by Arthur C Clarke or Shakespeare and it never was. But Rogue One honours the tradition of Star Wars A New Hope and that is all one should ask for."
"bobizam65","8","4","12","16 December 2016"," The best Star Wars since the original trilogy
","Rogue One is the first of Disney's set of spin off films based in the Star Wars universe. It follows the journey of Jyn and Cassian as they attempt to steal the plans for the Death Star that was transmitted to Princess Leia in the first Star Wars film (Episode IV).<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is fairly standard, but it really sets the tone for the rest of it. It's not your usual Star Wars film, but much darker and realistic-feeling, and you can tell within minutes. While most Star Wars films don't care too much about casualties, every death in Rogue One feels significant. Oh, and the Stormtroopers have slightly better aim than usual. But it does get boring. While it tells us some crucial information, the first act of the film drags on for too long, and I found myself yawning and checking the clock at around 45 minutes in. Luckily, after that the movie really picks up the pace and becomes a lot more interesting to watch. In fact, it continuously gets better as the film progresses and that only helps to make the ending seem even better.<br/><br/>The characters in Rogue One are of great variety, each one with distinct personalities brought to life with some decent acting. It won't blow you away, but Felicity Jones (Jyn) and most of the rest of the cast did a good job showing the essence of the different characters. Sadly, there wasn't the best chemistry between characters/actors, with a lot of interactions feeling too professional. There were two that stood out from the rest though, Diego Luna (Cassian) and Alan Tudyk (K-2SO) delivered some great performances that really gave their characters an extra dimension the others lacked.<br/><br/>On the more technical side, Rogue One was very well made. The costumes for all the main characters were unique and helped me keep track of who was who. The large number of planets and moons this movie goes through all feel unique and like another world – not a set somewhere on Earth. Greig Fraser's cinematography was simply beautiful, and the way he shot scenes ensured that the audience never feels lost, even in complex scenes with many things going on in frame. As usual, ILM brought some impressive VFX that never called attention to itself, tying itself in with the rest of the visuals seamlessly and also feeling real – no mean feat considering the audience knows the entire universe is fake. Rogue One also features some of the best action of any Star Wars film, with nail biting sequences that work really well with the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Sadly not everything is great. In addition to the boring start to the film, the music isn't great. It's decent, but not what you usually expect from someone as talented as Michael Giacchino. This can largely be blamed on the re-shoots, which meant Alexandre Desplat (who was originally asked to compose) had timing issues and Giacchino was brought in. While it sounds nice enough, it's not anywhere near as amazing as John Williams' original score.<br/><br/>Something that requires it's own mention is Darth Vader. Despite his very short screen time, you can instantly feel his presence in every scene he is in. Every time he is on screen, his imposing control over everyone is felt, and when he fights you can see he is a force to be reckoned with (mind the pun). He feels like the powerful Sith Lord he is, not some weak evil wannabe (ahem, Kylo Ren). In short, he is the best Vader in any Star Wars film to date.<br/><br/>Overall though, it's tough to find too many faults in Rogue One. The largest flaw was the utterly boring start to the movie. Apart from that, the great cinematography, VFX, action, a brilliant Darth Vader, interesting story and some decent acting add up to what is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy came out all those years ago. Gareth Edward seems to know what he's doing.<br/><br/>8.4/10<br/><br/>NOTE: This is a lot darker (and sadder) than other Star Wars films. Take care with kids."
"Theo Robertson","7","7","26","25 December 2016"," Perhaps A Little Too Much Spectacle
","It's difficult to look back at STAR WARS and view it critically . It's a film we've all grown up with so what anyone says here doesn't matter in the slightest . People will flock to the cinema to watch it on their millions and if nothing else it might just erase the cynical memories of the trilogy we got at the turn of the century <br/><br/>Truth be told I'm indifferent to the franchise . I felt bitter disappointment in seeing the original but with THE FORCE AWAKENS the mainstream view was that the franchise just got good again . The word from the neutrals in that trying to get to basics TFA was a carbon copy of A NEW HOPE so I decided to give it a miss <br/><br/>I don't know if this has impaired my enjoyment of ROGUE ONE but it did seem fairly self contained . The Imperial Empire develops a new planet destroyer ray gun and the only thing stopping its use is that the engineer who built it is now in hiding . If nothing else it does allow a cameo from Mads Mikkleson , one of cinema's most underrated actors over the last decade and just before the title comes up we see Forest Whitaker <br/><br/>This gave me hope we'd be seeing a character driven film with some intense performances but then we get the curse of event movie making and the studio second guesses what the public wants and gives it to them in bucketloads and is usually the case it's high spectacle . Lots of explosions , space fights and other high powered noisy set-pieces . Too much so for my liking but to be fair I did feel I was still watching a big budget movie rather than a video game which happens too far often when I'm watching Hollywood blockbusters but I still hoped for a bit more story amongst the carnage and high body count <br/><br/>One thing I would have liked to have seen developed more is the throwaway line about a rebel who broke away from the alliance and is fighting his own war against The Imperial Empire . A maverick rebel using his own army to fight against the enemy ? A sort of good guy version of a fighter in the Al Nusra Front splitting from former allies and building a Jedi Knight version of ISIS theocracy ? Just think of all the potential that type of story could come up with but it's a franchise event movie involving STAR WARS . Complex political intrigue and internal moral dilemmas will just have to wait for a different film series"

They wanted to make a statement in the great big Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>I love the way they accomplished their goal, I love the nods, and winks, and allusions, I love the way this film explains the plot holes in the original, 40-year-old Star Wars Episode IV movie. I love the way this film does not bend the knee. It tells a story, it tells *the* story. The story is of hope, and courage, and determination. The story is of continuation.

","Boring.<br/><br/>Routine spin off to continue taking money from the saga at the expense of the patience and good faith of the spectators.<br/><br/>Rogue One can only be described as a soulless and spiritless film that is limited to repeating the same formula applied to all Sar wars films, the same schemes the same development, I operate with a single paste, the characters are heroes than ever.<br/><br/>The protagonist is the but of all the Star Wars movies, she has no charisma. nor anything that makes her interesting is a cold, stereotyped, typical character.<br/><br/>And the rest of the cast? Without comment, a blind Kung Fu teacher in this saga? It doesn't even stick with a tail. What's up, that the screenwriter is a fan of the old films of Jackie Chan and Jet Li?<br/><br/>The only change is that this movie is conceived more like a war story, focusing on the battle between the Imperials and the Republicans, but it is not even there that it has emotion, the Imperials shoot three hundred shots and do not hit a rebel, the rebels hit four shots and they take them all down, that's all the thrill of battle the movie sells. Depressing.<br/><br/>To all this this is very long and it becomes infinite, because they have to be so long ?, If there is not even an argument or what is happening or what happens, you do not know anything you only see ships, shooting jokes without No grace and pointless follies. Can't the same be done in an hour and a half? Surely the movie would have won a lot with that duration.<br/><br/>And Diego Luna, what are you doing here?"

"brianrorr","5","3","8","28 February 2017"," Not a Star Wars movie and just bad
","Rogue One isn't a terrible movie, but in my opinion it is bad. It has very few characters which I cared to learn more about after their initial introduction and in the end, I cared about nobody's death. The pace of the movie was far too quick with an extremely saturated cast of characters. The first 15 minutes I literally laughed out loud as a new planet was introduced on screen every 3-4 minutes with a name I was not interested to remember as it was a place I had no connection to, and never would. I didn't know anybody's name or care at the end because so much was thrown at me in 2 hours and I didn't love any of the humor/backstory of the cast. Jyn was relatable as her parents protected her from the Empire and her mother died to save her. However, I thought her motivations for the rest of the movie as an adult were strange and unexplained other than wanting to find her father for answers. The BEST part about the movie was the spaceship battle in the third act of the movie; I was in awe at how good the action looked and sounded. I thoroughly enjoyed that....then got cut back to characters dying on a beach like Saving Private Ryan.....why? This is not Star Wars, this is terrible.<br/><br/>The most confusing character was Saw Gerrera (I had to Google that name, I didn't hear or remember the name even while I was watching the movie). What was his relationship to Jyn and why should I care about his movement or town or? What? Why is he weezing and Forest Whitaker talking like that? It makes the expositional dialogue even harder to understand as the movie in introducing characters are such a rapid rate, I can't remember anybody's story or why the main characters are moving from one planet quickly to another. This was suuuuch a bad character, I shed no tears as he died and I quickly realized ""Ah, everybody is going to die at the end, aren't they. Makes no difference to me.""<br/><br/>And here comes, in my opinion, the worst aspect of the movie, in that I feel the movie never had to be made. The whole premise, from how I observed the story, was to explain the engineered weakness of the Death Star by Jyn's father so that Luke and the Resistance have an explanation how they could topple the Empire in A New Hope. Who cares? Because I definitely did not. You are supposed to suspend your disbelief when watching fictional movies and the thermal exhaust port on the Death Star was OBVIOUSLY a deus ex machina for Luke to begin his path towards power and learning to become a Jedi, for Anakin to meet his son and ultimately restore balance to the Force by killing the Emperor. Are we next going to explain why Death Star II had a flight path from the outside to the core, so that Lando could destroy that Death Star now? I don't think so, because the audience bought that such a movie trope needed to be there so that the story could keep moving.<br/><br/>Please do not make more movies like this, with characters rapidly being introduced then dying with little emotional weight, with planets rapidly being cast on screen then forgotten as they are not visited for very long, and please forget about explaining small details in the Star Wars story and instead create new intellectual scenes in the Star Wars galaxy. Create new characters separate from the main conflict or a long ago back story to the Jedi/Sith conflict. People care about Anakin Skywalker and his story, about the Force! Not side stories with ultimately little meaning. Just my thoughts. This movie gets a 5/10, maybe even lower if I would see it again. Oh and I liked the Tarkin CGI and thought he was a good character, however I thought the Leia CGI was unnecessary and almost symbolism for how not needed this film was in the Star Wars saga."

"michaelraine","Null","3","8","3 January 2017"," Better than The Force Awakens
","Rogue One had a lot to live up to and, for the most part, it exceeded expectations and landed among the best films in the Star Wars franchise. Whilst The Force Awakens received criticism for it unoriginal plot, Rogue One excels in presenting one of the defining moments in the saga with a plot that does not just rely on what we as an audience have already seen before. In particular, the action, which is some of the best ever seen in this series of films, is a spectacle to behold and makes you really feel like the fighting is real. It really is something to see on the big screen. Honestly, if the next lot of Star Wars films are this good then the franchise is good and set for a long period in the public's consciousness. <br/><br/>There are of course bad parts to the film, as there are with any movie. The first act drags at an unbearably slow pace and most of the characters aren't particularly interesting. But the bad things are without a doubt overshadowed by the good and it would be wrong to say that this film doesn't rank close to the original trilogy, if not quite as groundbreaking and memorable. <br/><br/>With regards to Gareth Edward's directing, his action scenes are phenomenal but the realistic approach he takes to filming some of the scenes can be distracting, though I guess this can be excused as it does help make the film more intense. Also a lot of his shots, especially on one planet, seem to be drawing on images from war in the real world, which can be distracting but still does lend itself to the style he was using.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe and uses its war setting to create some of the best action in the franchise to date."
"nejclozarslo","9","3","8","2 January 2017"," A reason there is WAR in Star WARs
","The most important thing to note about Rogue One is that this is not a Star Wars episode, nor it should be. Rogue One is more than anything a war movie in a Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Knowing Gareth Edwards is directing it, one thing was certain: this movie will look damm good. Well that would be a massive understatement. Rogue One is a perfection in visual effects, cinematography, sound design, action directing, really technically this movie is gold standard and something that every other film period should aspire to match, despite this being a near impossibility. The only exception is one of the two motion capture characters, which is only in a shot for like 4 seconds and that's it. Gareth Edwards is to be praised for his work on this film. This is easily one of the best directed Star Wars and 2016 movies.<br/><br/>This film does such a magnificent job at just not letting you feel sit comfortably as there is a war raging across the galaxy. It's unlike anything we have ever seen in other Star Wars movies. Our main protagonist Jyn Erso, which by the way was portrayed beautifully by Felicity Jones, is not some who am I, adventure hungry heroine like Anakin, Luke or Rey, nor are the rest of the characters of which we don't learn much, since they aren't meant to look as heroes but as normal people who got caught in this messy situation.<br/><br/>Another praise-worthy aspect of this movie is that Rebellion is also forced into morally ambiguous actions in this desperate time. This is perfectly portrayed through a character of Cassian Andor played terrifically by Diego Luna. On the Empire side of things, Ben Mendelsohn did such an excellent job playing Director Krennic, you honestly feel for him.<br/><br/>Speaking of characterization, the one issue I have with this film is that after the opening sequence the film does drag a bit for the rest of the first act, though it does have moments of brilliance in the mix. After that the movie is pretty much perfect. It also addresses and forever fixes a problem Star Wars fans had for decades and turned it into an in-joke in a very satisfying manor.<br/><br/>The second act is great, but the third act... This is where you are in for some of the best action Star Wars has to offer. And once again it's not a cool lightsaber fight or anything like that, it's a dirty realistic war sequence, where the stakes are high, if they don't succeed it's game over. It's definitely on the closer to the R rating side of PG13.<br/><br/>Oh, and yeah, Darth Vader isn't a whole lot in the movie, but towards the end he has the greatest Star Wars moment since, ""I am your father"". More memorable than anything in Return of the Jedi, prequels or The Force Awakens (which I loved).<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is just so different, not just in comparison to Star Wars, but against the whole Hollywood norm. It sucks you in this dark and tense world where nothing is for granted, not even your life or peace and who would've thought that it's Disney to do it. The characters never asked to be heroes, their selfless actions and willingness to sacrifice everything made them that.<br/><br/>Just before I sign off, I just have to say that the chemistry between Jyn and Cassian was executed flawlessly. They remind me a lot of Cage and Rita from Edge of Tomorrow. At first they view each other as a troublemakers, but through the course of the film they both realise of the greatness in each other and it all pays of in one of the most gut- wrenching finales there are.<br/><br/>And without spoiling anything, the way the film ends is great, once again very much against the Hollywood norm, but just so fitting to the rest of the movie as well as to A New Hope, which you will never see in the same light as you did before. Rogue One gives gravity to the events in that movie. Just hang in there through the first act and let your mind be blown by the end. And after the credits roll just say to yourself ""this is a Disney movie"".<br/><br/>""Rogue One, may The Force be with you."""

","I just saw this movie for the second time and was even more wowed. Such a great film for die hard Star Wars fans or fans new to the series. From great special effects to a strong plot line and well developed characters, Rogue One offers a nostalgic experience that makes you feel part of the story. Rogue One is more of a war type movie, and definitely shows a different side to the saga than the ""jedi vs sith"" stories that the rest of the series shows. The movie showed certain similarities to the Star Wars Battlefront video game, due to both of their representations of the soldiers of the saga. The movie has a different feel to it, due to its standalone participation in the series. Overall, I very much enjoyed this movie, and it is definitely one of my favorite movies in the Star Wars series, and one of my favorite movies ever."

","This is Star WARS. <br/><br/>This is the story of Jyn Erso(Felicity Jones) and a squad of rebellions led by Cassian Andor(Diego Luna) to steal the Death Star plans setting up the events of A New Hope(or rather the original Star Wars). <br/><br/>Right from the get-go there are plenty of Star Wars fan service and references in the film. It's very hard to miss them if you're invested in this universe as any other Star Wars fan. However, if you're a newbie, it may confuse you and some of the new/younger viewers. <br/><br/>At this point, it's no secret that Darth Vader is in the film. He's not in it a lot, but he scenes are quite memorable. He absolutely wrecks the rebels when he invades the Tantive V ship and it's quite frightening as he tears through a squadron of rebels with absolute ease, blocking every shot with his lightsaber and using his force powers to take them out. <br/><br/>The late Peter Cushing's iconic role of Grand Moff Tarkin returns to the big screen, as director Gareth Edwards and ILM digitally recreated the actor. One could say this is disrespectful, but is it truly? Tupac was a hologram at a coachella concert, and there are plenty of celebrity impersonators, impersonating other dead celebrities. Paul Walker who recently passed in a car accident three years ago was also digitally recreated to send off his character in Furious 7. Marlon Brando's Jor-El was brought back for Superman Returns. The actor's estate more than likely provided the green light so they certainly wouldn't have a problem with it. The point is, controversial or not, Cushing himself and his character has been immortalized on film. I don't have a problem with this as long as it's not overused and only used to serve the film. <br/><br/>Princess Leia returns to the screen as she is completely CGI in the film. I will admit the digitally rendered faces were distracting in certain scenes, especially Tarkin's but I will say that the de-aging technology is just one step away from being perfect. <br/><br/>The pacing is slow. It did take a lot of time setting things up and getting things in place for the final act to unfold, but when it unfolds, that's where it all pays off. While the references are neat, it's all the film relies on to keep the slow set up entertaining. I also did find Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera to be a bit over the top. He doesn't have much screen time at all to be honest so his exit didn't mean much to the film. For those who watch the Star Wars Clone Wars and Rebels animated series might get a kick out of his character, but for those who don't might not even care. <br/><br/>The main spotlights in the film are Felicity Jones and Diego Luna. With these particular Star Wars characters, they have a lot of emotional baggage. The weight on their shoulders are felt through and through as they've made choices that they're not proud of, particularly Cassian who's been in the fight since he was young and every hard decision he's made, he made for the rebellion. The absence of Jedi in the film also gave Star Wars a new outlook. It proves that a Star Wars movie without the Jedi can be made and be made well. <br/><br/>Other supporting cast members Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang, Riz Ahmed, and Mads Mikkelsen do their job competently. Ben Mendelsohn does an excellent job portraying Orson Krennic, an ruthless and ambitious Imperial Director, responsible for apprehending Mikkelsen's character Galen Erso the father of Jyn, forcing him to create the Death Star. Alan Tudyk's blunt and unnecessarily honest droid, K-2SO brings a lot of humor into the mix, providing the right amount of levity in a bleak film. <br/><br/>Not all of these characters have a lot of screen time, but Gareth Edwards uses them effectively to serve the plot, making you care about them as the story unfolds. <br/><br/>With that being said, if you're a Star Wars fan, you saw their deaths coming, but because the script treats them as real characters for the most part, instead of fodder it is upsetting to see them die. You truly feel what's at stake. I applaud Kathleen Kennedy, Gareth Edwards, and Disney, they were not afraid to pull any punches. This is a war film, and in war, not everyone lives. Sacrifices have to be made.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a more ""grown up"" Star Wars feature. It's darker, more dry on humor, more violent, and morally ambiguous. But most importantly, it a breath of fresh air because of it. It isn't without it's issues, but its a new outlook and a new feel to the Star Wars franchise. I look forward to more spin-offs. <br/><br/>8.3/10"

","""Star Wars"" (1977) had three winsome characters. A farm boy who wanted to go do something exciting, but whose sense of duty held him back. A smuggler who struggled to hide his heart of gold even from himself (but who shot first, MISTER LUCAS!). And a Princess leading a rebellion against an evil empire of faceless bureaucrats that has, probably by high taxes and ""reinvestment"" schemes, created a weapon as large as a moon with the ability to destroying an entire planet. Both the guys are intensely likable with 1970s ""CHiPs"" looks.Both are reluctant travelers who ultimately make the choice of their own free will but who originally are forced out of their lifestyles, one on the run from the Empire, the other from an enormous slug. ""Star Wars"" also had the sense to feature one of film's greatest actors (Alec Guinness) and one who is iconic (Peter Cushing).<br/><br/>But Lucas' original world is simply good vs. evil. While the Empire contains evil (the dark side of ""the force"") it certainly had functionaries just doing their job to keep their family in food and shoe leather.<br/><br/>""Star Wars"" led to two increasingly complex flicks (""Empire"" and ""Jedi"") that were fun even in their darker moments.<br/><br/>Then came three boring sequel/prequels, and ""the force"" turned out to be a genetic thing making the Jedi a bunch of elitist, self-righteous prigs. And we learned George Lucas forgot how to tell a story and was really more interesting with tinkering with F/X. But at long last, the ""SW"" franchise was farmed out to people who can spin a tale.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""Rogue One"" lacks the charm of the original, though it inhabits the same time-frame. Though in the galaxy time is meaningless (do ""Star Wars"" and ""Rogue One"" occur over weeks, or all in one day?) <br/><br/>The Good: We're all weary of Lucas' ""theme planets"" and ""Rogue's"" more complex worlds are conveniently labeled as the characters arrive. The F/X are, naturally, superb. The areal shots are wonderful; I have no fear of heights but I had my stomach knocked out of me a few times. And through F/X, we are able to resurrect the dead Peter Cushing. I'm a jaded moving watcher but when Grand Moff Tarken turned around I said, WOW!<br/><br/>The main robot isn't as cutesy as C3P0 and R2D2 but he has some of the best lines. Not that we attend a Star Wars movie for intelligent dialogue. And a good thing. Alec Guinness hated the nonsense he spouted and for good reason. No one in the galaxy talks any sense. They say just enough to explain what the action scenes are all about.<br/><br/>The Questionable: If the original ""Star Wars"" heroes looked a little too clean and blow-dried, these new ones are forever grimy. Say, don't expensive spaceships have wash rooms? And they are also darker people. The only winsome thing is Felicity Jones' front teeth. We've gone from Lucas' ridiculous ""good v. bad"" to such a silly sense of moral relativism one wonders whether the Empire is really any worse than the dingy crew of malcontents who look like they joined a rebellion not out of sense of duty (as with Luke) or in a philosophical difference with the Empire, but just so they could blow up things.<br/><br/>The Best: ""Star Wars"" was undeniably the most influential movie ever made, but it had lots of plot holes. ""Rogue One"" cleverly caulks those holes (how come a bunch of Empire smarties built a Death Star that could be blown up so easily by a bunch of barnstorming yahoos?).<br/><br/>The Worst: ""Rogue One"" is the best ""SW"" movie after ""Jedi"" but one has the feeling it exists solely as a hole-patching device. Unlike Luke, Han, Leia, Obi-Wan, etc. one never gets the sense that these characters ever existed before ""Rogue One"" nor do they have dreams and desires outside it. They never feel like a cohesive unit. It's like the writers, rather than thinking up who could best carry the story, said, ""Hey, let's throw in a--!"" rather than fretting about whether a ""--"" really had any business clumping in on this mission (if it is a mission).<br/><br/>The Worst: I really liked ""Rogue One."" But while the galactic worlds are more complex, its inhabitants were not. In ""Star Wars"" Lucas threw in a cantina full of bizarre creatures. Lots of them looked like humans in cheap masks, but he made an effort. In ""RO"" nearly all the rebels are white guys with English accents. I'm not one for diversity just for the sake of it, but COME ON! You can do so much with digital effects these days but you give us a few alien faces? At least, the ""Rogue One"" crew has a variety of accents. They're like a rebellion in the Rebellion.<br/><br/>BTW, how come everybody in that galaxy long ago and far away has such a good grip? <br/><br/>There's no swearing, no nudity, no implied sex. There's not even an incestuous kiss as between Luke and Leia. The main female and male get close but it feels Platonic. Yet I would not take a child to this movie because of the VIOLENCE. And while ""Star Wars"" still maintains a feeling of freshness and excitement, ""Rogue One"" has an autumnal feel, as if it's the end of something rather than, as it turns out, only a beginning. Perhaps this reflects the modern cynicism of a society with too much time on their hands and not enough real problems, so they have to invent them. Yet ""Rogue One"" does present noble but almost lost ideals of duty; of identifying, fighting and sacrificing for something bigger than one's self. In that way, it does reflect the values of the original ""Star Wars"" though from a different angle. A good movie, but not for kids."
"fred-m-stabs","8","3","8","23 December 2016"," A war movie set in the Star Wars universe
","Rogue One is a quintessential war movie, in sharp contrast to the dumbed-down Disney theme park ride that was 'The Force Awakens'. It has more in common with 'The Dirty Dozen' than the previous 4 Star Wars movies, which were much more light and kid oriented. It wasn't heavy or depressing, and it had many of the themes and action you would expect in a Star Wars movie, but it did have a noticeably different tone. TFA was exactly what you would expected from Disney, but RO really surprised me. The movie may have its flaws but it is at least one of the best 2 or 3 Star Wars movies made so far.<br/><br/>The flaws: The pacing started out way too fast, rushing past points and characters almost as fast as TFA did, but then slowed down to a crawl that required patience (for a Star Wars type movie) to stay interested. Some of the characters were simple and 2-dimensional, there were generous helpings of clichés, and some of the dramatic scenes came across as forced and unconvincing. Keeping in mind that this is Star Wars though, it should be more than what you would expect.<br/><br/>The strengths: The special effects were absolutely amazing and realistic looking. Furthermore, in sharp contrast (again) to TFA it was mostly completely original in terms of spaceships , characters and story. Seeing the familiar Star Wars elements in completely new settings was by itself worth the cost of the ticket. Despite the darker tone and less than feel good ending, it was still a fun movie to watch. You don't have to be a serious SW fan to like this movie, but if you are then there are tons of SW lore references. If you only like mindless, nonsensical happy-sappy ending movies then skip it, otherwise I highly recommend seeing this movie."

","Being given the chance to take a punt at bridging episodes 3 and 4, and adding depth to a story already near perfect, Gareth Edwards has managed to bring yet more to the Star Wars universe beyond the dense annals of non-cinematic extended lore - and in Rogue One, he has done this in a classy, tasteful and visually astounding way.<br/><br/>Rogue One is often referred to as episode 3.5, a medial buffer to transition between Episode 3: 'Revenge of the Sith' (2005) and Episode 4: 'A New Hope' (1977), a time in Star Wars chronology when the Empire seems indomitable, and the last untapped vestiges of the universe were being systematically quashed. Edwards puts a face to all this angst in this film, whereas the dreamier George Lucas went for a more gentle articulation in his titles, giving all (or most) of the emotional weight to the affairs of Jedi and such, so to humanise the Rebellion and the Empire as done in Rogue One is to open up a whole new sentiment to what Star Wars means as a work of art that is still under construction after all these years. <br/><br/>Edwards also thrived off of the striking sense of desperation, and interwove it not only with the Rebels' theme of hope to repel the Empire; but also to tackle the internal difficulties made by their own snagging bureaucracy, it is a tale told that Edwards wants to make seem like a forgotten, unappreciated chapter, that, in context to the other films, edifies and gives credit to the feats of this leg of the Rebellion. It adds depth to later films, and foresight to earlier ones, where budgets and storyboards perhaps meant deepening the Rebellion's meaningfulness was never properly grasped. <br/><br/>On the tasking constraints of film making, this film was not exempt, the film followed the formulaic pattern of 'reach objective, get captured, escape, rinse and repeat' but did so at least in an interesting manner. What helped Edwards was the richly imaginative universe that his film was set in, and the story already established up to that point. The possibilities were truly endless; so much so, that the tendency for the film to introduce so many new planets and characters was quite inundating. Luckily, this did not feel rushed as Episode 7 did in places, and each character did play a part.<br/><br/>Edwards' greatest triumph in Rogue One, perhaps, was to show how the Death Star's later downfall in Episode 4 was not something easily achieved by the Rebels, it took blood, sweat and tears and this film was not afraid to show all of those things. The serenity of the Jedi was nearly forgotten in this cataclysmic war film, and I think it only makes us appreciate the Jedi all the more after the storm is over. <br/><br/>Not perfect, but a triumph in Star Wars cinematography, and to an extent, storytelling.<br/><br/>7/10"
"jakwieci","8","3","8","22 December 2016"," A confusing start builds to a very entertaining finale.
","Movie Review: Rogue One – A Star Wars Story<br/><br/>Disclaimer: for anything bad I'm about to write about this movie, it is easily outweighed by the good. It's fun, it fits where it belongs, and I'm going to see it again and again.<br/><br/>I appreciate the sentiment for 'prequel' stories. Any given story has to take place after previous events (unless they make a Genesis movie), so there's always questions about these previous events. The problem is, a story that answers those questions will necessarily create new questions about events further in the past. Whatever satisfaction is provided by the prequel, is overshadowed by the appetite it creates. In other words, I'm not a fan of prequels. George Lucas himself noted that it was important Star Wars start at 'the good bit', and skip what came before.<br/><br/>Rogue One does fall into this prequel trap. We know how the story ends, so it's simply a matter of connecting the dots so we end up where everyone is expecting us to.<br/><br/>The 'but' is Rogue One does something most prequels don't: it gives us new characters, with unknown fates. We know the story, but we don't know anyone's part in it. There is a story here to discover, and just like reading a map might tell you what to expect, it's still not the same as actually taking the journey.<br/><br/>The most unfortunate aspect of the film is the beginning. There is a tremendous effort given to ensuring we don't confuse this for a 'normal' Star Wars movie. It's not an epic conflict of good and evil, but rather we have some sort of grey area, where it's not entirely clear who are the 'good guys' and who are the 'bad guys'. This is where a surprising number of unanswered questions are brought up. Why is Jyn in prison, then on a prison transport? Who is Saw Gerrara, and why does he matter? What exactly did Bodhi do to get in trouble? Who is this guy in white who is in charge of security yet laughably bad at it, and somehow in charge of the Death Star, even though we saw Tarkin in charge of it in both Episodes III and IV?<br/><br/>As luck would have it, once all these awkward questions are posed they can be safely ignored as the movie gets into gear, and we finally see who is good, who is evil. It IS a real Star Wars movie, there's action, there's comedy, there's camaraderie, there's unlikely allies, there's Storm Troopers who are awful shots (I suppose the guy in white who is laughably bad at security was responsible for their training?)<br/><br/>As the story moves along, we are treated to the best part of a prequel: the fan service. Guy Henry does an amazing impersonation of Peter Cushing as Governor Tarkin. Other characters from Episode IV pop up, usually as a little comic relief, and a few are inserted using original footage from the filming of Episode IV which provides a little authenticity. None felt seriously out of place.<br/><br/>Naturally the two biggest elements of fan service were: 1) the Death Star. We get a better understanding of how it came together, how it works, and how it's seen by everyone. It could have been overplayed or underplayed, but I think it fell right into the perfect zone. 2) Darth Vader. We do get to see what he does in his spare time, plus we get to see how he gets where he's going in Episode IV. We also get to see him kick ass like a good sith lord should.<br/><br/>As the movie moves ahead, the tension ratchets up. We know the rebels are getting the Death Star plans, but we don't know which rebels, or how they'll do it. Is it going to be subterfuge? All out war? The Force? There are many rebels, and they make it clear that it is a rebel ALLIANCE, and like any alliance, there are different points of view trying to achieve a common goal with their own means and ends.<br/><br/>The movie does end in a climactic battle as good as any battle we've seen in any Star Wars movie (and quite honestly, better than most). Again, it's peppered with fan service (so THAT'S why there's no 'Blue Squadron' attacking the Death Star in Episode IV), but it's just a masterful piece of war direction that provides a big picture with consequences, and the small picture character moments that -remind us why we care what happens.<br/><br/>The music is great, Giacchino has large shoes to fill, but the music does fit in with John Williams' previous work while still having its own voice. Yes, he uses Williams' themes for continuity, but it would be jarring if he didn't. The original music is great and still 'Star Warsy'.<br/><br/>As befits a Star Wars movie, the special effects continue to serve the story, giving us an alien world that feels like it exists, and we could visit, and live in. Designs are clearly inspired from previous Star Wars movies, while again featuring their own unique aspects.<br/><br/>Acting hasn't been the defining feature of Star Wars. Certainly there are certain cast members and scenes that are truly fantastic, but as a whole, the acting in Star Wars isn't the main attraction. That tradition continues here. Some scenes work great, others are hamstrung with awkward dialogue, or elements that are forced instead of earned.<br/><br/>So many modern movies have a great setup, and don't stick the landing. Rogue One may stumble out of the blocks, but by the end, it's running smoothly at maximum. For anything bad about this movie, it is easily outweighed by the good. It's fun, it fits where it belongs, and I'm going to see it again and again.<br/><br/>May the Force Be With You."
"cschultz-2","7","3","8","21 December 2016"," Not Bad, Actually
","In the Star Wars lexicon, the new release Rogue One—not designated with an episode number but subtitled A Star Wars Story—inhabits a time roughly thirty years after the conclusion of 2005's Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and just prior to the beginning of the original 1977 picture: <br/><br/>In Rogue One, the oppressive Galactic Empire has designs to build a massive new spaceship called the Death Star, a craft already familiar to fans of the original picture. The Death Star will contain a weapon capable of reducing an entire planet to rubble with one single shot. But the primary architect of the Death Star escapes from the Empire's service before the weapon is functional.<br/><br/>Sometime later, the Empire tracks down the architect and conscripts him to return and complete the weapon, leaving behind his young daughter. Years later the daughter, now an adult, is recruited by the anti-Empire Rebel Alliance to locate and enlist the services of the father in destroying the weapon, toppling the Empire, and restoring peace and liberty to the galaxy.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a fairly impressive movie in the fantasy genre, not as good as the best entries in the Star Wars series but better than many. Actress Felicity Jones is cast in what is nominally the leading role, as Jyn Erso, the adult daughter of the Death Star architect.<br/><br/>Jones' Jyn Erso is consistent with the Star Wars tradition of strong female leads, from Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia in the original pictures to Daisy Ridley's Rey in last year's The Force Awakens. Erso is seemingly a little more indifferent to the niceties of good versus evil, but the character's carefully-maintained ambivalence seems to inspire the audience to desire even more her eventual conversion.<br/><br/>But Jones is only the headliner in a strong ensemble cast which includes Mads Mikkelsen from Casino Royale and television's Hannibal, the always-engaging Forest Whitaker, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, and Genevieve O'Reilly contributing memorable characterizations. Mexican actor Diego Luna is effectively cast in the swashbuckling role of Cassian Andor, a resourceful pilot working for the Rebel Alliance.<br/><br/>There's very much a sense of unification about Rogue One, with appearances by a variety of characters from both previous trilogies. At least one character from the original 1977 picture reprises his role posthumously, via the not-quite-persuasive magic of computer animation.<br/><br/>Certain of John Williams' familiar musical themes are repeated from the previous seven pictures, although the actual music score for the picture is credited to composer Michael Giacchino. Giacchino, who also scored the recent Star Trek pictures and Guardians of the Galaxy, already seems to have been so influenced by Williams that his name in the closing credits instead of Williams' is a mild surprise.<br/><br/>Rogue One director Gareth Edwards has proved his mettle for putting legendary film characters through their paces with his work on 2014's Godzilla remake. And certainly Edwards' sure hand keeps Rogue One moving along at a pace brisk enough to almost disguise some of the more preposterous turns in the film's script, credited to Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroyalthough twenty minutes could've easily been trimmed from the picture to bring the running time to under two hours.<br/><br/>In October of 2012, seven years after the release of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith—which Star Wars creator George Lucas assured us would be the last installment in the franchise—the entertainment world was stunned to learn that a deal had been finalized for Lucas to sell his Lucasfilm Ltd. corporation to the Walt Disney Company. As part of that transaction, the Disney organization also acquired ownership of the Star Wars series of films, released originally by the 20th Century-Fox film studio.<br/><br/>Simultaneous to the Lucasfilm acquisition, the Disney Company announced the production of new entries in the Star Wars series, beginning in 2015 with Episode VII: The Force Awakens. The new picture would reunite most of the cast of the original three pictures, and Lucas' services would be retained by Disney as a creative consultant.<br/><br/>The first clue that Rogue One is not a typical entry in the Star Wars canon comes in the picture's opening seconds. Although the Lucasfilm Ltd. logo appears prior to the opening shot, as well as the familiar legend ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" there is no opening stab of John Williams' iconic theme music, no words crawling from the bottom of the screen to the top explaining the story so far.<br/><br/>But the differences between Rogue One and the earlier Star Wars pictures are not limited to the modified opening moments. Since 1977 the pictures in the series have grown progressively more somber, developing a mythology almost as complex and challenging as Tolkien's Rings novels. Last year's The Force Awakens seemingly only barely avoided an R rating, with a My Lai-style massacre at the beginning of the picture and the violent death about halfway through of one of the saga's most enduring and beloved characters.<br/><br/>Parents conducting young children to a Rogue One screening should be warned: Even the darkness of vision revealed in The Force Awakens doesn't completely prepare the viewer for the unflinching loss of life and disturbing images in the picture. Rogue One works hard to earn its PG-13 rating: Characters we grow to like are killed on screen, and the graphically-depicted results of the Death Star weapon are more reminiscent of a nuclear holocaust than the bloodless big bang we remember from the original picture. <br/><br/>Those who professed wonder or surprise at the 2012 sale of Star Wars to Disney shouldn't have been—George Lucas always did profess admiration for that studio's entertainment heritage.<br/><br/>More perplexing at the present time, and especially while viewing Rogue One, is the knowledge that when the Star Wars saga began to explore its darkest and most disturbing themes and images, it did so under the Walt Disney flag of wholesome family entertainment."

","In a galaxy far, far away...<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Where to start... Honestly, when I bought the movie ticket, I went in not wanting to expect too much. I even considered not watching this at all. (Please don't throw pitchforks at me.) It was not part of the episodic formula of the Star Wars movies, and was clearly a side story, a companion to Episodes III and IV.<br/><br/>So far, the reviews have been rather mixed. Mostly positive, but there are of course those who are wondering, ""Am I the only one who thought that was overrated? Seriously?""<br/><br/>The characters were never meant to be too memorable. It's easy to see why lack of character development can be seen as a major flaw of this movie, because at the start, the build-up really seems like it is getting to nowhere. Personally, though, I saw enough to actually care for them. I saw enough of them to feel the anguish when they reached their inevitable doom. It was what made the last few minutes of the film so worth it. It went together so nicely with ""A New Hope"", seeing the path these rebels took to kindle hope in the hearts of the Rebellion once more. If it were not for the things these characters had to go through, nothing from Episode IV would have been possible. The ending of this movie was the most fitting conclusion they could have managed, I think. The sheer, emotional impact it gives is powerful. It is definitely a better experience seeing this after having seen Episode IV.<br/><br/>It really depends on what you wanted to see from this film. It felt like a film that was a story that enriched and expanded the way we viewed the events in Star Wars. There are plenty of treats for Star Wars fans, including the scenes with Darth Vader, who has stepped up his game since the last time we saw him. We don't see much of him, but when we do, it's sure to leave a mark. (Also, let's face it, after Kylo Ren, a lot of people miss classic Vader. Rest assured, you won't be disappointed).<br/><br/>So to answer your question, yes, as a movie, it is a bit overrated, but we can ask for nothing more from a SW prequel movie, because as a prequel, it does a terrific job. Rogue One is an emotional, dark addition to the franchise that manages to exceed expectations, a small phenomenon that helps the love for Star Wars burn brighter."

","So there we have a Star Wars PREQUEL, as we all know the prequels are at best boring and at the worst case scenario a disgrace to the name Star Wars. Thanks to Yoda ,the Force was strong with this one and it definitely deliver us with the best prequel in the Galaxy's Far Far way history. The story is as it follows, the Rebellion takes word of a new weapon been produced by the Empire (the first Death Star) and so an operation takes places in order to find out what it is and how to send to hell.<br/><br/>That is more or less the story and let's be honest the whole film it is a set up for Episode IV. But it is made in such way that it makes the 1977 film even better for now you get what has happen in order for this plans to be delivered in to the Alliance hands. As for the character development, was as bit sloppy and made in a harry ,but the manage to do the needed minimum , for the audience to care for our character and it was done quite well. All the actors did their best and now to the good stuff: the effects and battle-scenes.<br/><br/>One word ,mindblown, beautifully made, excellent mix of computer generated and practical to the point that you at times couldn't tell the difference. As for the fighting... goodness this was what we wanted needed and then some from the fight on the ground to the space battles ,it feel like watch a WW2 movie by in space. That is a compliment and quit fitting to this universe for when the first movie's space battles were made Lucas took inspiration from the air-combat in WW2, so that is a nice node to the original and the biggest war in human history.<br/><br/>All in all forget Christmas, now we celebrate Star Wars. Recommended to any Star Wars fun and may the force be with you force users. Happy celebration to all."

","This film has done what no Star Wars since Return of the Jedi has done. It brought you back to the old school retro feel of the original trilogy. Not only that Rogue One creates an entirely new respect for what the Rebellion is up against when A New Hope begins. Its exciting, fast paced and brilliantly cast. The momentum doesn't let up but the drama does provide moments for the viewer to relax and breathe between intense scenes. The cameos are fantastic and the fans will squeal with delight. There really is no sequel or prequel to any film quite like Rogue One. The cinematography and camera movements are so clean and gorgeous that this may very well be the best looking film in the series. All in all Rogue One is a must see in 3D or in the classic widescreen."

The opening is reminiscent of Inglorious Bastards.<br/><br/>the worst thing was the fully animated human characters.<br/><br/>and a really corny blind character<br/><br/>The positive:<br/><br/>Felicity Jones did a good job.

","Rogue One represents the sacrifice of ordinary soldiers, not ""chosen ones"" or ""special ones"" that however, without being so graceful in the management of ""force"" became a fundamental part for the rebel fight against the empire. A fresh film in its approach (Forget the Jedi, at least until Episode 8). Good performances, a little slow start, which is normal when you introduce new characters to the audience, some winks in dialogues and characters to the universe SW, and an a moving ending (No more details, i don't wanna ruin your experience). Rogue One meets the expectations for the most fanatic taking him along unknown paths in style and approach to ""a Galaxy far, far away "", providing a very interesting experience.

","Ever since the publication of the ""Admiral Thrawn"" trilogy launched the Star Wars Expanded Universe, there have been many stories that have made admirable attempts to fill in the crucial historical gap between ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope."" Namely; the events leading up to that fateful transmission of the Death Star 1 plans to Princess Leia. But, once George Lucas sold the franchise to Marvel-Disney, he relegated all those SWEU stories to the status of non-canonical legends! <br/><br/>Now, however, we _have_ a canonical explanation. And the telling of it is done brilliantly and poignantly.<br/><br/>We have new characters like Jyn Erzo (the daughter and only child of Death Star 1's reluctant chief architect) and Director Krennik (the ambitious Imperialist who wants full recognition and sole credit for the battle station's existence). Then, we have the return of old favorites like Governor Tarkin and Princess Leia, herself. The former played by a different actor; the latter, vocally reprised by Carrie Fisher; but, both of them the recipients of ingenious computerized face- matting!<br/><br/>I'm not going to reveal anymore than this, because that wouldn't be fair to the extreme spoiler-phobes among those of you reading this.

","To be honest I was kind of disappointed. I found the first 2/3 of the movie kind of slow, I did like the final act however. Was really let down by how they killed of Saw Gerrera so early, especially after they made it a point of how he was a hardened extremist rebel to only just give up after just meeting Jyn, who I found uninteresting by the way. Some of Rogue One's deaths were underwhelming to me, specifically Donnie Yen's character, who I was hoping to go out with a bang. I did enjoy the final scene with Darth Vader, notably as he emerged from the shadow in the corridor. I really wanted to like this movie more. A solid 7.5/10 from something that had a big buildup but was a let down for me, not as good as The Force Awakens."
"robiu013","6","3","8","17 December 2016"," It's what it is
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first in a line of probably many Star Wars spin off movies, that the people don't really need, but still somehow want. With that being said it's absolutely going the same way as the Marvel cinematic universe and taking something with a large fan base, then hiring competent enough writers, that can write around the franchises core and come up with a product, that doesn't seem like complete fan pandering shlock. None of the movies of such calibre are really worth a spot in a movie canon, but since all entertainment is audience pandering to some degree, we might as well look at it and evaluate it's worth. With that out of the way; Rogue One is fine overall. The movie is kind of pointless. We know it's outcome and where the story goes afterwards and you can easily predict the outcome. It's up to you to decide, whether you'll just take the information you get in ""A New Hope"" or whether you'd rather have this 2 hour movie do that for you. By taking the long road, you get a cast of characters, that while interesting on paper, still lack some interaction and chemistry for it to eventually lead into a satisfying climax, a plot that doesn't feel like rehashing the originals, some of the original's style of immersive world to get surrounded by, some good action scenes, bunch of cameos, you might have wanted or maybe didn't and the obvious fan service, that matters the most to some; Darth Vader. If that's the stuff, you'd want to spend your 2 hours of free time on, then you might just have a blast with it."

","Please excuse my brevity, or lack of form; the most recent of The Star Wars Saga has left me too depressed to care overmuch about protocol. Not to be confused with Protocol Droids.<br/><br/>After seeing Star Wars, Rogue One the night before its Friday open, my daughter asked me what I thought, and I answered that it was a 5.5 out of 10. She said that she didn't like it either, because almost every 'light-side' character died.<br/><br/>Although Rogue One obviously had adopted a rather George R.R. Martin-esque flavor, this was not my problem. More, what bothered me is that while Mr. Martin does occasionally kill fan favorite characters, and thereby keeps readers on their toes. He kills them off after developing the heroes sufficiently. Otherwise; who cares? Personally, I grieved (but only a little), that I would never have a chance to feel their loss. That mild dysthmia was further exacerbated by a cheese-ridden assault (being kind) of monotonous SW: A New Hope throwbacks. Most visible of which were CGI enabled performances of Governor Tarkin and Princess Leia. The latter of which was on par with a low-budget video game animation; Tarkin was a bit better.<br/><br/>Lesser evils were voice-impersonations of the rebel pilots who attacked the Death Star in 'A New Hope', including that death-curdling scream en route to crashing into oblivion. Other SW IV reenactments--another boarding of a Corvette Class Ship by Storm Troopers and Darth Vader, replete with 'force strangling'. I mean, really? It was, in this guys opinion, all a patronizing suck-up, and had me strongly considering going Trekkie. Are we adults, willing to admit that people die in (an albeit futuristic) war? Or kids, making us susceptible to mollification by paper-thin throwbacks to the 1977 movie that started it all? I may know the lines by heart, but I do have an independent brain, which is telling me that ambiance doesn't equal interesting! See it at your own risk, Star Wars Fans."
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","8","16 December 2016"," A fantastic stand-alone Star Wars adventure.
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Released: 15 Dec 16 Rated: M Runtime: 133 mins From George Lucas' prequels to J.J. Abrams' eighth episode and now the first of the ""standalone"" tales, the Star Wars franchise has long been attempting the tricky balance of delivering what fans want whilst also breaking new narrative ground. It's not an easy equilibrium to find, however director Gareth Edwards and screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy have successfully carved out a ripping intergalactic yarn that is free from the Skywalker-Vader-Kenobi-Solo story yet very much apart of the familiar Star Wars universe. Existing between episodes three and four, Rogue One follows a ragtag bunch of rebels — led by Felicity Jones' plucky anti-hero Jyn Erso — as they undertake the potentially war-changing mission of stealing the blueprint of the Death Star. Even more so than The Force Awakens, this movie hinges on its new stars to propel the adventure forward. The always-outstanding Jones is a marvellous choice to head up the titular crew of misfits; her mixture of arrogance, heart and biting intelligence makes Jyn a compelling central character. The international cast surrounding Jones offers indelible support too, the standouts being Ben Mendelsohn as the growling Imperialist Director Krennic and the one-two punch of Wen Jiang and Donnie Yen as a pair of squabbling old-timers who can still kick arse. A special mention also goes to Alan Tudyk's motion-captured droid K-2SO, whose insult slinging is perfectly timed to inject moments of levity in some of the otherwise darker scenes. From an action perspective there's as much laser shooting, aerial dogfighting and planet destruction as you would expect — all executed with the requisite level of technical mastery — although the smaller hand-to-hand melees with martial arts legend Donnie Yen are special to watch. For the all-out finale Edwards clearly plunged his hand deep into Disney's money chest too, the large-scale battle augmented with top-notch computer effects and amazing production design. (Which makes the subpar execution of a digitally de-aged familiar character all the more frustrating.) A clunky multiple-intros start and the inorganic cameos are quickly forgotten thanks to a host of exciting set pieces, an on-point cast and a ballsy bittersweet ending."

"zewolff1","8","3","8","16 December 2016"," This is the prequel you're looking for...
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a different kind of movie from what the series, and the recent blockbuster genre in general, is used to. Although there are cameos and references to please hardcore fans, it is isolated enough to offer a fulfilling story to the average movie-goer. This is something refreshing in a blockbuster landscape of sequels and connected cinematic universes. <br/><br/>At its heart, Rogue One is a war film. The characters are approached the same way they would be in something like Band of Brothers. Although they are enjoyable and interesting, there are a lot of new characters to introduce in one movie. The audience doesn't get to resonate with the characters quite as much as Rey and company in last year's Episode VII. <br/><br/>The film looks gorgeous. The action is shot terrifically and even though moviegoers have an idea of what comes next (this is a prequel after all), the stakes still feel high. <br/><br/>The film ties perfectly into 1977's Star Wars. Viewers excited to see lots of Darth Vader will be disappointed. The classic villain is used sparingly, but perfectly in the scenes he appears in. Rogue One features cameos and callbacks to other classic Star Wars characters as well. Some are wonderful and some are jarring. But it still works enough to keep diehards satisfied. <br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story may not reach the thrills of last years Episode VII, but judged on its own its still a thrilling standalone adventure. Fans that are okay with something a little different from the franchise formula will find this a Star Wars story worth telling."
"tc-40","8","3","8","15 December 2016"," Star Wars does World War II
","Star Wars Roue One. Warning, this review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>It would seem that Disney are looking to release a new Star Wars film every Christmas - maybe alternating between the main storyline and standalone films. Personally, a new Star Wars film every year is fine with me.<br/><br/>I guess the story of obtaining the Death Star plans is a pretty obvious story to tell, but I hope in future that the standalone movies aren't tied quite so closely into the main storyline - the opening scene of A New Hope would be the next scene following the closing scene of Rogue One. From a continuity point of view that's fine, but it does remove almost all the suspense from the story. And Star Wars is a vast universe - there are plenty of stories to be told.<br/><br/>Because we know that no one is getting out alive, it does make for a darker film than any in the original trilogy - darker even than Empire Strikes Back. That's not necessarily a bad thing - it's certainly possible to tell a dark, character driven story and do it well. However, this isn't a character driven story, it's an action film. But hey, this is Star Wars, so that's hardly surprising :)<br/><br/>They could have chosen to make a Cold War style spy thriller, but that doesn't give enough opportunity for dogfighting between X-Wings and TIE fighters, so they have made a war movie instead. In one scene it looks like the Rebel fighters have raided a surplus shop for American GI helmets, and they could easily be a squad of Nick Fury's Howling Commandos in the landing barge approaching the Normandy beaches.<br/><br/>Now, this might sound like I didn't really enjoy it, but that's not the case at all, I had a great time. Yes, it's an out and out action war film, but it's still Star Wars and it's still fun. The dogfighting scenes and the space battles in general are well done and we all like the space battles in Star Wars :) And the digital work for Tarkin and Leia is very good.<br/><br/>It's a fast-paced action film and we all know the ending, but it's done with Star Wars style and it works. But if Disney is going to tell a different Star Wars story every 2nd year, they are going to have to explore new territory."

They are not convincing and the CGI is a let down.<br/><br/>Could they have got any more politically correct either? Female Storm Troopers, Black heroes, female femme fatale heroes. How terribly 2017 of them.<br/><br/>And as for Felicity Jones in the lead role. Dear God her acting is straight out of some amateur dramatic production. Lots and lots of facial anguish, grunting, eye movements and faux shock all the time. She has clearly modelled herself on Keira Knightley with the terribly affected and polished Knightsbridge accent (when she said Haaarns for Hans it started to drive me mad) but it just doesn't work. I think we have all had our fill now of classically trained , privately educated spoiled little rich girls who are hobby actresses.<br/><br/>So that,s it. All a bit boring, a bit of a social justice warrior statement film and not too convincing. Poorly cast and poorly thought out."
"FrostyChud","3","4","13","25 January 2017"," Sadistic and regressive
","Star Wars fans are by definition sexually immature. I sat next to one in the cinema. He teared up when Jyn's father died. I judged him. My first criticism of Rogue One is that there is no sex in it. Adults like sex. Children fear sex. Instead of sex we get violence. I like violence in film when it serves a purpose: hypostasizing Radical Evil. Here its principal purpose is to excite boys and man-boys who cannot stomach sex because they are stuck in an archaic stage of psychic development in which lasers, swords, and phallic corvettes stand in for the terrifying organ of generation and its even more terrifying counterpart. Despite its superficial feminism (more on that further on), the form of the film is deeply anti-woman. Events succeed each other in an airtight masculine logic of cause and effect in which first principles inexorably lead to a predictable conclusion. All the writers have done is swap a biological male out for a biological female. This go-girl Hillary pseudo-feminism abolishes true femininity, which is the domain of ambiguity, desire, and intelligence. Women introduce cuts and gaps into stories. They get bored with the war play. This decentering power is their Jedi skill. Women don't like swords and guns. The phallic woman that is trotted out here (and everywhere else these days) is a little boy's fantasy. Women, don't fall for it. <br/><br/>More generally, ROGUE ONE is anti-adult. The fact that everyone dies in the end makes it look adult, but it remains a child's fantasy of adulthood. Why? Because by dying, the main characters preserve the ontological closure of the Star Wars universe. Their sacrifice means something. An adult is someone who realizes that deep down, nothing means anything. Parents hide this from their children.<br/><br/>I get the feeling watching this that if these characters could simply learn to have sex with each other, the whole overblown cycle of revolution, war, saber slashing, blaster fire, and death might end. Han Solo was a man and Princess Lea was a woman. Here there are only preteens. <br/><br/>The chump who wrote this movie directed American PIE in 2002. It makes sense. That film too concerns the impasses of juvenile sexuality. <br/><br/>The battle scene at the end is particularly repulsive from an ideological standpoint. The director chose to give the grunt soldiers (all very masculine-looking men, here symbolically demoted to cannon fodder) uniforms and helmets reminiscent of World War Two and the D-Day assault on Normandy. As if Mr. American Pie knows anything about battle or sacrifice. Once again we are dealing with a child's idealized fantasy of reality. Will we ever stop cynically using the iconography of World War Two as an excuse not to do the work of understanding each conflict in its singularity? <br/><br/>I was disturbed by the way the storm troopers were slaughtered here. We are encouraged to cheer on the main characters as they murder dozens of faceless humans (probably teenagers drafted into service) with all sorts of aesthetic flourishes. Killing is fun! <br/><br/>But sex? It has no place in Star Wars."
"philipn375","8","4","13","25 December 2016"," A great addition to the Star Wars Saga
","I remember leaving the cinema feeling absolutely stunned. I was filled with all sorts of different emotions that the film gave me and I also felt surprised - all in a good way. I was amazed at how Rogue One felt more like the truly epic space opera film Star Wars is - fitting more into the universe than I felt the The Force Awakens did, it simply felt more serious and mature. The film is seen from a different perspective as the main character is not a user of The Force, and it had a larger emphasis on war as a whole, with a darker tone compared to previous Star Wars films. <br/><br/>The battle scenes were very well done, both on ground and in space simultaneously. Great visuals on an epic grand-scale battle scene that we know from Star Wars. The end battle scene in Rogue One can easily rival the great end battle of Return of the Jedi or at the start of Revenge of the Sith. As Gareth Edwards said: ""It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie.""<br/><br/>The CGI in this film was downright absolutely astounding and was very well made - They brought back Tarkin, and he is by far the best CGI I have personally seen to date in any film, while he wasn't perfect, he was definitely convincing. The film has many diverse and breathtaking new planets & locations. One of the planets being Scarif as we have seen from posters and trailers, but also smaller Imperial Bases on asteroids and planets. My favorite location in the film has to be Darth Vader's Castle.<br/><br/>It was great to see all the references to the original trilogy and the prequels, the film included old characters, one of them being Darth Vader as we saw in the trailers. The film was packed with tons of ships, creatures, and many more great moments that connected the film to the rest Star Wars saga, as well as the two animated series. It also had a ton of comedic moments and lines as we known and love from the previous films.<br/><br/>As to the characters, I wish they had used a couple more of unknown actors rather than the established ones we might already know from other films. While I mostly liked all the characters, I would had preferred they didn't include characters like Chirrut and Baze, since they just felt put in for no reason, perhaps removing them would help the rest of the characters develop further. That aside, all of the characters were definitely different and interesting.<br/><br/>The ending was a good conclusion to the story of the film, and there is a surprisingly clear connection to A New Hope, and a great scene with Vader that has to be one of my favorite out of all the films.<br/><br/>Overall Rogue One is a job well done by Gareth Edwards, he made a serious Star Wars film that both fans and non-fans alike will enjoy. Worth a watch!"

ROGUE ONE is about the stealing of the Death Star blue prints. You know from the beginning (unless you never saw the original saga) that they will succeed and who will survive; but even with that limitations writers did a far better job than with the copycat that became Episode VII. The movie is mostly formulaic, but there are some very good dialogs and better action scenes than the previous films.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones is good but her character is too clichéd and not particularly interesting; who really carry the movie are Diego Luna, Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang, Riz Ahmed and the voice of Alan Tudyk as the cynical and comically depressing K-2SO <br/><br/>In brief; it is not for younger kids but worth spending 2 hours and 14 minutes."
"IndustriousAngel","8","4","13","15 December 2016"," Very straightforward SciFi action movie
","I you're reading this review, you're probably a Star Wars fan anyway, so I don't need to recommend it, but I felt very satisfied with this surprisingly lean addition to the Star Wars universe!<br/><br/>It's the most SF-ish of all the Star Wars movies - no princesses, no magic swords, prophecies or whatever - and it's extremely straightforward: no side quests, no twists, not even a romance. There's little humour or funny one-liners, most of those thanks to droid K-2SO; I don't know if that's a good thing, I have to watch it again someday to see if this droid doesn't get grating. The straightforward approach also means that we have very little in the way of character development or political or historical background but I didn't miss those ingredients much, the move was so entertaining. This is, from start to finish, an actioner.<br/><br/>Production design and SFX are very good, the Star Wars universe feels lived in and many characters and places have a realistic touch about them. The action sequence at the end goes on for maybe a few minutes too long, but never gets boring at least upon first viewing. And the whole story expands very nicely upon Episode 4's ""history"", probably makes watching the original ""Star Wars"" nearly a new experience. In fact, I don't know why this movie is set apart from the ""main"" SW movies at all, it's not apart in any meaningful manner but should really be called something like ""Episode 3.9""."
"ryanjmorris","8","4","13","14 December 2016"," Rogue One struggles with character, makes up for it with unforgettable action
","So, I ask you, what do you do when you have a classic and iconic film that has shaped and defined an entire genre and sparked one of the most recognisable film franchises in history, and it has a pretty hefty plot hole in it? The answer? You make another film, thirty- nine years later, which fills that plot hole. Rogue One was an unusual idea for a film when it was first announced, and it's still pretty bizarre to accept its existence now. It's a story that arguably doesn't need telling, and one that we all already know the ending to. How on Earth do you make that work? Just ask Gareth Edwards. Rogue One is far from perfect, and it won't be as loved and adored as last year's The Force Awakens, but here we have something we haven't really seen before: Star Wars at its boldest, and certainly its darkest.<br/><br/>We all know the story. The Empire has created a super weapon called the Death Star, and it's pretty much ready to be unleashed on the galaxy. The Rebel Alliance needs a way to destroy it. They find that hope with Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), whose father Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) was forced into the Empire to help design the super weapon. They believe that, with his assistance, they can find a way to bring the Death Star down. So, Jyn ultimately teams up with a group of Rebels to retrieve her father and the Death Star plans, and help destroy the thing for good. Wisely, Rogue One never even entertains the idea of actually destroying the Death Star within its run time, and neither do its characters. The focal issue with a prequel is that we already know far too much about what comes after, so some elements are tough to care about. Rogue One's script, by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, is smartly focused on the much smaller goal of retrieving the plans that we know the Rebels are in possession of by the time A New Hope begins.<br/><br/>What the film unfortunately isn't as focused on, though, is its characters. The characters here don't all need to be thoughtful, complex, multi-layered people. They just need to stand out, and they don't. Most of them aren't particularly memorable, and you won't feel fully invested in them. You'll like them, there's no doubt about that, but you won't truly care about them. Felicity Jones gives a great performance here, but Jyn's steady building determination can't quite match the gleeful journey into confidence that Rey underwent in The Force Awakens. It's not a massive issue in the film - it would be if the characters were genuinely unlikable, and that's far from the case - but it feels like it's always holding Rogue One back from hitting the same heights as the franchise's best efforts. Most of this comes down to the fact that the film skips and bounds between countless locations in its opening half, and it simply doesn't have the intricacy to pull this off while also defining its characters. They all come second to the planets and the table-setting, and it forces them into frustratingly underwhelming places.<br/><br/>But then Rogue One does two things. It heads into the two biggest and most epic battle sequences in Star Wars history, and it stages them simultaneously. Rogue One's final act skips between a visually breathtaking space battle over a planet called Scarif, while at the same time the entire main cast are fighting their way through Stormtroopers and AT-ATs on that planet's surface. Within this, the characters are almost all split up, meaning the film's final act has an enormous amount of ground to cover, and it pulls it off masterfully. I'm not messing around when I say that the final act is, without question, the best action film-making of the year. and potentially the most thrilling that Star Wars has ever been. The editing, performances, staging, cinematography and choreography are faultless. It doesn't feel clean and tidy, it feels messy and grim and scary. It doesn't feel optimistic and filled with hope, it feels morbid and as if everything could come crashing down at any moment. The cinematography is also above and beyond any that Star Wars has seen before. There are beautiful shots of the Death Star eclipsing a sun, but the film also finds moments of horror in the way it visually depicts war and grounded combat. It all comes together with breathtaking precision, before the film ends at arguably the best and most exciting moment that it could.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it's a little frustrating that Rogue One is so messy in its first half. As well as the offbeat pacing and thinly sketched characters, it also suffers from an almost catastrophic CGI recreation of a beloved character from the original trilogy, and while the constant references to other Star Wars films add a nice sense of nostalgia, they can't help but detract from the standalone nature that Rogue One was supposed to fit. But for every criticism I have, another brilliant moment pops to mind. Vader is used expertly here, never overshadowing the film's own cast and only used when necessary - his final sequence in the film is so frighteningly tense that it will surely go down as one of the best uses of the character to date. K-2SO, voiced by Alan Tudyk, is also mostly a success. Not all of his jokes land, but he never feels misplaced or like he doesn't belong; he fits perfectly in Star Wars' droid pantheon. It's very far from perfect, but there is an awful lot to like in Rogue One. While its first half isn't particularly memorable, the final act is something you won't be forgetting for a very long time. Give Rogue One your time and your attention, and then give it your patience. It will frustrate you for a while, but boy does it make it all worthwhile."
"Sainesk","8","5","18","26 December 2016"," Almost makes up for Episode 7
","To keep it short and sweet, this is much closer to what a Star Wars film should be like. Felt like it fits in well and feels truer to the originals (4-6) without recycling everything.<br/><br/>Since it takes place just before Episode 4 you will also see a lot more content from the original trilogy which makes it even funnier that this one still feels more original than Episode 7.<br/><br/>No idea how Episodes 8 and 9 will dig out the garbage hole which 7 dug with the ""new"" (copy + pasted) storyline. Hopefully more side stories like this one will keep the Star Wars torch shining.<br/><br/>If I had to critique one downside - I did not really start to care for the characters until what felt as too far into the movie, but 1 episode for a story of this magnitude might be too short to really build such character development and attachment to them."

","I'm a little late to the party, but for what it's worth, here's my two cents on Rogue One, the direct prequel to the original Star Wars, which shows how a brave group of rebels risked all to acquire the plans to the Empire's latest weapon, The Death Star.<br/><br/>After the disappointment that was The Force Awakens, I went into Rogue One with low expectations, which only served to make a very good film even more of a pleasure to behold. What we have here is a vast improvement over J.J. Abrams' unimaginative retread of A New Hope, a standalone spin-off story that is surprisingly dark, violent and gritty, especially considering that it is a product of the House of Mouse. Director Gareth Edwards tells his gripping tale of hope, bravery and sacrifice with an assured hand, delivering engaging characters (with a droid—K-2SO—stealing every scene 'he' is in), pathos, humour and, of course, excitement, the excellent action set pieces a marvel to behold (the rebel X-wing fighters attacking the Imperial Star destroyers is breath-taking).<br/><br/>If this is the standard that Disney has set for future films in the Star Wars Universe, then I'm back to being a faithful fan. 8.5/10, happily rounded up to 9 for IMDb despite the patently CGI Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia."
"Hellmant","10","5","18","16 December 2016"," I cried!
","'ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The tenth live-action film in the epic sci-fi franchise (counting two Ewok television movies); and the first standalone 'STAR WARS' film, in a new planned anthology series. The story is set shortly before the events of 'A NEW HOPE'; and it revolves around the Rebel Alliance's attempts to steal the design schematics for the Death Star. They recruit a criminal named Jyn Erso, to help them accomplish this mission. The movie was directed by Gareth Edwards (who also helmed the 2010 indie sci-fi hit 'MONSTERS', and the 2014 'GODZILLA' reboot); and it was written by Chris Weitz, Tony Gilroy, John Knoll and Gary Whitta. It stars Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Alan Tudyk, Jiang Wen, Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker and the voice of James Earl Jones (once again reprising his iconic role of Darth Vader). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and fans alike (including filmmaker Kevin Smith, and series creator George Lucas). I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young woman named Jyn Erso (Jones); who is arrested by Imperial soldiers, but then rescued by a small team of Rebel forces. The Rebel Alliance has learned of an extremely powerful (and gigantic) weapon, being built by the Galactic Empire, called the Death Star. Jyn's father, Galen (Mikkelsen), helped design it, and the rebels want Jyn to help them find him. She assists a team, lead by Cassian Andor (Luna), on this important mission (that we all know leads to the events of 'A NEW HOPE').<br/><br/>This is the prequel that fans have been waiting for; the film that many had hoped 'THE PHANTOM MENACE' would be (or at least one of it's two sequels), but this actually delivers (where George Lucas previously failed)! I'll admit it's not as fun as any of the other 'STAR WARS' movies, but it is epic (and pretty emotionally dramatic). It's a slow-building character driven drama (with lots of great action as well). The performances are all good, and the dialogue is well written (much like last year's 'THE FORCE AWAKENS'); it also doesn't have any of the lame silly kids' humor, that Lucas's prequels were filled with. There's even some great nostalgic throwback scenes (but it's not nearly as heavy on them as 'THE FORCE AWAKENS' is). Going into the film, I knew pretty much how it would all play out (as anyone that knows the earlier 'STAR WARS' movies, by heart, should); but I still loved watching it all unfold! It's a 'STAR WARS' film, and it's also it's own beautiful sci-fi tale; I cried (like I often do at movies that really move me like this). It's another 'STAR WARS' masterpiece!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0"

"CEBaum","3","3","9","27 August 2017"," Where are all the women?
","Gareth Edwards must have thought that by having Felicity Jones in the lead role, a couple of two-line actresses in robes and a few mothers running about his film would be female enough. By keeping his character arcs on an all-time shallow, and avoiding all banter between these bands of rebels, he has systematically removed all chance of any emotion for the viewer as one by one they fight, die, and form alliances. While Star Wars has always been for the boys, it's ridiculous to presume that there would be zero female rebel volunteers, female imperial scientists, or anyone of note here when half the population or more is female. And why Jyn would choose to hug the biggest idiot man of them all at the end is amazing to me when they basically spent most of the film despising each other. Three stars for Felicity Jones and Riz Ahmed, who act their socks off. But thumbs down for the blatant waste of an opportunity to add women to the cast, even in the background. Seems pretty sexist. Ya boo for not utilizing the wondrous Forest Whitaker. And yuck to the CGI characters. I was bored out of my mind in general, and was glad when the end credits rolled. What a shame."
"jabaleno","10","3","9","23 April 2017"," Well crafted story, well portrayed on screen
","So, this isn't your parents' Star Wars. The first movie I ever saw in theaters was Episode 4, A New Hope. It was 1977 and I was at the ripe old age of 5. This event forever created in me a passion for the franchise. <br/><br/>I preface this review with that statement for a reason. I had to watch this movie twice to really get the story. Not for anything done wrong on the part of those who made the movie, but more because I had gotten very use to seeing a certain set of characters in Star Wars movies to this point. <br/><br/>This movie is well written and works within the boundaries set with the previous movies to maintain continuity, but with a whole different set of characters. It's like taking your favorite sitcom and making it from the neighbors' point of view. This is not a bad thing, but if you walk in expecting the usual, you will be disappointed. Go in expecting to see a 'fleshing out' of the Star Wars Universe, as it were, and you will be satisfied if not happy.<br/><br/>After two viewings, this is definitely heading for my collection and will be viewed more times until I can recite lines from it as well as I can from the rest of the collection (I have destroyed VHS tapes by how often they get watched, digital is my savior).<br/><br/>Overall, two thumbs up, ten stars, standing ovation and whatever else you want to toss in there for good measure. I liked it, then I loved it. Go watch it now!!"
"Dandy_Desmond","10","3","9","17 April 2017"," Instant Classic
","Rogue One is comfortably the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. <br/><br/>So I'll tell you where I'm at. I love the original films - I grew up with them as a child of the 80s. I think the prequels are rubbish, I don't really watch cartoons and the Force Awakens left me cold. Personally I thought Star Wars was done. <br/><br/>But at least I had the original films. Untouchable. <br/><br/>So I thought...<br/><br/>I walked out of the cinema totally satisfied I had seen an instant classic. It is bold, exciting, funny, tragic and most of all entertaining. <br/><br/>I won't go into the story, as most people know that its how the rebels stole the plans to the Death Star, which was destroyed in Star Wars (1977) <br/><br/>Rogue One manages in its 2 hours 10 mins run time to bring together a motley crew of characters, give them each sufficient screen time for you to care about them before putting them on a suicide mission. Its a true ensemble piece, and almost feels like The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen or the Wild Bunch in space. As the film was playing I felt it was good, then towards the end I thought wow they are actually going to do it. They are actually all going to die and the last 40 minutes are incredible. <br/><br/>As I was reeling from this, the director Gareth Edwards then produces the real moment of the film. The jewel in the crown. Darth Vader after taking a back seat for most of the film, after many security failures by Krennic (a fantastic little worm of a character played by the terrific Ben Mendelsohn) takes matters into his own hands in brutal fashion. <br/><br/>Following this scene, the film ends with Princess Leia, as Star Wars begins.<br/><br/>The film has many strengths. Gareth Edwards being the key. He hasn't just made a lazy remake of the original. This film stands alone, yet fits totally alongside the first three in style, execution and with panache.<br/><br/>I just want to touch on the humour as well. It has moments of humour that does not resort to slap stick as seen in the horrific prequels, where CGI creatures fart or C3P0's head ends up on another droids body (really? yep it really happened) <br/><br/>Yes, finally a film that cares for its characters more than the CGI. Yes, this is the film that gave Darth Vader his balls back. Yes, this is the film that dared kill off the whole cast. Yes, the Star Wars film that highlights how bad the prequels and The Force Awakens is. Yes, I loved it. <br/><br/>Can you tell?"
"von_mistont","10","3","9","30 December 2016"," Rogue one is true awakening in The Force
","No spoilers. Rogue 1 is the true awakening of the force. While last year's cash grab made all 6 previous movies pointless, all our favorite heroes dirty and all their sacrifices and struggle irrelevant Rogue 1 only makes original trilogy better by explaining some important plot holes (boy how many hours did we spend with friends laughing about how stupid constructor of a Death Star must have been to build so vulnerable station – well Rogue 1 has the last laugh!). It must have been made by true fans of everything that made original Star Wars great and not by some childish pretender who can only see the surface and doesn't understand the essence. This movie is with The Force and The Force is with the Rogue 1.<br/><br/>Beginning may be a bit slow for some people used to today's action movies in which plot is only an excuse for some pointless combat but I myself prefer this kind of film structure in which first you have to learn why people do things they do. Finale on the other hand has no equal. And I'm not only referring to other Star Wars movies. It was so spectacular that I couldn't sleep that night when I came back from the cinema. When I close my eyes I see magnificent scenes from Rogue 1. I watched original trilogy dozens of times, some scenes hundreds of times , I watched flawed prequel trilogy a lot too and it also had some good scenes, and while I will maybe never watch Force Awakens again I know that I will be rewinding Rogue 1 and watching some moments over and over again.<br/><br/>There is nostalgia in this movie but it's not there just to trick you into liking this movie. It's there because it truly is real original great Star Wars movie in it's very core, you could literally make smooth transition between last scene of Rogue 1 and first scene of New Hope and you almost wouldn't notice that another film just started (and that's what I'm intending to do when Rogue 1 comes out!). It's also great standalone film. You don't have to know anything about other Star Wars movies to enjoy it and it makes it even better for Star Wars fan. When someday I will show my child Star Wars I would now have to decide if just maybe I should start with Rogue 1.<br/><br/>It really pains me to watch most of action movies, as often it seems that screenwriter was the worst payed person in whole crew. In Rogue 1 I would really have to search hole in whole to attack a plot. Story was really solid and could stand on its own even if it wasn't set in Star Wars universe. As I mentioned above movie explains some questions concerning New Hope and some quite familiar characters (one in particular), we can also see even more of how tyrannical Imperial regime really was, we learn that Rebellion also isn't a monolith but quite interesting group of people with different approaches. Humor was well placed and paced and unconstrained. It wasn't one liner fest. I feel that every dialogue had sense and it was there for some reason. There was even one inspiring speech which actually inspired me! Usually in moments like these I go in my head ""oh come on stop"", but when Jyn was delivering her speech she was making sense and her arguments were convincing.<br/><br/>Soundtrack was OK it did its job and I know it was there which I couldn't really say about previous movie. For me Star Wars was literally a space Opera or rather space symphony. I was watching beautiful scenes with no dialogue enjoying music and sights. And Rogue 1 has that quality too. Sights are magnificent, when spaceship is flying, even in battle you can see it clearly, camera doesn't fly like crazy, you can really see what's going on. I don't know if it was just me but I also really liked ship's landing scenes or when the ship flies by I find it very aesthetic and majestic and Rogue 1 has plenty of this awe inspiring moments and also plenty of action packed fight scenes.<br/><br/>Actors do a very good job, I really liked main cast a lot. Forest Whitaker was a bit overplayed, but on the other how do you not overplay a madman? Diego Luna was excellent as ruthless rebel driven by revenge, Donnie Yen was adorable human Yoda and like no other he showed us The Force really exists. After watching trailers I had many doubts to Felicity Jones as her character seemed too audacious and disrespectful with all this ""I rebel!"" etc. and I really want my heroes to care for what they do and be afraid to die, because if they don't care why should I? But I was wrong, she was simply great. And she wasn't some MaRey Sue either. I also had doubts about main villain but he was just repulsive enough to be believable and not some child's vision of how mad space nazi would behave. CGI characters could have been made better, I was a bit put off but I my fiancé who didn't grow up with Tarkins face said she didn't notice he was CGI character.<br/><br/>I can't wait for more movies by the authors of Rogue 1 it is without a doubt the best movie of this year and I couldn't honestly say that any of the original trilogy films is better that Rogue 1."
"richsutherland-44455","10","3","9","28 December 2016"," Finally, the modern Star Wars movie I dreamed of...
","This film is everything I wanted it to be and more. When I first heard that they were making Rogue One in the style of a war movie I was extremely excited though reserved because I felt Force Awakens was awful, unoriginal and disappointing. I simply did not think that Disney would have the guts to make something mature and dark as this story required. When I heard they were re-shooting 40% of the movie, I was extremely worried. Eventually it leaked what they had changed and it actually sounds like the re-shoots improved this film, bravo to Disney for that. <br/><br/>I think a darker Star Wars has so much more depth to it, at its core it is a story of good vs evil. Til now the Evil side seemed a bit lack lustre. I know everyone seems to think Star Wars is for children, well to hell with that - it's for adults as well. Empire Strikes Back was a dark film and it was also the best of the originals. Just because something is a bit darker doesn't mean children cannot enjoy it too. <br/><br/>I gave this film 10/10 because it gave me goose bumps and I left the theatre with my jaw scraping along the ground. It was emotional, explosive and above all nostalgic. Nostalgic in a way none of the films since the originals have managed to achieve. Without giving anything away, one of the final and best scenes captures Darth Vader in the most menacing, terrifying way seen yet on screen. There is no way to dress this scene up in fancy words, it was f'ing awesome. My inner Star Wars child was bouncing in the seat with excitement. <br/><br/>This film is everything I could have asked for and I want to go see it in the cinema again. Well done to the director, Disney etc. In my opinion you made up for the Force Awakens!"
"kornophreak","8","3","9","28 December 2016"," See past the odd canon, and it's a fantastic movie.
","Now, you've just watched Rogue One, and according to the reviews on IMDb already, you have one of two opinions; It was fantastic or it was an embarrassment.<br/><br/>The two sides absolutely have merit. I am no Star Wars expert, not by a long way, even though I did see the original trilogy as early as I could have understood it as a child in the 90s. I do understand the plot in reasonable depth -enought to satisfy myself- and the canon created by some of the games and so fourth, so this is where the crux of why some of the reviews are they way they are.<br/><br/>It would be easy to dismiss the negatives as 'angry fanboys/nerds angry that the film doesn't stick to the canon', but of course, the original Trilogy does not explain how things came to be before the first film. Thus, we almost REQUIRE canon.<br/><br/>However, a lot of it is rather complex and convoluted, whilst being absolutely reasonable, it would not make a good move it it's own right. To spread the story over several movies would make it...yawn-worthy, to be polite.<br/><br/>So corners are cut and stories are re-imagined, which quite frankly, is fine by me. Fiction is just that, the 'original' canon was not (always) created by he who wrote the original story. So see this as a film friendly alternative. It is much more entertaining, and able to fit into a 2+ hour film.<br/><br/>And what a film.<br/><br/>As usual, great action scenes, wonderful scenery and overall CGI, as expected. The story itself does feel fairly rushed, but again, this is down to being able to fit a lot of information and background into screen time.<br/><br/>There were a couple of questionable castings yes, but I attribute this to showing the world new, young and fresh actors, rather than squeezing every last drop out of the existing pool before they pop their clogs randomly/suddenly (it is still 2016 and people are superstitious about it now). Admittedly, I thought Mr Whitaker did not belong, his accent was, ridiculous. In once scene I swear he had an accent from the north east of England! As for the CGI Tarkin and Leia, there are computer games with more convincing movements, quite disappointing, since although I assume this had a lower budget than the main films, these scenes were a huge let down.<br/><br/>K-2SO, the real hero of the film, and though occasionally feeling forced with the jokes, I do feel it matched his apparent programming. Great character overall.<br/><br/>As for Mr Vader, I am sure he was taller before, and the one liner was really REALLY not necessary, but his actions towards the end depict exactly the kind of ruthless killer he is, no pause, only grim determination. The Vader that we all longed to see in action.<br/><br/>Finally, addressing peoples concern over not being too emotionally involved with the characters, I don't think you need to be. This is a film filling in the blanks, while most of the characters were not hugely memorable, it is refreshing to see a movie killing them off in ways that make sense. It was after all a suicide mission, hero's need not survive till the end, you must only look to past wars to see that.<br/><br/>The multitude of nods to the old films, like the deathstar plan visuals and control panels are memorable, while not completely fitting in with modern designs, they are easter eggs in themselves (though very in your face ones).<br/><br/>To Sum up: If you are a hardcore long time fan, don't watch Rogue One. I'm being honest it doesn't make sense with the current canon and there are some cringe moments which the older audience won't appreciate.<br/><br/>If you like Star Wars and still agree that the other nameless trilogy was a waste of space, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film.<br/><br/>If you have not seen Star Wars before or are simply of the younger generation, you will enjoy this film, even though some of significant characters/events may be slightly unclear.<br/><br/>For the reasons above -as much as I wanted to give the film a 9- i give it 8 stars. There were just a tad too many things that let it down to give it any more, from the opinion of someone that isn't that into the original canon.<br/><br/>The most important advice: just go watch a film, form your own opinion. Where some may loathe, you may love. What matters is what YOU enjoy. Reviews just give you a tiny insight.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"
"mgruebel","7","3","9","24 December 2016"," Easily beats Episodes 1 and 3.
","Rogue One has many good things in it, and also some important flaws. Still, overall it is a good film.<br/><br/>The story explains how the Death Star could have been built with a design flaw that would allow a single torpedo fired by Luke Skywalker to bring it down: its chief engineer Galen Erso hated the Empire, and made sure the rebels would catch wind of the design error he planted. The story revolves around an ensemble cast led by Galen's daughter Jyn Erso, first tracking down Erso, then finding out where the plans are stored, and finally retrieving them to get them into Princess Leia's hands. The movie gets my kudos for explaining this all in a pretty reasonable way.<br/><br/>Some of the stretches in the story line are not all that bad. For example, the idea that a sophisticated data library would require mechanical retrieval of data may seem a bit silly. But then, we all know that voting machines are decoupled from the internet for good reason, and if you really want to store secrets, you will do it in a way that requires mechanical retrieval and other layers to insulate it from remote data theft.<br/><br/>The appearance of well-known characters like Grand Moff Tarkin and Princes Leia Organa is also welcome, and was pulled off quite well . Some viewers find this creepy (the real actors who first played these characters in 1977 are deceased), and thus imagine all kinds of bad CGI or acting, when in fact these were nicely done. It's one of those cases where, if you know something is fake, your mind is going to come up with reasons why it is fake, even if it looks almost perfect. In fact, if you showed Tarkin and Leia from Rogue One to a person who's never heard of Star Wars, they would perfectly well accept them as somewhat heavily makeup-covered actors from a science fiction movie. I'd say their acting was better than that of many longer roles in this film! I commend the director and special effects people for daring to do it, even if it's only 95% perfect.<br/><br/>The final 'Battle of Dubai' is nicely done, with mayhem contrasted with idyllic gardens and blue skies, a welcome change from the usual deep space battle that is de rigeur in Star Wars films. It kills off the ensemble cast after their mission is completed, and Disney is to be commended for making a film where not everyone lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>The female heroine is just there. She's not played up in any way, and it's a true sign of emancipation when you don't think ""Oh look, they put in a female heroine to be politically correct."" Perhaps this is why the actress was instructed to play a bit bland and 'just be there.' It works, but of course, it also doesn't work.<br/><br/>But there are also many problems. The 'fan service' is a little too heavy-handed, and sometimes disturbs the flow of the story. Why do we need to see R2-D2 and C-3PO for 3 seconds? Why does a rough character from a bar on Mos Eisley from the original 1977 movie have to walk down a city street on a different world? The list goes on.<br/><br/>A major corollary of this problem is that the film spends too much time rushing to multiple locations, showing nuggets from the original, and rushing the ensemble cast along, denying its characters the time needed to become well-developed and thus likable. I honestly could not remember the names of many of the ensemble cast of rogues who steal the plans, and still did not know when they died. I would say at a minimum, you need to introduce your characters well enough that I know their first name when they die! The rush prevents the actors from building up their characters properly, so there's not much of a lump of sorrow in the viewer's throat when they give their lives. The film was not quite sure whether to spend some time (like the original), or rev up the pace (like I, II and III) for the generation of viewers with short attention span. In the end it did neither, boring those with little attention span, and puzzling those who wanted to understand what the characters are about. Basically, this film either needed to be cut by a half hour, or lengthened by a half hour, but the in-between approach does not quite do the story line and characters full justice.<br/><br/>Finally, the dialogue is sometimes cringe-worthy, in particular the great declamations. To be fair though: Jyn Erso's speech at the rebel headquarters was awful, BUT they did turn her request down! So what do you want? She's totally inexperienced as a leader, gives a bad speech, they say 'sorry, we can't.' It's actually quite realistic and moves the story into act III. The android made up for it by having some dry English humor quips just at the right times in the film.<br/><br/>To make up for any flaws, there are many beautiful locations, grand battles, the overall concept is sound, and the intentions are good, so I'll give this film a 7. I'd see it again at some point, if for no other reason than to discover the more subtle fan service that I surely missed, so I can bemoan some more how Disney overdid it. For people who played the Star Wars video games and got a completely different story of how the Death Star plans were captured, it must be quite jarring, and I doubt many of them would go above a 5/10. However, they can take solace in the fact that even real history is never self-consistent because alternative views of events persist, and the winner who writes history one day may be the loser another day and have it rewritten over their grave."

","First of all, I'm not a die-hard Star Wars fan; just a casual moviegoer.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. I had high expectations and this was certainly one of my most anticipated films of 2016. I'm happy to say that 'Rogue One' has not let me down.<br/><br/>The movie seemed very fresh and had a gritty feeling to it, which I really enjoyed. It was a nice deviation from the other Star Wars movies. Gareth Edwards did a hell of a job. The action sequences were very thrilling and satisfying and looked straight out of a war movie.Not that the 1st and 2nd acts were bad(they were really good), but the movie really picks up in the 3rd act.<br/><br/>The casting was spot on. All the actors and actresses justified their roles. Of course, Alan Tudyk's K2SO and Donnie Yen's Chirrut Imwe stole the show. K2SO's dry, sarcastic humour coupled with Chirrut's baddassery worked very well. Felicity Jones was also good as Jyn Erso.<br/><br/>Also, the main antagonist, Orson Krennic was great. He was bureaucratic, imposing and cunning. He had some great scenes.<br/><br/>Lets talk about Darth Vader. A couple of my friends were annoyed that he was hardly in the movie, but I felt his cameos were done nicely. Especially that last scene!! Wow!!<br/><br/>The thing I like most about Rogue One is how it seamlessly fits into 'A New Hope'. It not only enhances Episode 4, but also fills the plot holes and gaps, beautifully. Look out for many easter eggs and cameos, which are scattered in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great film!

","Okay, I will admit it, the first hour of of this movie had bad pacing. We kept cutting to this character, then that character, and such and such...but after the first hour of this, this movie became a near masterpiece. Every time you see Darth Vader on the screen, your mouth will be gaping open, gasping for breath. Even if he barely has any screen time, he makes up for it, and brings us some of the best Darth Vader scenes to date. Not only that, but the special effects and cinematography are absolutely stunning. The visual effects blew me away, without making it look like it had too much CGI.<br/><br/>The last ten minutes, however, was the best part in the film. Visually stunning and emotionally felt, the last ten minutes is what really made me give it a 10/10. The last ten minutes was pure masterful filmmaking, I can guarantee you that. Go see it. You will not regret it.<br/><br/>9.7/10."

","I cannot be too nasty to this film. After all me too paid for it and saw it with very hard cold cash. but this prequel/sequel/spin off is just another Disney plot to take cash out of idiots pocket. And it looks like people like me are falling for it. This world is just getting more and more ugly, hateful, rip off scam and dumb. I bet all Donald Dangerous clown Trump groupies and voters are watching this in America. It is so stupid. Disney knows it and designed to get dangerous retard Trump voters money. The very very dangerous rebel leader who just talks to the little girl he left behind for five minutes and is so dumb he doesn't even believe the pilot. The assassin who doesn't shoot when he should. The dangerous scientist who is so against the empire he decides to gives them his full cooperation for real just to trick them that he is not with them!?! The rebels find the girl, but the Empire can't. A major star cruiser can be pushed by a spaceship and can't fight back... You thought Episode VII was dumb? Watch this one. Who writes this stuff Donald trump the megalomaniac??"
"richardphong","7","3","9","20 December 2016"," A movie for those who love Star Wars
","The beginning of this movie was slow and a bit boring. However, things quickly scale up resulting in a fabulous war movie. This'll make up for the slow beginning. Character development was also good. Although Jyn was the most developed, others were also developed well without any character origins. They were well developed because they demonstrate care for each other and all are interesting. No need to relate to common people of today. Humor was good as it had quality over quantity. The battle scenes are, in my opinion, the best of the whole Star Wars Saga. I would like to see more of this dark themed movie as it truly showed there was a war and it was devastating."

","This is my first thoughts review - and will add to this when I have though about it more. It is definitely up there with the best of the Star Wars films and significantly better than the Force Awakens - puts the 'war' into Star Wars! <br/><br/>Gritty, political, tragic and engrossing with some great action and great performances. The film really succeeds in creating a pervading sense of oppression and and all the Imperial characters are seriously nasty, including a certain Sith Lord and a certain regional governor who takes over control on the famous ""its no moon... its a space station"" during the story!<br/><br/>9/10 Go and see it!"

","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story(2016) Starring: Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Wen Jiang, Forest Whitaker, Jonathan Aris, Valene Kane, Jimmy Smits, Anthony Daniels, Jimmy Vee, and James Earl Jones Directed By: Gareth Edwards Review A REBELLION BUILT ON HOPE You want to see more of the Star Wars universe as opposed to the episodic saga since it was ruined by The Force Awakens. Yeah, well does my man director Gareth Edwards got the movie for you. A rogue band of resistance fighters unite for a mission to steal the Death Star plans and bring a new hope to the galaxy. Last year I gave a review on The Force Awakens that was rather very glowing on the film but the more I watch it the more I hate because it's just feminist propaganda, I say that because the main lead has no weakness she fixes the falcon, knows how to use the force in like two days and beats a sith who has had like years of training. I hate The force Awakens and I thought Jyn Erso was going to be the same thing but Thank God she wasn't. Surprisingly the reviews for this film on Rotten Tomatoes weren't as glowing as The Force Awakens even though this is far far far superior to that film. Most of the reviews I heard said that there was no strong male lead but I have to whole heartily disagree. Chirrut who was played by Donnie Yen an amazing foreign actor. Cassian played by Mexican actor Diego Luna and Baze Malibus played by Wen Jiang. I thought they were excellent and the imperial K-2SO which was voiced by Alan Tudyk I thought that he was funny and I loved his interaction with Jyn. Speaking of Jyn Erso I mentioned that earlier I was like worried that she would be like Rey in the Force Awakens. All of sudden have all this unbeatable stuff and have superpowers or something. But what she really had going for her is that she could get people to rally up behind her for the fight to get the death star plans. Other than that she wasn't stupid powerful and being like oh I don't need man, don't hold my hand. Every character in the film felt pretty equal but the story happened to center around a female lead who thankfully wasn't an annoying know it all out of nowhere powerful chick. The effects and action were outstanding, this is the Star Wars film that puts the war in Star Wars. It felt like a Saving Private Ryan type of fantasy war film and the detail on the Tie Fighters and X- Wings its like they came back from the original trilogy. There some Cg but it is well needed and wont be that distracting to a hardcore Star Wars fan. Darth Vader looks maybe a little different because of the actors playing him in the suit they just looked a little taller. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the Star Wars film that we deserved not The Force Awakens that is a garbage movie. But Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is quite literally the most Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes back. I'm giving Rogue One a five out five."
"witster18","8","3","9","17 December 2016"," went with another movie-buff and pretty big star wars fan. We were impressed.
","Where do I begin? (very mild spoilers - not at all really)<br/><br/>It looks phenomenal. Gareth Edwards and Disney hit the look out of the ballpark. <br/><br/>The minimized nostalgia, that was done with many subtle touches, not with overly sappy, nostalgic scenes like in Force Awakens. I liked Force Awakens. Gave it a 7. Here the nostalgia isn't spoon fed, it's little sidebars. Familiar faces in quick glances, and references that are tied to the first three films. They're all over, but they're not asking for attention.<br/><br/>This film stands firmly on its own and you will b wondering why this wasn't episode 3. It's what episode 3 should have been. It's better than Jedi too. Yea, I said it. Go ahead and make it not useful, but that's my honest opinion. <br/><br/>Love the new characters. Good performances across the board. Solid script. Funny, but it isn't overdone. <br/><br/>I thought it was paced perfectly. Building tension as it went, and ending spectacularly. <br/><br/>Mads, Mendelson, and Jones added some serious brass to this affair. I want to see this again. I'd have sat through it back to back if they'd have let me. Its exactly what they said it was.. a Star Wars story. A story that deserved to be told and in a way that blended it seamlessly with episode 4, and once and for all married the grit of 1976 with the cgi improvements of 2016. An elevated espionage factor helped move the story- line, and everything came together perfectly down the stretch.<br/><br/>So much better than I ever could have imagined. This is the first time I've truly felt like this since 1987. Like we never even left that galaxy far, far away. Of all the Star Wars films made since Jedi, it's easily the most akin to the original trilogy, in look, feel and overall quality.<br/><br/>80/100<br/><br/>Three nit-pick negatives were an early scene when another conspirator was shot next to the Captain. Seemed strange and poorly thought-out, and then another scene were Felicity couldn't muster-up some tears which were desperately needed. The CGI face-rendering was much better than say Tron Legacies' Clu, but still isn't as good as it will be in decades to come. It wasn't too distracting. Everything else was aces.<br/><br/>This still moves into first place for the time being - 43 of 89 films through the '16 watch-list. That's not a crazy fanboy ranking either... here's my scores for previous Star Wars Films for reference.<br/><br/>Episode 4 New Hope - 10/10 Episode 5 Empire Strikes Back - 10/10 Episode 6 Return of the Jedi - 8.5/10 Episode 1 Phantom Menace - 5.5/10 Episode 2 Attack of the Clones 4.5/10 Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith 7/10 Episode 7 The Force Awakens 7.5/10<br/><br/>It's the third sci-fi we've ck'd-out on IMAX. Force Awakens was decent, Arrival was just too slow and uneventful(sure it's thought provoking, but), but this is a good movie. A very good movie."
"vorennaal","10","3","9","17 December 2016"," Breathtakingly beautiful
","I can easily explain why I gave it 10 stars out of 10. Because this is the first time in a long time I can honestly say: Thank You Lucas Film, thank You so much! <br/><br/>This movie is excellent, the 3rd act is simple breathtaking. Much like The Guns of Navarone (1961) and Where EaglesDare (1968). The first two act (1st and 2nd) is too diversified. You are about to catch the old school SW feeling, but it's somehow....Iwould like to accurately describe my feelings, so let me say this; I felt the 1st and 2nd act was way too much. But the 3rd act is pure art. The balance in the 3rd act is fascinating. Hard to describe how good the 3rd act is. Empire Strikes Back level. This movie is so much better then all the prequels, and I am not a prequel hater. I am not talking about effects or CGI, I am talking about story-driven filmmaking. In that sense Rogue One has all the scores. The 3rd act is sooo strong, I would put this movie on top of my personal Star Wars list. This movie is truly wonderful, turned out to have a heart of gold in the end. A true gift for every fan, especially for the first generation of Star Wars fans like me. Most Emotional Movie ending I've seen for a long time. It brought so much emotions at the end, I was almost in tears. A truly wonderful movie and it makes us better people."

If you are a star wars fan then this movie will absolutely change your life and be as good as the other ones. It definitely maintained the Star wars reputation. It was such a good movie that when i left the movie theaters i knew my life had forever changed.

","This is what a Star Wars film is all about. Believeble characters with which to identify yourself, in-jokes, serious space and planetary combat and music which we fans usually have playing in the back of our heads.<br/><br/>At first I was skeptical about this film after what ""Jar Jar"" Abrams did with ""The force awakens"" (not MY Episode VII)but Rogue One proves that there is a New Hope, and it lays in the fans, not in Disney's wallet. For those of us that have grown up reading Star Wars novels and comics while playing Star Wars games and re-watching both Triologies this film feels like home. Most importantly, after stepping out of the cinema one feels like playing Episode IV immediately, which I will do as soon as I hit SEND on this review.<br/><br/>Mr. Gareth Edwards, BRAVO ZULU!"
"dplowsav","9","3","9","16 December 2016"," Rogue One Is The Star Wars Film True Fans Wanted
","I really wanted to do this review without spoilers, but I wanted to talk about a few 'controversial' elements within the film that has sparked a flurry (some good, some bad) of feedback concerning it. But more on that later. This review contains spoilers, minor at best - I'll not spoil plot elements or the ending.<br/><br/>Rogue One has had me worried ever since I saw Force Awakens. I was not happy with FA, not one bit. While I enjoyed the film to a degree, I found it woefully poor, extremely fast paced and it all seemed like a cheap knock-off on the original trilogy. JJ Abrams is the new 'hip director' and that's not a compliment. It's quite obvious I'm not a fan of Abrams, and I would dear hope he is no longer tied to future films (in addition to certain writers, producers).<br/><br/>But Rogue One is a breath of fresh air and contains none of the recycled material that Force Awakens throws at us. None of the marketing shoved in your face such as the riot stormtrooper, falcon with a new dish, chewie armband toy, to name but a few. Sure, Rogue One is going to cash-in on it, but at least I watched the film and immediately didn't think the director wanted me to buy a new toy.<br/><br/>Another thing that is a welcome change to a star wars movie - the 'force' takes a backseat on this one. Well, mostly. There are still elements concerning a character, but at least its not the main character. Instead we are treated to a film that is about the men and women of the rebel alliance. The grunts, the 'little folk' who don't have any fancy force powers, and have to rough it out like the rest of us. It was refreshing.<br/><br/>This film felt right in every way - the pacing fell in that sweet spot. Not too fast, not too slow. Everything moved along at a steady enjoyable pace. The characters felt fleshed out, interesting and intriguing. Attachment actually grew with the characters. Where as in Force Awakens, everything was racing along at warp 10! You can sit down and actually enjoy the film, take in the plot and relax, rather than think your watching a formula one race.<br/><br/>I honestly do not have a bad word against Rogue One. If anything, I wish it was longer. I really didn't want to leave the cinema, and I was somewhat saddened to have it end. But I will surely go and see it again.<br/><br/>Now, I do want to briefly discuss that 'controversial' element that appeared in the film, and certainly knocked me for six! (SPOILER) Peter Cushings infamous character, Grand Moff Tarkin makes a prominent appearance in Rogue One. Not just a cameo, but he pops up several times in the film. I was not only shocked, but pleasantly surprised, and excited. I love the Tarkin character, and I honestly thought they did a great job on it. The CGI Tarkin was flawless. Some people online have been criticizing. Majority of those seem to be so-called 'Moral High-Ground Chasers' who have nothing better to do than complain all day about how the appearance of a dead man made it in the film. As if its some kind of insult to use him in a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>I like to think of it as a continuation of the legacy and legend that is Peter Cushing, and seeing him portrayed near-flawlessly in Rogue One is a treat I did not expect. The critics don't seem to be taking an issue with the younger Leia, but that's because the actress is still alive. So it seems the criticism is mainly geared towards the fact that Cushing's appearance was used. But the Cushing family were involved in the process and aware of it. Did they take issue? No, they didn't, and they were actively involved.<br/><br/>So quite your whining! Rogue One is an excellent star wars film, and it has more than a few surprising 'nods' to the original trilogy, but they're subtle enough that it never breaks immersion.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"kingsean-44483","10","3","9","14 December 2016"," Best movie in the Series
","I was going into this movie with very low expectations after being very disappointed with last years movie, The force awakens. I had lost very much faith in Disney. After they said they were going to make so many movies, I began to fear that they were going to milk the franchise, but I stand corrected. With my expectations, I went into the cinema and was blown away by the Quality, The Acting, The Story, while not completely original, was huge leap from ""The Force awakens a new hope"".<br/><br/>Its an intense action packed movie and fixes upon many of the issues that other movie has. Even with a female lead, its not an issue. This is not a mary sue character, she is not unstoppable, aside from one scene where she defeats around 7 Stormtroopers with her bare hands ( I didn't count since it happened so fast, but it was something around that.)<br/><br/>The Plot basically revolves around getting the death star plans back so that the rebellion might stand a chance against the Deathstar. Leia Organa and Moff Tarkin re-appears as CGI characters. Though the only reason I noticed this was because I was wondering how they were going to have the characters in the movie without having the looking different, but that didn't really matter as they looked quite good. And the ending is literally a couple a minutes from the start of a new hope.<br/><br/>There are no intense light saber duels in this movie, aside from Vader tearing apart some rebels, but a lightsaber duel is not as much needed when we have large amounts of rebels throwing themselves at even larger amounts of stormtroopers. There is also an intense battle at the final section between the rebel fleet and an imperial fleet. In the end, the entire final hour is just an action packed sequence with intense fighting.<br/><br/>The Characters are very likable. The main characters Jyn erso and Cassian Andor have a final sequence together where they hug each other as they watch seconds before the death star blows them to shreds. As person who thinks men crying is pathetic, I almost, ALMOST shed a tear, it was just to beautiful.<br/><br/>But then there comes a gigantic plot hole where I am either stupid or just don't get it at all.<br/><br/>The Plot revolves around Jyn Erso trying to retrieve the death star plans. The Death star plans was made by Jyn ersos father, and she tries to find him to know where the plans is. At the start of the movie, we see stormtroopers and one of the moffs approach her fathers house and demand him to come so that he can build them a death star since he is apparently a very talented engineer or something.<br/><br/>The problem comes when you realise that the death star plans was already made in Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. You can see this when Poggle the lesser, the Geonosian King gives the Death star plans to Count Dooku before he engages Obiwan and Anakin in Combat. There Storm troopers demanding Jyns father to make the plans. Storm troopers didn't exist in Episode 2? What happened here? I really don't know.<br/><br/>The plot hole left me a big question mark, but it didn't exactly make the Movie less enjoyable either. Still I'd say its the best star wars movie to date, and if Disney can deliver this quality onto future star wars movies, they can go ahead and milk the series for all its worth because I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS!!!"
"ElPresidenteObamame","9","3","9","15 December 2016"," Great for fans of Star Wars!
","I think fans of the Star Wars universe will watch this and be amazed by it. Those who aren't as familiar with the many in jokes are sure to be left with slightly quizzical looks on their faces at points, but for the most part the movie should resonate on some level with everyone in the audience.<br/><br/>As good as it was to watch as a fan of the movies, I don't think it was quite as good of a movie as Force Awakens. What really made this go for me were the many homages to the original films and watching the action scenes unfold with the excitement of a little kid seeing old dreams come true on the big screen! I remember watching the original movies and wishing there was more where that came from, hoping throughout my childhood that one day George Lucas would make a new Star Wars, and then he gave us those prequels... OK movies but not what made so many of us love Star Wars.<br/><br/>This is the movie for all the fans of the originals, the corny, funny, action packed goodness we've been waiting for.<br/><br/>I can only hope that there will be more and better films in the future.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the originals DEFINITELY see this!"
"hanley_chris","Null","3","9","15 December 2016"," The Best Star Wars Film ever.....
","This is a spoiler free review. In Fact, go AND see it to get the facts (thats how good it is)<br/><br/>As you know, the rebels need to get their hands on the plans to the Death Star. This is the reason that the movie is so good. The rebels have a threat that they must stop or the universe suffers. It makes you care about the characters - the force awakens didn't have the same sense of urgency.<br/><br/>This urgency drives the film and bonds the characters together but what also makes this film works, is the universe feels like old Star wars. Its feels like a used one, one that has junk everywhere and the crew did a wonderful job of making it look very real."
"chrisblackgb","9","3","9","14 December 2016"," The Force is strong in this one!
","I have just seen StarWars Rogue One... I am one with the Force, the Force is with me... Film is outstanding, the way it is made... nothing short of spectacular. It pulls the right strings and when characters that we are used to love by now are on screen your heart melts... The new heroes and villains are also good but you cannot really feel too attached and when you watch it you will understand why you never will... Nevertheless, I am all in for Christmas StarWars films every year as it is worth it. The Force has definitely been strong with this one and appears to be strong with Disney. It is not as good as Force Awakens by any stretch, it could be because I for one have been waiting many many years for a good StarWars film and level of nostalgia putted in Force Awakens completely swept me off my feet. This instalment is totally different, it is unlike any other StarWars film you have ever seen in the cinema; hence, it is not a part of the Saga... For instance it is the first StarWars film that does not start with the all so known by now ""flying letters"" introduction of the story. It is being understood that you know what you are watching and are already familiar with the setting. Having said that, for people whom never seen any of the franchise - this is the one to start with to get acquainted with the story. Lastly, I just want to point out that it is truly incredible how they have managed to create such a phenomenal experience that in reality revolves - and it kept ringing in my ears throughout the show and it keeps ringing - around Leia Organa saying that many brave soldiers DIED for those plans... One sentence really mentioned just in passing and if you will ever watch New Hope again, you will never ever look at it the same way... OK one LAST thing - promise... The ending... Ending is... just unbelievably stunning... what they have managed to achieve with modern technology brings tears to my eyes... no spoilers but you will know when you see it... if you are fan of Star Wars you will NOT be disappointed."
"tomdamen007","10","6","24","14 December 2016"," Greatly raises the bar for episode 8
","By far the best production since the original trilogy. <br/><br/>Compared to The Force Awakens, Rogue One is intense, and dark, and deep. The force isn't ridiculously all-powerful and present; the empire is deadly once more; and last but not least: there are no cringing attempts meant to evoke laughter. This movie takes its characters and its audience seriously. <br/><br/>It does borrow materials and characters from previous movies, but without those materials being dominating or annoyingly present. The movie by itself offers a fresh and new story-line. <br/><br/>As we may expect from a Star Wars movie, it is visually a treat. The battles are breathtaking and the audience will experience them as intense. War in Star Wars is deadly and cruel again, and choices in war are difficult and costly in lives.<br/><br/>It raises the bar for the Episode 8 producer, and represents a highly recommended movie for both star wars fanboys and novices."

","The first of the Star Wars Anthology movies has a lot to offer here.<br/><br/>Not only are we back in time to just before the events of A New Hope, but we get to see how events unfolded leading up to the opening scene in the original.<br/><br/>The cast were all fantastic. Felicity Jones, Ben Mendolson and Donnie Yen were the standouts for me. The remaining cast were just as good. <br/><br/>It was great to see Stormtroopers again and even better to see the return of my favourite character, Darth Vader.<br/><br/>The movie is a lot darker in tone compared to some of the other Star Wars films. You kind of expected to know what happens at the end. In that sense it was predicatable. But the journey getting there was one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Director Krennic was the perfect villain and played by a fellow Aussie as well which made me happy. And he was the perfect person to have an argument with Tarkin (resurrected through pretty good CGI). <br/><br/>The only character which I didn't like was Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera. His motives were not clearly explained in the movie. Like me, if you watched the Clone Wars or the Rebels cartoon you know why he does the things he does. For those who don't watch these or read the books you don't get a sense of what he is doing in the movie, besides being a terrorist. It should have been better explained to the audience.<br/><br/>I think this film is far superior to the likes of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. It's just a shame so many scenes in the trailers were not in the movie and that a lot of reshoots has to be done.<br/><br/>But in the end it worked our brilliantly.

","So if you're going to make a movie about popular video game characters and change their names, you should realize that people will notice. But as with everything in life, most people won't notice because they don't understand what they're watching. Lot's of things in this movie were cool conceptually and lots were not. The story was just like a video game in that the characters ran from objective to objective pulling switches. A shameful rendering of Peter Cushing fooled many, but not me. Pitiful word play for the names and planets. A bloated Darth Vader helmet with red eyes was surprising as well. In episode IV his eyes had a ""red tint"" but were not red. NOW, thats not to say that Darth didn't have a replacement helmet at some point with fully red eyes but why so bloated in the neck. Also why did he carry himself like a teenage girl when he walked across the bridge of the Star Destroyer?? Go back and watch Darth take girly steps. Even in the slaughter scene he was a bit effeminate. Just sayin, no offense to the effeminate among us. Watch the originals and Darth's helmet changes gradually in each film until the perfect rendition we are treated to in 'Return of the Jedi'. Forrest Whittaker is so bad it's flabbergasting, but then again when was he ever good? ""Im one with the force the force is with me"" was the signal that Disney no longer cared about Star Wars and clearly had no idea what these films are about. There's no arguing about that... They see Darth Vader as a one liner character like the terminator. I love James Earl Jones, but he sounds like he's 175 years old now and it was super sad. BUT, it was cool that they understood that all these Mofos were gonna die by the end , and they did, which was legit AF. I could keep going but I wont because it was a MASTER PIECE compared to.........'The Last Jedi' (barf barf barf barf barf barf barf and barf) ALSO the battle droid they stole from KOTOR was BY FAR the best character in the movie."
"invisibleunicornninja","4","2","5","15 March 2018"," I guess its ok? Forgettable - but ok.
","I'm not a Star Wars person. When I saw this movie in theaters, I hadn't seen any of the other Star Wars movies. The only reason I went to see this movie was because I was dragged along by pretty much my entire family. Due to all the hype around this movie and the good reviews, I was actually planning on enjoying this movie. I didn't. <br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - This movie is relatively well shot. Most of the effects are ok. The sound design is pretty bad, and its pretty hard to understand what the characters are saying most of the time. <br/><br/>Plot - The plot is simplistic and full of holes. The first half of this movie is somewhat decent, but after that it quickly falls apart. A lot of the character motivations are flimsy. Overall, aside from a few scenes, the script is terrible. <br/><br/>Action - The only thing that kept me from screaming at how stupid and illogical all the fighting tactics were was the fact that I was in a movie theater. The action in this move is so bad. I'd heard that they're bad in the previous movies - but that's no excuse. <br/><br/>Characters - Most of these characters are extremely unlikable. The only one I liked was a robot (K-2SO). The characters are dumbed down and infuriating. The acting may be good, but the script isn't.

","As a long time Star Wars fan and collector of course I was interested in seeing this film and add it to my video collection.<br/><br/>We knew most characters would not make it into the storyline of the first film.<br/><br/>I am disappointed with the film.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera character. He did nothing. Save Jyn then disappeared just to send her on her way to get the Death Star plans. Killed off before half way through the film. Disappointing.<br/><br/>New droid K-2SO. Did not like the character at all. Former Imperial Droid. They sure did not reprogram that droid well. I did not like most of the characters responses & actions. So the only good droid activity in the film was the R2-D2 and C-3PO appearance.<br/><br/>CGI Tarkin I liked how the character looked but they did not get the voice, close but not quite good enough. The short CGI Leia. One word & very short screen appearance. Did not really liked how the character looked, not as good a job as they did on Tarkin.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing Vader. Does not get much screen time but I was disappointed on how his voice sounded. They got James to do the voice again so why did it sound like they turned the sound down on the voice? I did not like that, otherwise his limited screen time was good.<br/><br/>The final battle with the X-Wings and the AT-AT's was good. Overall though some of the effects were not up to Star Wars standards.<br/><br/>So sorry to say as a long time fan I was disappointed & awaiting The Last Jedi."

","Excellent movie if you're a fan and even if you're not, it's good all its own. But like any movie, there's always room for improvement and the only issue I really had with it is Donnie Yen's character. <br/><br/>The writing for him was not very good at all and it felt almost like they couldn't figure out what to do with his role to make it more relevant to the story. His opening fight scene was one of the best I've seen in any movie and it was downhill from there. Mr. Yen deserved better in the writing for his part in my opinion. Repeating the same line over and over quickly became annoying and there was so much more that could have been said and done with his ability as an actor. He clearly had a grasp of the ""force"" and I was expecting him to be some kind of spiritual mentor even if he wasn't ""officially"" classified as a Jedi and perhaps not central to the plot. The rest of the cast did very well and each role was clearly established.<br/><br/>As for the story, the only other improvement that I would have expected but wasn't entirely necessary was for more on the back- story of Forest Whittaker's character.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a 9 out of 10 for me and will definitely be in my collection when the Blu-ray comes out!!"

","For me this is a Star Wars movie, although I admit it contains some weird, unusual elements which are not generally welcome by many fans. Still I felt the Star Wars feeling for the first time since ROTJ. It presented complex worlds and the empire, space combats, ground assaults were presented as it has to be on the big screen. <br/><br/>The story is reasonable and good: The only thing which is hard to accept its more darker tone than the original trilogies (prequels and the latest night-mare under SW name better to be forgotten forever). The plot is like a dirty dozen plot. We have a bunch of not really nice people (it was already said by Cassian in the movie) or lost"" people (like Jyn or the blind Jedi Kung Fu Master) for a suicide mission in the world of SW. Dark, isn't it? It is a SW tale, but for the adults and I liked it. <br/><br/>I liked all the characters as well: I liked even the Jedi Kung Fu Master who lost his eyesight and his lightsabre as well. It worked and it was fresh. And the Universe is big much bigger than our world, so it could be weird, but far more enjoyable than the lame, Tatooine folk costume uniformed jedis. I understand that Darth Vader's fight scene was completely useless, but it was so good. Let that amount of special effect be afforded for the sake of entertainment.<br/><br/>And what I liked the most: I said during watching it, a SW movie without uselessly starring the droids. And then Bang! They were there as cherry on the top, but their timing and limited presence were just perfect.<br/><br/>I would score it 9.5, as it was not perfect only for its darker tone, as SW is a fairy-tale for me not a tragedy. (Although I understand why everybody has to be perished, but after some time I would be able to fiction a better ending)."
"tapio_hietamaki","8","2","5","3 February 2017"," An uneven space war movie that's a departure from the Star Wars formula
","This review spoils the entire movie so don't read if you haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>There are all kinds of Star Wars fans - those who adore the old movies but hate the prequels, those who defend the prequels and accuse 'The Force Awakens' of being a sell-out and a copy-cat, and those who think the animated show 'The Clone Wars' or the video games 'Knights of the Old Republic' are the best thing to come out of the franchise.<br/><br/>I'm in the camp that liked 'The Force Awakens' but wasn't too impressed with 'Rogue One'. Maybe I'm just a nostalgia fanboy who can't stomach anything new and different - TFA did the Star Wars formula by the book, whereas 'Rogue One' is daring and original. 'Rogue One' is not a proper installment in the Star Wars saga but rather an addition to one of the installments. It leads up to one of the most iconic movies in history. It's a difficult task, especially 40 years after that movie came out. If you watch 'Rogue One' and 'Star Wars' (also called 'Episode IV: A New Hope') back to back the difference in age is noticeable. The pacing is different, the special effects are different, the tone is different.<br/><br/>But 'Rogue One' has a tone that's different from any previous Star Wars movie. It's darker and faster, it introduces many characters and kills them off by the end, it features political scheming, and it has morally gray acts of terrorism. Other Star Wars movies are fantasy adventure: 'Rogue One' is more like a war movie. Its characters are agents of political powers, soldiers and spies, and it tells the story of a single operation in a larger conflict. It just happens to take place in space.<br/><br/>Does it work? I would say yes, although it stumbles at places. The script feels a bit unfinished at places, a sign that there were many changes to the movie during production. The character of Cassian is introduced as a back-stabbing scoundrel but ends up having a heart of gold, a bit like schizophrenic, exaggerated version of Han Solo's arc in Episode IV. The scene where Jyn's father is killed by friendly fire seems like it sets up Cassian as a troubled and twisted antihero but doesn't follow through, leaving the character half-baked. Saw Gerrera is similarly set up as an interesting, complex political agent, but is killed off before he has a chance to do much of anything.<br/><br/>Highlights of the movie were the intense space battles and the brief appearance of Darth Vader at the end, and I liked the scene where Chirrut walks through laser cross-fire unharmed. Maybe I'm just a sucker for space fantasy.<br/><br/>I have to mention the controversial CGI recreations of real actors. Peter Cushing died in 1994, and yet here he is on the big screen again in a new role, and he has a surprising amount of screen time. Carrie Fisher only appears briefly, but her appearance has unfortunate implications as she tragically passed away when the movie was still in cinemas and she is due to appear in future Star Wars installments as well, making the end of 'Rogue One' a rather morbid experience in hindsight."
"thecallingisnear","4","2","5","26 January 2017"," Well, what was I doing before this movie?
","I couldn't have been more disappointed. Is it because she's pretty? I am not sure. Everyone follows some young women with putoffish personality, isn't a jedi, and doesn't seem all that emotionally interested in being on screen. She wasn't horrible, but she could have been replaced and I wouldn't doubt anyone else they chose would be better overall.<br/><br/>Cassian was fair to midland, as the old saying goes. He seemed realistic and believable. He doesn't have much chemistry with his costar, but I think both of them know thats on her.<br/><br/>K2 - fantastically voiced and funny lines..... that are totally out of place in a storyline where C3PO is the most cutting edge thing that resembles a human. The lines were like haha but please, a robot repeating that twice for sarcasm? Come on. And his movements were far too human like when you realize the other 6 films didn't do any thing like this motion.<br/><br/>Darth Vader didn't seem like Vader except the few seconds walking in the light. The electronic tone was off on JEJ's voice! And it was all too fast. He deserved another scene but apparently it was worse than these? The storyline was a bit (understatement) rushed and messy. Couldn't you have made it better for goodness sakes. The bouncing around lacked execution. It sadly felt like some great college graduate's first film.<br/><br/>I didn't mind Leia at the end - it was real enough because they must've used her real life eyes and movements under the cgi. Its Tarkin that spoiled the film. If he were able to see this he would constantly be saying, did someone steal a wax museum replica of me and what's with my eyes??! If technology isn't up to where it needs to be to make it work - get a live actor who resembles Peter Cushing, you amateur hour goofs! Seriously. How did they not watch that and go, ""this is so wrong and distracting..."" I guess when you're just giddy you're making a SW film, believability and continuity are tossed out. I am easily entertained - and wasn't a whole lot watching this! Grade C-"
"funkymei","4","2","5","27 January 2017"," Surprising for a Star Wars Movie
","Rogue One opens up to a rainy scene, grassland plains between rolling hills, with a little girl running in the mud. She goes home to her parents and her father who tells her ""it's time"". This episode in the Star Wars franchise started out as any other. I was expecting a movie with the same plot lines, and typical characters without any depth. But I was surprised by the Star Wars movie. We open up to a seven of the girl years later, after her mother has been killed, and her. Father has been taken by the Empire. She manages to escape an Empire truck with the help of the resistance. She learns that her father is with the Empire against his will, making plans for the Death Star, which the resistance is trying to obtain. And thus begins the mission of movie. At points in Rogue One there is some tension between the characters, which lead to these sad backstory type sentimental lines, which don't really work for the movie. But these moments don't take away from the plot line. From the star of the movie comparisons can be seen between the markets of different planets and the Syria/Middle East conflict. The Empire can be seen on the planet, with their big militarized trucks mining and looting special crystals from temples to use to power the Death Star. They're going through the busy streets, storm troopers following behind. Then gunfire erupts as a rebel group starts to shoot at the trucks. The storm troopers fight back with large army robots and grenades, all the while civilians re caught in the crossfire. The girl, Jyn, fights with resistance member Cassian, who kills another member of a different rebellion. They are captured and taken back to their base, which turns out to be led by Jyn's uncle who raised her after her father was captured. Jyn is reunited with her uncle who she's not too pleased to see after he abandoned her. He apologizes saying it was necessary to save her, after which they make plans to take the Death Star plans. Jyn is joined by a reverse team of resistance fighters. The ending scene of rogue one seems very much like a war scene. Bombs are being thrown as imperial walkers crush the land, and by the end, all of the main characters are killed, a first for a Star Wars movie. One of the reasons the episode stands out against all the others is was because of how much more realistic it was (well, as realistic as a Star Wars movie can get. In the end, you see Cassian and Jyn struggle to the shore of a beach, all of the comrades dead, their mission a success, they collapse onto the sand as the death ray blasts the planet into oblivion."
"rlaine","9","2","5","17 January 2017"," I expected it to be good and it was
","I grew up with the original trilogy and all the merchandise in the 80s, so I have lived and breathed Star Wars, it's a part of me and I know the originals inside out. In the 90s I was a young adult and interested in other things, so the second trilogy passed by quietly - altho I did see each film. I liked Force Awakens, it was a trip back to childhood and a well made Star Wars movie. <br/><br/>Rogue One had my expectations high for a couple of reasons, #1 it being a new original Star Wars movie, but close #2 being the director Gareth Edwards. I absolutely loved his movie Monsters. Godzilla wasn't quite as good, but the atmosphere was there. I think Edwards has a great eye for cinematography, use of close ups in contrast to wide open spaces and great locations. He also clearly understands the need of drama and buildup and not going for straight up action. This was very clear in Monsters, which is basically a talkie, not much action there. Even Godzilla has relatively little action and a long build up, but the whole movie didn't work quite as well as Monsters.<br/><br/>Rogue One looks amazing, everything is spot on. Cinematography, locations, fx, the cast and how they look. It was great seeing men with sideburns and vanishing hair, it was of course obvious to style them according to the first Star Wars movie made in the late 70's for continuity, but it was very well done. The cast doesn't look like they are superstars, they look real and gritty.<br/><br/>The story works. In the beginning the movie moves quickly from one place to another, but it sticks together quite well. It's basically quite a straight forward movie, even to a point of being maybe a tad too long for what it has to tell. I was surprised how much this movie mirrors todays conflicts in middle east and the fact that it clearly takes the terrorist point of view. I'm also quite surprised how easily people have accepted this or not seen the connection. There is even a holy city by the name of Jedha and there is a real city of Jeddah close to Mecca. It really is not that far fetched to see rebels as extremist terrorists and empire as the ""world police"".<br/><br/>Acting is good. While Felicity Jones' portrayal of Jyn Erso is not quite as interesting as it could be, I'd say Cassian Andor by Diego Luna is a well written and portrayed character. I also liked Ben Mendelsohn's Krennic as the villain, very well acted. K-2SO as the C3PO style comic relief works perfectly, this is really a perfect example of a well done comic relief. The rest of the cast - while quite big - are all good and interesting, well portrayed characters.<br/><br/>Actions scenes are amazingly done, even tho I'm not a huge fan of action, but here it works.<br/><br/>After the amazing use of music for atmosphere in Monsters, I was slightly disappointed with the soundtrack in Rogue One. The John Williams connection is there, the original themes when ever Vader or a familiar character is on screen, but the rest of the themes are a bit so-so. There are variations of the original themes, which made me think ""that's not how it's supposed to go"", slightly distracting. And the themes didn't feel emotionally that fitting. I understand you can't go with an electronic soundtrack for a Star Wars movie, but I may have tried a bit different themes and orchestrations for a movie like this.<br/><br/>All in all highly recommended. Stands on it's own, but there are spine tingling moments for Star Wars fans, especially in the end. While Force Awakens was a bit of a pastiche of the originals, this one takes it's own approach for most part. It's more of a sci-fi war drama, but with a proper dose of Star Wars we know and love."
"cathalokane","9","2","5","10 January 2017"," *Spoilers* A true Star Wars film, made with love.
","This is a serious Star Wars film that primes the watcher for the greatest movie trilogy ever created.<br/><br/>I've read a lot about Rogue One over the past week or two. I've seen it 3 times, twice at IMAX 3D and once in normal 2d. I've read some pretty cutting criticism, and seen some overly friendly reviews. I'm naturally a critical person and I was worried for this film, primarily because the director Gareth Edwards made a film that I didn't finish despite having paid a cinema entry ticket; Godzilla. I left halfway through.<br/><br/>On my first watch of Rogue One, I briefly fell asleep halfway through. Admittedly I had *ahem* had a late night the evening before... Christmas drinks. I think it's fair to say that this film has some flaws and one of those flaws is a flaw that it shares with Godzilla. It suffers from a slightly bloated mid-section. It's not a major flaw, but a flaw nonetheless. Other flaws include the slightly forced fan service; the inclusion of C3PO and R2D2 felt a tad annoying and pointless, as did the addition of the ""Cantina ruffian"" in Jedha. We don't need this in every Star Wars film. We really don't. These are minor issues.<br/><br/>This film is packing the greatest 45 minutes of action yet seen in any Star Wars film, and the rest of the film is simply an elaborate set up for this crescendo. It's a long time since I had to suppress an urge to punch the air in public, but there I was witnessing the Rebel fleet exit hyper space above Scarif - to the tune of John Williams Death Star attack music - as they arrived to support the Rogue One mission on a crazy suicide, all-or-nothing attack to get the plans on the planet below. It's exhilarating, hair-raising stuff that felt like the arrival of the Riders of Rohan at the fields of Pellenor, except... it's Star Wars. A great moment.<br/><br/>Every Star Wars fan knows the end result of this story, but the tension as the attack gathered pace was beautifully crafted by the director, ensuring that although we all know what is coming there is still a room full of tension. There has been criticism of the character development in this story, but these criticisms feel vapid to me. Enough time was given to understand the motivation of all of the motley band of Scarif attackers. We didn't need to understand every single life nuance of Boba Fett to enjoy his character in Return of the Jedi so why do we suddenly need it here - that's not what Star Wars is about. What we do get is a tragic story arc for every character, all of whom gather under the banner of the Rebel alliance. They all have different histories, motivations, and reasons for being there, but it all comes down to the urge to fight back against a clear evil.<br/><br/>They all make the ultimate sacrifice to give their cause a chance, and I found it exhilarating and life-affirming, sad but uplifting.<br/><br/>The musical score does the story justice in the absence of John Williams, plucking at the heart strings when ""Star Dust"" breaks at the sight of her father, not seen since childhood, and lifting you on a wave as the action scenes unfold, with a stirring new Imperial theme as we see Vader foiled at the end staring after the Corellian Corvette that makes off with the plans.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews I have seen have spent a lot of bandwidth moaning about quibbles, like the use of hardware seen in other films (RLM tediously spend a lot of airtime complaining about the use of At-Ats), or the fan service references, or the effects on Tarkin or Leia. These additions are not simply cheap attempts to give one positive reinforcement, but feel to me more like successful attempts to make this film fit with the feel and atmosphere of the original trilogy. I think this is done very successfully indeed.<br/><br/>This film feels like a genuinely excellent addition to the original trilogy. It's serious in a way that the Force Awakens sometimes wasn't and it felt to me like a Star Wars film aimed towards an adult audience in thrall to the original films. So that's a hell of a lot of people. I think Gareth Edwards did brilliantly, and this is a more fitting addition to the films than the Force Awakens. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Force Awakens, and will do so again, but am fully aware of it's slightly infuriating imperfections and occasional cartoony feel. Rogue One has none of this.<br/><br/>The story is serious, emotional, fun in parts but never cheesy, exhilarating for the last hour, and it achieves a staggering amount in sending us off to a New Hope with a fresh but heart-warming perspective. If anything, it does what I thought would be utterly impossible, and it makes the original Star Wars: A New Hope beginning feel even more serious and dangerous. It crystallises the vicious threat posed by Vader, and grounds the vulnerability and desperation of the Rebel alliance more than any previous film. It sets up the arrival of Luke Skywalker and his sister in a way that I never expected.<br/><br/>Well done Gareth Edwards, and thank you!"
"matt_hew","6","2","5","9 January 2017"," A Decent Movie that struggles to decide whether it's 'Star Wars' or not
","A decent enough movie that struggles with a design by committee plot whilst trying to decide whether the film is part of Star Wars or something else.<br/><br/>This begins from the outset, there's the familiar 'A long time ago' but no rolling intro (understandable) the music plays, it sounds like Star Wars but not quite... and it is this vibe that plays out through the entire movie.<br/><br/>In theory the story is solid, the outcome of the movie (like Ep.III) is already set – its just a question of how to get there. However this is where the problems start. Everything is squeezed into the film, some new looking TIE Fighters and some different types of Stormtroopers, they want the Force to be in there so they introduce a cliché martial artist character and there's the token droid etc etc... mixed in with loads of action.<br/><br/>And visually it's great, but it seems to be at the expense of everything else. In between all of the CGI, recreating the 70's outfits and paying homage to the other Star Wars movies (again!!) they forget about the characters. All typical, uninspired and under developed – the only one you feel bothered about at the end is K-2SO. Even including Vader seems a bit pointless, as other have said the scenes featuring him have no impact on the story and ultimately serve to force the conclusion of the film to tie in with Ep.IV. <br/><br/>Finally a question: does every 'new' Star Wars Film now have to pay homage to its predecessors?<br/><br/>Is it a contractual requirement now that in order to be considered worthy with fans / critics quotes and scenes (or with Force Awakens the entire movie) have to be recreated, spun or shoe horned into the story? Has any other franchise felt the need to do this to the extremes that the Star Wars movies now do!<br/><br/>Maybe it's all Obi Wan's fault when he said to Anakin: ""You'll be the death of me"" – who knows!?<br/><br/>""Rebellions Are Built On Homage"""
"jacobhunt6","Null","2","5","6 January 2017"," Utterly amazing
","As a Star Wars fan, I can honestly say that for the first ninety minutes of this film, I was utterly unimpressed. After the excitement and pleasure that was ""The Force Awakens"", the first two acts of ""Rogue One"" were a dull disappointment with only brief moments of nostalgic excitement - but they were more than justified and redeemed by the thrilling third act that truly glued the film together. The brief moments of Darth Vader's cameo and the reintroduction of Grand Moff Tarkin were impressive, and the visual effects stunned, while the performance of Mads Mikkelsen was utterly spell-binding. But it wasn't until the Tobruk-esque third act that I truly appreciated the beauty of this film. Its dramatic climax, including a showing of the true power of Darth Vader, a reveal of Princess Leia, and an emotional and incredible battle scene to rival the best of Star Wars, was far beyond my expectations and justified the re-shoots of the third act tenfold. While the characters seemed cliché at times, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna performed fantastically and were contrasted beautifully by the performance of Ben Mendelsohn as the film's primary antagonist. I can only commend the writers and directors on the risks they were willing to take with this darkened, gritty approach to the Star Wars universe, and say that every single one of the risks paid off in the end. Utterly amazing."

","I am sorry to say this film was a major disappointment. The excessive hype led me to expect more. Having seen the other STAR WARS and enjoyed them, I felt there is a basis for my remarks.<br/><br/>The story line was difficult to follow and the scenes shifted too quickly to get a firm grasp as to what was going on. This is particularly true of the battle episodes. A war movie, it is, but one could often focus for only a few seconds before another aspect of the battle came up. Less scene shifting and longer exposure was needed. To see droves of storm troopers singlehandedly being mowed down was overdone, too.<br/><br/>Some of the visuals were impressive and a few scenic settings attractive. I allude to the beach and sunset scenes. It was a nice touch to have Carrie Fisher appear at the end of the picture, also."
"virindra","6","2","5","5 January 2017"," I expected more from this movie.
","I am not a star wars fan, but I can enjoy a good movie. In my opinion Rogue 1 had lots of flaws, therefore I could not enjoy it. First of all, I liked the actors and actresses, although some of them had small parts (but there are no small parts...).<br/><br/>In the beginning Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen, great actor) says he has to work on this disaster machine. If he doesn't go, the bad guys will find someone else to make this machine. Then why did the bad guys go all the way through the galaxy to find him? There is this planet where Jyn Erso can find a tape to get the blueprint of this disaster machine. To enter this planet you have to go through a circle because the rest of the planet has a protection shield. Really? If a planet has a protection shield, this shield will orbit around other planets and the planet in the shield will crash against the shield. Okay, let's say this is science fiction and somehow it is possible, if I am a bad guy and I invented a shield around a planet, why just one? Why did they not create a back-up shield within the first protection shield? So the good guys have a plan. With a very small spaceship they push a very big spaceship of the bad guys against an other spaceship of the bad guys. And when the big spaceships collide they crash into each other and explode. In reality this could never happen. The big spaceship would only bump against the other big spaceship and that's just it. I wonder why the people who created these images did not say ""wait, this is just stupid"". When I push a big truck against an other big truck with my small car, the trucks will not explode.<br/><br/>At the end Darth Vader kills a couple of good guys with his light saber. That looked very stupid. If he has the power to squeeze their throats, why did he bother to wave with his light saber? What was the purpose of Jyn Erso to be in prison at the beginning of the movie? If Jyn Erso had a rough life, how did she manage to keep the crystal she got from her father? If Galen Erso did not know whether his daughter was alive or not, he had not seen her for many years, why did he named the tape after his daughter's nickname? What if his daughter decided to become a chef, why did he put this huge responsibility in her hands and not in the hands of Saw? Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) gets killed by storm troopers. After getting killed Baze Malbus comes over to his friend to say goodbye. Where were the storm troopers at that moment? This movie did not make any sense to me."

","Hmm, where to start, after Force Awakens hit the theaters last year, i said that i will not watch anything new that comes from Disney and has Star Wars in the name, i was so disappointed, even George Lucas prequels where magnificent achievements when you compare them to JJ Abrams directing. But somehow when Rogue One came to theaters in my town i said to myself i would go and watch it, and yes i must admit i had a great fun but nothing more from that, it is action and just action, like watching Rambo movie just set in galaxy far far away. I must admit i like the look of new planets especially planet Jedha, yes you can see the middle eastern influences especially city of Jerusalem but i like that a lot, that part of the movie reminded me on maybe the best star wars video game Knights Of The Old Republic, and yes i had a feeling from the beginning to an end that i am playing some good star wars video game, not watching movie, like mix of Rogue Squadron, KOTOR and Battlefront. Acting in movie is just i don't know what to say but there is no acting, maybe just from Ben Mendhelson as main Villain Orson Krennic, he really looks like ambitious man of Empire real villain without emotions, and Mads Mikkelsen as father of Jyn Erso, others are not worth mentioning, maybe Forest Whitaker but his role was too short. The biggest down was acting of Felicity Jones, so dumb and one of the worst acting i have seen on big screen. Even with all this flaws this movie is better 10 times than Force Awakens and feels more like Real Star Wars, but not expect too much, you will not find great acting, story and emotions and spiritual deepness like in first movies, but if you just want to watch good action, great filming locations, bunch of star destroyers and TIE Fighters these movie is for you. I give it 6/10, even Edwards is better director than Jar Jar Abrams."
"deathrays","6","2","5","2 January 2017"," Could have been great
","This had the potential to be a great star wars movie. It had it's own voice and story (unlike force awakens), and the story could slot into the original trilogy perfectly. The move makers nailed the star wars look, it had all the vehicles, all the robots, the aliens etc. It looked fantastic.<br/><br/>And yet I couldn't help but look at my watch towards the end. It dragged through the middle and there was very little light to balance all the dark moments.#spoilers - every single main character dies! Every single one.. half of them were never really developed so you don't really care, but still. There's a few token 'rousing speeches'about hope and fighting against the odds for a cause, but there's nothing hopeful or joyful at all throughout the movie. I appreciate you need conflict in a story, you need danger to raise the stakes. But there's also a lot to be said for ""they all lived happily ever after"", or ""some of them lived happily ever after"" or even ""the ewoks had a BBQ at the end"". <br/><br/>Basically, star wars to me has always been about escapist fun. Simple stories, good guys defeat the bad guys with cool aliens and robots sprinkled throughout. I don't need to see the agony of war or saving private Ryan sci-fi edition. It was just a bit too much for me. I didn't hate it, but I'm not in any hurry to see it again."

","Excellent but not quite. Tonally a very different film to what you may expect but part of the Star Wars universe for sure and different in its look and feel. Although it beautifully shot and acted my issue with it is not an an issue with the film, its the fact that its prequel to one of my favorite films. So throughout the movie your waiting for those familiar moments to connect it to the start of Episode 4 and don't get me wrong this does deliver. However its all a bit anti climatic, did I really care about all the cliff hanger moments leading up to the start of episode 4? ...Well no actually I didn't care for them at all because I knew they would succeed in their mission and their ultimate fate either way didn't bother me...and that ultimately bothers me. I should care about the characters, I want to care about the characters. Thererfore for me it wasn't really a story worth telling. Its a geeks dream with lots of little easter eggs all over the place. Overall it was like a trivia movie that answers questions that I didn't ask e.g. Did you know who invented the death star and have you ever wondered what their story was? Did/do you want to know and do/did you care ? If you did or do then this film is amazing and tells it in a brilliant way. Its a disjointed film, dark for a majority of its run time but then constrained too not fully unleashing in the way that it could have done - they should have been a bit more braver and gone darker. But at the the end of the day Disney is writing the cheques, so there will always be limitations. All in all though its enjoyable and its STAR WARS so enjoy it and watch it on the big screen. Good to see some familiar faces on the big screen :)."
"markjayaweera2003","9","2","5","31 December 2016"," Best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi
","**alert some spoilers**<br/><br/>I never thought it would have been possible to catch some semblance of the spirit of the originals. But this 21st century film crew with Gareth Edwards at the helm have managed to pull it off.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in a multiplex at a shopping centre in Chadstone a suburb of Melbourne as I am in the city visiting my brother who lives here. He is seeing it for the second time. We both agreed, this is the best star wars film since the originals. We both agreed as long term star wars fans that this was far superior movie to The Force Awakens of Disneys reboot of the franchise in 2015. Rogue One is a very impressive film on so many levels. First they managed to put together a very good cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses. Who put in very good performances. The special effects were very good. The story was good leading in perfectly to a new hope. The most iconic villain in movie history is back. Can there ever be a proper star wars movie without Darth Vader. They also managed get Darth Vader exactly like he was in the originals. Which was missing in the prequels There is a jaw dropping sequence where they managed to resurrect that superb British actor from the 1970s Peter Cushing. The final shot was particularly moving as they showed or resurrect a young Carrie Fisher as Princess Lea. Carrie Fisher sadly passed away a few days ago at the age of 60. Carrie Fisher was a well loved actress, so when her character said ""Hope"". You know the magic and wonder of the originals have been finally captured. Albeit briefly, here in the almost 17th year of the 21st century. You can scarcely believe that old school movie making style like this which gave the originals its wonder has been captured at least for Rogue One by a new generation of movie makers working under Disney. I would like to congratulate everyone involved with the making of this fine film. From the actors/actresses to the behind the scenes film crews. As a long term star wars fan after the prequels and The Force Awakens. Which were enjoyable but didn't have the spirit, awe and wonder of the originals. Rogue One managed to get back that spirit for a new gen of movie goers. In short this movie is a perfect marriage of old school movie making which many thought was a dead art with modern day 21st century advanced computer generated imagery and voice synthesizer techniques. Where they could resurrect a long dead Peter Cushing or the Darth Vader of the originals convincingly. Amazing film because of this and very worthy addition to the star wars cannon. Which after the Disney take over recently, means the now 40 year old sw universe is back in our lives and not going away anytime soon. A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi Rogue One The prequels The force awakens Also it helped that rogue one was close to the star wars originals time line which prequels didn't have."

","Saw this 2 weeks back. Actually I liked the first hour or so , but then it dropped in quality. I thought the villains were the best in this outcome and certainly way better then the heroes. The blind swordsman ? what was that about ? referring to Zatoichi ? gimmick it is . The rebels attack and there are 2 destroyers just laying there doing practically nothing or are not capable ? just stupid . At least invent a reason for being so lame like f.i. they are not full equipped due to holiday-season or home for Christmas. And we get some more non original stuff in the last hour such as the way to drop the shield ( actually they find this switch rather easy do they not ) , the search for the plans is also a copy from SW4. The only thing original is that all the heroes die. Though the execution of it is rather Disney , most certainly with the 2 main characters on the beach . The one who pressed for such an ending should be grounded.Again , this could have been the best SW since The empire strikes back , but it is not, even when they incorporate some of its elements. A five out of ten is about correct. Now let's hope that the new Blade Runner is not messed up."
"duncanbourne","6","2","5","29 December 2016"," Nice film shame about the acting
","There is a great deal to like about this film. It has some excellent action sequences, some nicely realised planetscapes and a well used look to all the equipment that reflects the ethos of the original (not to mention a few in jokes for the fans). PLUS!... Well spoiler alerts later. However the area that really, really lets it down is in character development...there isn't any. I can not think of one character that was anything other than a flat cardboard caricature with the possible exception of the robot K-2S0, who is marvellously voiced by Alan Tudyk, which says a lot really.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES<br/><br/>The CGI Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin. Well the estate of Peter Cushing are fine with it but ti does open up a whole field of ethics regarding the reviving of dead actors to star in new films. That aside the CGI worked quite well and shows just how far we have come with the craft. I also liked the final scenes with Darth Vader which were actually quite terrifying. Finally the best thing about the film, in an age where everything has to have a happy ending, is that everyone dies. Just a shame that you don't feel enough for them to care."
"stermix501","7","2","5","23 December 2016"," This might bring back the lost fans
","Did SW7 hurt you? Well this might partially heal you.<br/><br/>Despite some unjustified scenario points (like Jyn's mother revealing herself and shooting, or how the Empire soldiers despite all their technology could not locate Jyn under the rock, etc,etc), the overall plot stands fine. It is dark, serious, and targets clearly a more adult audience than the previous movie. All the 7 y.o. kids (about 50 of them!) brought to the cinema by silly parents believing they would see one more Disney tale were annoyed and bothered with their behavior the rest of the cinema. This is a solid indication of saving the saga! <br/><br/>Biased from previous failure I wouldn't watch this if Donnie Yen was not in. My hopes were satisfied. He is the Donnie a fan would expect and although he didn't get a light saber (despite being more close to the force than anyone holding one in SW7), his presence and character portrayal will stay in audience's heart. It was certainly an attempt to please and interest the Far East Asian audience, but it was a pleasant one. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones was an other great presence. Unlike Daisy Ridley, she didn't have all the spotlights on her. Although following a female lead, we didn't have the feeling of a Barbie/Hunger-games crap targeting under age girls. And that's a win-win for Felicity and Gareth Edwards. <br/><br/>K2SO was another great addition. Mature acting with good sense of humour, was a refreshing take on how an android of that era should be, making C3PO only good for scrap. <br/><br/>And finally Darth Vader was there. Finally some good old bad-ass baddie we missed so much. His guest star appearance was enough to rise Rogue One to new levels of approval. Something must be done to somehow keep him in SW universe, or there will be no future for the saga.<br/><br/>All in all a good film. Not a great one as already most die hard fans acclaim, but an acceptable one. One that deserves a place next to the 6 older movies and far from the last one. Watch and appreciate it now. Before Ridley-Boyega pair return to remind you that you are no more a SW fan."
"blanbrn","6","2","5","23 December 2016"," A good way to make Vader mad! An okay prequel that sets up ""A New Hope"" just fine!
","Being a ""Star Wars"" fan I had to check out this new film called ""Rogue One"" and though nothing great still it entertains and fits into the saga just fine as it leads everything into episode 4 just fine. Set just after episode 3 and just before the happenings of ""A New Hope"", this chapter centers around the rebel alliance and a risk type of a move to steal the ""Death Star"". It kind of involves ordinary and common people, combined with warriors and of course rebels and rogues who come together to work as a team! It's all speared by Jyn(Felicity Jones)along with guidance from flight fighter Cassian Andor(Diego Luna)and droid K-2So. Along the way plenty of battles are fought with gunfire and skill. Yet behind it all is a plan and plot to help the rebels overtake the ""Death Star"" from the evil empire, overall pretty simple story that entertains and reveals a path and gateway to launch the other chapters of the saga, plus the appearance from ""Lord Vader"" was a presence shattering feel of doom and command for any viewer."
"Talia_the_StoryMaker","8","2","5","22 December 2016"," Very solid and satisfying despite not being as engaging as I might've liked at times
","Though I thoroughly enjoyed the original trilogy and liked The Force Awakens, I'm not exactly an obsessive fan of Star Wars; I like it, but I haven't even bothered to watch the films multiple times. But even for someone who lacks that craving for fan service, Rogue One managed to fill the bill for being an enjoyable movie. It's far from perfect, considering the characters aren't THAT compelling and I often found myself simply failing to track with what was happening in the movie and actually losing focus, but honestly, at the end of the day, it's was still very satisfying. They took a pretty small story focus - one small element that went into the events of Episode IV happening - and managed to create an entire movie out of it. Ultimately, I think that small focus is the most intriguing element of the movie and a major reason I liked it so much - because I just found it so interesting that they managed to do so much with one small thing (not saving the galaxy, just one step to saving the galaxy!) and it sort of sent a message of the impact of one's actions. It's not a matter of being THE one to ""save the day"", but doing something that ensures that other people will be able to continue the fight you started, and how utterly valuable that can be. It's about being brave and doing the right thing, even if you're not the one who will be remembered, because your actions still make a difference. Having a lot of disparate characters thrown in actually helped with this - each character may have not gotten an enormous amount of development or especially deep characterization, but they all were a part of a story that was essential to the salvation of a galaxy. Remarkably, the lack of detailed characterization actually created a feel that served the story's ""message"", because it showed that even the people we didn't remember for their personalities or who didn't seem particularly special can be part of what it takes to do what needs to be done to impact countless lives.<br/><br/>Maybe this wasn't really an incredibly engrossing film with an immaculately crafted story and characters, but it was still very well done in many regards (with the action scenes, visual impact, and overall sense of intensity and darkness when necessary being particularly excellent highlights) and definitely had that Star Wars feel, and even if it wasn't quite ""amazing"" overall, it had this amazing kernel of goodness, of a truly heroic story, that I couldn't help but love."
"jonas_bassforce","8","2","5","20 December 2016"," It was alright
","If you love Star Wars you probably will enjoy this film too, as did I. It tells a great and exciting story that fills the gap between Episodes III and IV and it's much darker than before. It shows what the rebellion against the empire really was before things started to go their way, and it feels more realistic in some ways. As always with Star Wars the effects are good. <br/><br/>But still there are some moments that draws my score down:<br/><br/>1. As it tells a great story, it's really not that well executed in my opinion. It's quite messy from the start and you kind of feel like you're thrown into the middle of a story where you're missing some key plot points from some earlier installation.<br/><br/>2. The acting is lame. It's got plenty of great actors but they seem like they don't really believe in what they're doing at times.<br/><br/>3. It doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie but rather like a crossing between Star Trek and Mad Max.<br/><br/>4. There are way too many cameos and nods to the other movies. They're trying too much to tie the movie into the original Star Wars instead of letting this one stand on its own.<br/><br/>5. What is with the CGI-actors? One thing that annoyed me throughout the whole movie is the appearance of CGI Grand Moff Tarkin. It's quite obvious why he's in the story, but why would anyone care so much about him looking exactly like he did in Star Wars that they make a CGI version of the late Peter Cushing that just looks awful? The actor died over 20 years ago!! It would make much more sense to recast the character with a lookalike instead. The same goes for Princess Leia. A badly made CGI version of young Carrie Fisher could have been skipped. We know where the plans end up already, no need to show EXACTLY how they got there.<br/><br/>6. John Williams did not compose the score.<br/><br/>Still, the Blu-ray version will probably find its place on my movie-shelf between Episode III and IV. Just because I'm one of those who have to own the complete set.. It's the nerd in me."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","8","2","5","19 December 2016"," The most unique and original Star Wars movie.
","Rogue One has been one of my most anticipated movies of this year but one I was very cautious about. So many things were going against this movie like the extensive reshoots, replacing the composer at the last minute and working as a standalone story and prequel. And for the most part it succeeds which I found to be such a relief. It has become one of my top 3 favourite Star Wars films.<br/><br/>Rogue One goes down in a direction not seen before in previous Star Wars movies. In past films, the Rebellion has been set in the background to focus on the fantastical elements with the Jedi and the Skywalkers. By removing the mysticism and fantasy, Gareth Edwards makes the Star Wars universe feel like there is an actual war going on in a grounded way. The rebels are shown as a group who do morally questionable things because of desperation due to the Empire's tyrannical rule. This new perspective draws parallels with today's CIA and even terrorism. <br/><br/>Edwards's expertise in vfx shows he knows how to make the visuals feel realistic and not lifeless. Both the cgi and practical fx are amazing to look at even by Star Wars standards. The biggest piece of visual spectacle is of course the Death Star. It is seen more menacing then ever as you see it above from a ground-level perspective. You feel the power and threat it presents more effectively then how Starkiller base was in Force Awakens.<br/><br/>The new characters are not fleshed out as previous characters but I was still rooting for them in the end because of the performances and likability. Felicity Jones shows both toughness and vulnerability as Jyn Erso who has a great redeeming arc. Diego Luna breaks out as the complex rebel soldier Cassian Andor who contrasts with Jyn's disrespect to authority. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang work great as the supporting characters Chirrut and Baze, respectively. While the Jedi are not a major part of this film, Chirrut is not only a bad-ass (which is no surprise when you got Donnie Yen) but also provides a sense of spiritual aid and calmness with his belief in the Force. This clashes with Baze's hardened personality and lack of faith. Director Krennic, played greatly by Ben Mendelsohn, acts a fresh new villain in the Star Wars universe who isn't straight-up evil but is desperate to climb up the ranks of the Empire by any means necessary. The one character I wished was explored more was Rhiz Ahmed's Bodhi Rook just to better understand his defection against the Empire. And last but certainly not least (in fact probably the best) is the Alan Tudyk's droid K-2SO. He brings much-needed comic relief without becoming Jar-Jar Binks. Every one of K-2SO's lines was hilarious despite addressing the severity of the situation. Definitely has become my favourite droid.<br/><br/>The final act is definitely what you are going to remember most about this movie and has proved to be Gareth Edwards's greatest strength as a director. Much like the big monster battle in Edwards's last film Godzilla, the moment final battle begins you knows are going to get something unforgettable. You get heroic moments seeing the characters take on the Imperial army but also eventual heartbreak and sadness. And much applause should be given to Lucas Film and Disney for allowing Gareth Edwards and the writer Christopher McQuairre to end in a certain way that I think most studios would not risk taking. <br/><br/>I am not a hardcore Star Wars fan but if you watched New Hope before Rogue One there are certain little things and characters from that particular film you will definitely catch which helps to connect the two films. Now I am about to go into major spoilers. I will say the two returning original characters, Tarkin and Princess Leia, who are recreated through digital effects felt either overused or off-putting. As a vfx artist I was certainly impressed by how photo-realistic they looked but still could eventually see the uncanny valley. And the unfortunate thing with Tarkin is that I felt he greatly overshadowed Krennic, which prevented him from shining as the main villain. The one returning character that I wasn't disappointed with is Darth Vader. Vader was not in it as much as I predicted but I was still very happy with what scenes he was in. When Vader appears you will think Rogue One went from being a sci-fi war movie to a sci-fi horror. This made me forget him as the whiny and non-threatening Anakin Skywalker and think of him more as a combination of Jason Voorhees, the Terminator and Magneto. <br/><br/>I am going to say my biggest gripe with the movie unfortunately was the lack of a title crawl and the music. The title crawl could of helped a lot with explaining the first act. Plus it felt so weird not hearing John Williams's score right after ""a long time ago in galaxy far, far away"". As for the film's main score itself; it wasn't memorable. It felt like Michael Gianchino just made a fan version of John William's music. However I can't entirely blame him when he had only 3-4 weeks to compose it.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a great new addition to the Star Wars franchise while still standing apart from the other films. Rogue One has flaws, maybe as much as Force Awaken but for different reasons. Force Awakens has more well-developed characters and fun moments but Rogue One feels like a more satisfying and fresh story with a stronger ending. It is good escape from the standard tones and stories of the past but still feels it is a part of that universe. It will make you have a better appreciation for New Hope and look forward to future standalone stories in the Star Wars franchise."

Rogue One it's about every element well taken care of, from the story to the characters to lot of action without tacky rubbish.<br/><br/>Yes, some little holes in the plot, but after all all of the Star Wars always had them, and very cool almost ""stealth"" references to the first three episodes, that has been a real pleasure to seize.<br/><br/>If they make all the spin-off like this... well they do them, we will not be tired anyway! Ah, and to whom binds Star Wars to lightsabers alone... for me you're not a true fan of Star Wars. There is much more, and Rogue One is an entire anthology about."
"stian_kallhovd","9","2","5","19 December 2016"," The Creators Have a Story to Tell
","An excellent film!<br/><br/>This film is not all about action; it is very clear the writers and the director have a story they are passionate about. The story steadily builds in tension. I will admit that for the first 30 mins (approximately, I didn't look at the time) I was not too excited, but from there on out I was really hooked and cared a lot about the characters and their goal. The point of the film where I started to get excited and maintained that excitement throughout the movie is the hologram scene (you'll know it when you see it).<br/><br/>One thing that really excited me about this film is that the characters are very down-to-earth. Sure, they have hope -- they have an intuition about the odds they don't want droids to tell them about -- but they don't receive their mission with a speech about how they are destined to reach a goal. And thus they don't act on the request with that kind of attitude. They're just people with a strong intention and a clear goal. They're not trying to be pretentious.<br/><br/>In the last part of the film, where the action reaches its climax, there are also scenes of a different nature to accompany that action, so that the end doesn't become a pure 30 minutes long battle scene. This is very important to me, because it maintains my care for the characters' goal.<br/><br/>There are also several new worlds in this film, which also makes the Star Wars universe feel richer. The reason these worlds are interesting is that the events taking place on these worlds are of interest; the creators didn't just invent some new worlds for the sake of it.<br/><br/>You should be warned that this film is not about lightsaber action and force abilities, which is expected of Star Wars films in general. To like this film, you should be familiar with Star Wars: A New Hope, and have a particular interest in the backstory of the Death Star and the events surrounding this weapon in Episode IV. This is a fair warning to give.<br/><br/>This review is based on the 2D version of the film."
"mr-ananth","9","2","5","19 December 2016"," Rogue One - I have a great feeling about this!
","Gareth Edwards (director), helming Rogue One started off with visual effects, this is something that shows in a lot of the visuals in his newest and probably most ambitious undertaking thus far. What stands out right next to this is that the movie is full of heart, no wonder it captures your attention and holds on until the credits roll. The best way to make your audience comprehend your script is through visuals and Gareth Edwards (director) uses this to his full advantage.<br/><br/>Working of a taut script penned by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, Rogue One succeeds primarily because of the attention paid to detail, Do not be surprised if you get hit by Star Wars regulars like 'Its a trap', 'I have a bad feeling about..', Wilhelm screams and more, At no point do we feel borne down by the pressure of Jedi's and their mission statement when the urgency of the movie propels us along and Edwards does not let us relax for too long even to contemplate the various Easter eggs hidden in. Nor is there a dearth of the usual things - cantinas, kyber crystals, bacta tanks - fans of the canon will like how things have been put together. Does an ugly faced man seem too familiar in one of the scenes? Think back to a cantina scene elsewhere and you shall have some goosebumps added for good measure.<br/><br/>The cast seems to have been made for the movie with really innovative casting like Donnie Yen, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, Forest Whitaker apart from the already stellar Felicity Jones, Diego Luna Ben Mendelsohn and lots more. In particular and without going into too much of spoilery details, Alan Tudyk plays a cynical imperial robot - brilliant. In Ben Mendelsohn we have an Imperial director who perhaps while choking on his aspirations also sends chills down ones bone. Remarkable as it is in not having a single Jedi in the movie, Chirrut and Baze, guardians of the Kyber crystals provide us with an inkling of what is currently the past and lost glory of Jedis.<br/><br/>It is almost as if Gareth Edwards (director), Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy planned to ensure they had a spectacular Star Wars movie on paper without a single Jedi duel. And it has worked spectacularly, unless you count in the appearance of one very special light saber - beyond which I will not spoil the movie for you. Action sequences are as gritty, real and involving as are the scenes that maintain the heart and spirit of the Star Wars movies. Without succumbing to mind numbing forced additions of mirth, humour, wry and otherwise finds neat slots in the narrative and in the form of Chirrut, the Imperial droid K2SO and others ensure we wear a smile when we aren't gaping open mouthed at the incredible visual imagery. Production design by Doug Chiang (OFFICIAL) and Neil Lamont contributes to the open mouthed gaping, Filmed in multiple locations such as Maldives,Iceland, Jordan, England and surprisingly for one of the scenes Canary Wharf underground station in London - the sets, props, weapons, aliens all synergize to an end product that transports you to - yes - a galaxy far far away - yet not so far away that it disconnects you from the goings on. Subtle but excellent.<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino has been in the headlines a lot lately and Rogue one confirms he is one of the best composers to have scored a Star Wars film, no pun intended.While paying respect to John Williams original Star Wars (soundtrack), Michael Giacchino provides his own contribution raising the soundtrack to a level where one can clearly sense one is in the presence of the Force and that the force is with us.Not only do we hear the soaring operatic notes that Mr.Williams pioneered in this space drama series we are treated to a whole new range of improvisations - difficult to achieve without restraint. Overall, Rogue One (with the unfair advantage of having a full knowledge repository of the entire Star Wars universe), in my opinion, is the best Star Wars film thus far. Gritty and full of heart, dramatic and nearly a war movie - there is not one moment when our visual and auditory senses along with our brains do not feel gratified for having paid the price for an IMAX ticket.Taking up a classic idea of a motley crew of fighters facing off a near impossible opposition and demonstrating courage in the face of annihilation is something that is as classic as cinema itself."
"PyroSikTh","9","2","5","16 December 2016"," This is How you Star Wars
","Rogue One primarily follows a band of Rebels as they learn of and attempt to steal the plans of the infamous Death Star. Narratively, it could be argued that Rogue One's primary directive was to answer the unanswered questions of A New Hope and fill in the biggest plot hole in the entire saga, but the end product plays out more like a bridge than a prequel or a sequel one way or the other. Either way, it marks the first Star Wars movie not to feature a Skywalker; not to follow the main Jedi v Sith saga, and focus instead on the story around them; the Rebels vs the Empire. This is a movie about the little guys who won't be remembered in the history books of the Star Wars universe, rather than the legends who would form the myths and change the universe around them for centuries.<br/><br/>One thing Rogue One is rife with is references to other movies and cameos from various characters. Crucially though, none of it feels unnatural. Every reference and every cameo feels necessary. Well, apart from maybe 3PO and R2D2 making a brief appearance. If nothing else, Rogue One proves that nostalgia in tentpole blockbusters can really work both narratively as well as financially. In truth, a lot of scenes would feel odd without them. As chronology places Rogue One a matter of days, or even hours before A New Hope, the absence of certain characters would've been jarring.<br/><br/>Chief among them being Grand Moff Tarkin, who I didn't expect to see at all. Thing is though, Peter Cushing, the actor who played him originally, has been dead for over twenty years. If I hadn't known that, I wouldn't have noticed his recreation for the movie at all, and for the sake of continuity it was a risky yet fantastic choice. Sure, they could've recast him like they did Mon Mothma, but let's be honest, it would've been a harder sell. Instead they've brought in Guy Henry, who manages to capture Cushing's authority over the screen masterfully, and given him a CGI facemask that is almost uncanny in it's representation of the late actor. There have been many attempts over the years to bring back dead actors, or at least make them look younger, but Rogue One is the first to truly surpass the 'uncanny valley'. Visual Effects contender at the awards? Almost certainly.<br/><br/>Acting was pretty great by all. I won't repeat what I said about Guy Henry's part in the resurrection of Peter Cushing, but it was arguably the most convincing and impressive performance of the movie. Felicity Jones proves that she is absolutely on the up-and-up and will only earn more recognition from Rogue One. Diego Luna was maybe a bit of a weak link, but certainly not movie-breaking (cough Christensen cough). Ben Mendelsohn does what he does best in creating a threatening and engaging villain who isn't without flawed personality traits of his own (a confrontation with Darth Vader is one of the movie's high points). Alan Tudyk steals the show as K-2SO, a sarcastic, deadpan Imperial droid who provides the most comic relief, while Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang make a great double team of believer and sceptic respectively. Mads Mikkelson frankly doesn't get enough to work with, and Jimmy Smits (as Senator Bail Organa) and Genevieve O'Reilly (as Mon Mothma) reprise their Episode III roles as little more than frequent cameos.<br/><br/>While character development may arguably be a little lacking in Rogue One, there's enough for the viewer to get a sense of who each of them are amidst the snowballing plot, that doesn't particularly allow for a lot of downtime. Rogue One's real strength with it's characters, especially in contrast to the main saga, is that there is no good or bad, just various shades of grey. It's a world of doing what's necessary, no matter what. Cassian kills an informant early on with little emotion, maybe to save him from the torture of the Empire, or maybe just to save his own skin. Galen Erso metaphorically sleeps with the enemy in order to keep a daughter he hasn't seen in fifteen years relatively safe. Saw Gerrera's disruption of the Empire borders on terrorism. Jyn is, herself, a criminal for reasons unknown, and initially uninterested in the political conflict she's found herself thrust into. Of course Director Krennic is villainous to the core, and Chirrut is righteously heroic, proving that there's still room in the muddle of greys for some black and white.<br/><br/>If I have one disappointment, it's the music. Michael Giacchino's score is great, don't get me wrong, but the most memorable beats in the movie were definitely the original themes written by John Williams. Giacchino's score reworks some of them, and attempts to create some new, but they pale in comparison. Not only that, but the main trailer for Rogue One had solid scoring that I'm disappointed didn't make it into the final cut (it's like Age of Ultron all over again). Overall though, this is just a minor niggle.<br/><br/>Rogue One is, for me, quintessential Star Wars. Not only that, it builds on and improves it's surrounding movies in the saga. I'm not quite sure it's better than Revenge of the Sith in my personal ranking, but it's definitely up there alongside Empire Strikes Back as one of the best Star Wars movies ever made. It is consciously more Original Trilogy than it is Prequel, without completely ignoring what came before it. It taps into what made Star Wars beloved by many for decades without feeling like a retread like Force Awakens did. For this, I'm going to go with my gut rather than try and keep my feelings reserved, and give Rogue One a fantastic 9/10. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end, and it's all I ever wanted from a new Star Wars movie."

","I managed to make it to the local multi-plex over the weekend, in spite of some lousy weather, to see this with the family, along with our annual Christmas exchange. I'll try to do my best not to post any major *SPOILERS* but won't promise anything for sure LOL.<br/><br/>For anyone who doesn't know by now, this is not in the ""series"" of SW films, as far as episode I, II, III, etc.. I guess, however, you could call this ""Episode 3.5"" since it's set between ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope,"" and concerns a plot involving the newly-formed ""Death Star."" Felicity Jones (""The Theory of Everything"") is our heroine, and she is great in the lead role -- I see her character's nick-name, ""Stardust"" actually in her immediate future. I know I've seen her co-star, Diego Luna in a few things over the years, and he's also great in the co-starring role.<br/><br/>I see this was directed by Gareth Edwards, who previously helmed the 2010 CGI-animated ""Monsters"" as well as the recent 2014 reboot of ""Godzilla."" He remains true to the storytelling and action format of all the other SW films.<br/><br/>I do notice a couple things about this ""Star Wars Story"", possible *spoiler*, although nothing too important. The main John Williams ""Star Wars March"" is not included in the music score, and there is no opening ""crawl"" giving an update on the latest happenings in the SW universe.<br/><br/>Chinese martial arts star, Donnie Yen, is pretty awesome as a blind warrior who believes in the Force, and I had to look into this, but Alan Tudyk (""Firefly"") in many ways steals the show in the ""comic relief"" dept. as ""K-2SO,"" a Rebel-owned Imperial enforcer droid whose memory is wiped by Andor. He sorta reminds me of a robotic version of ""Sheldon"" from TV's ""Big Bang Theory"" (okay so regular version of Sheldon LOL).<br/><br/>Heavy hitters, Oscar winner Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen, also play major characters. And O-M-G they managed to recreate using a CGI digital technology likeness, Peter Cushing! Absolutely AMAZING!! I give this movie almost a perfect rating -- a 9/10 at IMDb! Loved this!"
"burlesonjesse5","7","2","5","18 December 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
","Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, and Forest Whitaker (his impression is all too brief) are well cast in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (my latest review). And in traditional trending, a side character just had to quip, ""I am one with The Force The Force is with me"". Thankfully, The Force for the most part, is with ""Rogue One"".<br/><br/>After a decade-long wait, director J. J. Abrams was given the keys to the highly successful, Star Wars franchise. In Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he got away from the kid-friendly, CGI overload of the George Lucas prequels. He instead tried to create something that resembled the original trilogy (episodes IV and V come to mind). I was not overly impressed. Yeah Harrison Ford came along for ""VII's"" long anticipated ride. Yeah Mark Hamill made a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance. And yes, there was the obligatory lightsaber fight between good and evil. Here's the thing though: ""Rogue One"" has none of this and still manages to be more epic, more monumental, and more visually striking than ""Force Awakens"". It's the kind of Star Wars catacomb that ""Force Awakens"" wished it could have been. Truth be told, I was hoping ""Rogue One"" would've came out sooner than later.<br/><br/>Anyway, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is not only a film tailored for 3D viewing pleasure, it is also a decent segue into Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope. Just call ""Rogue One"" episode 3 and a half. Remember in ""Hope"" when Princess Leia appeared with a secret message via a hologram? That's because the characters in ""Rogue One"" (Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor) were part of the Alliance and gave her viable plans to destroy the almighty Death Star. Carrie Fisher is even shown by way of computer enhancement as if it was 1977 all over again (I think it was Carrie Fisher). The image is a little creepy but it'll do. Oh and did I mention that they brought back the deceased Peter Cushing in glorified CGI fashion as well. Interesting and startling are the words I'd use.<br/><br/>Now ""Rogue One"" does contain an overly pouncing, sort of ho-hum musical score (by veteran composer Michael Giacchino who lacks that John Williams touch). And yes, it does omit the famous, serial opening titles. Still, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story manages to crack my top three in the Star Wars rankings (it's tied with 1983's Return of the Jedi). With ""Rogue's"" title referring to a military call sign, this is a more mature installment, a more down-and-dirty installment, and it is as dark as they come. The look is less pristine, like sci-fi Ridley Scott. The costume design is Alien mixed with 2013's Snowpiercer. Finally, ""Rogue One's"" concluding battle sequence is Southwest Asia, Apocalypse Now chic. There's palm trees, explosions aplenty, and epicness in scope. By the way, look for the anticipated Darth Vader appearance that everyone's been talking about (spoiler). Don't worry, James Earl Jones still does the voice mind you.<br/><br/>The director of ""Rogue One"" is Gareth Edwards. This is a step up from his monstrously bland, remake of Godzilla. His camera has a keen eye as he includes every stormtrooper, every intergalactic world, and every Rebellion vs. Imperial dogfight in every singular frame. Overall, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is sumptuous, gritty, unwashed, and beautiful. It's like cinematic, Empire perfume for it truly stinks pretty. Granted, this isn't a Star Wars endeavor that will bring out the kid in you. This is more attuned to the adult or young adult for that matter. Bottom line: Don't go ""rogue"" and avoid the local multiplex. See this possible, future classic right away. Rating: 3 stars."
"kristoffer-hamilton","9","2","5","18 December 2016"," Does not get any better.
","Strong point is the raw, gritty look and style. This is Star Wars in the style of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy. People die. The empire is savagely cruel. CGI blends in perfectly. The return of ""Peter Cushing"" as Tarkin is pure evil in its most chilling form. Popcultural borrowing works in this one. The Bladerunner-esque street life of Jedah feels real and not stolen. The K2-droid does not feel like a cheap copy of C3PO. The character is funny and believable. Back story as reprogrammed adds depth. Even his design, blatantly ""inspired"" by Studiio Ghiblis Laputa does not matter. Movie magic at its best.<br/><br/>The overlap and reference to the original trilogy is in perfect balance. Less is more seems to be the thinking here. We never see the emperor, only one light sabre use, R2D2 and C3PO appears once casualy in the background. Personally I like how the ending of the film locks in exactly to the opening of A new Hope.<br/><br/>Weak point is the texts explaining locations. What on earth is that for? So annoying! ""Secret Rebel Base"" Yes, I get it! Part of the fun of a movie is to absorb the images and guess the next step. Texts adds nothing, ruins the suspense, calls the audience stupid. My advice; for home release take them off.<br/><br/>Darth Vader does not match original character perfectly. Walk is too forced. Spins around his heel too quick. Should be more laid back and move slightly slower.<br/><br/>3D works well in the bright scenes at the end, not so well in first dark part of the film."
"icpemsby","8","2","5","18 December 2016"," A strong Star Wars entry with very vague potential spoilers
","It has its flaws, lulls, questionable cgi and flat dialogue moments but overall SWRO is so good that it makes these moments forgivable. The movie feels it has a weightiness to it a desperation with real consequences that had me feeling like no one is safe. <br/><br/>I stayed away from any trailers or media on this movie at all. To me, this movie seemed very character driven, I found myself invested and on board with character motivations and caring for these characters that I knew nothing about previously. The story was engaging and woven so nicely into the Star Wars universe that it had me wondering whether this was a screenplay written in the time of the original trilogy that never got made. <br/><br/>I found it a relief that unlike TFA which I also enjoyed but found it borrowing from ANH on several story plot points, RO was not recycling but actually adding and expanding what we know of the Star Wars universe. I see a definite potential in the SWU in these stand alone single entries to expand and take the franchise in places that you couldn't otherwise go within the main Star Wars franchise movies. <br/><br/>RO has a darker, more at stake tone to it then I expected and I already knew the ending before I went to it but found myself so invested that I was wanting and hoping to be wrong about the conclusion of the film. <br/><br/>Disney seems to have a real knack for doing right by their properties these days and I hope we get to enjoy this kind of quality for decades to come."
"michael-commack","9","2","5","17 December 2016"," Rogue One: An Awesome Star Wars Story
","Despite the film's slow paced beginning, Rogue One, the eighth motion picture set in a galaxy far, far away, inflicts a great sense of nostalgia for the original trilogy and instills in fans an anxious excitement for the franchise moving forward. The familiar elements of the Star Wars universe, overlaid with realistic warfare that has never been so front and center in a Star Wars movie, lays the groundwork for a truly astounding story and action packed movie experience. Indeed there are a few drawn out scenes and mundane monologues building up to larger story arcs as there is with any movie at over 120 minutes in length. After all, how else would Hollywood make our $20 IMAX 3D tickets worth the price tag. But what viewers gets in return for their patience as the story tellers lay the necessary ground work in Act 1 and 2 is an astounding Act 3 that lands blows the audience may not have been expecting. The ending battle sequence is fantastic visually and does wonders with respect to proper pace, relevant content, and of course X-Wings, lots and lots of X-Wings. The creators of this movie from day one declared this movie a spin-off film, making it very clear that they would be slightly veering from the normal Star Wars form of story telling while still respecting the universe in which it exists. This remained consistent when the title logo was released without the ever so recognizable franchise insignia, the introduction of the ""A Star Wars Story"" tag line, and a promise of no opening crawl. And that's exactly what we got. A story set within the Star Wars universe that contained a perfect addition of brand new elements, purposeful hints of old elements, and a climax that forces the crimson red blood in viewers hearts to pump with vigor until the closing credits roll. What does this mean for future Star Wars films? This means there is hope. Hope for the future spin-offs, hope for future episodes, and hope for the successful continuation of the Star Wars franchise for years and years to come."
"scott-859-748921","7","2","5","16 December 2016"," A Different Take on Star Wars that has Good Points and some Bad Points
","So many mixed feelings about this movie right now. Firstly, it's different to the other Star Wars movies, but that's good! I liked the way the film was shot, I like that they took a leap of faith away from the traditional Star Wars canon. It was a bit more serious too, like a legitimate sci-fi movie, instead of just being ""jokey' or for kids. There's a downside to the seriousness however, and that is, it often felt TOO serious at times.Even with the humor they threw in (which worked, it wasn't too contrived) it just felt like a massive war movie. It just wasn't fun! With all the shade, the producers should have put more ""light"" in there to help balance the movie. It was just too much of one thing. <br/><br/>The middle of the movie felt like nothing ever happened and it went on far too long. I am embarrassed to say that I was fighting to stay awake it was so boring. I really liked the concept behind the main group of characters, it had a lot of potential. But bringing in so many new characters in a 2.5 hour movie means that there's not a lot of opportunity to learn much about them. Consequently, I felt no empathy for the characters. Not even the lead character. So much so in fact, I felt like a ""female lead"" was shoe-horned into this movie just to be politically correct with this day and age. This actually lowers the impact of the point of Daisy Ridley's character being female in the main Star Wars canon. Why does Disney/Star Wars insist on reusing the same character story line (girl loses family, seeks revenge...) and plot (blow up the Death Star!) from every Star Wars movie?!<br/><br/>Trying not to give away any spoilers but the CGI used with some well-known characters was the best movie character CGI I've seen in a long time, it's amazing how far we have come and continues to improve. Credit to the director, I think he made Star Wars look beautiful, really nicely shot, but the story line was just too long and there was too much of the same war battles in the middle of the movie that dragged-on forever. I can see why they decided to try and salvage this movie by rewriting and re-shooting.<br/><br/>I had high hopes in the first third of the movie, I thought it worked well. But the final two thirds left me disappointed. Nice try, I think the intent comes from a good place, but it just missed the mark of being something really good. The most disappointing aspects for me is that (and I know this is a precursor to a New Hope) is that we cannot have anymore Death Star story lines. It has been done to death (and then some). How many Star Wars movies now feature the Death Star? It's beyond silly. If you can split this movie into three parts, I would give 10/10 for the first third, 4/10 for the middle third, and 5 or maybe 6/10 for the final third.<br/><br/>I'm usually first in line to buy a DVD/Blu-ray version of Star Wars after a movie release, but this time around, I don't have the excitement to want to get it when it's released.<br/><br/>Let's not be spoiled however - the fact we get spin-offs like this is what we've been asking for, so we should not come away too dejected or ungrateful. The more spin-offs that are made, the better, because some of them will be great, and we should not have the expectation that all of them will be great. Let me be clear - Rogue One stands head and shoulders above the George Lucas prequels in the 2000s and that's because of a huge improvement of the writing. Rogue One is very well written. Dialog is great, never silly or forced. The special effects were really well done but even they went overboard in places. So much so that it verged on resembling a Michael Bay Transformers movie (you know, one of the bad ones!). The balance needs to be right, and Rogue One just kept missing the mark. <br/><br/>Here's to 2018, hoping that next main Star Wars installment in the main canon can bring that perfect balance back to the force."
"amunastra","1","4","14","16 May 2017"," Opinions vary
","Only my opinion but I couldn't get into the film.I like to be engrossed in a film that It takes me into the story.I thought it needed some brightness in the filming.I always like to get to know in depth at least one of the characters but alas I couldn't. I recognised Peter Cushing as soon as I saw him,which gave me a little more interest.Only for the fact that I was racking my brains ,trying to work out how he was resurrected after passing away many years ago.I have ticked the spoiler box for that reason but I wont tell you how it was done or the reason why.I must admit I fell asleep three quarters through the film through boredom and haven't and don't intend to watch it again."
"aslund-92834","9","4","15","15 December 2016"," The force is strong with this one
","Rouge One is a perfect mixture of fast-paced action with the grit and feel from the original movies. CGI is used but well made. Although it's guns blazing from the start until the end it never gets too much. Rouge One makes up for the disappointment most die-hard Star Wars fans were left with after The Force Awakens. Rouge One is a war movie without clichés and portrays the true nature of war. The nostalgia is strong with this one. Rouge One is filled with references and ""easter eggs"" and will most likely be a big block buster, if not bigger than The Force Awakens. During the end credits the audience gave a standing ovation and that pretty much speaks for itself. Rouge One is a vast and long-awaited contribution to the Star Wars universe but works well even for those who are not acquainted with the franchise."
"ttobin-34654","3","3","10","24 December 2019"," Just One Long Video Game Cutscene Posing as a Star Wars ""Film""
","I put film in quotations because this is not a film (nor was it even shot on film) but instead a very expensive and glorified fan boy..... I guess I can call it video?<br/><br/>Where do I begin?<br/><br/>Well the acting is awful (except for the robot, ironically). The action scenes are so uninspired that I actually fell asleep during one of them. Rogue One has zero inspiration and the lead character's personality is about as wooden and stiff as a bird house in the middle of winter. The film is off fan boy nostalgia with showing Darth Vader in between the prequels and original movies. However, James Earl Jones voice sounds tired and bored, just like I was when watching this. So this kind of digital cinema fodder is what we can expect from Disney for the next infinite amount of years?.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Rogue One is an uninspired, uninnovative fan boy cash grab for the Disney Mega-Corporation. Stick to the Skywalker sagas, those films at least still have the ""feel"" of Star Wars and avoid this ""film"" like a dirty toilet seat at a Truck Stop. Rogue One simply adds nothing to the franchise."
"frazipe","10","3","10","8 March 2017"," Excellent Movie
","I think my 4th favorite Star Wars movie behind the original trilogy (much better than The Force Awakens). If this was a stand alone SciFi movie and I never saw any other Star Wars movies I think it would be one of my favorites of all time. I can count on one hand how many movies I've gone to see at the theater more than once and I saw this one 3 times. It did an excellent job of tying in Episodes III and IV. Cinematography, acting, writing, special effects were all spot on."
"rogerdob","Null","3","10","18 January 2017"," Horrible...humorless...boring.
","The movie was completely void of any humor or light heartedness except for a extremely few pathetic attempts. The brilliance of the very first Starwars was the action coupled with a sense of fun and adventure. This movie was SO serious that it was boring. The lead actress was quite forgettable in her role and for the first 40 minutes it was extremely hard to keep track of who was who and who was doing what!<br/><br/>The other things that began to annoy me was the extreme fast cutting so that it was hard to follow the fights and the pretentious music in the background. The music just reeked of saying ""this movie is important because this music sounds important."" After about an hour we walked out!"
"classicsoncall","8","3","10","3 January 2017"," ""Rebellions are built on hope.""
","I had a good feeling coming out of this film - both times. I saw it the first time before the news of Carrie Fisher's passing, the second time after. Knowing that she won't be around for the final chapter, (Episode VIII is already filmed as I understand it), adds a note of poignancy to the franchise, seeing as how forty years - FORTY YEARS! - have passed since ""A New Hope"" came out to thrill legions of movie fans.<br/><br/>What this film did in it's own way was to bring back some of the magic I felt was missing with ""The Force Awakens"", the latest movie of the series from just a year ago. That might have had something to do with characters from the original films appearing here, I'm thinking of ones like Governor Tarkin (not yet Grand Moff), Mon Mothma, Darth Vader and of course Princess Leia at the stunning conclusion of this story. That minor scene of R2-D2 speaking with C-3PO was exceptionally well played, especially since it wasn't overdone. When I say this, I guess it's the traditionalist coming out in me. It's that magic feeling we all had back when the series started that I look for with each new entry in the Star Wars Universe, and this picture delivered some of that.<br/><br/>On the flip side, I don't know if the new characters introduced here will resonate with me in the same way as time goes by. Even the heroes didn't seem to be particularly likable to me. Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) I think had the capacity for further development, but his death in the story leaves him out. Though they were OK, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna didn't have the charisma to become bigger players in the franchise, but since this is a stand alone story that probably doesn't matter. For whatever reason, K-2SO just struck me the wrong way, even if he was a robot.<br/><br/>But with all said and done, this was an effective story to explain how the Rebel Alliance paved the way for stealing the plans for the Death Star, something we could only guess at forty years ago if one had a mind to think about it. There was even a cautionary hint of the Rebels operating outside the law so to speak, in going up against the Empire. I thought that was an intriguing concept. More than anything though, what the film did for me was send me back to the movie archives to experience the Star Wars saga once more, all over again. And that can only be a good thing."
"THX1701","9","3","10","27 December 2016"," Star Wars Reawakens
","This is how you reawaken the Force. This is what happens when you take out Jar Jar Abrams out of the production: you get a better picture. Whenever I used to go to see a Star Wars movie, I felt like a kid again. I loved going with my parents to the movies and having a good time. I miss those good old days from the 1980's and 90's. Upon seeing Episode VII I felt disappointment. Something didn't click right. The problem was Abrams directing in the wrong direction and writing for the wrong generation audience and Disney not caring for Lucas' true vision of the saga.<br/><br/>Here we have a fresh new start. Disney went totally rogue! I love the multi ethnic cast. Episode IV's prologue is retold in this film. Simple formula and it works. At first I was against the idea. I felt an in-between chapter was not necessary fearing it would cheapen A New Hope. Clearly I was wrong and as a Star Wars fan I am satisfied with the story. I felt like a kid again at the conclusion of this movie! I hope Disney does not make it a habit, though. May the Force Be With You Carrie Fisher. RIP. You will be missed."
"DarthVoorhees","8","3","10","25 December 2016"," It isn't perfect but it looks and feels the part
","'Star Wars Rogue One' is an interesting companion piece to the saga. There are definitely a lot of thematic nuances to discuss about it. For a 'Star Wars' fan I think it'll be a film to dissect and appreciate for a long time to come. The problem is that as a whole it is kind of odd piecing everything together. The long and short of it is that I liked it a great deal but it does have faults; some that hinder the movie from reaching the great heights of the franchise. It's a movie with moments; some that rank as the highest highs and the lowest lows of the saga.<br/><br/>The thing that has to be gotten out of the way is that Ben Mendelsohn's Director Krennic is the worst villain that has ever appeared in a 'Star Wars' movie. His motivation is so flimsy and half hearted that you almost find yourself kind of chuckling at some of his stuff. His entire character arc is whining about getting his due credit in the empire. That isn't good enough especially when Vader and Tarkin are in the film. Having a villain this weak is a crippling flaw in a 'Star Wars' film. 'Star Wars' is always at it's best when it's villains are loud and theatrical. Krennic just is there. That isn't to say you won't appreciate the small brilliant concentrated doses of Vader and Tarkin.<br/><br/>Peter Cushing is brought back from the dead and the effect is uncanny. A problem with the later 'Star Wars' films is that the computer effects have never had a tactile sensation to them. It looks and feels like Cushing is in the film. I hope this effect isn't over used but when I heard about this I didn't think they could pull it off. They did. This effect is a game changer in film and will be fascinating to see how it is used in the years to come. I wholeheartedly hope 'Rogue One' steals that Best Visual Effects award for this because it would be much deserved. I am a Cushing fan and have seen many of his films. They capture some of the sly dark humorous facial expressions even. It's other worldly.<br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards has his flaws but his unquestionable strength is creating epic scope. One thing I loved about his 'Godzilla' and this film is how small he makes the audience feel. You feel in awe of the space battle and the destruction going on around you.<br/><br/>The movie expertly corrects one of the glaring complaints thrown at 'The Force Awakens'. There are a lot of homages to the original trilogy but they aren't throw away moments meant to just tug at the hearts of fans. They very consciously serve the plot. The best comes from my favorite Mads Mikkelsen as his character explains that one nitpick thrown at the Death Star in a way that is clever and totally adds to the universe.<br/><br/>I missed the Force and the Jedi though. The comparisons to this and a war film are highly accurate. I don't want a straight forward 'war' film though. 'Star Wars' needs the force to give it mystery and wonder. 'Rogue One' just doesn't have it. The only character to really care about the force is Donnie Yen's character, Chirrut Imwe, who flirts closely to being a generic martial arts stereotype.<br/><br/>The musical score by Michael Giacchino leaves a lot to be desired. He is trying to be John Williams and it just is an impossible task. His score hardly borrows from the classic themes. I might be a Pavlovian Dog but I want loud and rousing renditions of the original themes. His faux John Williams is uninspired and just generic.<br/><br/>To fully dissect 'Rogue One' I have to delve into it's tragic and yet optimistic ending. What is done to our characters is brave and unprecedented for a 'Star Wars' or any comic/pulp movie really. 'Rogue One' is all about creating a fleshed out world and this fleshed out world has no room for a forced sequel. I loved the ending. I loved how grim it ended up being because it totally plays into 'ANH' and how Luke represents that very slim chance of bad things being righted. I get some of the complaints about the film not being safe for children or what not but I think they are baseless. 'Rogue One' is not a good introduction to 'Star Wars' it is for the seasoned pros who grew up with it and want an adult story. Honestly going in I was expecting a new series trying to be started up. I was not expecting the sad ending at all. It gives the story and the universe at large a lot more weight. It would have been easy for Disney to make a 'Rogue Two' and so forth and have the gang meet up with a CG young Mark Hamill but they didn't. This is a story with a beginning, middle, and end with high stakes. It's so much more refreshing than something going on forever like Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evan's Marvel friendship which plays like a goofy commercial.<br/><br/>I realize this sounds like a kind of grocery list and less like a review but I feel that kind of what 'Star Wars' is at this point. It's a formula and assessing it is all about how the formula sizzles relative to making a coherent and gripping story. The mixture isn't always there in 'Rogue One'. I think at this point 'The Force Awakens' is a better film but this film felt more like an authentic 'Star Wars' picture if that makes any sort of sense. The big fans are going to find something to love even though 'Rogue One' has it's imperfections."

","Review (with Spoilers)<br/><br/>Noted Actor(s)<br/><br/>Jyn (Felicity Jones) | Darth Vader (James Earl Jones)<br/><br/>Storyline<br/><br/>Like the majority of Star Wars films, it all begins with a child losing their parents. In this case, it is Jyn (Felicity Jones) losing her mother, and hiding as her father goes to help make what shall become the Death Star. Leading her to believe, growing up, this was her father's choice. He wanted to be part of the evil empire. However, it is revealed this isn't true. He joined them, helped them, to input a flaw. Leading to a journey to not only know the truth but spread it to the world.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>James Earl Jones Returns To Voice Darth Vader<br/><br/>Honestly, for me anyway, the praise is in short supply but I must admit on top of it being nice to see Darth Vader in the suit again, it was especially cool that James Earl Jones returned to voice the character.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Forgettable and Expendable Characters<br/><br/>As I'm sure many of you know, after Disney had hits with The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, and more, they released a bunch of straight to VHS releases to try to capitalize on the success of the first film. To me, Rogue One is similar to those movies. The only difference is this was given a far larger budget than past unnecessary editions so that it could have the usual special effects and decent fight scenes.<br/><br/>But while any Star Wars picture is certainly worth noting for its special effects, at the end of the day it is the story and characters which should matter. Problem is, for this film, they don't. We are, with the exception of Vader, introduced to characters not in the original films. Making it so they all have a chance to try to make this film their own. Perhaps present this film as more than a simple cash grab using that tired Star Wars formula of the orphaned child turned hero. Yet, they don't.<br/><br/>From our lead to the men who fight with her, it is like they utterly lack personality. I mean, this is like a generic action movie within the Star Wars universe. Not as bad as episode 1 - 3, but at least with those prequels there was some attempt at trying to give the characters admirable traits or at least plant something so that their lives mattered to you. With this film, however, it relies too heavily on the basic principle that this person is the hero so you should root for them. This person is the bad guy so you should hate them and it adds 0 complexity to it. And I know, ""What about Jyn's dad?"" Well, he is barely in the movie and honestly by the time the ending is revealed, it is a relief that we shouldn't have to worry about any of these characters' story continuing.<br/><br/>Overall: Negative (Skip It)<br/><br/>I have never been so tempted to fall asleep during a movie and I watch movies which are purely Oscar bait. But what makes me not say this is just another ""Home Viewing"" movie is because this is a blemish on the brand. This film leads you to believe Disney is trying to recoup how much they paid for this brand as quickly as possible. So even if they just make some rinky dink story, connect it to the main series at the end, and you are left with nothing to praise but the special effects, they are fine with that. After all, they aren't invested in the characters so why should you? Making it so, overall, this movie seems solely about keeping the Star Wars franchise in your thoughts and perhaps making Star Wars a perennial money maker for the house of mouse."

","First I am an original star wars fan,I was there in 1977 in the theaters when Star Wars opened.I saw the film countless times and bought all the toys.It funny to me people old enough to be my kids are so passionate about these films but for a person like me who saw it from the start,the last 4 films have fallen short of capturing that feeling I got back in 1977 but this film brought it back.<br/><br/>The main thing that went away in the more recent star wars film is the grittiness and edginess of the original 3.Lucas wanted to show off his new tech and made the sequels too glossy and wrote them for an audience that he thought was 12 years old(he keeps referring to them as kiddie movies and wrote them that way)<br/><br/>This movie has that grittiness that edge the original moves had,it does no over explain everything (again the Lucas style).It knows the audience is fully aware of the characters and know every aspect of them.It was made for a star wars savvy audience<br/><br/>Its a harsh movie, its brutal at times and has humor all well worth your time.The originals like me will get that feeling back that was lost in the last 4 films.."
"xtraflo","8","3","10","16 December 2016"," Closest thing to a Star Wars movie that we'll probably ever get !!
","This was a movie for the Hard Core fans of Star Wars. My eyes welled up at least 8 times throughout the movie for various reasons, from plot points to the subtle sounds and images. I personally loved this movie and can't wait to see it again. The best way to describe it is, remember when you were 8 years old and playing with your Star Wars toys, now give yourself $100+million dollars to make that movie. Gareth Edwards did a great job with tone, visuals, script and emotion. Pacing could have been a little more on point but an overall solid film. Thank you Lucasfilm, I now at least have 4 strong movies to tell a Star Wars tale about. Not a perfect film but a Solid Star Wars Story ! B+"
"stevendbeard","8","3","10","16 December 2016"," Stand Alone Treat
","I saw ""Rogue One:A Star Wars Story"", starring Felicity Jones-Inferno, The Theory of Everything; Diego Luna-Elysium, Open Range; Alan Tudyk- Suburgatory_tv, Serenity; Mads Mikkelsen-Hannibal_tv, Casino Royale_2006; Forest Whitaker-Arrival, Taken 3 and Ben Mendelsohn-The Dark Knight Rises, Quigley Down Under.<br/><br/>If you are a Star Wars fan, you are in for a treat. This is a stand alone film-I'm pretty sure there will not be a sequel because it leads right into Episode 4:A New Hope. It has all the elements a fan could want in a Star Wars movie. If you remember the opening scene in the 1977 classic Star Wars film where a scroll going across the screen tells us about some rebel fighters that stole the plans to the Death Star and gave them to Princess Leia. This movie tells that story. In case you might be wondering, there is not a scroll going across the beginning of this movie. Felicity is the daughter of Mads, the scientist that created the Death Star-under duress, of course. They were separated when she was still a little girl and she was raised to be a fighter by Forest. Mads was put to work for the Empire by Ben. Years later, the rebel alliance comes up with a plan to use Felicity to lead them to Mads and either rescue him or kill him to prevent the Death Star from being completed. Diego is in charge of the mission to rescue-or kill-her father and of course, he forgets to tell her about the killing option. Alan plays a robot called K-2so who was formerly an Empire robot but has been reprogrammed to be a good guy. FYI: They use motion capture technology for Alan to play the robot and he is fantastic in the part. There is lots of action, both man to man and space ship to space ship. There are lots of characters from other Star Wars movies that pop up. I won't spoil all of them for you here but if you have seen the trailer, then you know that one of them is Darth Vader. And they do use James Earl Jones for his voice-Thank Goodness. And a couple of the characters popping up were a little surprising-one in particular, since the actor that played him died in 1994! And then I read that they used CGI to fake it. It did look pretty good, though, I must say. FYI: Darth Vader does not have a lot of screen time but he does have a kick-ass fight scene including showing off his expertise with a light saber. If you are a fan then you should enjoy this movie-I know I did, immensely. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. I loved 'The Force Awakens' and I believe this one is just as good. I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"CANpatbuck3664","10","3","10","16 December 2016"," Darker and Grittier, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Succeeds Completely as a Standalone and Connects Easily to the Original Trilogy
","So we get our second dose of Star Wars done by Disney. We already had The Force Awakens but Rogue One is a different story. It connect almost directly to Star Wars: Episode IV, taking place just a few days before A New Hope. I was hooked going into this movie just from hearing about the plot premise, let alone the awesome trailers. It centres on the Rebellion, with a squadron of rebel fighters trying to steal the plans for the original Death Star. The reviews were good and with a vibe more like the first trilogy, it wasn't hard to figure out that this was going to be a big hit. Did I love it? Absolutely and I'll be happy to tell you why.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Forgoing the opening crawl, we join Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) and his family on a remote planet. An Imperial transport shuttle starts to land. Young Jyn Erso (later played in the present by Felicity Jones) runs back home and the family begins an evacuation protocol. The ranking Imperial officer that steps out of the shuttle is Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn). He's a no nonsense type who's come to recruit Galen to come work on the Death Star because production has stalled and Krennic's commanding officers are growing impatient. To stall for time so his family can get away, Galen tries to make excuses on why he can't come but Orson isn't taking no for an answer. Jyn is able to get to safety but her mother goes back with a blaster. Galen begs for his wife to stop but she shoots Krennic and is fatally shot in turn. Galen is led away and Jyn escapes to a nearby cave. She waits until Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) a freedom fighter and friend of the Erso family is able to pick her up and transport her to safety.<br/><br/>This movie is decidedly different from The Force Awakens, both in tone and subject matter. What I loved most about Rogue One is that it focuses on a different side of the rebellion. The movie is more about espionage and the movements of ground level troops instead of focusing on Jedi or the larger political fight. I really dug that, considering where the Rebellion is according to the original time line, things ought to be bleak and dark. I think Rogue One resembles the original trilogy and it was nice to see. I want more movies like this, focusing on smaller parts of a larger picture and telling a more grounded and emotional story.<br/><br/>Another note about Rogue One is that it is a decidedly less family-friendly story. The story is more visceral, the lines of morality are more blurry and some of the violence is more brutal. The characters aren't Captain America heroes, they do selfish things and aren't always looking out for the common good until the end. Rogue One represents more of an adult scope of the new Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>I really like movies about a team of anti-heroes coming together to execute an operation/heist and Rogue One represents one of those movies done to almost perfection. I liked so many of the new characters they introduced, some of them are unique warriors like Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen, some of them were heroes that had to find their courage like Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), and others were sarcastic robots that put the mission ahead of forming bonds with humans like K-2SO (Alan Tudyk in a scene stealing role). They came together pretty seamlessly and even though the development of the individual characters was uneven, by the time the final battle came around I was having so much fun watching them work together to take down the Empire. The villains were very well done too. I really liked Orson Krennic and the bringing back of both Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarken. They hit the perfect harmony between threatening, menacing and intimidating.<br/><br/>I think that Rogue One made some bold casting choices. Felicity Jones seemed like an odd pick for an action movie star when I heard about it but she brought her A game to this movie, she sold her character very well. I didn't like Diego Luna as much but I think that was more of a problem with his character. So many of the smaller parts were played by recognizable actors and they nailed their parts. It was nice to see Mads Mikkelson play a good guy and he gave a good performance. I'm a big fan of Riz Ahmed and he was strong as Bodhi, he mixed the vulnerability with courage that the character needed. I actually wanted more of Donnie Yen, he was great and his character was interesting. Forest Whitaker was also solid in his part, he had a pretty dramatic role but he's an excellent actor. Alan Tudyk was funny and unique as K-S20, he might be the most memorable. Ben Mendelsohn showed me why he's one of the more underrated actors out there. I was expecting him to be hammy but his balance between quiet strength and repressed anger/nervousness was spot on.<br/><br/>I only had one real minor complaint with the movie. Almost all of the individual characters are great but their development as a group seemed to require some big leaps in plot. They go from an angry group of misfits to an unbeatable team a little too quickly for my taste. Especially with Cassian and Jyn who flirt with becoming a couple when they were about to rip each other to shreds just a half hour earlier.<br/><br/>Boasting excellent CGI, action and a kick-ass story I loved Rogue One. It represents a great continuation of the Star Wars universe, providing the requisite fun, thrills and adventure you want at the theatre. Keep knocking them out of the park and I'll continue to show up opening day."
"chenrybausmaniv","9","3","10","15 December 2016"," Am I one with the force, the force is with me.
","The abyss and frustration that enveloped recent past Star Wars movies has been filled! I just walked out of the premiere and just keep saying WOW! Hardcore fans of Episodes 4-6 have a real treat in store, and new comers are greeted with an excellent stand alone film filled with amazing character development, unfolding plot, and a cinematography masterpiece! <br/><br/>Characters- amazing! so thought provoking, in depth, and absolutely detailed performances by the actors. Even Darth Vader has that same jaunt in his step as the original. The cast didn't miss a beat, and no detail of their character went overlooked. I smell some serious nods for one cast member in particular, you all can guess who.<br/><br/>Plot- The plot started off a little disjointed and confusing. You know this is a story about how the rebel alliance gets the plans for the Death Star but that's about it. I have to admit i was a little fearsome the first 20 minutes are so of the movie, with having to learn all the new names, and jumping around to multiple different planets that have not been seen or explored in the Star Wars Cinematic Universe yet. Boy did my patience pay off. They answer just about every question you could possibly conceive and looking back realize the creative approach they took really played more into character development and building an entire experience. Have patience padawan, push through and the force will reveal everything.<br/><br/>Cinematography- The graphics and animations seamlessly meld into the elaborate, impressive and detailed sets I would expect from Old Hollywood, and every picture captures the imagination with possibility and information. A lot of my complaints with Episodes 1- 3 were that their efforts in technology advancements seemed unfocused, poorly guided, and without reflection, giving life to unspeakable horrors like JarJar Binks and flashy incoherent lightsaber swordplay. This movie transports you back to the technological era that existed in Episodes 4-6 and gets rid of the unnecessary clutter and disorganization that plagued previous Star Wars movies. By far the most impressive aspect of this film. <br/><br/>I was extremely worried about where Disney would take this franchise (especially after the standard and steady reintroduction they gave with episode 7) and those fears have been put to rest. Kudos Cast and Crew, I look forward to the next adventure to a Galaxy far far away..."
"coda-73738","10","3","10","15 December 2016"," Mind blowing!
","Have just got home from watching the latest episode of the 'Star Wars'saga 'Rogue One' I went in with a totally open mind as if I'm honest I felt a bit let down with 'The Force Awakens' but what I saw tonight really blew me AWAY! This is not a typical 'Star Wars' type film that all the family can enjoy, this is for the fans that have grown up with 'Star Wars'. The action and special effects are mind blowing. This is not the type of film that you can take your 6 year old son or daughter to see as the story is quite dark for a 'Star Wars' film, and has to be followed. I have been a nut of these films ever since I saw the first one out in the U.S.A in the '77 and I have loved them all (apart from episodes 1, 2 and 3, the least said about them the better!). Watching this film tonight made me feel like I was 13 years old again seeing 'A New Hope' for the first time and sitting there in total awe at this amazing film that I was seeing on the screen in front of me. This latest episode of the 'Star Wars' saga is right up there alongside the best episode of all,'The Empire Strikes Back' and dare I say slightly better? But I will have to reserve my judgement and see this episode a few more times before I make my final decision. If like me you are a 'Star Wars' nut go and see this film as soon as possible, you will LOVE IT!"
"jalkazar","8","3","10","15 December 2016"," Hope and sacrifice are essential themes in this extension of the Star Wars saga
","Hope and sacrifice. These are the two themes that run through the veins of this extension of the Star Wars mythos and it is these themes that makes the movie greater than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Rogue One is the first installment in what is going to be a (probably endless) series of one off movies within the Star Wars universe and what Rogue One does right, and does so excellently, is build upon what is established and give the first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, an added sense of weight by telling the story of what preceded it. It's a prequel of sorts, but not one that going into the characters of the other Star Wars movies, but one that expands upon the sacrifice and struggle that made the Rebel Alliance success possible.<br/><br/>The film is not without fault however. The early sequences jump between settings and characters in a quick progression in order to set up all of the different moving parts. The individual scenes are often well acted but they seem to separated from the overarching theme of the movie, a theme of war, hope and sacrifice. This rush also loses what could have been important moments. There's a scene where a young girl is caught within the crossfire and it's meant to convey a moment in the story where one of the characters start seeing what the war does but some of the weight is lost when the scene plays out too fast without truly giving the audience a sense of the dread and chaos of the battle scene.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie work for the most part. Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Donnie Yen and Riz Ahmed all deliver memorable performances and it's great to see Star Wars embrace diverse and fresh talent. Other performances, Forest Whitakers for instance, fail to sell me on the characters and there's a certain CGI character that falls into the valley of uncanniness for me (even if the CGI passed some by without being noticed).<br/><br/>But Rogue One shines when it does what it does best. Expand upon and give weight to the story of A New Hope and I loved those parts."
"Rat_27","8","3","11","27 December 2016"," I can't WAIT for Rogue Two!!!
","Not because I know a lot of Bothans will die in it, but this movie was AMAZING! This was the Star Wars entertainment we have been waiting for at the movies. And I say 'at' the movies, because this movie deserves the big screen and Dolby. 3D isn't necessary, but it's a theater experience.<br/><br/>The visuals are outstanding, and the story is compelling, although we all know the outcome. And the final scene with Vader is now one of my all-time favorite Star Wars scenes.<br/><br/>On the downside, I am a little confused to the point of Stormtrooper armor. If troopers can be beaten with a stick, then what is the point of the helmet? We've also been told that they can't filter toxins, just smoke. And they clearly don't have any aiming assistance software. And the breastplates don't seem to stop blaster fire, so ... why are they wearing it? On that note, finally seeing some dirty Stormtrooper armor was kind of cool, as was some of the other sets of armor.<br/><br/>The music wasn't John Williams. And those are my only two complaints.<br/><br/>Everything else was awesome. I have a new favorite droid, and the new spacecraft were really cool, and well used. Also, it makes sense why they aren't present in the next 3 movies. The locales are very Star Wars-esque, and the fighting finally feels like this franchise should be named as it is.<br/><br/>If you are a Star Wars fan, you want and need to see this movie. If you aren't, then ... we aren't of like minds, and <br/><br/>Anyway, I rank this movie third in the series, and I have very high hopes for further Star Wars stories."
"Bello-4","10","3","11","24 December 2016"," Rouge One Is Perhaps The Best of the Star Wars Movies!!!
","Rouge One is perhaps one of if not the best of the Star Wars movies. While admittedly starting a bit slow, Rouge One quickly takes off and doesn't look back. As more than one critic has stated, this is a war movie first and foremost. The characters don't spend time on sappy dialog and the sets, scenes and action are visually awesome and stunning. The movie viewer can appreciate the Empire being at the height of its power (troopers being able to actually hit things, and haven't some of us ever rooted for the Empire - just a little?), as well as rebels whom don't give up, don't need any hokey force but rather throw themselves into things with all they have and never give up.<br/><br/>Rouge One succeeds very much where Episode Seven failed. While both movies are visually stunning, their action scenes roller-coaster awesome and their female lead characters inspiring and believable. Rouge One is very much an original story, while Episode Seven - a really good film in its own rite - is also a disappointing rehash in several aspects (and that's confirmed by folks leaving the theaters - both at the end of Episode Seven and Rouge One - that I overheard).<br/><br/>I appreciate the Vader, and Leia for that matter, only really make cameos. It makes sense in that it keeps them from taking over the movie, and also a character like Vader; well you know HE would've never lost the plans for the Death Star. It also allows others within the Imperial military to shine, I mean while Vader might've been the most famous Imperial there were others of recognition also and this movie really allows them to come into their own.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones, whom I've admired for years, is going to see her career made by this movie. She's had a reputation for being careful in the films that she chooses to do, she'd rather do a film of substance rather than a hopeful blockbuster. She made the right choice in picking this movie, not because it was going to flop - I mean it' Star Wars - but rather it's a rare caliber of a blockbuster that draws in the viewer and you forget that you're ""watching"" a blockbuster. I wish Ms. Jones all the best of luck that this movie will bring to her, she deserves it as does the rest of her motley band whom knowing the odds still embraced a mission for the cause."
"AaronCapenBanner","8","3","11","24 December 2016"," A Story Of Hope
","First in the stand-alone/spin-off series of ""Star Wars"" films is a winner. Set in-between Episodes III & IV, story has a ragtag group of rebels(led by Jyn Erso, played by Felicity Jones) who are made aware of an alarming new super-weapon just completed by the Empire called the Death Star that is capable of destroying whole planets, and so come up with a desperate plan(aided by the Rebel Alliance) to steal the schematics of it in order to exploit a weakness built into it by a most personal architect and ""collaborator"" - Jyn's father Galen(played by Mads Mikkelsen), though that won't be so easy, as Darth Vader(still voiced by James Earl Jones) is on the way to stop them...<br/><br/>Superb prequel takes its time to build, but delivers a rousing third act filled with well-staged ground and outer space battle scenes that gives this a welcome gritty feel. Filled with knowing cameos(especially regarding Grand Moff Tarkin) and touches, film is obviously made with love and respect by director Gareth Edwards and the whole crew, with a final sequence and scene that hits the bulls-eye.<br/><br/>Will give real hope to ""Star Wars"" fans that new parent company Walt Disney is on the right path at last, though of course only time will tell for now..."
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","3","11","15 December 2016"," A Tale of Sacrifice.
","First off, this was so much better than I anticipated! Possibly better than all three prequels combined. Overall, a spectacular blend of the best aspects of all Star Wars films. I was impressed last winter by Episode VII, and I'm excited to see where those new characters take us, but for now, this Episode serves as a wonderful present under the holiday tree!<br/><br/>There are various reasons why Episodes I-III fell short of many of our expectations as long-time fans. Too much reliance on CGI, wooden acting, clichéd writing at times... Lucas seemed to be phoning some of it in. Rogue One is intense, intelligent where it needs to be, and a wonderful blend of modern effects with a retro production design. Even the comic relief character is tolerable! One thing I really like about this film and Episode VII, is the different and more detailed ways they film ship movement in relation to planets and other ships. Space seems to be more three-dimensional. The acting is quite good. Unfortunately, the nature of this story does not give is characters that we will get to know over several episodes. They perform their functions, and the well-crafted story allows us to see what their sacrifices will ultimately lead to. It takes special skill to make us care about a story that can only lead to a certain place. Rogue One has this quality more so than the prequels.<br/><br/>By all means, see this film. A bravo effort from a mostly unheralded cast full of action and exotic set pieces both familiar and new. The Star Wars Universe is capable of expanding... if you do it right.<br/><br/>9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"AdventureWolf","8","3","11","15 December 2016"," Really enjoyable and packs an emotional punch.
","For 40 years, all we've known of the rebels who ""managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR"" is that they were successful. Now, we finally get to see who they were, what they did, and what became of them. Coming with such a love of Star Wars and a knowledge of it's history, I was very excited to see this and get to meet the characters who provided the catalyst for my favorite and the most influential movies of my life.(I must also point out that I am one of those who will have nothing to do with the prequels...) I was not disappointed. The tone is quite different to the saga movies (the start without an opening crawl seems very abrupt), but the familiar iconography and the fact that we know exactly where this fits in the time line make sure that this is most definitely a Star Wars movie. The introduction of the (many) new characters is necessarily brief and initially makes any emotional attachment to them slight - but by the end of the movie and the final battle scene the viewer finds themselves really caring when their fates are revealed, giving the finale a real emotional punch. There are also so many wonderful familiar moments that tie the movie to the original trilogy - but these are never forced and always sit well within the context of the story being told here. My ten year old kept turning to me and grinning at each one. The action at the end is on par with anything we've seen and there are several showstopping moments that simply have to seen on the big screen. Both times I've seen this movie (so far!) there have been gasps and claps from the audience at several of the big effect moments. If I have a gripe it's a very small one, a related only to a few instances of the CGI of two significant human characters (you'll know who they are, but apart from that I have no complaints about Rogue One. It's not a Star Wars movie, it's a definitely a war movie, but it's most certainly part of the time line and ties in seamlessly with the movies we all know and love. Thoroughly recommended. And the Darth Vader scene at the end? Awesome!"
"joni-72","7","3","11","14 December 2016"," Too much violence.
","Am I the one only who thinks that there was too much violence? 1/3 of the movie was a total war zone and ground troops killing each others like flies. I did not expect this to be a war movie, but more like a spy movie that they would deviously infiltrate to places and use more wisdom rather that violence. I don't mind air battles they are always amazing and looks stunning! So the story line was rather weak and way too predictable. Also I did not relate to many of characters and most of them be only remembered as a cannon fodder. Probably most of us Star wars fans will appreciate many moments in this film and they will remain as a classics. Many shots where really beautiful and overall cinematography was proficient and versatile."

","I am too old for admire the virtues of this new serie. A part of them, in obvious manner, are real great, from the actors in secondary roles to the fight scenes, for the direct and cold story about rebels without any choice to be something else to the meeting with Darth Vader and Princess Leia. The Death Star plans are just a pretext for a huge present of battles and action and rain of special effects. Sure, for my 43 years old, I am too old to be fan of Rogue One. Only one of polite viewers with respect for the perspective about Star Wars of a new generation."

"chakor-74657","1","2","6","13 June 2018"," Could Have Been Good, But Ended Up Boring and Forgettable
","When I heard that this film was basically another prequel and not just an bland retread like The Force Awakens, I was actually somewhat looking forward to it and thought it would be a good home viewing - boy was I wrong. <br/><br/>Long story short - a lot happens in Rogue One, but almost none of it really means anything because it has almost no substance. The idea on paper was still good and the Vader scenes were well done, but other than those two scenes, the entire film is horribly bland and completely forgettable. The characters are about as cardboard as they come and have almost zero character development. There are only three characters in the entire film who I found myself giving an iota for as I watched it, and those were the droid (can't remember its name), Jyn, and Galen - and even all three of them weren't given enough development; they were just better than the other characters. The score is also unbelievably ""bleh"" and does not help the film at all. I have heard other reviews argue that this film is ""deep"" - yeah, maybe for a 13-year-old. But for someone simply looking for a good film, there is no substance and it feels like a two-hour waste of time. It is so boring that it is almost the perfect opposite of entertainment.<br/><br/>So, at the end of the day, this is yet another fine example of how to sell a film with its name. If this film didn't have the Star Wars name on it, its Rotten Tomatoes score would be incredibly low and I doubt it's IMDb consensus would be a 7.9/10. Normally I would rate this about a 3/10, but considering how high the current IMDb consensus is, all it's getting is a 1/10."
"jonconnormustlive-46298","1","2","6","16 December 2017"," The worst Star Wars film yet!
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a prequel to A New Hope. It Sees a group of rebels on a mission to thwart the Empire and steal the plans to the Death Star.<br/><br/>On paper this was probably a good idea but it just failed in every way.
It's worth mentioning Disney Studios forced reshoots. Director Gareth Edwards quit and a new Director was brought in to finish the film, hence the uneven tone. <br/><br/>It's filled with HORRIBLE CGI!! There are two characters recreated by special effects and they look like creepy bobble-heads.<br/><br/>The actors are dull and forgettable.
The action scenes are boring and bad-looking.
The dialogue is weak and adds nothing.
Even the scenery is dark and dreary.
This doesn't look like a Star Wars film it comes across like a crummy generic dumb action movie.<br/><br/>I find there's nothing redeemable about this crap fest.
I don't know how anyone rates it highly. It's completely pointless!"

This time around the problem is in me. I just did not like it. While The Force Awakens was a very fun movie that i enjoyed i need to admit this one on the other hand i was bored with watching and i did not really like it. There were a few good laughs, an OK action scene and a pretty sweet ending. The movie itself, the middle just felt boring to me.

"dave-lester-301-806366","10","2","6","25 July 2017"," Star Wars at its best
","Very few spoilers..When I first saw the initial trailers for Rogue One I wasn't looking forward to the movie release but this is a great film, arguably the best Star Wars film ever made. I'm a mad Star Wars fan, love them all (maybe the Jar Jar one not so much) I saw this 4 times at the cinema in the first week of release It is superbly directed and acted with believable characters and a great link to ""A New Hope"". I think its very important that characters are believable in who they are playing (If you've seen Alien Covenant, try telling me any of the crew were believable, did the bumbling captain look like a leader lol) Rogue One is quite a dark film with characters being killed off almost as quick as they are introduced but it moves at a great pace, and it pulls it off as it is very well cast, hats off again to the casting crew, I thought Forest Whitaker was excellent as Saw, the whole cast were, especially Jyn, Cassian, Galen, Krennic and Chirrut & Baze and of course the droid K-2SO, for me the biggest surprise, how could they ever eclipse C3PO and R2D2, well they have. As most of the cast don't appear in a New Hope I'm very surprised by any criticism of how quickly they are killed off. Visually the film is stunning with great locations, if I was a storm trooper, I would want to be stationed on Scariff. The Death Star looks super menacing as it comes into view, I'm not sure given its size it would cause an eclipse but it makes it look twice as menacing. This film is what Star Wars fans have been crying out for, a darker version, with stunning locations and great fighting sequences on land and in space (If you are not keen on some of the CGI of Tarkin And Leigh...its nit-picking) The final scene when it switches from Jyn & Cassian on Scariff to Vaders ships as the Rebels try to jump back into hyperspace is incredible and ties the film superbly to ""A New Hope"""
"jelstudio","8","2","6","21 April 2017"," Darth Vader is truly impressive :)
","Reviewing the movie: ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (8/10 stars)<br/><br/>The previous film; ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", was such a disappointment to me that I wasn't expecting R1 to be any good. However, I'm glad to say those 2 movies are nothing alike.<br/><br/>R1 felt true to the original spirit of the first Star Wars movie (episode4) and feels like it sits perfectly as episode 3½ (which I suppose it's aiming for, although not officially, given the story- line)<br/><br/>There was nothing that felt out-of-place or 'wrong', in how it told the story preceding episode 4, which actually is a bit stunning considering the movie is made 40 years after episode 4.<br/><br/>This is VERY well done! :)<br/><br/>Not even the hair-styles felt out of place.<br/><br/>Also, thank the force, there was no Jar Jar Binks.<br/><br/>So, the story fits, the visuals fit, the sounds fit, in pretty much all regards R1 feels like a true Star Wars film. Understanding how much Star Wars have become almost a kind of religion to fans, that is a really huge accomplishment.<br/><br/>George Lucas himself messed up with episode 1, 2 and 3 (and to some extent also with his re-makes of episode 4, 5 and 6 (although, in all fairness, I do like the remade version of Jabba the Hutt more than the original human character (played by Thomas Declan Mulholland) that was supposed to be in the very first release of episode 4, but ended up as a deleted scene))<br/><br/>And Jeffrey Jacob ""J.J."" Abrams, who directed episode 7 is just no good at directing (He's good at producing though). Even though he has a cool middle-name he has not directed a single movie I liked (""Mission: Impossible III"" was OK, but the rest of his directing- work is all terrible)<br/><br/>So, as a long time fan of Star Wars, watching episode 3½ was like seeing the first real new Star Wars film since episode 6 (from 1983) So for me there are 4 real Star Wars films; episode 4, 5, 6 and now; 3½.<br/><br/>So is there nothing wrong or bad to say about this new one? Yes; the 3D version was 'fake 3D' (as in; a conversion from 2D to 3D), although a very well made 'fake 3D'. If you don't know what to look for, you may not notice it's a conversion, but once you know what 'real 3D' looks like; you can tell it's a conversion. It's not really a problem, unless you're a purist. In my world; 'fake 3D' (conversions from 2D) is to 'real 3D' what CGI-characters like Jar Jar Binks is to real people; just stupid and annoying.<br/><br/>Speaking of CGI-characters; it was actually quite fun to see how Governor Tarkin and princess Leia was brought to life in this. In episode 4 Tarkin is played by Peter Wilton Cushing (He made some seriously cool cult horror-films in the old days. Actually he's made a ton of cool films. A magnificent actor. One of the few really great ones), who passed away in 1994. I guess in the near future real actors will no longer be needed, since it's now possible to hire any face you want. They weren't perfect (the facial movements and eyes still don't look fully natural), but they were close (If you don't know the original actors It IS possible you wouldn't notice). Especially Leia (although she only had one scene, where Tarkin had a full role)<br/><br/>About the story; ever since the original in 1977, female protagonists have been common. This one is no exception. Actually it takes it a bit further; this time the main-lead, Jyn (played by Felicity Rose Hadley Jones), is a full-on solo lead. I guess you could say it does in fact deviate a bit from the originals here, in that we only really get one main-lead. She does have friends that help, but it's not quite the band, or group of close friends, of leads, all with their own personal story-line, like we saw in the originals.<br/><br/>It gives it a bit of a Joan-of-Arc feel, which actually works very well for the story and how it plays out. I don't know if that was an intentional decision, but it happens to fit the story perfectly.<br/><br/>Finally; Darth Vader is, and here it comes across even better than in the originals, just the most formidable villain in all movie- history. The main scene he has in R1 is just too cool. So super awesomely cool that it is down-right epic! Who ever designed that scene... wrote it, filmed it, edited it, lighted it, the lot... that crew is just a pack of pure genius talent! I was just blown away by that scene :) THAT was the REAL Darth Vader right there. Fantastic.<br/><br/>That's it. What a cool film :)"
"EvilBaldDude","9","2","6","21 April 2017"," A good Star Wars prequel
","That almost sounds like a contradiction in terms, after the last three efforts. For the first time in decades, we have a Star Wars film with a good, solid story that hangs together. It also ties in nicely with Episode IV.<br/><br/>There is a great multinational cast. The acting is good, and the characters are unusually believable and vivid for a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>It is still your classic space opera, with space battles, laser gunfights, and the usual smorgasbord of visuals. However, there are darker, more gritty elements in the story. Some Star Wars devotees might find that a bit of a con, preferring their entertainment more lighthearted. There are others, though, for whom it makes the film more absorbing."
"jigou-82386","10","2","6","15 April 2017"," My new personal favorite
","Fabulous, a Star Wars movie that takes its theme completely seriously. I ditched High School the day I saw the first movie, and I don't think I've found any of the sequels quite as satisfying, until now. Having met Peter Cushing as a young teenager at the 2nd Annual Famous Monsters of Film convention, it was great to see him resurrected for the film in a role most sinister. And having lost Carrie Fisher recently, her digital appearance as a young Princess Leia is also too cool. I've had some trepidations over the idea of Disney taking over Lucas Films. But frankly, if this is an example of the caliber of what they will produce in the future, this galaxy is in good hand."

"jdr_ph","8","2","6","11 April 2017"," A lot better than Episode 7
","I became a Star Wars fan after watching the original trilogy in the 70s onward. Yeah, I am already old. I was disappointed in the prequels and Episode 7 for the simple reason that they did not get the flavor of the original trilogy, in my opinion, and relied too much on special effects instead of storytelling and characterization. Rogue One, on the other hand, had that feel of the original Star Wars and even though the film was almost like the original trilogy in terms of having characters that were like Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca in android form, and Ben Kenobi (the purpose and traits of each character are a bit similar to the original characters), the story was a good prequel to A New Hope, Episode 4. It might have fight scenes reminiscent of the old trilogy but overall the storytelling was gripping enough to hold my interest and made me see why the original trilogy was such a hit critically and commercially. I am glad I watched this after seeing Episode 7 which made me vow to stop watching its sequels, especially now that Carrie Fisher is dead. Oh, this reminds me that the film could have benefited with a better CGI for two well-known characters."
"Thrashman88","10","2","6","22 March 2017"," The Star Wars Movie Adult Fans Have Been Waiting For
","Rogue One: easily the most adult of ALL Star Wars movies. To some, saying ""adult"" would mean ""boring"", ""unexciting"" or ""lifeless"". ""Rogue One"" is none of those adjectives but it's fair to say it is the most ""kid unfriendly"" of all the Star Wars movies. Director Gareth Edwards made it his quest to make a Star Wars movie for the middle aged fans, the ones who were, 8, 9, 10 or even 15 years old when they first got introduced to George Lucas' space opera. Yes, I'm one of those fans. It's unavoidable comparing this movie with the prequels. While the prequels had their charm (and were made by the CREATOR himself, Mr. Lucas), it wasn't really what I was expecting. I don't hate them at all, but I don't like them as much as the originals (I do think however, ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is superior to ""Return Of The Jedi""). Gareth Edwards completely understood that there was a huge need for a more ""serious"" Star Wars movie. ""The Force Awakens"" was a move in the right direction, despite what the unfaithful might think or say. ""Force Awakens"" had a perfect balance of serious, dramatic parts with more lighthearted fare (without ever falling into Jar Jar or ""ani"" territory). With ""Rogue One"", Gareth Edwards went all out to make a grim, bleak looking movie. Certain scenes reminded me of ""Bladerunner"" and ""Alien"", two masterpieces of adult science fiction. We get to feel the rough edges of the rebellion, that it's not all peachy and good and that sometimes violent decisions must be made for the sake of the cause. Reviewers that have also mentioned similarities to ""Saving Private Ryan"" are also right. The fights are violent, the storm troopers are scarier (something that JJ Abrams got positively right in ""The Force Awakens""), the rebels have their defects. It's not all ""good"" or ""bad"", there are grays, there's a middle ground.<br/><br/>What we basically have with ""Rogue One"" is a prequel. The most ""prequels"" of the prequels, if there's an adjective to describe Gareth Edwards work here. The movie truly ends with the beginning of ""A New Hope"". We finally know how the rebels ""stole"" the plans to the Death Star: a lot of casualties, a lot of deaths, a lot of sacrifice. ""Rogue One"" was the REAL suicide squad. Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor and their band of mercenaries are heroes as much as Han Solo, Leia Organa or Luke Skywalker. While the latter three lived to celebrate the destruction of the Death Star, I wonder how many of the rebels know the sacrifice that went into stealing the plans. <br/><br/>The acting, the pacing, the effects: everything was brilliant about ""Rogue One"". It was a daring project that could've backfired but it did not. Yes, I too missed the intro scroll with the triumphant Star Wars theme playing loud in the background. Yes, I missed the familiar themes of John Williams. Composer Michael Giaccino had one hell of a task but he pulled it of. The main prevalent musical motif in ""Rogue One"" (could be ""Jyn Erso's"" theme) is similar to ""Rey's Theme"" in ""The Force Awakens"". It could be a friendly nod from Giaccino to Williams. Only a couple of Williams' classic cues were used: The Imperial March, the Imperial theme from Star Wars, the Force theme and of course, the end credits have a good portion of classic Star Wars music, but almost 90% of the score is brand new music. It had to be done and Giaccino was the right choice.<br/><br/>I have nothing but praises for ""Rogue One"". If you were expecting something like ""The Phantom Menace"", this movie is NOT for you, I'm sorry to say. For me, ""Rogue One"" hit all the right buttons. It was the Star Wars movie I was waiting for."

Many don't like the way they brought back some of the old characters, but to me it was OK. If somebody had any questions how Disney will treat Star Wars and can they keep saga alive after this movie movie I think there is no any questions about it. Disney is a perfect home for Star Wars and I hope we will see many Star Wars movies in the future. In Rogue One makers had free hands to handle the characters because there is no need to make sequel for it. You could think that story is dull, because you already know the ending. Despite that movie is full of surprises and script is clever. Without a doubt Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>Star Wars movies has always been my favorite movies since 1977 first movie. It was a good choice to sell Star Wars to Disney after not so good episodes 1 to 3. This way we Star Wars fans get a chance to enjoy many more Star Wars movies in the future. Rogue One is an excellent continuum to Star Wars saga."
"wildhunt1-585-849528","10","2","6","27 January 2017"," Another awesome addition to a great series
","All right, my review is a little late, and for that I apologize. I wanted to make sure my pure fanboyism over Star Wars didn't take completely over. Unfortunately, this was an awesome Star Wars movie, and while it did have a few faults, they were so minor in my opinion that they did not take away from the sheer awesomness of this movie.<br/><br/>Grade: 10/10, A+<br/><br/>Does this movie truly deserve a 10/10 grade? That's debatable, and if you don't think it deserves that, I can completely understand. But everything in this movie worked for me, other than a few minor things, but as I don't grade on aesthetics, I can't really fault the movie for them. Should the movie have had an opening crawl with the Star Wars theme? Yes, it should have. Did it truly, completely need it? No, it did not. Should the movie have been scored by John Williams? Yes. Did it truly, completely need John Williams? No.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10 You cannot fault the story in any way, shape or form. Everything you needed to know to tell the story completely was there. There was nothing missing, there were no plot holes, and the character development was great considering these were characters never mentioned again in the later movies. Every part of this movie led to the fantastic conclusion which was awe-inspiring in its greatness.<br/><br/>Character Development: 10/10 Considering how the movie ends, and the fact the characters in this movie are never mentioned later, the character development for them all was pretty solid. Could it have been better? Of course. But it's not really enough to take points away for. I liked all the characters in this movie-- some more than others, yes--but everyone served their purpose and did what they had to to make this an exciting experience for me.<br/><br/>Directing: 10/10 Gareth Edwards, who brought us Godzilla 2014, had me a bit nervous as the director, because he famously had a Godzilla movie that barely had Godzilla in it. So I didn't really know what to expect from Rogue One. All I can say is, you did a damn fine job, Gareth, and I hope you do another Star Wars movie later. He told a great story here.<br/><br/>Casting: 10/10 Great cast! Everyone was perfect in their role and I liked everyone immensely!<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 Everyone played their parts perfectly!<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10 Some people might have a problem with parts of the CGI in this movie, and again, I can't fault you if you did. But to me, every part was almost perfect, including the two fully CGI actors who should not have been in the movie but thankfully were. No spoilers, though I'm sure almost everyone has seen the movie by now. Again, perhaps not perfect, but it shows what Hollywood will be capable of--and in a way, that's rather scary.<br/><br/>Music: 10/10 Michael Giacchino is not John Williams, but considering his scored this movie in 4 weeks is phenomenal in and of itself. So, I'll cut him some slack for that. The music was still very Star- Warsy, and while it may not have been as memorable as John Williams' music, it was still darn good. I can't take away points when he gave us something still spectacular in such a short time.<br/><br/>Pacing: 10/10 Did not want to fall asleep once in this movie. It started off with a bang and kept going to a very thrilling and unexpected, jaw-dropping climax.<br/><br/>Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Everything felt and looked just like something should in a Star Wars movie. Great job!<br/><br/>Enjoyment: 10/10 If I could, I'd probably give my enjoyment a 13/10 because I really loved this movie. It was the first Star Wars movie that didn't have anything geared towards kids in it. No Gungans, no Ewoks, not cute and cuddly creatures. This was a movie about a mission, and that mission was awesome and dark and grim and more than I was expecting it to be. Gareth Edwards outdid himself in my opinion.<br/><br/>To show how this movie ranks against the other Star Wars movies, I'll post all my scores below:<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - 10/10 Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens - 9.6/10 Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back - 9.6/10 Star Wars IV: A New Hope - 9.6/10 Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi - 9.0/10 Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith - 8.5/10 Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones - 8.1/10 Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace - 7.8/10<br/><br/>Before anyone says anything, I had a few problems with Empire and A New Hope that were enough to keep me from putting them above Force Awakens. None of the movies were perfect, but Force Awakens I just enjoyed more, which is why it has the same grade but is placed above Empire and A New Hope."

"hanyap","9","2","6","14 January 2017"," Great movie, re-energized my love of SW after disappointing #7
","Some light spoilers.<br/><br/>I had very low expectations going into RO, because I felt horribly let down by #7. Sure it hit some buttons in the sense that the universe was there, some familiar faces (and ships) were present, but there was too much humour, it felt like #4 re-imagined, the plot lacked cohesion, (parts of it, like the planet sapping the suns was just laughable), emo villain (Khylo Ren) wasn't impressive, and a weak, semi-hysterical heroine who runs off into the forest when she discovers something difficult was disappointing.<br/><br/>I almost didn't go to SEE Rogue One, because after 1-3 and 7, I couldn't take any more disappointment. I LOVE Star Wars, it was a seminal series for me with lots of attachments and importance, and I couldn't take another battering by it. I love space and science fiction, and Star Wars grabbed the love I had of that genre and made it alive in front of my eyes. I am grateful for that.<br/><br/>My boyfriend's company had extra tickets for RO however and I went. At first I was confused a little - the story line comes together in pieces in the beginning, jumping from a remote planet to a prison to a mining colony, etc - but slowly the shape takes form.<br/><br/>Jyn is a terrific character; she tries desperately to hold what is happening at bay, because as she says to Saw, her former father figure, ""all this has brought me is pain"", and it's believable. But when confronted with a message from her real father Galen and what is going on she becomes a dedicated fighter, willing to sacrifice anything to stop the empire and make Galen's sacrifice mean something.<br/><br/>I loved the characters - from Bodhi, the cautious rebel who fully embraces the Alliance, to Churrit, the almost naively faithful guardian of the Jedi temple. The danger and urgency seem real - something 7 was lacking for me - and Cassian is a great character; a man hard from years of fighting the Empire who softens yet stays true to his principles.<br/><br/>The locations are great - from Scarif, the Empire's repository of plans to Yavin 4, faithfully reproduced as the rebel base, to Jedha, the site of a Jedi temple. I loved how everything isn't all spelled out - you know for instance what Jyn has is Khyber around her neck without being told, and you are left to wonder a bit how Bodhi really came to want to help to alliance; whether it was mostly because of the rape of Jedha, his homeworld, his admiration for Galen, or even more than that.<br/><br/>K-2SO, voice acted by Alan Tudyk, provides a few light moments in a story that feels urgent, deadly serious. The last 45 minutes or so, when the rebels decide to join the fight on Scarif whilst Rogue One is trying to steal the plans is amazing. I saw this movie in both Real 3D and IMAX, and it is stunning in both. It has some of the best space fighting and cinematography I've seen in any Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>When I first heard Peter Cushing's voice, I was surprised - I knew he had died years ago. His CGI is better than Carrie Fisher's at the end, FWIW. Tarkin is as creepy and loathsome as you remember him, and I am glad he was able to be included here, as he is key to the continuity and it segues into Star Wars: A New Hope.<br/><br/>The movie for me, however, wasn't without flaws. When General Dravin tells Cassian to kill Galen rather than capture him, it seemed ill advised - after all, the station is operational and Galen could be the only person to provide information on it to the rebellion. I do admit a capture operation is a bit more involved and perhaps Draven didn't want to sacrifice the forces necessary for it. Also Tarkin destroyed the repository on Scarif, which I also thought wasn't very reasonable. I don't believe he was certain about the status of any upload and the records for the ENTIRE empire were stored there. A huge loss, I would think, and if the Death Star is so impregnable as Tarkin seems to believe, then why worry even if they DID get the plans for the Death Star? Then I realised there might be another consideration - Tarkin knew that Director Krennick was on Scarif, and could have also been getting rid of a thorn in his side.<br/><br/>Despite these few questions, I think the movie is excellent and holds up well - perhaps better - after a few showings, when you have a bit of an orientation and you can enjoy the smaller details, drink in the battles."

Even the reviews of my girlfriend and myself were mixed; while she really liked this film, it left me cold.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a surprisingly dour movie for a series that usually embraces a fun aesthetic. The empire and rebel leaders are almost equally unlikable, and the story is a grim slog.<br/><br/>While my girlfriend spent the movie planning her Jyn Halloween costume, I found the character fairly bland; far less interesting than Force Awakens Rey or the original's Leia (or even, for that matter, Phantom Menace's princess). I cared for the rebel soldier in charge of the mission even less.<br/><br/>The best characters were easily the blind Chirrut and K-2SO. These two characters had the humor and heart I expect from Star Wars characters.<br/><br/>The basic idea of building a movie around something briefly mentioned in the original movie is a good one, and the story is pretty solid. But I never felt invested in the characters and little of the action actually excited me.<br/><br/>I don't understand anyone who claims this is the best movie in the series. Even my girlfriend wouldn't go that far. For me it was a huge disappointment."

","In this understated tale from a galaxy far, far, away, we follow the daughter of a rebellious Imperial scientist who has masterminded the one fatal flaw of the deathstar, named Galen Erso. Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones) is a despondent pawn in the fight against the empire. After becoming all but orphaned as a child by the war, the film finds her many years later; her self-destructive path has led to her arrest but, due to her connections with an extremist rebel, she is 'rescued' by 'The Alliance'. We then follow her and a group of unlikely heroes who battle their way to an imperial stronghold, eventually retrieving the blueprints that set the scene for the original trilogy. <br/><br/>The film's title is its mantra. It is the Rogue One of the family and stands apart from its flashy cousins, almost as an independent film about rebellion that just happens to be set in the star wars universe. I think what I enjoyed most about this addition to the star wars franchise, is that it has unearthed the nuanced and slightly dejected characters that have to live out their existence in the post-jedi universe. It has, unintentionally or not, shone a mirror to the real-life struggles that overlooked and disparate individuals of political upheaval today must feel. <br/><br/>The film barely sets the scene before darting dizzingly from planet to planet, only pausing for brief moments of slick action and to piece together the motley crew that will take on the empire. The worlds they visit are very much alive and distinct, from the origins of the force in Jedha to where it now resides in the hellish, volcanic home base of Darth Vader. The action, being on a smaller scale for the majority of the film, is gritty and visceral. The final battle brings to the fore images of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>At a 133 minutes long, however, the cast still don't get the screen time they need in order to connect with the story or to each-other and, sadly, in this regard the characters in Rogue One are underdeveloped. With Captain Andor (Diego Luna) slightly boring in moments and the defecting pilot played by the underutilised Riz Ahmed. I would have appreciated slightly better character development in the first half, even though the second half brings what is left together very nicely. The cast being so large, none get to truly find their feet, even the father-daughter driving force of Galen and Jyn can sometimes seem hollow; with all the forced nicknames that come with it. However, the additions of the blind muttering monk and his admiral aimbot sidekick do fill their role nicely. Old favourites pop-up in sometimes forced ways, but I try to remember that this film has its heart in the right place. It is not The Force Unleashed, it is for the fans. <br/><br/>Considering the wealth of characters, the writing does not let itself be watered down. It provides a compelling narrative with characters wrestling with themes of self-doubt; whether, in this rebellion, the end can ever justify the blood soaked means. In Rogue One's portrayal of a darker, meaningful Star Wars universe - this film triumphs. The dialogue and themes underpinning the film are surprisingly forceful (heh). It is a success in providing the much needed depth to this universe, and provides hope for future spin-offs that can stay true to the grass-roots."

","Ten years after the terminal insertion into film cosmos begot by George Lucas (""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" in 2005), settled down the first usufruct of Disney's shrewd acquisition when it purchased Lucasfilm—studio which is interpreted as the most remarkable franchise in pecuniary terms—by a reasonable value (USD $4 billion). ""The Force Awakens"" was the channel Abrams applied to flourish the torpid force in the warsies' heart after the futile prequels. Starting with this one, Disney took it upon itself to purvey an annual movie within litigating film release schedule. Kathleen Kennedy (co- founder of Amblin Entertainment and current President of Lucasfilm) and formidable crew of the factory covet with making an empirical universe about the preternatural galaxy far, far away; and to achieve this, they have concluded to try its luck with Edwards' war experiment in order to elucidate whether it is beneficial to create a line of independent events out of the Skywalker family. Fall 2016 was reserved season to release invigorating and unsafe new invention; ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" opens by far a feasible wave of dissimilar films of a galactic anthology while focusing and securing its strongest point in the director's fervent declaration: war film which does not drink neither George Lucas' nor J. J. Abrams' lymph for manufacturing a deferential, nostalgic, cogitative, and sometimes dispiriting extension in Star Wars mythology.<br/><br/>Despite economic success is safeguarded even with the most negligible work around this captivating constellation, its narrative or plot component emulates the scale clichés of the original trilogy: an inspiring princess, a humorous robot, a bold misanthrope, a strife between the dark side and the light side and of course theatrical display of spaceships assailing each other furiously. Conversely, this compact design takes risks as for inquiring into primitive and uncommon perspectives of the galaxy, which foster a fortification of a deeper concept around this mythology. And although as a last resort is a war celluloid more than remarkable—in spite of it merely sketches certain characteristics and focuses its plausible references in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967) by Robert Aldrich—does not manage to be a corporeal Star Wars movie since it's constantly held on by fan service and generates a quite primary treatment to the development. A prime look to unfamiliar areas from a standpoint's as ordinary as opposed, a wit tinged of tribulation and grief and one of the most honorable final thirds in a sci-fi/action/adventure blockbuster in recent times are the unforeseen top ambitions by a filmmaker who, respectfully, did not have good expectations on his hands owing to the controversial final reshoots, the script reformulations by Disney and doubtlessly the trembling replacement in musical lead from Alexandre Desplat to Michael Giacchino's baton, however, it's never too late to shut up a few individuals.<br/><br/>It takes place before the events of ""Episode IV,"" ""Rogue One"" came up from a shallow idea of visual effects supervisor and CCO at Industrial Light & Magic John Knoll, which consisted in clarifying the time- space around what was the itinerary of the Death Star plans until being in Princess Leia Organa's hands , route somewhat named in ""A New Hope"". So this is the story of those ordinary beings who achieved the extraordinary. Innocent Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) opens with a retrospective scene about her girlhood, underlined by tragedy and misfortune. Thereon, it introduces her as a redeemed prisoner who is moved to a Rebel Alliance HQ. There, a transcendental mission has commended her in order to make contact with his fading father for locating and discovering the nature and the place of a substantially powerful weapon. And as if it were ""Suicide Squad"", ordinary people clan gradually takes form, finding its cardinal mover into the force. Although the fabled team bounces from a planet to another for terminating its commission, we figured out exiguous details about the crew captained by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) —who made me very proud;—likewise, most fans clamor for more background in Saw Gerrera's story, the leader of the Onderon rebels; something completely similar to what happened with the Joker in ""SQ"". Despite the fact that the depth was an authentic reverb, character designs and performances are what many fans were waiting for. Displaying a heterogeneous and multicultural acting cast, which delves into each contemporary civilization, the film takes advantage of the cultural range to generate a vast human-racial universe inside its world, in the same way, each performer gets its moment of glory before the decisive and evocative ending. Their performances made the audience proud, so much so that was ineluctable not yell in the credits of the motion picture.<br/><br/>More suitable for adults than infants, more suitable for warsies than mass audiences. If it were action and conflagration scenes, the near-perfect third act would lead the film to the sublime, sadly, its burning and high-octane last forty minutes aren't enough to keep afloat lack of enthusiasm and the multiplicity of the beginning and exposition, opportunities lacking in momentum and vigor that exclusively are notable for performances and special effects. In time record, Giacchino composed an entrancing, nostalgic and fortifying soundtrack, which is assembled with the dark tone of each frame, also it testifies him as the first author in breaking John Williams' musical canon. ""Rogue One"" is more a war product, in where its spectacular music, sparkling performances, and nearly excellent action sequences invade unexplored lands and nothing irreverent in Star Wars world, also, the film gives a message of hope and encourages all us, who this year lost a great woman: imposing Carrie Fisher. RIP my Princess Leia."

","I am 40 years old and was practically raised on Star Wars. After going to the theater to watch episodes I, II, III, and VII, I swore I would never again go to a theater to watch any of the new age Star Wars. After three weeks of hearing everyone at work say this is the first good Star Wars movie to come out since the originals I broke down and watched it. I am in absolute shock at how good this movie was after the incredible disappointment of the last four. This movie got back to the basics and was in tuned with the originals. There were not any goofy characters, overwhelming CGI, and technology of equipment all matched the originals. As far as my collection is concerned, this is Episode III and I will buy it when available on Blu-Ray."

I recommend you go and see this in cinemas now because it is worth it. if you love star wars then you need to see Rogue One and even if you don't like star wars or are new to star wars you will love this movie, it is basically a war movie in star wars which really pulls you in and doesn't let you go with its tense scenes and all out action scenes that are great, whoever you are you will love this movie."
"timewhorl","9","2","6","5 January 2017"," Decent, solid addition...
","...not a total work of art, true, but fits well between Episodes III and IV. I enjoyed that it shows the post-Republic galaxy where the opulence has decayed and the stakes have increased. It also carries on the original theme of Rebels challenging a tyrannical Empire, in what seems to be a grittier way than previously seen. The characters do get some development time, a nice change from previous installments where all we know is a name and profession (heck, it took 45 minutes to meet Han Solo in A New Hope, all while NOT knowing Luke's last name?!?!). There are the occasional hiccups in plot, moments where characters seem to care more than they should about each other, too early in the story but I blame that on late extensive reshoots and plot changes. Grand Moff Tarkin was a vast achievement, I was impressed because I could believe it was him (99% of the time). That tech has made huge strides since Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy. I do think the side plot? main plot with Saw Gerrera could have been tightened somehow, but it still held my interest. <br/><br/>The Great: Casting, in my opinion, was brilliant. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna made you believe in the Empire-occupied dismal reality their charascters inhabit. The supporting cast, including Alan Tudyk, were also A+. Ben Mendelsohn, you the man, as far as villains go! The plot also fit in seamlessly with A New Hope, much more smoothly than Episodes I-III do with Episodes IV-VI. CGI was nice, tight and special effects in keeping (mostly) with those seen in the older trilogies.<br/><br/>The Good: settings, costumes, and musical score were quite good. Like I said, the opulence of the previous era is gone, people wear utility clothing that fit in with A New Hope. I was so happy to see the return of real clothes. The score IS good for a guy who had only six weeks to do it in, not quite John Williams but close enough while still being unique.<br/><br/>The Not-so-good: (SPOILERS) CGI Princess Leia was not as good as Tarkin, but this clip is so short it really is easy to ignore. The odd squid-mind reading creature of Saw Gerrera's is not really needed, a modified Imperial round torture probe would have been scarier (that needle on the end, woooah!). Vader. I think he had more plot before reshoots (trailers hinted at it) but really only needed to be at the very end. Scaring everyone in the theater with that hallway appearance. Speaking of the end...<br/><br/>It works for me, although I felt awful (SPOILERS) about Jyn and Cassian and their ship that never sailed. It was so close, too! But I felt Rogue One gave A New Hope greater urgency, that the stakes were even higher now because the Rebellion had lost so many lives.<br/><br/>So my advice is go see it. Form your own opinion. See how Leia got those plans, and maybe if you rewatch A New Hope, you will see in the opening crawl their efforts come to life as you remember this newest Star Wars story."
"dovelsfriend","10","2","6","4 January 2017"," Awesome movie. One of the best Star Wars films!
","What a wonderful movie. It has been a long time since I saw a movie so good and wanted to get back in to see it again. In my opinion this was a much better film than Episode VII. It has characters I enjoyed, and a real feel of fighting a war. It reminded me of older war movies of a small band of soldiers fighting a almost impossible battle. This is what Star Wars films should be.<br/><br/>It was well written, the actors did a good job in their roles and the story was one I found entertaining. It moved along at a good pace that held my attention and before I knew realized it was over. <br/><br/>I would very much enjoy seeing these writers and this director do another movie within the Star Wars time line."
"mclong2009","7","2","6","4 January 2017"," OK Movie
","Although it carries the magic of the Star Wars name, ""Rogue One"" is just another big, rather soulless Hollywood drama. I can't say I didn't get my ten dollars worth but there are episodes of ""The Vikings"" I'd rather watch. I actually enjoyed the ""The Force Awakens"" a lot more than I enjoyed this one. I felt the chemistry and tension between Jin and Cassian worked pretty well, although the reprogrammed droid was probably the most interesting character. Darth Vader's appearances are pointless and uninspired. ""Rogue One"" is an interesting chapter in the Star Wars saga, but the battle scenes do go on a bit. Forest Whitaker's character was certainly an incomplete and puzzling one--I suppose most moviegoers were familiar with his character going in. Here's hoping episode 8 lives up to the hype"
"shweta-51657","10","2","6","31 December 2016"," Was a better prequel ever made??
","I left this movie with one intention: to go watch the original trilogy all over again! <br/><br/>This movie was soo brilliantly made, every detail so well thought out, it was, honestly, a marvel to watch. Its such a wonder to me how a movie made in 2016 could have tied in SO AMAZINGLY with the first part released in 1977! The transition from the ending of this movie progresses seamlessly to the movie that sets off the original trilogy that began nearly 40 years ago. <br/><br/>I attended the film with someone who was not a fan at all. But he didn't need an intro or an explanation prior. Certainly, he was full of questions later, (so Darth Vader is bad news, huh?), but as the movie opens right in the middle of the War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, you are filled right in with the nature of War and its effects on our heroes (It was odd however, not seeing the usual open credits roll up as the movie begins).<br/><br/>Diego Luna was a pleasure to watch. Knowing his incredible acting prowess from movies such Milk, he carried off Cassian Andor with aplomb and with this movie has certainly garnered female attention (me included). Ben Mendelsohn was so good in his bad role, he was great. I thought Alan Tudyk's K-2SO would be a hard sale against the legendary droids (3PO and R2, who btw, who also have a few seconds in this movie) and BB8, but his comedic timing won me over.<br/><br/>What caught me by surprise was the portrayal of Grand Moff Tarkin. I knew at the back of my head that Peter Cushing had passed away but his portrayal was done so well, I had to double check! His role was reprised to near perfection by (I found out later) Guy Henry and the help of CGI. <br/><br/>What was a first for me, I realised as the red lightsaber lit up the screen in the dark .. was that this was the first time in MY lifetime that I was able to watch Darth Vader on the big screen. And oh dear lord. Did he deliver. I had goosebumps! Never did I think that in my life would I sit in the theatre as a movie goer and ever get to feel frightened for our heroes as the Imperial March plays in the background. But I did. This wasn't on TV, or a DVD, but was happening in real time for me for the first time ever! (in the theatre, but, hell, you know what I mean)<br/><br/>I now understand how desperate the fans back in the 70s and 80s must have been, impatiently waiting for the next part to be released, waiting eagerly all year round for the next one.<br/><br/>Thankfully, May is only 5 months away. But until then, may the Force be with you."
"KiltedGreen","8","2","6","28 December 2016"," ""Grown up"" Star Wars
","I've seen all the Star Wars films, but by no means am I a huge fan. I really disliked Episodes I & II but in my view III was the best of that trilogy by a long way, but still had a lot of issues. The Force Awakens was a much needed improvement and I felt like we were back with the ""originals"" again.<br/><br/>I didn't see Rogue 1 as a proper Star Wars film before seeing it, but to me in some ways it's right up there with the best. I thought ""Star Wars for grown ups"". Everything looked real - I didn't find myself thinking that everything was blue screen and CGI. I felt like I was watching real spaceships in real battles. The lack of those nasty ""cute"" characters like Ewoks, JJB and other inexplicable creations that were far too prevalent in Star Wars for my liking were blissfully absent! Joy.<br/><br/>I found the film gripping, dramatic, well paced and with many, many lovely nods to so many scenes and events from the ""original 3"" films.<br/><br/>I'm still thinking about it three days later. I really hope that there are going to be more with this level of quality."
"wulfthar","8","2","6","24 December 2016"," No war is won without sacrifice
","After the disappointing experience with Episode VII (that I consider the worst SW movie ever, even worse than EpI) I had low expectations for Rogue One but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Of course in this case 95% of the story was drawn by Lucas in EpIII and EpIV, they just had to connect the two dots, but at least in this case they made it right. The plot is quite simple : 10 years before the battle of Yavin a brilliant scientist refused to work on the creation of the Death Star, his boss tracked him down, killed his wife while his daughter was successful hidden by a Resistance member. Fast forwarding to the present time of EpIV, the daughter is captured by the Resistance and convinced to collaborate in finding her old associate who received a message from his father by a Imperial pilot who deserted. Around her and a captain of the Intelligence a cluster of different characters will assemble to try to win the first battle for the Alliance.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of this movie is that it deals with more or less ""normal"" people, not Jedis or heroes bigger than life like Han Solo, even if the protagonist suffers a little of Rei syndrome (also known as Mary Sue condition)...it is evident that Disney is actively chasing the young girls' market as probably the boys' one is already filled. After all they are a greedy corporation looking to get more money, right? The fans will appreciate the presence of old characters like Senator Organa from EpII, Mon Mothma, a younger CGI version of Leia Organa and Grand Moff Tarkin from EpIII who actually makes a good job impersonating Peter Cushing....all of them in smaller roles in comparison to the ""little people"" who take the main scenes.<br/><br/>In general the retro approach to FX gives its fruits, the movie has a nice 70s feel to it, there are few innovations like the U wing and the atmosphere variant of the TIE fighter, from a photography point of view nothing to complain.<br/><br/>What I didn't like? Well, first the inclusion of Darth Vader is totally unnecessary plot wise and must be interpreted as the usual fan service, the excessive role of the protagonist good to do everything is another one, but minor in comparison to the Rei aberration. The movie should be around the story of the Death Star but it doesn't deal with three fundamental aspects: one is the Geonosis' origin of the weapon, the second one is that it never explains the delays of the development of the Death Star (they are just mentioned), the third and final is that it never deals with the second Death Star from Endor: as the first Death Star takes almost twenty years of R&D it would be reasonable to assume the construction of the second one should have started in parallel with the former, and it might also give a good reason of the long development of two pharaonic constructions at the same time.<br/><br/>Having said that, they are minor, I enjoyed the movie and I would give it a 8 over 10. The best thing of the movie overall is its message:without spoiling much most of the people should already understand the end, and while in the main episodes the good guys always win easily, Rogue One teaches that victory can be achieve without heavy sacrifice."
"joncheskin","7","2","6","23 December 2016"," New Look for the Series
","Rogue One is a very interesting new installment in the uber-famous Star Wars series. It is a true prequel, taking place immediately prior to the events of the original 1977 movie, and in effect tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance obtained the plans for the Death Star and why it has a technological weakness. The characters are relatively minor players in the Star Wars universe, but they rise in the movie to take a special place in Star Wars lore.<br/><br/>In past installments, Star Wars movies generally stress character development and conflict as much or even more than the galactic struggle. Episode III, for example, is all about Annikin Skywalker's fall into evil, Episode IV is about Luke Skywalker's rise as a challenge and foil to that evil, Episode V their battle to convert each other to their respective sides of the force, and Episode VII the new awakening of the force in Rey and Kylo Ren as they become adversaries.<br/><br/>Rogue One starts on this path--in the opening scene, a 7-year-old Jyn Erso watches the villain of the movie, Imperial stooge General Krennec, murder her mother and imprison her father in order to make him finish his scientific work on the Death Star. We might immediately assume that the main conflict of the movie will be between these two characters, and that she will become possessed of ""the force"" like Luke Skywalker, but it actually does not happen that way. Jyn later in life is forcibly swept up into the struggle as the Rebellion is trying to get their mitts on the plans for the Death Star--they want her to enlist the assistance of her father and also the terrorist Saw Gerrera in that task. We learn that the Rebellion is fractured--consisting of outlaws, do-gooders, former Republicans, and other forces. A remarkable ensemble cast begins to assemble that sees the Empire as a common threat, and this ensemble, a roguish band, will become the actual main protagonist of the movie. The band will include a Rebel Spy--Cassian Andor, a converted Imperial tactical droid--K-2SO, an Imperial-pilot turned defector-- Bodhi Rook, and a random blind warrior--Chirrut Imwe, strong with the Force.<br/><br/>What follows is a surprise--the ragtag group goes on a mission to retrieve the Death Star plans, and the suspected character study turns into a full-blown war movie/ensemble Western. The models for this are movies like The Magnificent Seven or Force 10 from Navarone, where a small gang of soldiers goes on a quest against impossible odds. The interpersonal stuff underlies a huge action picture with awesome war sequences both on the ground of a tropical planet and in the space above. The cliff-hangers and special effects are awe-inspiring. The ending is something of a surprise, even though it makes perfect sense given the plot of Episode IV that occurs right after.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie, primarily because it takes the Star Wars series into some truly uncharted territory. This is really an exciting war movie above all else, a battle between good and evil on a different plane than the other movies. For those who might have thought Episode VII was a bit derivative, this is really something new."

"pyrocitor","8","2","6","21 December 2016"," War – here's what it's good for
","Forget ""I am your father"" - Rogue One features the greatest surprise in the entire Star Wars franchise, one that had our entire cinema gasping aloud in shock and disgruntlement. This long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away begins without a title crawl. Yes. For this is a 'Star Wars Story,' not a Star Wars Film, and director Gareth Edwards takes advantage of the distinction. It's unmistakably part of the same intergalactic umbrella, with familiar names, faces, sound effects, and all manner of exhilarating adventure mayhem that is the quintessence of Star Wars. But this prequel soars - a grim, gritty tale, without a scrap of kid- friendly pandering, and the stakes have never been higher. It's also, functionally, the only film in the series that could feasibly stand on its own, and is all the more eminently compelling entertainment for it.<br/><br/>Intriguingly, what helps Rogue One stand out is how transparently it puts the War back into Star Wars. With the main plot line anchored on a Dirty Dozen, WWII-style espionage caper, and side setpieces very much geared on the casualties of war – try explaining how the bit with the former Jedi temple occupied by the Imperial militia is an overt intertext to the U.S. army's incursion into Afghanistan to your kids – Edwards accomplishes what Lucas never quite could, and extracts genuine tension and threat from the brewing space fascists and their looming superweapon. The Star Wars franchise has always flirted with political subtext, but never at the behest of adventure or fun (until under the claws of Episodes I-III and Lucas' hours of Senate debates). Here, politics are at the forefront, as the Rebel Alliance is crippled from the inside by bureaucratic infighting, and sects of extremist offshoots (Forrest Whitaker shines in a too brief role as a guerrilla fanatic whose motives are almost as questionable as the Empire's). It's a surprisingly nuanced parable of political dissonance, and characters visibly struggle with questionable actions in the name of a righteous cause. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is still Star Wars, not the latest Oliver Stone manifesto, and Edwards remembers to find moments of flinty humour throughout to keep proceedings from becoming too bleak (the always wonderful Alan Tudyk's sour comic relief droid goes a long way). Look for the usual glut of fan-friendly cameos, integrated more tastefully than The Force Awakens, including some de-aged (heLLO Carrie Fisher!), or even reanimated (welcome back, Peter Cushing...? Eep...) through CGI which would be seamlessly convincing were it not so eerily unsettling. The return of Lord Vader, of course, is staggeringly awesome, though thankfully Edwards doesn't milk it, and he's around long enough for audiences to gasp and cheer, without overstaying his welcome. The absence of John Williams is, of course, sorely felt, but Michael Giacchino fills the void with chirpy aplomb, teasingly dancing around the core Star Wars themes while concocting thrilling new leitmotifs of his own. <br/><br/>Still, Rogue One is a War film, and Edwards (perhaps still reeling from the lambasting over his Godzilla's lack of cathartic action payoffs) orchestrates some of the franchise's most stunning mass battles. The first act blowout at the Jedi temple is breathlessly thrilling (where Donnie Yen's dazzlingly choreographed, charmingly cheerful blind swordsman, and Wen Jiang's wryly sardonic human armoury steal the show). But it's the final jaw-dropping blitzkrieg of a beach-storming battle that throws out all the stops: x-wing and tie-fighter dogfights, blasters on the beach, and (squee!) Imperial Walkers unleashed in all their glory. Disney's Marvel superhero films have drawn considerable (and justified) flack for their CGI-bloated finale battles of late, but here Edwards reclaims the trope with one of the most genuinely stunning action set pieces in recent memory. <br/><br/>There's also the welcome infusion of something sorely lacking from far too many action blockbusters: consequence. By slotting Rogue One within pre-existing Star Wars canon, we're tacitly aware that all of these characters have dubious chances of survival - why else wouldn't they pop up in A New Hope? So, when they plunge into action, the threat is real that they could be unceremoniously dispatched at any moment, making the action sequences bristle with very rare, tangible tension. Naturally, Edwards pulls out all the stops to get us as invested as possible in this scraggly Star Wars Suicide Squad before dashing our Hopes (ha) as they're eradicated one by one. This is war, after all, and casualties are inevitable.<br/><br/>If there's a fleeting criticism, it's that the glut of supporting characters are often given too short shrift to be properly memorable, but they still make for a formidable ensemble. Felicity Jones does a capable job as the battle-hardened Imperial refugee who gradually learns to hope, but she's a bit too bland and placidly stoic to make a proper splash as lead. Diego Luna, conversely, is superbly convincing, practically simmering with charismatic passion and bitterness. Ben Mendelsohn sneers, spits and preens with perfect sinister campiness as the Death Star's overlord, while Riz Ahmed's defecting Imperial pilot flirts with the quirky charisma of a Poe Dameron, but is too underutilized to fully excel. Sadly, the normally excellent Mads Mikkelsen is on sleepy autopilot mode as Jones' 'exposition repository' estranged father, too emotionally absent to sell his Robert Oppenheimer 'reluctant weapon of mass destruction creator' archetype. Between his and Jones' fizzling flatness, the film's emotional core suffers for it.<br/><br/>Rogue One may not be quite as euphorically fun or jauntily memorable as its canonical predecessors, but its taut, robust, rich storytelling and grimly spellbinding action make it an eminently compelling watch, as Star Wars flick or standalone action romp. If nothing else, the takeaway is this: Disney's announcement of a new Star Wars film roughly every year left many audiences reeling with worry of blatant cash grabs, and creative stagnation through supersaturation. But, if the care and thought invested into Rogue One are any indication, we may yet still have... Hope.<br/><br/>-8.5/10"
"fendetta","9","2","6","20 December 2016"," ""May the Force be with you, Rogue One""
","Rogue One through its seamless storytelling achieves instant mythical status, attaching itself perfectly to 'A New Hope' providing the Saga films with deeper meaning and significance.<br/><br/>Rogue One has a distinctly different tone to the Saga films, a much darker and grittier one. It is however one that we realise in hindsight is necessary to the franchise. This is the War film required in the Star Wars universe to add greater urgency and pathos to the conflicts between imperial and rebellion forces. <br/><br/>In particular, Rogue One critically explores the moral fibre of characters blurring the line between imperial and rebel, good and evil. That is not to say that the entire film plays a la Apocalypse Now; the creators still conscious of it being a childhood film leave out explicit scenes of violence, however more so in this film you experience the harsh realities and sacrifice made in War. The last act set on a beach conjures up WW2 imagery enhancing the rebels' cause for the greater good.<br/><br/>The casting is near perfect, a diverse cast unheard of in a blockbuster film. It seems in more ways than one the film goes rogue on what makes a star wars film as well as what makes a blockbuster film. This is made especially apparent by the daring ending. <br/><br/>Jones and Luna play their respective rebel characters Jyn and Cassian with stoic determination yet there are still moments punctuated with humour in particular by Tudyk's brilliant K-2SO. Ahmed, Yen and Jiang complete the inner circle of rebels creating memorable moments of quiet heroism in their respective arcs. This reaches particular poignancy in the last act through their subdued acceptance of death. The tight embrace of Jyn and Cassian in the clear view of the Death Star beam is a stunning and instantly iconic shot that sums up the lack of glory these characters craved for or indeed received.<br/><br/>If viewers are not quite keen on this take of the Star Wars universe, the penultimate scene of Darth Vader instantly makes this film a significant part of the canon. The ruthless annihilation of rebels and being within fighting grasp of the death star plans, mark the beginning of 'A New Hope' with greater meaning and urgency.<br/><br/>Huge creative choices have been made with Disney's first stand-alone Star Wars film but they pay off brilliantly in Rogue One, paving the way for the Star Wars universe to grow in less predictable ways."
"richard_heys-757-149700","9","2","6","20 December 2016"," An excellent addition to Star Wars
","""Rogue One"" is another addition to the Star Wars Universe, this time focusing on the events leading up to ""Star Wars A New Hope"" which involves the creation of the Death Star as well as the plans regarding the Death Star, how the rebels were able to obtain these plans.<br/><br/>We follow Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones (I have only seen her in ""Theory of Everything and Amazing Spiderman 2, in Theory of Everything she was very good), daughter of the architect for the Death Star. To begin with she is very standoffish, not wanting to be involved in any of the Rebels or Empires plans, now I have noticed several people complaining that this made her very unlikable, ""why would people rally around her?!"" etc, well, considering there is a very pivotal moment in the film where her outlook changes as well as simultaneously explaining why she is so standoffish (think abandonment issues) its fair to say people do not pay attention as well as they think they do. Her character does have a character arc, again she starts off not caring for anyone, pushing everyone away, fighting to survive rather then fighting for a better tomorrow to a character who actively looks to be a beacon of hope. The supporting cast were excellent, Cassian had great moments and yet again another character arc. Chirrut and Baze are two protectors, hired muscle if you will, these characters do not have much of an arc, however, they provide us with lots of great action sequence and some comedy relief and revelations. K-2SO is a reprogrammed imperial droid, I would say he is a cross between C3PO, Marv from Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy and Ethan from Infinite Warfare, C3PO due to his constant calculations on Survival chances, Marv due to his sarcastic nature and Ethan due to his general badassery, an excellent character. Then we have the main Antagonist Orson, who was excellent, a man with a lot of ambition who sees the world he believes he created fall apart around him. I will mention that Moff Tarkin and Vader also appear in this and are imposing as always, not only this but Vaders costume is pretty much identical to the one in ""A New Hope"" right down to the eyes being a burgundy color rather then black. His scenes although short leave an impression. There are also a few cameos here and there in the film, these happen again fairly naturally and don't feel forced these feel like they would actually happen. One thing that cannot be said enough is the skill of Gareth Edwards, I would imagine he had a lot of input when it came to the use of CGI, he comes from a CGI background and showed what he was capable of doing on the movie ""Monsters"", in here he took it a whole other level, the compositing of shots was damn near perfect, some shots were very hard to tell what was CGI and what wasn't. To me this was brilliant, as everything in the film felt organic and real. The shots within the various locations they filmed also felt very organic, compared with ""The Force Awakens"" the designs in here felt a lot more natural and thought out. It would also appear that face mapping to bring to life actors long since passed or actors too old to look like there younger selves has been brought to another level, it still isn't quite right, as you can still tell its CG however, it is very good. As another note, to me it is important that action scenes make sense, whether it be between individuals or between army's, what we see has to be coherent, in here I personally believe they nailed it. I will explain, in some films action scenes just happen, for some films this works, for others not so much, lets take Empire Strikes Back as an example of a action scene working, Battle of Hoth, we see the rebels trying out different tactics throughout the ground fight to prevent the AT-ATs from breaking through finally landing on a tactic that works. Now lets look at a film where to me it doesn't quite work. The Force Awakens, the final fight in this involves a very thrown together plan with help from Finn, literally the plan is thrown together in minutes, the action scene itself is basically about ace pilot Poe getting his killstreak up, it looked awesome but it just seemed incredibly dumb that they could come up with that plan that quickly and execute it that easily. I know that a New Hope had previously done exactly that, however, there were differences the key one being the planning. Rogue one to me falls into Empire Strikes Back territory as far as action sequences they not only look incredible but they also are well planned, a lot of thought went into the sequences beyond ""what looks cool"". The storyline in Rogue one to me is pretty simplistic overall, however, its the journey that makes films such as this one great, it had a lot of attention to detail with a lot of great characters. This is a companion film, think films such as Seven Samurai, Kellys Heroes The Fellowship of the Ring without all the overhead orbiting shots. Its an excellent movie that I will be seeing again due to its replay-ability. To Surmise, this is a brilliant film well worth seeing in the cinema, its well thought out and well executed is what to me puts it above other movies this year."

"salvadorcamelio","10","2","6","19 December 2016"," A new hope for Star Wars fans
","When I first heard about Disney acquiring Star Wars rights my first thought was ""They are going to ruin it"". But after chapter VII, they proved me somehow wrong. Even though the way the story was created seemed a bit familiar, it was a great movie. <br/><br/>I never considered myself one of those fans that were encyclopedias of Star Wars knowledge, like knowing which size of shoes wore Luke. But I'm one of those fans that loves the stories and the universe that George Lucas managed to create and put so sublimely on a screen.<br/><br/>At first I thought this new movie could be the one that destroyed the whole franchise, the one that was going to ""unbalance the force"". That movie that you watch and know it's over, the one you know they have gone too far trying to make a profit out of a famous name. But I have to say that this time, Mickey Mouse did something astonishing.<br/><br/>Even when I knew where the story was headed, and had a general idea of what was going to happen this picture managed to make me cry, which has happened 3 o 4 times before with a movie. The most romantic and geeky side of me came out. And it was because for the very first time since ""The Return of the Jedi"", someone was able to capture the real essence of Star Wars and create an original but at the same time new story in this universe. <br/><br/>To create characters that made sense with what was made before, and tell the beginnings of everything in a way I fell in love with something I already was in love.A story so perfectly built that made me get surprised with the known and anxious about the inevitable, in a way only great stories can.<br/><br/>I always had some problems with the new films (I, II and III), I liked them but felt they lacked of something. Always thought it was the CGI, and how that took away the meticulous art behind the old films. But I was wrong, I never had the chance to get involved the same way with the story, the mystic behind it wasn't the same or maybe something in the story was missing. This movie proved me wrong, I missed the essence of this magical universe and Rogue One proved that the essence is a fundamental part of this beautiful franchise.<br/><br/>My (fan boy) vote: 10/10"
"kimura-toyo","9","2","6","19 December 2016"," Perhaps my favorite star wars movie
","I am surprised this movie does not have a higher rating, and by some of the mixed reviews. For starters, I consider myself a common Star Wars fan. I grew up with Ep 4-6 and have watched all of the movies more than a few times. I don't go to ComiCon or dress up in cosplay, but I appreciate the fantasy value behind the movies, as well as the acting, directing, and character development. And the action scenes and the struggle between good vs. evil is a big plus. Rogue One is arguably my favorite star wars movie. I was sorely disappointed in Episode 7 – too much ""kid"" and Hollywood appeal, too much of JJ Abram's fingerprints on it, and not enough individuality and too predictable. I could write a long critique on The Force Awakens, but perhaps another time. What Rogue One did for me and made me feel after leaving the theater is what I wished Ep. 7 had done. The movie was paced well (a bit too fast in the beginning though) and kept you focused on one scene to the next. The characters were all solid and played their roles close to perfection. There were some scenes/dialogue I thought would be corny, but I ended up appreciating them because I was empathetic and attached that much to the characters. Many scenes were genuine, the plot line was consistent and delivered a smooth transition between Ep. 3 and 4, and the action scenes were probably one of the most entertaining I've seen in the whole series. There was a great balance between ground battle scenes vs. in space, and it was never too overbearing where you were wondering when it would end. And there were some nice, pleasant cameos from older characters that were timed perfectly. The movie was unique in the sense that it was edgier than the other movies. You could see a darker side (no pun intended) of the rebel alliance. And, there was no real ""love story"" that has all but become too cliché and predictable. The director, Gareth Edwards, deserves a lot of credit. The cast does as well. The movie ended with me clapping and excited about the direction the saga is heading in and looking forward to future movies, something Ep. 7 failed to do. I think this movie would appeal most to my generation, the ones who grew up with Ep 4-6. I don't think I would recommend this movie to kids younger than 6 as there were some violent and dark scenes. Rogue One stands on its own and should be recognized as one of the better Star Wars movies."
"OlieRendch","8","2","6","19 December 2016"," Not as streamlined or grand as your main saga episodes, but it brought something new to the table and it worked.
","Rogue One is the first Star Wars Anthology film, it isn't an episode, it doesn't follow the lives of a Skywalker. In fact, as you probably know but I'll confirm here just in case: it takes place just before 1977's Episode IV: A New Hope. I've been looking forward to this film for a while because I'm a fan of director Gareth Edwards and this universe in general.<br/><br/>I'll start by talking about the cast, the majority of which I didn't know. Felicity Jones leads with her character Jyn Erso and from the trailers I didn't particularly like what I saw; the character just didn't seem likable and to an extent that carried over into the film at the beginning, but then as time went on they laid out a plausible reason for her personality and I grew accustomed to it very quickly and it worked for the story; Felicity Jones does great in the role as I've enjoyed her performances before in films such as The Theory of Everything. Diego Luna's Cassian Andor was an interesting character to watch, his internal struggle with the moral gray area he operated in made for some compelling scenes and Diego's performance I thought was great as I've never seen his work before. Some other cast and character highlights were Alan Tudyk's hilarious droid K-2SO, he delivered some great lines, but they weren't cheap jokes or eye rolls, he's no Jar Jar Binks; even though he was the comedic relief he also served a purpose and could defend himself when needed. Donnie Yen's blind Chirrut Îmwue and his partner Baze were a very entertaining and sometimes quite touching duo who had some great action sequences between them.<br/><br/>On a villain front, I have to say I really enjoyed Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic. He came across as a classic Star Wars baddie but brought something new in his disposition and line delivery. His own arc as well was a compelling one and in the end, after some thought, you start to feel sorry for this guy, especially in the context of the other films. Now of course Darth Vader turns up during the film and that's what a lot of people were excited about (including myself), and so I'll just say that he isn't in it much, which I'm fine with, but I know a lot of people wanted more of him....Although there a specific scene that he's in that people are going talk about for a long time. So in the end, I really enjoyed the cast, perhaps with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who did fine in his role, but his role wasn't really needed; it just felt like we'd missed something, like there was more of a story there but was cut.<br/><br/>Now talking of story, Rogue One, is somewhat predictable in the main arc because you know what it's about, you've seen what takes place afterwords, but finally knowing the specifics and details is a real treat, for the most part. The first third of the film is very choppy, we're suddenly moving from one location to another super quick setting up each character and situation and it's a bit messy. When the plot gets going, though, it really picks up and becomes an entertaining series of events following these characters, that lead to an epic climactic third act. A complaint the film has is that the majority of characters weren't fleshed out enough and so they didn't care about them but I didn't find that at all; sure we didn't really get to know their history and motivations but just with the time we did spend with them, I really felt for these people by the end, and the ending itself made me come away viewing these people in a different way.<br/><br/>The final scenes of Rogue One is truly one of the most memorable moments I've had in a cinema. From the choices the film-writers make regarding the characters, to the final five minutes before credits roll, I have to say that Disney certainly is in a league of their own. Was the film perfect? No, not at all, there are things I haven't managed to touch on because of spoilers, but there are also amazing things I couldn't mention for the same reason. As a conclusion. I'll say that although it isn't as streamlined or grand as your main saga episodes, it brought something new to the table and it worked."

","OK, so I'll get it out the way first. I really didn't like The Force Awakens. By the third viewing (I really wanted to like it), I actually quite enjoyed it but, despite it's loving nods to the previous films, it seemed to lack something for me. Something that even the widely despised prequels captured.<br/><br/>But Rogue one has it. The scope, the scale, the feeling of aliveness in the scenes. The shots are big, the ambition is big. It feels, in many ways, dated and simple but in others, massively up to date and complex.<br/><br/>Yes, there's loving nods to the originals but they're not overplayed. It has ideas of it's own. Something which, again, TFA lacked in buckets. <br/><br/>It's not perfect - the CGI Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher look good - brilliant in fact - but not perfect. Our 2016 eyes may excuse the flaws and they are, by far, the most realistic CGI actors I've seen in a film but, you can tell they're not real people and that did suspend my engagement in the scenes.<br/><br/>The first hour does take a bit of investment - yes, if you're a Star Wars fan, there's more than enough to sustain your interest but, as I was watching, I tried to see it through the eyes of the many who may not necessarily be that heavily into Star Wars or - and these people do exist - those who've NEVER seen a Star Wars movie in their lives.<br/><br/>Once the first hours done, the stall has been set, we know what they're fighting for, it's action all the flipping way. And it's stunning. The entire visual spectacle is truly breathtaking. And do bear in mind - I like Star Wars. I've always liked Star Wars but I'm not one to like something or get all puffed up about it JUST because it's Star Wars.<br/><br/>But Rogue One completely does the Star Wars legend justice. And then some. It's perfectly tied up the whole Saga, added an additional layer to the whole (space) cake, offered delightful tributes without being overly sentimental and, for me at least, abso- frickin-lutely ROCKED!"

A planet where crystals are mined an used to power the weapon, as well as providing energy to Light sabers.

On her way there she is rescued by Cassian Andor(Diego Lunas) and his Imperial Droid K-2SO. K-2SO was reprogrammed by the Alliance so he can be a mole on both sides. Cassian has been part of the Alliance ever since he was a kid. When he meets Jyn she tells him that she must meet with the senior council. She gives them what she know about the Death Star and they share what they know.

When the plans arrive on Leia's Blockage Runner. While under attack a rebel fighter hands the plans to another fighter. The plans arrive to Princess Leia( Carrie Fisher). Once she sees the plans she discovers there hope in destroying the Empire and their most powerful weapon.<br/><br/>I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD, hoping for extras. Unlike the weak prequels, the CGI effects in this movie are excellent. Especially with the late great, Peter Cushing(Gov.Tarkin) and a very young Princess Leia( Carrie Fisher). This film is much better than The Force Awakens which I gave a 7/10. There is so much excitement it will keep you glued from the beginning to the end. Ignore the small amount of negative reviews some have expressed,with this film. It has a great cast, excellent story; and beautiful scenery which makes this a hit.

They did throw some new faces in, but the trajectory was almost entirely the same as that of A New Hope.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised, that Rogue One was an original movie. A whole new cast of characters, some of them who were quite memorable. Few tired Star Wars tropes this time around.

"oli-trussell","5","2","6","17 December 2016"," A decent companion piece to the star wars saga that just falls short of it's true potential.
","First off I've got to say this film looks and feels amazing - the world building, the sets, the costumes, and vfx work together to create an authentic feeling Star Wars story. At the same time it also manages to show a different side to the Star Wars universe without straying too far from the source material. Welcome to a dark underworld of desperate survival under the oppression of the empire; congratulations to the writers for not giving the film a happier Disney-esque ending as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film does seem more concerned with filling itself with references and cameos rather than spending time with our collection of main characters. Cameos are like penises, if you're going to have one on screen you better have a good reason for it. (That's not my quote by the way I stole it.) The limited interactions our characters DO have are mostly pretty great, but the dialogue can sometimes be a little insulting to your intelligence. You can clearly see what the character is thinking and feeling so why does it need to be said out loud?<br/><br/>So yeh this film has a great vibe with great action and some great performances. Unfortunately it isn't quite able to have the emotional punch it could have if we spent more time with our main characters. With that said Vaders presence WAS appreciated, as he has some of the best scenes in the movie; perhaps he should have been the main antagonist instead of Krennic? Just a thought..."
"louisfoster","8","2","6","17 December 2016"," A strong edition to the STAR WARS universe, that can hold its own!
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story directed by Gareth Edwards, is the latest and first edition to the Star Wars universe as a standalone movie, telling the story of how the rebellion captured the plans to the first Death Star, that we eventually see in the original Star Wars movie – A New Hope, where Rogue One ends just ten minutes before.<br/><br/>To put it straight, this is a not an entirely child friendly Star Wars movie. From the onset of the film, you really do get a grasp of the overall tone that this movie has throughout, which is darker and grittier than the saga movies. Now, there is no gore, but let's put it this way, there's a lot of death, and rightfully so given the plot of this movie and the gravity of what the rebellion is up against and the stakes associated with the mission at hand.<br/><br/>Rogue One will definitely sit well with most hardcore Star Wars fans, and if you've read the novel 'Catalyst' by James Luceno, or have invested a lot of your time looking into various aspects of Star Wars lore across the board, then you will most likely have a better understanding of the characters going in, as well as the events that took place before the time of Rogue One and the relationships certain characters have. Casual fans that perhaps are not as invested into Star Wars can enjoy this movie, but watching it, you can tell this is geared more towards hardcore fans based on the content that's presented in the film. While the overall film isn't anything unique and pays homage to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now, it can be argued that it is more original than that of the The Force Awakens plot line, that has seen some controversy from critics and fans alike, despite being an enjoyable film nonetheless and a worthy edition to the saga.<br/><br/>There is no crawl, but this didn't take anything away from the overall quality of the movie. Instead, a title card is used, which looks a little unprofessional, but it's only there for a few seconds. <br/><br/>The first act of Rogue One begins quite slow, introducing us to each of the characters in a way that could be done better, and seemed a little misguided, where characters were not fleshed out as much as we'd perhaps like them to be. However, the second and third act make up for the slow start, but the slow start does provide us as the audience with context to help perpetuate the plot forward. There are small Easter eggs and hints of fan service peppered throughout the film, but doesn't feel shoehorned in just for the sake of nostalgia.<br/><br/>Rogue One is without a doubt one of the most visually stunning Star Wars films to date, which is accented by cinematography that captures the beautiful landscapes of places like Iceland and the Maldives. The CGI in the film feels and looks real and blends in very well with the practical effects nicely where everything works together. There are only a few moments where CGI can seem a little ineffective, but nothing that stands out to be significantly negative. Overall, the CGI in this movie is used very intelligently, in new ways that hasn't been seen too often in cinema.<br/><br/>As much as the characters all have their moments in the film, the main standout characters are noticeably K2SO (Alan Tudyk), Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Orson Krenic (Ben Mendelsohn). K2 isn't like any other droid, he is an imperial droid that has been reprogrammed to serve and fight for the rebellion. While he's the comic relief throughout the film and breaks some witty one liners, he can also hold his own as a skilled fighter in both physical combat and firearms. Chirrut, who is a blind warrior located on the ancient city of Jedha (holy land for the Jedi), believes strongly in the force which guides him and assists him despite his impaired vision. However, he is no Jedi nor Sith, just a follower/believer of the force that carries a great spirit. Krenic is a great edition to the villains within the Star Wars universe; he is continuously trying to show off to a particular character in the film for a sense of approval and validation, and is ultimately trying to move up the ranks to the big leagues, although his arrogance can often be his downfall. And of course, the iconic villain himself, Vader! Vader is used sparingly throughout the film, which has been highlighted by Kathleen Kennedy (president of Lucasfilm) many times before the release. He doesn't have a lot of screen time, and he doesn't need to as this isn't his movie, but his time on screen is utilised 'perfectly'. When you see him, his presence can be felt. He is most prominent in the last act of the film, which will not disappoint.<br/><br/>The battle on Scariff and the space battle above its atmosphere is undoubtedly one of the best battles amongst the Star Wars films, and will perhaps go down as one of the most iconic as well as historic for its connection to A New Hope. As said previously, this is very much a war film and puts the 'wars' in 'Star Wars'. This movie doesn't rely on Jedi or Sith, its main focus is on the average soldier and what they've had to sacrifice for the cause of the rebellion in the fight against the rise of the Empire. There's lots of death, which goes without question, as this final battle is very reminiscent to the likes of Saving Private Ryan, and takes a lot of inspiration from the Vietnam War in terms of cinematography and the scale of the battle itself.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a strong edition to the line of Star Wars movies, and will undoubtedly sit rather high in the ranking table."
"mawriz","Null","2","6","17 December 2016"," This movie is 100 times better than Force Awakens
","This movie is 100 times better than Force Awakens. I'm kinda glad JJ Abrams isn't directing Episode 8. This one is actually trying to be a real movie, the other one is trying to be a blockbuster, a montage of cool scenes. The story hooks you and you can't let go. The characters felt real and you connect with them at an emotional level. The dialogue is sharp and fits the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The war scenes felt like Saving Private Ryan. I love that they had the balls to kill off everyone. If I had one criticism, it's that Act 1 took too long to connect the strings together. It felt little disjointed at the start. But once they did, they took you to one hell of a ride. This is the real Star Wars movie for me."
"raynerjozzy","9","2","6","17 December 2016"," Fantastic film but not given enough of the Star Wars treatment
","This film is a fantastic adventure that lets you experience the star wars cinematic universe from a foot soldier perspective with some beautifully orchestrated nods to the original trilogy which includes some seriously mind blowing cgi to resurrect one of the main characters from A New Hope but at the same time telling what feels like a whole new story even though the final outcome was filmed 40 years ago.This film firmly slots between ROTS and ANH giving any child growing up the chance to what we could only hope to do and watch all the films in chronological order.The film deserves all the accolades that it will inevitably receive and rightly so,but the only little niggle i have is that it doesn't quite endear you to it like the original trilogy or the TFA and that begins at the start of this film without the use of the iconic scroll which makes you feel that Disney didn't want this film to be on par with the new sequels."
"mauro-taccone","6","2","6","16 December 2016"," Pretty good movie
","I just saw Rogue One and I thought it was good. However I have some mixed feelings about it. Now is it as bad as the Prequels no of course not. Is it as good as the original trilogy or The Force Awakens. No Way.<br/><br/>But now I'm going to say what I liked about it and what I didn't like about it. The best thing about this movie was the visual effects. This is perhaps the best looking Star Wars Movie ever. The visual effects were great, Gareth Edwards did an amazing job. What I really liked is how they showed the scale for example the small ships in comparison with the gigantic planets. The Death Star looked never so intimidating. I liked that they explained some plot holes in the original Star Wars. Like the explanation for the death stars weak point. It didn't feel forced and it played in with the story. The Action was amazing which brings me to my next point. It is a Star Wars movie that felt like real war we have never seen that before. What I think this movie did better than the Force Awakens is the humor. In The Force Awakens the humor often times stopped the movie and it didn't fit very well. This movie nailed it pretty well it didn't interrupt the story because they didn't make as many jokes and the jokes were actually funny. There weren't as many stupid callbacks to the original movies like in The Force Awakens. They kept it nice and simple. It first kind of bugged me whenever a character died in this movie. I even called it The Game of Thrones version of Star Wars. But the more I think about it the more I like it. They were fighting for the Plans and they even sacrificed themselves so they could succeed. <br/><br/>Now to the negatives The characters weren't as interesting and whenever someone died I didn't care for them. The ones I liked were Mads Mikkelsen and Donnie Yen. Mads Mikkelsen had an interesting conflict but he died very early in this movie and Donnie Yen was more or less just entertaining to watch but i couldn't really tell what his character was. Jyn Ersos character was boring. The dialog was sometimes very cheesy for example the reused lines like ""I have a bad feeling about this"". The Darth Vader scene was cool but it didn't fit at all. They just needed to show a Darth Vader scene so they just forced it in at the end. There were some random scenes in the movie like the tentacle scene at the beginning which took me out of the movie and didn't serve a purpose at all. The romance between Jyn and that other guy was forced. The Beach planet looked cool but it got really stale after a while. My last point is directing. Gareth Edwards is an awesome action director. We saw that in Godzilla and we also saw that in this movie. But he is not so good with characters and actors. I would love to see some other people directing a Star Wars movie. Here are some of my suggestions: Christopher Nolan, Alex Garland, Ridley Scott, Denis Villeneuve, Matthew Vaughn, Matt Reeves and maybe Duncan Jones. I think those people would nail the action and the characters. Anyway although my review may seem like I hate this movie I enjoyed it. I wasn't disappointed but my expectations weren't exceeded. I think if you like Star Wars you won't be disappointed. I'm looking forward to episode 8 and the Han Solo Spin-Off<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 7/10"
"Ben_Cap","7","2","6","16 December 2016"," The Most ""Rogue"" of all Star Wars Movies For Sure
","Rogue One is the first stand alone movie to be released in the Star Wars franchise, and with that comes some new expectations for the series and more specifically for this movie. With the exception of maybe episode 1 and episode 7 the viewer has had a pretty good idea of what they were going to get from each individual Star Wars movie, we would continue the story from the previous movie and unravel more of the saga. Rogue One tells a very specific story that happens to take place somewhere in between episode 3 and episode 4, but this is not episode 3.5, it is more fleshing out possibly the most beloved universe in movie history, and for the most part it is a success.<br/><br/>One of the really difficult things about how to tell the story of Rogue One is that it does not really have the massive amounts of fan service to draw from. It takes place in a bit of a dark period in the galaxy, not just because it is a war torn galaxy but because we don't know much about the events during this time. There are a few things here and there that are to service the fans, but for the most part this movie introduces us to some new people and places that we have not seen previously, and I think the movie is better for it. It is nice to see what people without the last name of Skywalker are doing, and maybe creating some new characters to inhabit the galaxy.<br/><br/>Rogue One also has the difficult job of being the makeshift bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy, and as stated before they do a great job of not trying to explain everything that happened in that time and instead giving this movie a more focused vision. From the start you can tell that while this movie is about the Star Wars universe, it is definitely has it's own feel. Rogue One is more a war movie than any of the other Star Wars movies. This means a darker tone and a less fun time at the movies. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it helps to separate this movie from the main series but will certainly make it a less enjoyable affair.<br/><br/>While not as well casted as episode 7(few movies are) Rogue One introduces some new characters to us and while I won't go nuts about the acting chops in a Star Wars movie, Felicity Jones holds her own as a bonafide star in Rogue One, even though her character has some likability flaws at the beginning. Another thing that would be silly to judge harshly in a Star Wars movie is the writing. The overall plot has some holes that are covered up in some of the laziest ways I can possibly imagine, and the dialogue is mostly forgettable, but the overall scope of the plot is great, and will satisfy almost every fan of the first 7 movies.<br/><br/>Star Wars has been up at the top of my favorite movie franchises since I was a tot, and just the fact that I get to see a new movie with Darth Vader and storm troopers in it makes me very happy, but Rogue One is not a perfect movie by any stretch. The main thing that I think was missing from episode 7 and hopefully will play a bigger part in the coming movie was space battles. In a movie titled Rogue One there better be some high level fighter pilot battles, and while there is a decent battle at the end, I still felt shorted a bit. This is kind of the overall feel of Rogue One, yes its a good Star Wars movie and yes Vader is in it, but the twist at the end of the punch is missing. All in all I am pretty happy that we are getting solid Star Wars movies almost yearly now, and to be honest I saw keep them coming."
"wolfstar_imdb","8","2","6","16 December 2016"," Hate Star Wars but liked this
","I've never liked Star Wars - it's dumb juvenilia that, while fine for kids, should never really have found an adult audience or have been continued beyond the original film (which was fine on its own terms). It misunderstands good and evil, misunderstands war, is bad sci-fi and has zero subtlety.<br/><br/>This, however, was decent - OK, it still has its share of typical Star Wars hokiness (I could have done without Darth Vader, the walkers, the CGI Peter Cushing and cartoonish British Bad Guys, the mind-reading octopus, the cliché blind guy who uses ""the force"", the stormtroopers who serve as pure cannon fodder, and the frequent overintrusiveness of the score) but by about half an hour in, once we've gotten to know the characters - who are engaging and human - it becomes real and compelling. The performances, plot, pacing and direction are effective and come together well, in particular during the Eadu scenes. I especially liked Diego Luna, who really grounds the film. Felicity Jones was convincing throughout, except in the two scenes where she gives speeches (though perhaps that was deliberate). The robot character, who I initially thought would be annoying, was engaging and a couple of times even reminded me of Brian from Family Guy. The romantic elements weren't overdone, just a tenderness borne out of the situation and proximity - depicted gently with the perfect amount of nuance and restraint. The film's action scenes feel more visceral than the glib ones in previous Star Wars films (though can still be somewhat contrived), and like they have real stakes, though the final action sequence on the tower lacks credibility (mostly due to the use of physical storage media) and is a little reminiscent of Galaxy Quest.<br/><br/>This isn't art-house, and if it wasn't a Star Wars film it wouldn't even be breaking new ground, but for the franchise it's a massive step up. First Star Wars film I've liked since the original, and an effective companion piece to it as well as a respectable and enjoyable film in its own right. For once the overriding goal seems to have been to tell a good story (albeit not one which needed to be told) on realistic terms with values that resonate in our times, rather than to sell merchandise to kids and pacify audiences with simple narratives and happy endings."
"Ramascreen","8","2","6","13 December 2016"," Resilient
","Wow! They weren't kiddin' at all when they said #RogueOneAStarWarsStory is in the same vein as ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""The Guns Of Navarone."" This has got to be the most grounded, most heroic ""Star Wars"" movie I've ever seen. Because when you take out many of the usual elements that make the Star Wars saga iconic, whats left are the faith and strength of the human spirit.<br/><br/>Behold the first ""Star Wars"" standalone film, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" a new epic adventure in a time of conflict as a group of unlikely ordinary heroes band together on a mission to do the extraordinary: steal the plans to the Empire's most ultimate weapon of destruction, the Death Star. Starring Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, and Forest Whitaker. Scripted by Chris Weitz and then Tony Gilroy, directed by Gareth Edwards.<br/><br/>A band of misfits teaming up for a common cause, it's nothing unusual in a ""Star Wars"" saga, after all it doesn't get more of a stubborn misfit than the smuggler Han Solo. But firstly, I'd like to commend ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" for its international cast, I'm sure some of those decisions are based on business in order for the film to do well in certain markets by featuring the biggest stars from that region, but nevertheless, it really adds authenticity to the already diverse group of characters.<br/><br/>Since the story is set between the events of ""Revenge Of The Sith"" and ""A New Hope"" a.k.a the original ""Star Wars,"" this film has tons of references that are sure to get every fanboy and fangirl geekin' out because they will pick those up immediately. But do those references distract? Not necessarily, they're nothing more than a wink. The script to me isn't perfect. I guess we'll never know for sure which parts are filmmaker Tony Gilroy's contributions until Gilroy himself breaks his silence, but to me, the film feels like it drags a little, and the conflict within the Rogue One team isn't as impactful as one might expect from such stories. And the resolve seems unearned. But does that hurt the movie in any way? It's arguable. I'd say all of that gets redeemed by its pulse-pounding battle sequences in the final act, something akin to the beach invasion in ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>Actress Felicity Jones is rugged and resilient, hers is unlike any other heroines that this saga had given us over the years. Less elegant and more general-like. Jones pretty much plays it straight the entire film. There's a familial dilemma at the heart of it all, which is expected, since as we all know it's not a ""Star Wars"" movie without lineal themes. But my favorite in ""Rogue One"" has got to be Donnie Yen. Growing up in Asia watching all his movies, to finally see him be part of something as big as this, and he actually does quite well in it, I must say that's a good enough reason to feel happy for the man. And his character is as badass as it gets. The new droid, K-2SO doesn't always hit the target when it comes to being the comic relief but when it does, you'll get a few laughs out of it. I think fans will be in an agreement that Ben Mendelsohn as the villain Orson Krennic is incredible. He has that strong, commanding, intimidating presence overshadowed only by Lord Vader whose cameo reminds us exactly why we are in awe of his might.<br/><br/>Because this is a prequel to ""A New Hope"" which as you know has its own decades-ago graphics, you have to give credit to ""Rogue One"" for at least attempting to capture much of that look, tone and style, or at least give you the impression of it. That said, as a standalone, does it really need to exist? And if we were to list our favorite, where will we place it among the ranks of other ""Star Wars"" movies? That is something we the fans would just have to judge for ourselves."
"themadmovieman","8","2","6","16 December 2016"," Visually exhilarating, and just what we die-hard fans want to see
","Are there stories out there in the galaxy beyond the Skywalker saga that are interesting and significant enough to carry an entire film? That's the question Rogue One had to answer, and I'm glad to say that it's a massive yes. With a gritty and hardcore story throughout that, by focusing on a smaller part of the Star Wars universe, makes for a hugely entertaining and unique watch, there's so much to love about this movie, not to mention the utterly dazzling spectacle of it all.<br/><br/>I think the most important thing to know about this film is that it isn't trying to be exactly the same as the main Star Wars saga. Of course, the imagination and excitement that make the movies so wonderful is still there, but it's the gritty atmosphere, everything from the tone to the look, that runs right through the middle of this movie that puts a little space between itself and the enormous space operas of the Skywalker saga.<br/><br/>It's also important to note that Rogue One is a far more hardcore Star Wars movie. Already going into detail by making an entire movie out of A New Hope's opening crawl, this film gets right into the nitty-gritty of the Star Wars universe, providing us with more context for the events that unfold in A New Hope. As a result, this is a very nerdy film, and whilst that's utterly beautiful for hardcore Star Wars fans, it may prove a little too in-depth to interest some of the more casual viewers and general audience members.<br/><br/>Regardless, the film is still a hugely entertaining watch, principally because it's a visually spectacular experience from start to finish. Gareth Edwards' directing here is wonderful to behold, giving the film its uniquely gritty vibe, whilst also retaining the elegance that only Star Wars can produce.<br/><br/>Sweeping shots of a wide variety of planet landscapes are beautiful to look at, whilst the visual depiction of the Empire, always presenting their ships as the dominant force in any frame, makes them an even more formidable and threatening enemy than ever before.<br/><br/>It's not just the establishing shots that are so stunning, but also the action. Without a doubt, Rogue One has some of the best-directed and most exhilarating action in any Star Wars movie, combining that gritty intensity with beautiful, flowing direction that makes every action sequence an utter joy to behold, something that I'll remember as the best part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>The performances here are also brilliant. With less context and history behind them, the lead actors did an incredible job to bring their characters to life, and make you care just as much about them as anyone else. Felicity Jones' feisty lead performance is brilliant, as she proves a great action hero whilst also providing an impressive level of emotional depth. Diego Luna, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen are very likable co-stars, and they all make a brilliant on-screen team, something that's vital to the story, whilst Ben Mendelsohn is a convincing, albeit not incredibly intimidating villain.<br/><br/>There's so much to love about Rogue One, and it's a film that will dazzle your eyes from start to finish, fascinate you with its detail and gritty atmosphere, all the while putting a smile on your face as you watch the legendary Rebellion be born.<br/><br/>However, there is but one issue I have with Rogue One, and it comes in the form of the plot, particularly the first act. I'm glad to see we get a grittier Star Wars movie here, but I have to say that, for the first 40 minutes or so, this film really does drag. Its tough intensity, mixed with the by far the nerdiest part of the entire movie, isn't exactly riveting to watch. It's a lot of fun in the context of an action movie, but when it comes to good storytelling, it's not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this film gets a lot better as it goes along. Avoiding all spoilers, I'll say that the second act ignites the fuse, which reinvigorated my deeper interest, and the third act goes all out in one of the most spectacular finales I've ever seen. Not just a brilliant action climax, but an emotionally intense and incredibly brave ending that was so beautiful to witness it brought a tear to my eye.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a massively entertaining movie. It may struggle to get up to pace in its first act, but with a story that gets more and more enthralling throughout, brilliant performances, and some utterly beautiful direction, it's a thoroughly spectacular watch, which also gives us hardcore fans some fascinating context and history into the galaxy far, far away."

","The Force Awakens was a gigantic success, making $2 billion, third on the highest grossing movie list (behind Avatar and Titanic), and then I heard about this follow-up, not the next sequel, set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, it certainly sounded like it could be good, directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Godzilla). Basically on the planet Lah'mu, research scientist Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) and his family are in hiding, Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) arrives to force him to return to working on the Death Star project, a super-weapon space station capable of destroying entire planets. Galen is taken away and his wife Lyra (Valene Kane) is killed, their daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) escapes and hides in a secret bunker, she is found and taken to safety by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), a veteran of the Clone Wars. Fifteen years later, pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) defects from the Empire and smuggles a holographic message, from the moon of Jedha, of Galen to Gerrera, meanwhile Jyn Erso (The Theory of Everything's Felicity Jones) has been in Imperial captivity, she is rescued by Rebels who want her to help them find her father, however General Draven (Alistair Petrie) orders Rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor (The Terminal's Diego Luna) to kill Galen. Jyn, Andor, and his droid K-2SO (A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk) travel to Jedha, there the Empire are mining Kyber crystals to power the super-weapon, while Gerrara and his supporters are armed and working against them. Blind warrior Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and mercenary Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang) aid Jyn to make contact with Gerrara, who is holding Rook captive, he shows her the hologram, in it her father explains the Death Star's reactor design was compromised, an Imperial high-security data bank on the planet Scarif has the plans of the space station. Krennic meets with Governor Tarkin (a reanimated Peter Cushing, played by Guy Henry) on the Death Star, he expresses scepticism of the project and its management, Krennix demonstrates the weapon, with a low-powered shot to destroy Jedha's capital, Jyn and her group are forced to flee, while Gerrara remains to die rather than run. Tarkin breaches security and takes control of the project, and Krennic is ignored by Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones, played by Daniel Naprous and Spencer Wilding) when he pleads for support. Galen is tracked down by the Rebels to an Imperial research facility on the planet Eadu, Cassian chooses not to assassinate him, Galen admits responsibility for the leaked information when confronted by Krennic and his troops, before Jyn can attempt a rescue there is a Rebel bombing, Galen dies in his daughter's arms, the Rebels escape in a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics from Scarif, but the Rebel leadership cannot agree a plan; so Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, Imwe, Malbus, Rook and a number of Rebels go a rogue mission to raid the data bank, using the stolen Imperial shuttle, when communicated with they call their craft ""Rogue One"". Jyn and Cassian disguise themselves as Imperial officers and search for the plans, while the resident Imperial garrison is attacked by the other Rebels as a distraction, Rook contacts the Rebel Alliance fleet to engage the Imperial forces in space and attempt to breach the shield surrounding the planet, to enable the plans to be transmitted. K-2SO is destroyed holding off Stormtroopers, enabling Jyn and Cassian to obtain the Death Star plans from the data vaults, in the battle Rook, Îmwe, Malbus and many Rebels are killed, Krennic confronts Jyn and declares the Empire's victory, but Cassian shoots him, and with the shield deactivated Jyn is able to transmit the Death Star plans to the Rebel command ship. In the end, Tarkin fires the Death Star to destroy the compromised base, Krennic is killed in the blast, and Jyn and Cassian die in the ensuing shock wave, the Rebel fleet retreat, but Darth Vader and his troops intercept some of the Rebel ships before they jump into hyperspace, in search of the plans, on the Rebel flagship Princess Leia (a reanimated Carrie Fisher) declares that with the plans the Rebellion now have hope. Also starring Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma, Jonathan Aris as Senator Jebel, Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa, Ben Daniels as General Merrick, Ian McElhinney as General Dodonna, Daniel Mays as Tivik, Babou Ceesay as Lieutenant Sefla, Geraldine James as Blue Three, Simon Farnaby as Blue Five, Angus MacInnes as Gold Leader and Warwick Davis as Weeteef Cyubee. Jones is terrific as the feisty and likable heroine, Luna and Ahmed are good as ragged fighters, big stars Mikkelsen and Whitaker do well in their parts, but most of the best moments are from Tudyk voicing the wisecracking and sarcastic android. You can fit this ""standalone"" chapter in the series where it is supposed to be placed, the characters and story work as well as what we've seen in the original films, the fast-paced, thrilling fight and battle sequences are well executed, and it must be said the special effects of this entry are outstanding, how they managed to bring back young Leia and deceased Peter Cushing is highly impressive, a satisfactory and entertaining science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up/Hair and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"

","Had quite a good cast of characters in this, Darth Vader was the best character but unfortunately he didn't get a lot of screen time. New characters were lacking, the droid had some funny lines but other than that it was a pretty useless character. Cassian had some interesting backstory but it was very underdeveloped and seemed to lack much personality and uniqueness. Jyn was a bit interesting, but not much. The action scenes and special effects were brilliant but I disliked there wasn't any lightsaber duels, though the Vader scene at the end made up for that a bit. Some of the space battles were entertaining. It was nice to see Mustafar again.<br/><br/>The characters overall were too fresh, they only had one film to get the viewer to know their character and for such a huge franchise like Star Wars having the main characters as new characters with hardly any personality is very disappointing. They should've at least made the major new characters relatable to previous well established Star Wars characters, the lack of interesting new characters is the main reason I can't give this film a 9/10."
"questl-18592","7","1","2","10 February 2020"," Rogue1
","Hands down the best in this new generation of Star Wars movies. Rogue One steps back in time, slipping right in between episode III and IV, to witness the daring adventures and perilous gambit of the brave souls that captured the Death Star plans for the Rebellion.<br/><br/>Our ragtag group of rebels is a mixed bag. The lead two, I actually feel pretty ambivalent on. They're not bad or anything but they don't exactly wore me either. Then you look at Alan Tudyk's hilarious, movie stealing, battle droid or Donnie Yen's remarkably universe expanding blind monk and I can't help but think they're some of the best Star Wars characters we've had in a long while (don't worry Kylo, you're in that list too).<br/><br/>The film is fun, adventurous and fits quite nicely into the Star Wars universe, expanding on the lore without detracting a thing.<br/><br/>The problem here is that it's still a Star Wars movie. As such, they just have to add a bunch of nods and callbacks to the other movies in really obvious and forced ways. Among these is a downright disturbing glimpse of a CGI rendered fan favorite that straight up creeps me out. If they could have dialed the fan service back a bit, this would have been an exceptional journey.<br/><br/>Still, the ending is so amazing it makes up for a lot and we left with a movie that's a lot of fun, feels relevant and builds the universe.

","I have lost pretty much all investment in the Disney Star Wars trilogy, solo included, but this movie stands above all of them, seeming to be the only competently written film that respects the original trilogy. The story is executed near perfectly, and I was very surprised how much I was able to care about the characters despite them not being in any other film. I could talk about this movie all day, but overall, it's incredible. If I were to watch all the movies in order and ignore all Disney Star Wars, I will would not exclude this movie.

It's a war drama, a story of resistance against the tyrrany, a resistance made by common people just like us. They are not indestructable ,they don't have superhuman powers, they are human beings of flesh and blood. And they die. They all die because they can be killed just like anyone and because they are fighting against overwhelming odds. It' a pattern which has been repeated countless of times during the human history. Common people fighting and sacrificing their lives for freedom. It could be a story taking place in Nazi Occupied Europe during WWII as well. It's a movie that everyone can watch regardless of which type of movies one preferes. It's worth it."

","I must say that this relatively new Star Wars movie isn't as bad as anything that has transpired among the traditional *post* 1983 trilogies, in fact it appears that whoever made this, has somehow managed to keep any disgusting Harry Potter-ish Disney influence out of it, resulting in a serious movie with some delicate details and even a certain degree of unexpected depth and bits and pieces of quite believable dramatic twists and turns.<br/><br/>Its not a masterpiece which it can not be by default; yet I have to assume that there is a sliver of enjoyment in it for nearly every audience, including those who have already passed the mid point of their lives. The odds are that blablas running Disney and ruining everything they touch will unlikely see it this way but still; one can hope that this highly watchable piece of entertainment will turn out to be a soothing spirit for some nostalgic old fans and in some cases even create new followers.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has glimpses of the highly regrettable trend in todays Hollywood where the real talent hides itself in lesser known products while keeping away from traditional popcorn blockbusters made for those representing the idiocy of today.

But the reason I say this is that they were never truly 'hard' science fiction, more like Flash Gordon ... might I even go to far as to say kid's science fiction ! But they were always well made, and I watched them all.<br/><br/>This film however crossed another line. It is actually a really a dark film, not so much kid's stuff at all. In this film there is a streak of 'Alien' and even of 'Blade Runner.' It doesn't present warfare as a struggle where the guys in white hats do away the guys in black hats. It shows that there must be sacrifice in any struggle ... good or bad. <br/><br/>It is a dark movie ... but it's beautifully honest, and for me, the best Star Wars movie I've seen so far."

","In my opinion, this film is a very interesting link between trilogies. Yes, the timing was unfortunate and very ""cash-grab"" but as for the review of nothing more than the movie itself. to a true fan of the franchise, it did not lack substance. It may not have had the backing or be canon of the original story line. But to an imaginative person, it is quite fun to imagine. My only negative opinion would be that because it is indeed a bridge movie (Between 3-4) it is impossible to have any sequels (Since pretty much everyone, with exception to Darth Vader and Tarkin (for obvious reasons) is confirmed or presumed dead. Which leaves an impressed viewer feel wanting after seeing this. But reviewing this as just a connecting stand alone film to bridge between episode 3 to 4 and not in the horrid fashion of clone wars, I would say for what it was supposed to be and for what it is... it is not too bad. 
TL;DR : If you want a sequel, don't expect to like it. If you are a Star Wars Nerd, you will probably like it. Take it for what it is. A bridge movie between trilogies."
"alexandregatineau","8","1","2","31 January 2018"," A good surprise - no spoilers
","To put this into context: before I saw this movie, I was against the idea of this movie (milking the franchise), I didn't like the main actress because I didn't really see her in the role of a badass violent rebel spy and we didn't see to know any of the characters in the trailers (except Mon Mothma).<br/><br/>Well, that movie shut me up for 2 hours. <br/><br/>It's a bit messy in the beginning, many new characters, planets, and you change scene every 3min. 
But the second half of the movie is glorious. <br/><br/>Soundtracks are epic, especially the music for the last 10 minutes. No spoiler but you know which soundtrack I mean, and if not, it's called ""your father would be proud"". <br/><br/>Visually it's wow, nothing to envy to what would call ""a real star wars"". The last battle (no spoiler I swear) has really really cool and good shots.<br/><br/>Casting is good, Felicity Jones was a good surprise and so was Diego Luna. The droid and whoever is ""inside"" is pretty good too. He drops like 1 or 2 jokes but overall, there's no humor. <br/><br/>Which leads me to my last point: it's not funny. People are dying, the rebels are seen as terrorists, there is no Anakin line ""This is where the fun begins"", it's not funny Anakin, we're at war god damn it! People aren't smiling, they're sad, dirty, there's few hope. it's pretty dark and I love it. <br/><br/>Just a small points about the last scene (go watch it) which I can't spoil... wow.

","After being separated from her parents since she was little, Jyn Erso ends up collaborating with the Alliance in a desperate attempt to gain the original plans for the Death Star. Together with a group of rogue rebels, she will venture on an Imperial occupied planet, against all odds, in order to bring hope to the universe regarding the infamous Death Star.<br/><br/>It's a movie which tells, as its title suggests, a story related to the Star Wars universe, told from a different perspective, which ultimately affects the events from the franchise. Although it brings a sad and apparently thrilling premise, the story fails to impress in any way. It is good, it has consistency, but a bit too predictable and a bit too simple to provide much satisfaction. The characters are on par with the story, not bringing something which might raise the bar. They are quite underdeveloped, some even useless, almost without a clear direction, doing what they do just because they were supposed to do it, not because they actually felt that they should. Or at least that's how it is seen from my point of view. You simply don't get to care about their fate, maybe with one or two exceptions, thus making the finale as dull as it was predictable. To be honest, Cassian's robot was the only one which made itself pleasant and even funny, thus becoming the most cared for character of the movie. And this is, if you ask me, a bad ball for it. <br/><br/>The effects are very good, making it a visual pleasure, but this is nothing unexpected when talking about this type of movies. The sad part is that the visuals are the only very good part of this movie which ultimately fails to create something great. Although it had quite a good idea, the actors weren't able to bring something extraordinary to their ""ordinary"" characters, which, to be honest, were the disappointment of the movie. It felt lame, something made just to be there, not managing to transmit emotion to the viewer, which simply awaits the finale, instead of enjoying the story. Yes, I am disappointed by this one, not because I had big expectations regarding it, but because it failed to be a good movie, not to say that it had the whole Star Wars universe at its disposal."
"Christopher_Reid","4","1","2","19 January 2018"," Mostly terrible with some decent space battles
","I hated The Force Awakens but Rogue One managed to be even worse up until its redeeming final act. The characters are dull and boring. They have no life to them, no personality, no positivity. They could win a lotto ticket and still find a reason to be depressed.<br/><br/>At least Rogue One isn't a remake of A New Hope the way TFA was. But it's story didn't interest me much. It has a lot of little references to the original Star Wars trilogy, perfectly matching the details. From the little black robot that buzzes around to the cool style of door that closes after Vader fights Obi-Wan in ANH, from the costumes and hairdos to the bright lights and machinery of the Death Star. But it lacks the life of the original movies. It's all style with no substance. Half the costumes look like they've just been made and are being worn for the first time. It lacks the dirtiness of Star Wars, where everything looks used, likes it been through a lot, even though it's futuristic.<br/><br/>The music is terrible. Michael Giacchino has composed great music for Pixar movies like Up and Inside Out, but this score sounds uninspired. He references the first few notes of various Star Wars themes, only to fall flat with some other vapid theme. There's no impact, no energy. No chills down your spine moments like John Williams' scores are full of.<br/><br/>The finale brought this movie from a 1/10 up to a 4/10. That's impressive. Parts of it are quite exhilarating, but only briefly. There are inspired shots that take you back to childhood for fleeting seconds. It's not because they imitate the spaceships from the older films, it's because space battles are exciting, especially when the effects, editing and cinematography are good. Having sophisticated vehicles juxtaposed with palm trees and a generally tropical location is also refreshing.<br/><br/>Rogue One lacks the intrigue of the force. One character repeats the mantra ""I am one with the force, the force is with me."" over and over again. This is more grating than interesting. The story is often far-fetched, falling into a common problem where we constantly feel we're simply at the mercy of the writers. Maybe a character will dramatically die, maybe they'll have a miraculous close call, maybe they'll do that thing where they shoot and get shot at while having a conversation. The danger is only there when the script calls for it. It's shallow and inconsistent.<br/><br/>What made the original movies so great was a combination of rare things: good characters, great music (amongst the greatest ever written IMHO), state-of-the-art special effects, iconic heroes, villains, vehicles and gadgets and good direction. At best, Rogue One has some sections of good special effects combined with good directing and some decent dramatic moments. But otherwise, it is woefully subpar for most of its running time, on the level of a TV show. I think it will age poorly."

","When I watch a movie, I want it to make sense. There were numerous scenes in this movie that do not make sense to me.

At this point, the rebel commander sends in his ships to bomb the entire place. Why not just do that in the first place?<br/><br/>Secondly, why do the rebels want to assassinate Erso? The death star is already operational. His only value to the rebels now is to get information about how to destroy it. The kill order makes no sense; capture would make much more sense.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end of the movie there are hundreds of tie fighters flying around and not one of them gets the order to destroy the satellite. Have a fighter shoot down this satellite and the death star plans will never leave the planet. They use the death start to blow up the entire city just minutes after the plans are received by the rebels. Why not before?<br/><br/>This all being said, it's a very interesting movie and is thematically different from the rest of the Star Wars movies."

Also in the begging of the movie the movies cuts to like 3 locations in 5 minutes. I know they want to build the setting, but its too much. I still find this movie quite enjoyable and it deserves most of the praise it gets, however it will never be a true Stars Wars."
"AmyJenson1995","10","1","2","15 April 2017"," The missing piece
","When Rogue One was released, I didn't have any particular expectation about it. I was quite disappointed by the Force Awakens released a few months earlier but as many of my friends who happen to be great Star Wars fans begged me to go see it, I've given up and gave it a shot. And I don't regret anything about it.<br/><br/>Rogue One is the Star Wars movie we should all expect to see. It has the sense of epicness the previous trilogies have, the same taste of visual and sound marvel and they have characters we could truly identify with. It has also some very well placed dose of humor which is welcome to enlighten the mood a little.<br/><br/>Because we should not be mistaken about it: this movie is very dark as it's the direct prelude of Episode IV where the Empire is ruthless as ever without any sight of hope to see. The Alliance is still burgeoning and struggling to survive and almost to the point of breaking up and surrender. The only hope will come through this bunch of ordinary heroes who are willing to risk everything including giving up their lives to give the Alliance that will which would allow them to defeat Evil.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso has nothing special just like we thought Luke was before we learned of his past. She is the daughter of a genius scientist who got kidnapped by the Empire to create what will become the Death Star. Trying to survive on her own, she is rescued by the Alliance so she could help them locate her father and destroy the Death Star before it's becoming operational. Here begins an epic journey which will drive them to go straight in the clutch of their enemies to steal the blueprints of the deadliest and most powerful weapon ever and finally give the galaxy a new hope to triumph from Evil.<br/><br/>This movie has so many assets and it uses it very efficiently. First it has a true purpose as it's the last piece of the puzzle. It explains us and give us many answers to questions which were left as a mystery. For example we never knew if that fatal flow of the Death Star which caused her explosion was an accidental mishap or a deliberate attempt to thwart the project. With Rogue One that mystery is answered. We also know how Tarkin got control of the Death Star or how Leia got involved with all of this. Rogue One in that aspect was necessary.<br/><br/>Second it allowed us to meet again characters we fought long gone like Governor Tarkin, Gold Leader, Red Leader, Bail Organa or young Leia thanks to the incredible ingeniousness of Light & Magic. Those people are so talented it's mesmerizing. They deserve an award just for being able to recreate those legendary characters and inserting them into that newly created story. It was ambitious and risky but it worked to the perfection. I had a chill watching them coming back to life once again. It was eerie. <br/><br/>And of course we meet Darth Vader once again. That part was probably the best one ever of the movies. Rogue One surely wrote another part of the legend of Darth Vader. The two scenes he appears are chilling and breathtaking truly showing how raw and powerful this legendary character is! That was something Gareth Edwards did very great.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the locations: Scarif is breathtaking. It truly looks like a postcard place with its sandy beaches, teal waters and tree palms if only it wasn't used as the Archives of the Empire and the main scene of a destructive and bloody battle. Jeddah is the recurring sandy planet each Star Wars is obliged to have but it's still very interesting to see with its atmosphere and great array of population communities, one of another recurring theme every Star Wars Movie has to show.<br/><br/>Finally the musical score. As a Star Wars movie, its score has to match the epic feeling of the movie, the tension of the scenes. Michael Giacchino did a great job at it especially the final battle which was a real pleasure to the ear. If it was John Williams well I wouldn't be surprised one bit, but for a newcomer, it's impressive so great job Michael.<br/><br/>So to conclude, Rogue One deserves to be considered as canon. It has it all: the epic story, the great cast, the visual masterpiece, the music score and the creativity. George Lucas once told that among all the movies Disney released since they took over, Rogue One was by far his favorite. Well I cannot agree more when you see how disgraceful Star wars has become since then."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","2","4 April 2017"," A Rich, Stargazing Concept with Serious Problems
","Feels like I wanted to like this more than I actually did. Behind the dazzling effects work, the colorful character designs and the back-bending efforts to make everything feel at home beside the beloved original Star Wars, the story itself has deep-seated problems. Despite a very long, convoluted setup, most of the cast feels deeply underdeveloped and the plot comes across as overly simplistic and predictable. Even moreso than one might expect from a direct prequel to a film most of the target audience has watched dozens of times. The injection of late rewrites are obvious, too, as the third act flows far more smoothly than the preceding hour-plus. Most of the successful elements fall into the domain of the visual and the atmospheric. The constant attention to detail is impressive, going to great lengths to establish vital credibility, and I was amazed by the controversial, convincing CG stand in for the long-dead Peter Cushing. Another computer-generated character just before the credits isn't nearly as effective, but that's more of an Easter egg than an integral part of the story and I'll let it slide as such. The action scenes sing, particularly when they also twang the strings of nostalgia by dropping familiar forms into a new setting, and the grand climax, while somewhat saccharine-drenched, is nonetheless effective. A good demo-reel for the viability of the extended universe, but some day soon the sentimentality will lose its edge. Better get things tightened up before then."
"Danny_G13","9","1","2","2 April 2017"," By a distance, the finest Star Wars movie
","Let's not lie about this, for all the colossal and justified popularity of the Star Wars franchise, they are not cinematically the greatest movies ever. They are fun, endearing, charming, captivating, but the acting could be better, the effects (for those who have seen the originals) are pretty weak and for his iconic imagery, Darth Vader is not the scariest or most intimidating movie villain ever.<br/><br/>So there was definitely some room for a genuinely high quality story to join the Star Wars world, and while Force Awakens made a good fist of it, there is undeniable irony that a 'stand alone' adventure with character cameos is by some distance the strongest in the whole saga.<br/><br/>Rogue One is the story of the team who managed, by hook or crook, to get the secret weakness plans for the Death Star back to the Alliance so Rogue Two and crew could destroy it. What exactly happened to that team I will not spoil by describing, because that is the story here in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones, in her first headline act (unless you count the bizarre mess that was Inferno) is Jyn, daughter of the chief scientist behind the Death Star, separated from him at a young age and forced to live her life raised by an outsider before ending up alone. She finds her way into the Alliance and a plot to kill her father, and her attempts to save him lead to a domino effect which will eventually lead to the end of the Death Star.<br/><br/>To say more would spoil the meat and guts; but it is safe to say this is an impeccably filmed, directed, produced and conceived stand alone adventure which gives avid fans some excellent and worthy back story while winning a few new ones thanks to the lack of need to have seen any of the other movies in the series.<br/><br/>This is the first Star Wars to actually make you care about the characters - in that what happens to them truly matters - all the rest while enjoyable, simply didn't connect emotionally with the audience in the way this one does. Not in the opinion of yours truly anyway - and it's that control it exerts over its audience which makes it so strong - it respects its viewers, both seasoned fans and brand newbies, and produces a fine result for both.<br/><br/>There is some character development, subtle though it may be in places, more obvious in others, aided by direction which gets the pacing dead on, and the cinematography is as good as any you'll see in any movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects too are up to scratch, even certain cameos, and it really does neatly tie in with the rest of the franchise, with some fine humorous moments as well which don't feel as cheesy as the gags from the earlier efforts.<br/><br/>Overall it's a rip roaring ride and hard to really fault on any level. Some characters ARE a bit wasted, which is a shame, but that's about the only thing wrong with it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Rogue One<br/><br/>The real reason Darth Vader wears a mask is because of a tanning bed accident.<br/><br/>Luckily, the UV-rays in this sci-fi movie are emitted from actual suns.<br/><br/>When the Alliance learns the location of Death Star blueprints that could turn the tide in the resistance, they have an ex-con (Felicity Jones) and her rag-tag rebels (Diego Luna, Donnie Yen, Alan Tudyk) infiltrate the Empire's tropical base and steal them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the project-lead (Ben Mendelsohn), Lord Vader (James Earl Jones) and Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) each vie for credit and control of the colossal mobile laser. <br/><br/>With imposing villains, unscrupulous heroes and a straightforward story that enters some pretty dark territory, this stand-alone prequel to a New Hope is not only funnier than any previous Star Wars movie, but also the most captivating installment since the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, however, this white sandy beach episode doesn't feature any bikini-clad Wookies. <br/><br/>Green Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

","I found myself falling asleep during the movie (even though I was well rested) which is always a bad sign... Something failing to keep the interest.<br/><br/>Won't say a lot, while the CGI was great, especially in the latter scenes where a lot is done is broad daylight, open spaces and against a marina background (always looks a lot more realistic when there are real-world backdrops), I thought the plot was very predictable with few surprises. Planet-busting Death Star, rebel scientist forced to build puts flaw in core reactor - spelled out in embarrassing clarity DOH! - must get plans for, and destroy...<br/><br/>Jyn Erso seemed more like a little-girl-lost rather than a feisty Leia - was this deliberate? Stormtroopers always look impressive in their white armour, but how come they fall like tenpins at the first whiff of a blaster? Only at the end does Darth Vader show what Imperial forces should be capable of.<br/><br/>I've long thought that the way battle is conducted in Star Wars movies is very WWII-ish, I don't see much evidence of advanced or futuristic methods, even though the machinery may be different.<br/><br/>How is it that star-cruisers (or even stormtroopers) can't be protected by forcefields, as can an entire planet? Anyway, having one rammed and brought down in rather conventional way sure looks impressive - fans are happy and I guess in the end it's all about keeping the $$$ flowing in.<br/><br/>Getting the Death Star plans out of that assembly looked suspiciously like 20th century storage technology dressed-up, complete with giant floppy/hard-disk... hmmm. Again it makes for the drama but is not very advanced.<br/><br/>As I am a SF nut I will definitely keep this one in my collection if only for the great CGI scenes... too bad about the cerebral lack."

Putting aside usual nonsense like sound in space and laser fire visibility and sounding, this is the first intelligently written and directed Star Wars episode. Now all of the story (I mean the whole saga) makes sense and is beautifully connected. The cast is very good, and so are their performances (which I cannot say for the rest of the movies). This is also the first Star Wars movie with almost nothing stolen from already told stories like John Carter and others. No J.J. Abrams (""damn the story! just shoot and kill and destroy! and do it fast!"") here and no G. Lucas (""I love fairy tales!""). Almost perfect. Too bad this was not filmed before (by the same team).

The performances are very disappointing if you think of the wonderful actors in this film. I do not feel that the stars were really into Star Wars to be honest, so they failed to deliver their lines convincingly. <br/><br/>Regardless!!! It's all about the battles! Excellently choreographed, fully satisfying, and exactly the thing I have been asking for since ROTJ.<br/><br/>So, do not expect anything story wise, but the battles alone are worth watching this movie time and time and time again. <br/><br/>8/10 for the X Wing VS Tie Fighter Action !"

I thought the performances were terrific particularly by the 2 leads Felicity Jones and Diego Luna. The supporting characters were memorable and i found myself actually worrying about these people.

","I was a huge Star Wars fan. I say ""was"" cause I grew up with the original trilogy and the true magic that surrounded it. That same magic went out through the window when George Lucas decided to ""complete"" his saga with three additional films, The Phantom Menace, Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. I was very delighted to hear about this, but boy, was I in for a surprise when I saw The Phantom Menace. What was a saga for adults and children had now become a saga for children... under 10. I was really sad about the direction GL took with Star Wars and I felt how Star Wars no longer meant anything to me. I actually hate those movies. I started to dislike Star Wars from head to toe and I never watch any of the original movies anymore mainly because of GLs horrible CGI add ons. I don't know how GL manage to destroy his own masterpiece. I thought of him as a genius, but now I think it was more likely the staff around him that created the magic and GL was just lucky to have such a great film crew. Star Wars was a big part of my childhood fantasies and dreams, but they were now gone. Forever I thought. Until now, when Rogue One was released. I didn't dislike The Force Awakens but it still felt like a movie for kids. But Rogue One is not only a movie for kids. Its back were it belongs, and I actually felt the nostalgia return a bit. IT was a great movie and I salute the director, cause he manage to bring back some of the true magic!<br/><br/>If I could erase I,II,II and the cartoon franchise that came with them, from movie history, I would in a heart beat.

"nickshenoda","9","1","2","29 March 2017"," on par with the first two
","this is by far the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back. why? because even though being very different from the main stream star wars narrative it pays homage to the one quality of the original star wars movies that we know and love them for i.e originality. this is more of a war movie than a sci fi. and granted there are some war movie clichés, never have I seen a more rooted in reality space wars film. you can really feel the WARS in star wars, even more than you can in the first two films dare I say. I can understand why die hard star wars fans don't like it, because it takes a leave from focusing too much on the defining traits introduced in the original movies e.g light saber fights and jedis using the force but the prequel trilogy was all about that and remember how it turned out. instead rogue one takes a different approach and focuses more on the struggles of the characters to survive in this brutal rule of the empire. unlike previous films, nothing is easy in this one. you can really feel the tension and danger and lives are lost in the struggles. plus I loved how the characters were very different from the original trio unlike those of the force awakens which should be a defining quality of the new characters since they are by definition NEW characters. also the character building of cassian was very good, in the start you see him murder someone because he will be a burden and I thought wow, what a jerk. but by the end you see him risking his life for jyn and nothing seems out of place"
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","2","27 March 2017"," Will surely please hardened fans and newcomers in equal measure
","Following their procurement of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise with it, it didn't take long for Disney to announce an all-new trilogy, continuing the legacy that was somewhat tarnished by George Lucas' terrible prequel trilogy beginning back in 1999. J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens, aka Episode VII, predictably made a ton of money in 2015, despite being a thinly-disguised re-hash of Episode IV with a few new characters thrown into the mix, and soon enough announcements were being made of spin-offs and origin stories aplenty. Many rolled their eyes at what appeared to be an easy money-spinner, but many more were excited to see this vast universe - which had been explored to no end in books, video games and comic- books - come to life on the big screen, and Gareth Edwards' Rogue One is by far the finest Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. <br/><br/>Set some time after The Revenge of the Sith but just before the events of A New Hope, the universe lives in terror as the Imperial Empire, led by the feared Darth Vader, seeks to crush the Rebellion and rule the galaxy. Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is forced by Imperial weapons researcher Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) to complete his work on the Death Star, a device the size of a moon capable of destroying entire planets. Galen's young daughter escapes the Stormtroopers and is raised by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). Years later and now a young woman, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is freed from a labour camp by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and is taken to Rebel leader Mon Mothma, who convinces her to help persuade her father to defect so they may learn more about the weapon he is building. Joined by a rag-tag gang of fighters and criminals, Jyn unwittingly finds herself at the centre of an impossible mission to steal plans to the Death Star, and playing her part in rescuing the universe from oppressive rule.<br/><br/>Continuing the series' line of strong female leads after Carrie Fisher and Daisy Ridley, Jones' Jyn Erso stands out by not being a princess or a 'Chosen One' character, but a tough orphan without any stand-out skills other than sheer will and determination. She doesn't get any special treatment due to royal connections or suddenly start wielding the Force, but must shack up with an equally gruff and battered gang of unlikely heroes to stand any chance of survival. Her companions are as equally memorable and played by strong actors, without ever being defined for a unique attribute. With C-3PO off elsewhere, the comedy robot is K-2SO, a re-programmed Imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk who offers the movie such much- needed comic relief. There's also blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen, who really looks like he's enjoying himself), his gun-wielding mercenary pal Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), and defected pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed).<br/><br/>Any fans who adored the Easter eggs barely hidden in The Force Awakens will be pleased to know that there's no change here. As the timeline inevitably crosses over with A New Hope, many faces and events will be familiar. Even Peter Cushing is brought back via some impressive CGI work as Grand Moff Tarkin. Edwards ensures that these crowd-pleasing moments of nostalgia don't distract too much from the central plot, and he really goes all-out with the action scenes. Apparently, futuristic helmets were placed upon the heads of real soldiers in old war photographs by Edwards as an idea of how he felt the aesthetic of the battles should be. They pulled it off, as there's a real immediacy and grit to the fighting. and a clarity in the way it is captured. Donnie Yen going to town on some Imperial soldiers with a staff provided, for me at least, the film's highlight. While the film does move too fast for its own good on occasion, this is a thrilling experience, with characters far more interesting than those involving in the main story. It will surely delight hardened fans and newcomers in equal measure."
"ms-52486","4","1","2","21 March 2017"," Dull Wars
","Some films can make you feel interested in the main characters within minutes. Rogue One to me is just another of those overly long movies that fails to create any form of empathy with anyone, even at more than 120 minutes. If a filmmaker doesn't care about the characters he is creating, then how could I as a viewer.<br/><br/>The beginning was promising, with Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn having an interesting showdown in a wide poetic landscape. But the longer the film went on, the more I felt that there must be a book titled ""How to make a Star Wars film"", and some studio executives got their hands on it. That said, the film is very well produced and superficially looks like a Star Wars epic in every way. But the bland acting (Diego Luna especially) and the constructed story line put me in a rather dull mood. Ben Mendelsohn's Krennic was one of the few interesting appearances. There were some good attempts in showing the moral ambiguity of the rebellion, which had some potential to suck me into the story. Unfortunately the fight scenes in the holy city made the Storm Troopers look pretty silly, almost comedic, and took away any sense of menace. <br/><br/>I do think there is an interesting dramatic story at the heart of it, but somehow after decades of film making, Disney seems to have forgotten how to build a gripping tension. When certain decisive moments in the film occurred, like the arrival of the rebel fleet, I just didn't care. <br/><br/>For me, this is a product leeching off the sentimental memories people have towards the original films, me included. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone above the age of 11, and I surely won't watch it again.<br/><br/>Finally, I found Leia's CGI face pretty horrible, but the film had already lost me at that point, so I wasn't as shocked as I should have been."

","The ""Star Wars"" universe is a world of endless possibilities about what stories you can explore, with an unprecedented amount of quality thematic elements that can be examined. With ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" Lucas Films and Walt Disney Pictures have started the analyzing elements of looking at different ways to tell the stories of some of our most beloved characters, while introducing new ones. Gareth Edwards' firm direction, in partnership with Greig Fraser's stunning cinematography, makes for a lavish and intense new chapter in the ""Star Wars"" mythology.<br/><br/>The first of the Star Wars standalone films, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" tells the story of a group of unlikely heroes that band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction.<br/><br/>Boasting an impressive cast that is led by Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones, it is one of the film's best attributes. Diversity in film has been called upon by every corner of the cinematic community and ""Star Wars,"" Lucas Films, and Walt Disney do not get enough credit in being of the first to fully embrace this notion into its most profitable franchise. As Jyn Erso, Jones leads with intensity, delivering a near heartbreaking interpretation of the most unlikely hero.<br/><br/>Of the players, the fanboys of the universe will scream the names of Chirru Imwe, played exquisitely by Donnie Yen, or K-2SO, played with spunk by Alan Tudyk.

I'll leave them for you to experience yourself.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this is one of the franchise's most vivacious productions. The aforementioned Greig Fraser delivers grit and action in his abilities to capture them with the lens. John Gilroy, Colin Goudie and Jabez Olssen cut the film to an impeccable action- adventure that stands toe-to-toe with anything delivered in 2016.<br/><br/>Having big shoes to fill in John Williams' illustrious classic score, Michael Giacchino rises to the occasion and then some with his compositions.

With the exception of some shoehorned entries of new and classic characters, ""Rogue One"" finds its balance in presenting this world to an avid die-hard fan and a casual movie-goer that is walking into this universe for the very first time.<br/><br/>Early reports of a ""darker"" and ""more gritty"" film have been around for months. We definitely have that here, but the insert of comedic beats often feel inserted so the audience can feel some joy in this tragic tale.

"BoundingSlinky","6","1","2","28 January 2017"," A welcome addition to the universe, but misses the greatness of the better Star Wars movies...
","After the resounding success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" Lucasarts Studios has rewarded the loyal Star Wars fans with a film that would introduce us to the story about how the rebel alliance exactly got to the plans of the ' Death Star' in the beginning of the movie where it all started. In this way, the film builds on the success that Star Wars with her first 3 films has amassed, which is a very smart choice. We can't exactly say the same about the prequels sadlySay what you want but the pre- quels were now not really a bull's eye. The story focuses around Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who from an early age since losing her parents, took on a rebellious path which has proved quite troublesome for The Empire apparently. When she meets Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), a member of the Rebel Alliance, she unwittingly lands into a plot against The Empire. Gradually the two in contact with various individuals who all have reason enough to join the group. The most notable of which are the duo of Chirrut Îmwe a blind (force wielding) ninja-like fighter, his best buddy Baze Malbus and K-2SO ( a hilarious re-programmed Empire-droid, with a great use of sarcasm). The mission sounds simpler than it seems: getting a hold of the plans of the Death Star to prevent the whole Galaxy being under the power of The Empire. <br/><br/>The 'Star Wars '-label on this film is both a curse as a blessing: on the one hand it brings the return to this ""Galaxy far far away"" nostalgia back. The grim post-apocalyptic atmosphere that the original trilogy had as well,finds its roots deep into this movie as well, the visual effects, the costumes and the overall atmosphere throughout this movies is a joy to watch and something you don't really find in a lot of movies nowadays.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the fact that this film was clearly as a story 'leading up to' (although is already 40 years old) A New Hope, makes the film also firmly limited in its freedoms: While this movie has created so many things you want to know more about, the movie simply doesn't have enough time to go into much dept about them. The characters suffer the most here. Outside the main character, Jyn Erso, none of the Rogue-One group members get a lot of time to develop their backstory, their motives of really much of an arc. So you feel little to no involvement when they are in danger during the suspenseful scènes. You just know too little about these characters to experience a real commitment. When u have already seen the original trilogy (as I suspect you did), you also kind of know where this whole story is going. While this is not fully deal-breaking, it does take away a bit of it stakes throughout the movie. The film is also rather slow start during the first part and it really takes a while to get the movie going. The first half of the movie does need quite a long time to orient the events in the universe and sometimes this feels orchestrated. I had a feeling that throughout the movie the paths of the characters were already pretty much set and this gave me a a bit of a compromising experience. However, the biggest problem that this movie will probable face is the fact that it made bad use of its. By putting our most favorite bad guy in the Galaxy in the trailers a lot of Star Wars fans had high expectations for the screen time that Darth Vader would receive during the movie. Unfortunately Darth Vader only appears 2 scenes. Although one of the scenes was absolutely amazing to watch (you will know it when you see it), I can't deny that I was a bit bummed out by only seeing him this much. That being said, Rogue One does contain at his core something where every Star Wars fan instantly falls in love with. The fact that Rogue One also answers some questions where a lot of fans have been waiting for 40 years for, does make this movie relevant. There are also some very nice treats for the very attentive fans amongst us, who will be rewarded for knowing and remembering all of their Star Wars-trivia (bonus geek points!) Last but certainly not least the movie is also surprisingly funny, much credit here for goes to the sarcastic droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk). All in all this movie is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe. Star Wars fans that don't get their expectations too high will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. If you previously, however, weren't Star Wars fan was, this movie will not suddenly win you over.<br/><br/>Conscensus: don't go with too many expectations to this movie (not sure if you have a lot of Darth Vader expected). The film comes when slow start but once the action starts, both action-fans as Star-wars lovers really enjoy this movie. You also want to watch' A New Hope ' again right away!"

First of all its a long movie 2hrs 13 minutes long and with the 9 previews close to 3 rs. Second Expecting the John Williams soundtrack with the powerful horns and strings intro. NOPE its a new score of some sort. Reminds me of the sound someone was suppose to come with each time you entered the building in Transformers Age of Extinction uninspiring and flat. Then of course the black space shot pan up or down planet or battle shot. We pan down to a planet and an imperial ship landing on it. This movie starts out slow. Really slow compared to the other ones. So sit back and wait for it. Finally we get to meet Sau Gurerro. OK Hess like the rebels Darth Vader but not terrifying like Darth is. The facial overlays the CG isn't that good Clearly their faces are lighted differently than the surrounding lighting.<br/><br/>Now here's the important part. A lot of people die in this film. possibly billions of them. Anyone you get attached to in the movie, well Don't cuz they DIE. Everybody dies. WTH? This is the most depressing of all the films. No Jedi no force no sabers other than vader. Its really cool we find out how the Deathstar weapon is designed and what powers it. This thing is terrifying. We get to see up close very up close shots of what it does and how the planets are ripped apart.<br/><br/>One thing I wish they did differently is not show us Anakin in his recovery chambers without the Darth life suit on. I don't know without Georges touches and Abrahams guidance on it. its turns into basically the battle of Iwo Jima and the quest for the Enigma box.<br/><br/>WE do get see a very well done battle though a very long one. That was a new site to behold. Also loved the new U wing fighter transport and yes my fave the Y wings show up in this to. It does segway right into Episode 4 really well. I don't know if I'm adding this to our collection in the future. WE have every version of the other Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>If you are expecting the old Star Wars film style. Don't.

","And lo, did Disney acquire the rights to arguably one of the most famous film franchises ever created (in this galaxy and all those before it). And, as everyone guessed, they began to milk it for all its worth. However, unlike the prequels, they did their best to appease everyone (i.e. the 'soft reboot' that was 'The Force Awakens'). However, along with what is technically the 'main' Star Wars story, they also decided to make one about just about everything from those little rodents you see briefly outside Jabba's palace, to why that Stormtrooper didn't see a door in front of him.<br/><br/>And here we have 'Rogue One' – the tale we all know the end to about how the Rebels got their hands on the plans to the Death Star. So, if you've seen any previous Star Wars story, you basically know the end – which is technically a 'spoiler,' but never mind that. Despite us all knowing how it turns out, it's actually pretty fun.<br/><br/>We join a young girl who has tenuous links to both the Rebels and the Empire and see her lead a band of misfits on a raid to steal and delivery the plans for the Death Star. And that's about it plot-wise. Like I say, if you've seen any of the others, you can probably guess how it all turns out. However, what's good about it is basically how well it ties the (depressing) prequels to the (excellent) originals. There are so many, not so much 'in-jokes,' but 'nods' to the original that only forty-year old fogies like myself will get. It's great to see all the faces who were in the original 'New Hope' film back here, even if some are a little 'CGI.' Rogue One in some ways is nothing new in as much as you know the story, however it is a worthy addition to the franchise due to it keeping with all the 'rules' of the universe (and not mentioning those 'midi-chlorines' or whatever they're called). Much of the talk surrounding the film centres on the use of computer graphics to restore dead actors (or 'un-age' them). I thought it was done pretty well, but there are those who say it's either disrespectful or just plain bad.<br/><br/>But, whether you're a die-hard fan like myself, or a casual cinema-goer who can't name every single X-wing pilot in the battle of Yavin, you should enjoy this story as a fun, action-packed romp which is suitable for all the family (assuming you like action/sci-fi of course). Let's just hope all those other Disney rumours about 'prequels' and 'back-stories' live up to this one. My hopes aren't high for the 'Han Solo origin story.'"

","So rogue one, is the story of a band of heroes that must steal the plans for the death star if they ever hope to destroy it. First the pros. Let me start by saying this film is a great war film. Its dark, its gritty, and its depressing. As for special effects they are awesome(as usual in a star wars movie). Gareth Edwards has proved that he does an excellent job at making things huge. I saw the death star in this movie and remember saying ""dame that's huge""! The cast does a good job as well. And i saved the best for last, the action scenes. Oh my god, they are amazing. You got ground troops fighting each other, You got an astounding space battle, And you got rebels fighting huge at-ats. As for the cons this movie doesn't do to well in the begging. The film wants you to accept these new characters in a very rushed manner. I wouldent say the characters are disposable, more like not as memorable. So in the end Rogue one has a slow start with a few character problems, but it then builds to an epic 2nd and 3rd act that makes all of those flaws seem very forgettable. 9/10 *2nd favorite movie of 2016"
"avatar_z","8","1","2","6 January 2017"," Almost there but a few slips
","First off the bat, this is a good film and is a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga.<br/><br/>This is firmly in the vain of Star Wars 4 - 6, NOT 1 - 3.<br/><br/>To be fair 1 - 3 is a bit pants, Jar Jar Binks anyone, they are a bit shiny, a bit clever, a bit crisp around the edges and a bit polished. 4 - 6 are a bit grubby, a bit dog eared and a bit dark; R1 is firmly in the 4 - 6 camp, the ships are a bit battered, the characters are a bit grubby and war weary and not the nice guys usually portrayed, they've done bad things for the rebellion.<br/><br/>This is a good change of tack for these films. The beach battle scenes wouldn't be out of place in any WW2 movie, a full on war movie feel; the space battle is on an epic scale, loved it.<br/><br/>There are a few down sides that do detract from the overall movie. The turnover of characters is huge, because of this you don't get the attachment you do with the characters of the trilogies, which is just as well as they do pop off so fast. The CGI for Tarkin isn't quite there, he's a bit ""not right"" on screen but a welcome addition. Finally, the opening, WHERE WAS THE OPENING SCRAWL, the film just starts but no opening blurb and no opening Williams score, sort of a duff start.<br/><br/>Overall though, see this film."
"cadenbutera","9","1","2","4 January 2017"," A Succulent thrill ride of Cinematic Masterpiece
","Rogue One: 9/10<br/><br/>Rogue One consisted of basically the highest cinematography the industry has to offer. With Arguably some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, and breathtaking action sequences, Rogue One: A Star Wars story was pretty dang solid in my opinion.<br/><br/>I thought it had a compelling story that managed to keep me engaged the entire time, regardless of the fact that everyone knew the ending since 1977.<br/><br/>I also appreciated that it was darker tale in the star wars universe, making this movie a fresh telling of a story in the beloved familiar world. Thanks to George Lucas and his design crew; Star Wars is arguably one of the best, and largest universes of design. From its droids, technology, ships, etc, Star Wars is a brilliant and unique constructed reality. I thought Rogue one showcased that beautifully and dove deep into the brilliance of its unique world, without relying on it to carry the story.<br/><br/>The variety in the character assemble was strong, with a enjoyable amount of comedy and chemistry overall. With my biggest praise going to the driod character 2-KSO as well. WHAT A GOOD CHARACTER. That being said, main protagonist Jyn could have been a little stronger in my opinion, as to develop more intrigue for her as a character. She was still a good, strong independent character, justperhaps not as dynamic as I was hoping.<br/><br/>Not every story can be about the mighty power of Jedi and siths. Sometimes it takes a story about the smaller, more personal group of characters to make an intriguing story, and that is how Rogue One succeeded. Without being about to rely on the classic lightsaber duels and force using action sequences, I thought Rogue One created intrigue through its stylistic warfare sequences and immersion into the scenic design of the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Something unique Rogue One executed was bringing back to life 1977 Carrie Fischer, and Moff Tarkin, completely with CGI. Instead of skipping over Admiral Tarkin's storyline, because of Peter Cushing's death, they decided to harness of the power of 2016's technology. Personally I thought this was wonderful. It makes sense that they would spend time on Tarkin's character considering the timeline of this movie's story, and they went for it, regardless of no longer having Peter Cushing. My opinion on the CGI is pretty high. For the most part I was blown away by how good it looks. Princess Leia on the other hand.didn't look right to me. The CGI on her struck me as a little bit off. Ironically though, as I was discussing the CGI with the friends I went to the movie with, they had literal opposite impressions. As both me and my brother thought Tarkin looks great and Leia looks mediocre, my two friends thought Tarkin looked Mediocre, and *Leia* looked great. So I suppose that proves something. Wither way, I think CGI has reached a pretty high point in Cinema history, to where I am glad they could harness those tools effectively to tell a good story by including these characters.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Darth Vader for a moment; possibly everyone's favorite moments in the movie. He was great. Its funny, because in the first main scene featuring Darth Vader, he engages in a semi- lengthy conversation with Orson Kendrick, and as this scene progressed I realized, this is the most we've ever heard Darth Vader talk! Most of his dialogue before consisted of brief sentences and one liners. So to hear Vader speak for an extended period of time actually expanded our viewpoint of him as a character. In that scene we see him being a little sassy, even using sarcasm, and ending he conversation with a pun! WOW. And of course the most epic scene with Darth Vader taking on Rebel troops like a badass; now that was something. In the original movies, we were used to him being a lot slower in his fighting, due to pace of the scenes & likely some of the technical limitations of that time. But in Rogue One, we finally get to see Vader show off the fierce, Sith lord bad ass he really is.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie. Gareth Edwards did a phenomenal job, and I can't wait to go see this movie many more times."
"thornlessjl","7","1","2","4 January 2017"," First half: boring and characterless, second: Epic and amazing to grand proportions!
","I went in to this movie and didn't know what to expect, since I saw this movie as a watershed for what people thought of it. I want to divide this movie-review into two parts, the first stretching from the opening scenes to just before the rebels get to Scarif. Hence the second from the Scarif opening point till the end.<br/><br/>Beginning with the first part, the characters are presented and the premise is slowly but steady being set into action. However, the story that you are being told raises more questions than answers, in my opinion. That can be summarized into the plot-characters being pretty bland and questionable in their opinions. For example: Saw Gerrera's and Jyn's relationship isn't shown and told that much and makes the viewers feeling indifferent to the moment when you are supposed to feel for them. Another example is Jyn's opinions regarding the rebellion. She starts by saying that the Empire's possible ruling over the galaxy, isn't a that big of a deal if you just: ""don't look up on the flag"". And then later makes a fast turn and openly speaks on the rebel- meeting about they must continue to fight the Empire! This is not clear why she just switched her opinion that quickly, because of the plot maybe? But hey, no more cynicism, for now I will continue with the second part (AKA the part that makes this movie and raises my 7 rating to an 8). When the rebel-squad led by Cassian and Jyn, arrives on Scarif and whole hell breaks loose, the movie changes rapidly for the better. The action and battles are amazing, the plot is instantly better and more interesting and the characters that are brought forward are recognizable and thereby more likable, in my opinion. It's epic, good looking, funny, sad and jaw dropping all at the same time, watching the rebels taking on the Empire. The ""multiplot"" that sets into action during this part, with the audience being allowed to follow several plot-characters and their whereabouts, works very well and unites good in the ending. Also seeing Darth Vader kick some butt was very pleasing and a nice touch.<br/><br/>Story: 7 Characters: 6 Effects: 9 Fan pleasing: 10 Overall it gets an 8 from me, first part being an weak 7 or almost an 6."
"mistabobdobolina","8","1","2","1 January 2017"," A very different, but very welcome, take on the Star Wars universe
","What I liked most is that Rogue One puts in the foreground the toll the Empire takes on the lives of the people who live under it, or struggle against it. Jyn Erso, the lead -- charismatically portrayed by Felicity Jones -- is one of these people: living on the run from the Empire since childhood, raised a rebel cadre before the cause abandoned her and she abandoned it, the story is essentially the tale of her coming to terms with her past and trying to fulfil her work, to make sure her father's last gesture against the Empire doesn't come to nothing. <br/><br/>The people gathered around her are the flotsam and jetsam of rebellion and resistance, people who've traded parts of themselves (in some cases literally) to the pay the price of battling the Emperor; some of them have retained a sense of at least gallows humour about all this (Donnie Yen's Chirrut is one of the most instantly memorable characters ever to appear in a Star Wars movie because of this), others have been largely broken by it (brought out beautifully in Forest Whitaker's portrayal of the paranoid and hollowed-out Saw Gerrera), or remain driven by the need to have the terrible things they've done in the name of the rebellion mean something (which provides a passable excuse for the relatively stock Stoic Hero character Cassian). Everyone is damaged in some degree and looking for some kind of redemption, some way of striking back.<br/><br/>These people, and the tone of the story they inhabit, are considerably different from -- and darker than -- anything we've seen in Star Wars before. I think this lies at the root of the otherwise baffling claims in some quarters that the film lacked ""interesting"" story, characters or emotion; if you come in expecting the light-hearted, bantering space opera adventure tone of something like A New Hope or The Force Awakens, that's decidedly not what this is. I'm okay with that, because Rogue One is ditching (most of) the light-heartedness in favour of what is essentially a species of relatively grown-up ""war movie"" style storytelling in Star Wars clothing. it gains more from the trade-off than it loses. <br/><br/>That's not to say everything is perfect. I'm not entirely convinced by the way the hero team coheres by the end of the film, and Cassian in particular does not really hold his own as an interesting protagonist across from Jones' excellent work as Jyn Urso. There are nitpicks to be had with the way the action is handled from time to time (Rogue One really does bring up the eternal questions of why exactly stormtroopers wear armor that apparently is useless), and sequences that don't quite make sense (Saw Gerrera's tentacle moster). <br/><br/>But there's so much more tastiness here: Mikkelsen, Whitaker, Yen, Alan Tudyk's priceless turn as the cynical droid K2SO, a fun and smarmy baddie in Krennic, a badass guest appearance by Darth Vader, the digital wizardry used to resurrect Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin and to give us a glimpse of a young Leia. Sauced with excellent action sequences and clever fan-friendly nods and easter eggs, I found Rogue One to be tremendous fun on the whole."
"Hey_Sweden","7","3","12","11 August 2017"," The Force is with me. I am one with The Force.
","""Rogue One"" functions as a bridge between Episodes III and IV in this ongoing ""Star Wars"" film series, telling the story of the ambitious plot to obtain the plans to the armored space station The Death Star and hopefully find a weakness. A character named Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is recruited by The Rebel Alliance because it was her father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped to design the damn thing. Even after Jyn learns from a hologram of her father that it does in fact have a weakness (that he deliberately contrived), the RA won't lift a finger to help her. So she goes ""rogue"" with various soldiers, a Rebel spy (Diego Luna), a smart alecky droid (voice of Alan Tudyk), and an Imperial defector (Riz Ahmed).<br/><br/>While it is true that the script isn't without flaws, ""Rogue One"" is a spirited enough adventure. We don't really get to know characters that well, but they possess a basic inherent rooting factor that does help. Director Gareth Edwards handles the scope of the material quite well, and this viewer, for one, didn't feel that his pacing was too sluggish. The expected abundance of CGI was actually fairly impressive, for the most part. The action steadily builds towards an ultimately large scale battle in space that is satisfying.<br/><br/>Best of all, it's nice to see Darth Vader in full bad ass evil villain mode, even if his screen time is limited. Governor Tarkin is also brought back, using the digitized rendering of the image of the late Peter Cushing, and this effect turns out better than expected, if not perfect. Various nods are made to characters and details from Episode IV, such as those characters who pick a fight with Luke in the cantina.<br/><br/>It really does throw you off at first, not hearing that familiar, majestic John Williams theme OR seeing an expository crawl at the beginning. (The score by Michael Giacchino isn't bad at all but it's nowhere near as memorable as anything Williams composed.) Fortunately, once the story kicks in, this becomes a solidly entertaining viewing experience.<br/><br/>The performances from the international cast are decent. Tudyk is amusing as a droid who doesn't ACT much like a droid; he has a sardonic, sarcastic personality. Forest Whitaker is over the top as an extremist character who really doesn't serve much of a purpose.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Rogue One"" shows the audience a fairly good time, right up until its conclusion designed to lead right into the opening of Episode IV.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

"paul_haakonsen","8","3","12","17 December 2016"," A glorious addition to the ""Star Wars"" saga...
","Whatever hollow feeling ""The Force Awakened"" left us with will be filled out with what ""Rogue One"" delivers. And while I did enjoy ""The Force Awakens"", then it was just a blatant mash-up of part IV and VI, which served no purpose, except for catering to a whole new audience. However, ""Rogue One"" caters to both a new audience, but also to us who has been with the ""Star Wars"" saga since ""A New Hope"", and it does so with great skill and precision.<br/><br/>I must admit that the lack of the iconic scrolling text and ""Star Wars"" theme threw me off at first, and it was a shame that director Gareth Edwards opted to leave that out of ""Rogue One"", because that is how everything even remotely ""Star Wars"" starts out, even the PC games. But my disdain quickly dissipated like morning dew at the rays of the sun, because ""Rogue One"" turned out to be a real treat for us hardcore fans of the ""Star Wars"" galaxy and franchise.<br/><br/>The storyline, to those not yet familiar with it, is about how the technical plans for the Deathstar came to be in the hands of the Rebel Alliance.<br/><br/>Yep, that was essentially it. Of course, there are more layers to the storyline than just something that simple, but that is the essentials. And I will not delve further into the details, because I believe that this is something that you should experience for yourself.<br/><br/>True to the ""Star Wars"" saga, there is an abundance of characters, both good and evil throughout the course of the movie, most of which we are hardly given a good chance to get to know. However, the movie does focus mostly on Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones) and leaves the rest of the characters mostly just to appear as fillers and static characters. That was a shame, because a lot of the characters seemed to have really interesting background stories to tell and would add a whole deeper level of authenticity to the movie if we got to see more of what drives them, why they act and behave the way they do, and such. But of course, that would require a more extensive movie. However, I was left with a feeling that most characters were just colorful cardboard characters without a chance to fully shine on the screen.<br/><br/>As for Grand Moff Tarkin, well I will say that bless the CGI team for their efforts and for their attempt. However, it was painstakingly obvious that this was a CGI animation, and it didn't even remotely sound anything like Peter Cushing. And while the CGI animation was quite impressive, then he looked like he belonged in a ""Final Fantasy"" movie, and not in a ""Star Wars"" movie. There is just something about CGI animation which never looks fully life-like. I assume it was the lack of soul in the eyes. And the same should be said for Princess Leia, even with the little screen time that she had. But again, they put in a good effort and it worked out well enough. But with hand on heart, then it was a bit disheartening to witness on the screen.<br/><br/>Thankfully they had toned down on the comedic element, so there wasn't a new Jar Jar Binks to be seen in ""Rogue One"". Sure, there was some comedy, but it was subtle and it worked quite nicely with the dramatic storyline and the fast-paced action. And the comedic element was of course delivered by the very lovable K-2SO robot.<br/><br/>And there were great cameos throughout ""Rogue One"". It was especially great to see Gold Leader and Red Leader back in the cockpits of their Y-Wing and X-Wing respectively. That was a really great moment. And also when Jyn bumped into two very familiar characters on the bustling street, that was also quite a blast to witness. And then there was also a brief, but certainly, great moment with R2-D2 and C3-P0.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action in ""Rogue One"", both space combat and ground combat, which really helped the movie along quite nicely. The entire combat scene with the rebels and stormtroopers on land was just impressive, but it got even better as it was spiced up with some amazing space combat.<br/><br/>Now, there was of course Darth Vader, and while he is not a central part of the story, then he had some really great scenes, and it was a treat to have James Earl Jones return to voice this iconic Sith Lord. And the last five minutes of screen time that Darth Vader had was just amazing.<br/><br/>As for the acting in ""Rogue One"", then I will say that I was impressed with the entire cast for most parts. I was especially impressed with Diego Luna, Alan Tudyk, Wen Jiang and Donnie Yen. But Felicity Jones also managed to do a good job in the lead role, and while I had initially dreaded seeing my countryman Mads Mikkelsen in a ""Star Wars"" role, then he actually exceeded my expectations and was a welcomed addition to the saga.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Rogue One"" were just awesome, and you are constantly bombarded with visual effects, both CGI and physical. And there are so many details in every scene, that your mind really is working on overtime to take it all in and absorb it.<br/><br/>If you enjoy ""Star Wars"" in any way, then you definitely have to go to watch ""Rogue One"". ""Rogue One"" definitely picks up the ball that ""The Force Awakens"" fumbled and dropped and carries on the torch of the ""Star Wars"" saga."
"subxerogravity","9","3","12","16 December 2016"," Nothing like I was expecting from a Star Wars film, but this is for true Star Wars fans.
","It was a film not a movie like Episode Seven was. <br/><br/>It's the type of story usually reserved for a comic book tie-in rather than an entire feature.<br/><br/>I knew this was going to be a prequel but was not sure where in the Star Wars universe it was going to take place, but it was pretty brilliant following the mission of the team that got the plans for the Death Star used in Episode Four to destroy it. How this story ties together is amazing. Everything fits just right without being over the top, which surprises you.<br/><br/>It's obvious by the grim focus on political war fare that this was not going to be the record breaking blockbuster that Episode Seven was made to be. No, instead Disney made a film for Star Wars fans specifically. I'm sure others will like it, but not in comparison to the guy who realizes how this movie connects within the universe. <br/><br/>The film was beautifully retro as well. Everything was made using real sets, miniature models, and very little CGI to give it the 1977 Star Wars effect. They took visual effects to the limit bringing back characters either too old or too dead to play their original roles from near 40 years ago. The battle scenes where amazing as well. Done on a grand scale making Rogue One an amazing war epic.<br/><br/>And a great cast. I could not wait to see Donnie Yen battle the Empire, as a blind warrior whose into the force but is not a Jedi and he was amazing. Also like Ben Mendelsohn as the newest villain in the Star Wars Roster.<br/><br/>One flaw in the movie is that it is long without needing to be. Sometimes it just too far too long to introduce the simplest characters who would disappear a scene later.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a an amazing extension of the bigger Star Wars story.

"Matt_Layden","8","3","12","15 December 2016"," Hope...Rebellions Are Built On It.
","Rogue One has the difficult task of being the first Star Wars spin-off and having a story that doesn't revolve around any previously known Star Wars characters. Add onto that, the fact that we already know the outcome of this story. So how do we care for a story and characters when we know the ending? Rogue One tries to answer these questions and more and actually delivers something a little different for the series.<br/><br/>The Empire is building a powerful weapon that can destroy planets and the rebels are losing time. Fearing the end to the cause, a rogue group of rebels take it upon themselves to strike first and steal the plans to the Death Star, which details a small weakness purposely built into the system. <br/><br/>Even though I sat there knowing full-well that those death star plans make it into the hands of Princess Leia, then to R2-D2, then to the rebel alliance, which leads to Luke blowing up the Death Star.....I still found myself enthralled with Rogue One. There is a lot to digest here, so let's dig in. <br/><br/>First, the film starts off slow and weak. We jump from planet to planet to get our bearings and are introduced to a few characters that will eventually lead the story. One such character is Cassian Andor, a rebel who first hears about this weapon. He's tasked with leading Jyn Erso to help find her father, the man who helped build the Death Star. Despite both Diego Luna and Felicity Jones being good actors, I felt a little disconnected with their characters here. Which is a shame because they are suppose to be the core emotional pull for the audience. It's their sacrifice and determination that is suppose to corral the viewers behind this team and while they try, I never felt like they really hit it high enough. Even though I was let down with their work in this film, two other characters more than make up for it. Donnie Yen's Chirrut and Alan Tudyk's K-2SO steal the show. Yen's trust in the force makes him a weapon of mass destruction despite being blind. He has numerous ""kick- ass"" scenes that brought a smile to my face....the man has a stick for crying out loud. Then we have Tudyk, the comic relief. His android is above and beyond more interesting and tolerable than previous tall androids from the series. Yes, C-3PO is annoying. Here K-2SO is given a winning personality and Tudyk runs with it. It doesn't hurt that he knows how to take out some Stormtroopers as well. <br/><br/>Ben Mendelssohn is always reliable when you need him to look menacing and play up the villain role. He does so here, to great effect. The one cast member who totally blows it though and is hilariously awful is Forrest Whittaker. I'm not sure what he was thinking when he decided to play up this character, but he ruins all the scenes he is in. He brings the film down a few pegs and is one of the main reasons why the first half of this film is rather weak. Things eventually pick up and the film finishes strong. A much better second half, which takes the film into a more war like genre, creates suspense, thrills and genuine excitement to see space battles again. <br/><br/>So where does this film fall on the Star Wars scale? Well, it certainly is better than the prequels and some might even say better than Force Awakens, but I feel that some hardcore fans will feel a little put off by Rogue One. It feels different. It's more depressing, more action and chaos oriented. No jedi and even no John Williams. This is the first film not scored by John Williams. It's noticeable, not bad in any way, just noticeable. No opening crawl text either. I can see these small things rubbing those hardcore fans the wrong way, but do not be alarmed, this film is entertaining and worth the watch. <br/><br/>Ever since Benjamin Button was able to digitally make Brad Pitt look like he's in his twenties again, films have been using this to their advantage. They have not perfected it yet, people still look a little weird when digitally altered. Rogue One does this with some key characters, mainly Grand Moff Tarkin. Great to see the man in this film and it looks pretty decent as well. Sometimes though, it might take you out of the film experience. Then we have another classic character pop up, Darth Vader. Anyone who has seen the trailers know he's here. His screen time is limited...but the second time he shows up is probably the best scene involving Darth Vader in the entire series. Bold statement, but everything about the sequence was so well executed that I couldn't have asked for anything more. <br/><br/>A satisfying Star Wars film that tries to be a little different. Despite knowing how it will all end, the film does an admirable job of making you care for some of the characters and giving you edge of your seat excitement and entertainment. Easily recommended."

The movie holds a superb narrative pulse (and I say it because at my age I easily catch a wink otherwise) and what it is found by many as 45 minutes where nothing happens I find it not only necessary to reinforce the action and climax of the movie but a interesting change in the current action movie pattern where directors tend to put the audience in a unnecessary continuous emotional roller-coaster. It actually allows to savor the second half of the movie. The X-wing Tie Fighter warfare is simply fantastic. And the way this episode seamlessly merges with episode IV is a masterful continuity engineering. I'm truly sold about Rogue One.

For seeing its overwhelming success, there could be a prequel, which has a very very slim chance.<br/><br/>The story was like that had started in a half way. That's why I wanted a prequel to tell us the Galen Erso's point of view story. When he has been taken back to the base to work for the Empire, his daughter is the only one who escapes from there. After a few years later the grown- up daughter, Jyn, end up on the rebel's side. When she hints a plan for them to strike the Empire, nobody considers it.

","So its a great plot about how the Death Star plans get into the hands of the rebels. But, the plot gets lost in the crazy amount of people, places, and things that really don't add or mean much to the story. The most interesting character in the movie, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) who plays the father of the heroine, only gets about 5 minutes of story line. Yet, he is the central figure on how the plans are made available. This movie should have been a spy-thriller, not a series of shoot-em-up battles one after the other that just don't hang together. The ending is great, and gets us where we all wanted to be - heading towards Tatooine."
"jorge-b-dias","8","2","7","8 January 2017"," The best of the new movies
","For me this was the best movie since the original trilogy. It relies less on easy jokes and CGI and more on a good story and action as the good old original ones, and yet it is more unique than episode VII. I appreciated a lot the care to detail on robots, computer graphics and space ship instruments, that don't look (a lot) more high tech than original episodes IV, V and VI, which would be odd given the chronology of events. On episodes I, II and III, technology keeps looking more developed than in the original trilogy which is strange. In Rogue One one they sorted this out in a better way. The way the plot develops also makes it harder for there to be a sequel to this movie which is also refreshing has today almost every movie has a door open to one..."

","I'd say this is Star Wars Episode 3,5. It feels like Star Wars because it has:<br/><br/>New unique/weird characters, Humor, A story, Fits right into the Star Wars universe. And the ending... Wow.<br/><br/>You know they made something right when one of the most likable characters is a droid, business as usual, it's Star Wars were talking about!<br/><br/>What really makes me sad is how they could pull of this movie so good, but completely screw up the disaster called Episode 7. TFA doesn't fit into the Star Wars universe... at all.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching if you're a Star Wars fan."
"kierranambrose","8","2","7","4 January 2017"," There was nothing Rogue about this film - it truly belongs and adds depth to a promising Disney Star Wars universe.
","I very rarely write reviews. The film has to either be so horribly tragic - enough to warrant warning people off, or a film that transcends a conventional movie experience. Thankfully, Roque One is the latter.<br/><br/>Firstly I will clarify this; Roque One has some flaws. They're not glaring, but they are there. But at no point during the film did I pause and explicitly curse ""why the f*** did that just happen?!"". Just the inevitable Jame's Bond-esque bullet dodging (or in this case, laser dodging) amongst a couple of other minor things.<br/><br/>Anyway, moving on.<br/><br/>If you are a moderate to extreme hardcore Star Wars fan, this film is emotional and nostalgic, and something which I think we needed (especially after the three initial prequels). It really is. And the reason I say this film transcends a conventional movie experience is because this film bridges the gap on so many levels leading up to episode IV. It makes you feel the pain, despair, loss and the sacrifice it took to kick start the demise of the Empire. It's a film that isn't just a throwback trying to milk the cash cow Star Wars franchise. It's a film that adds real depth and context, and at least for me, immersed me more into the Empire versus the Rebel Alliance than I ever expected.<br/><br/>Without going off on too much of a tangent, we live in politically unstable times. This is a film that myself, and I believe many people will be able to relate to - because a large aspect of the film (and the original Star Wars films) is fighting the establishment and fighting against oppression. Rogue One captured the pure emotion, desperation and anger of the small people fighting against the immovable object. it was beautiful.<br/><br/>Without giving any spoilers away, there were some moments in the film which I think would bring a tear to the eyes of any legitimate Star Wars fan.<br/><br/>To sum up... a truly nostalgic and emotional film, and everything that I could have hoped for in a meaningful Star Wars story. This is the film we should have had instead of Episodes I-III."

It pays as a tribute to A New Hope but at the same time, certainly stands by itself. <br/><br/>Everything; from the compelling backstory of the protagonist and the antagonist, to the climactic battle sequences and the heavy, heart felt ending, all add up to a Star Wars film that was worth waiting my entire life to see. Thank you, Disney. Perhaps I've been wrong about your takeover of the franchise thus far. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Rogue One is a breath of fresh air to a franchise that was certainly becoming static with no new adventures or characters to explore. Now, perhaps this will come to pass."

"morrison-dylan-fan","9","2","7","20 December 2016"," Rogue Wars.
","Going to do some late Christmas shopping in town,I decided to check what was playing at the cinema. Learning of Tony Gilroy being one of the co-writers of the first ever stand-alone Star Wars film when watching the magnificent Bourne franchise earlier this years,I was thrilled to discover a showing about to start,which led to me going rogue.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Taken into hiding for 15 years by Rebel Alliance members after seeing her mum killed and dad Galen Erso taken to help with the ""Death Star project"" (nice name!) Jyn Erso gets a message from her dad about the near-completed Death Star needing to be destroyed. Joined by fellow Rebel Cassian Andor and droid K-2SO,Jyn goes to the planet where the Galactic Empire is extracting rare minerals for the project. Crossing paths with resistance fighters on the planet,Jyn discovers that her dad has put a weakness in the Death Star that will allow Jyn to give the world a new hope.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Raging against the machine from within, Felicity Jones gives a wonderful, energetic performance as Jyn,whose urgency to turn the Death Star dead is gripped by Jones in giving the action scenes a tough edge. Making the travels across this universe an enchanting experience,the ""character actors"" give fantastic performances,from Mads Mikkelsen and Forest Whitaker giving the flick a touch of gravitas as Galen and Saw Gerrera,to Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen hitting the heroic kicks as Rebels Bodhi Rook and Chirrut Îmwe.<br/><br/>Flying over the usual opening scroll,director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Greig Fraser set the film off with all rockets blazing,hitting special effects which are given a ""realistic"" sheen in a Sci-Fi world by Edwards covering all the objects in grit and dirt,with stilted wide shots soaking in the atmosphere from the beautiful real outdoor locations. Given just a month to come up with a score after Alexandre Desplat left over time issues, Michael Giacchino delivers a fitting score which soars over the excellent action scenes from Edwards, covered in vast crane shots looking down at the explosive war across the galaxy.<br/><br/>Trimming the infamous exposition of the franchise down to a minimum,the screenplay by Chris Weitz/Tony Gilroy/John Knoll and Gary Whitta fire up an adventurous Sci-Fi War, where the shadow of the Death Star hangs over every action Jyn makes. Carrying a galactic plot on its shoulders,the writers impressively find space for character moments,which turn Jyn into a rogue rebel and make droid K-2SO a scene-stealer! <br/><br/>Given the editing chair and $5 million to perform CPR and save the flick from hitting the Death Star,Tony Gilroy gives the movie clear signs of his ""Bourne skills"",via any step the film takes to overly complex exposition being firmly pulled away by Gilroy and placed round a focus on the characters. Being just the second Disney SW,the writers have the easy chance to tie things up in a neat bow. Taking a massive gamble for a blockbuster,the writers unleash an extraordinary grim ending,which truly makes this Star Wars film rogue."
"malcydon","10","2","7","18 December 2016"," This was amazing.
","The movie is amazing! It binds you into the chair. The characters are amazing, the story is well written. The fight scenes both on the ground and in space are beautiful.<br/><br/>Nothing is forced, everything as it should be. The movie is credible, it fits both for SW and normal viewers. I'm not sure of plot holes or small things etc, have to wait for smarter viewers.<br/><br/>A movie experience from which you can walk out happily and satisfied. It's a fine movie. May the force be with you, always.<br/><br/>..as it seems I still need two more lines to make this an acceptable review. So.. The weather effects were amazing. The darkness was Star Wars like, and not the blind darkness you see in most movies. I know the critics like that because it's ""realistic"", but I didn't bought my ticket to stare at a black blank canvas for two hours.<br/><br/>The weapon fire and weapon usage really improved. I like how it has a soul. It's not just the effect, but the shooting itself. Really good. What else? The star ship! Most space movies love to be small on the variety, but this! A real fan service for Star Wars fans, and for sci-fy lovers the better. You can see so many different vehicles! Both in space and on the landing pads. One can believe that armies are fighting not just x wings and tie fighters."

","Hopefully, after watching Rogue One, a truly very good film, more people will realise just how many things were wrong with The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams should be made to watch Rogue One on repeat, so that he might learn that you can make a great Star Wars film without being particularly original, but also without blatantly copying whatever you've seen on a previous installment. And how you can make a science fiction film that is low on the science but still doesn't ever become ridiculous.<br/><br/>A film that actually tries to close gaps in the plot, instead of opening new ones. And in which the heroes are not, for once, too special.<br/><br/>We get new, likable characters and a high quality dose of nostalgia with Darth Vader's brief but very memorable appearance and the digital resurrection of Peter Cushing (at first I thought they just found a guy who looked like him, doh). We also get a lot of effective drama even though we knew all along that the masterplan would work out. In addition, the idea to end the film where A New Hope begins was fantastic, and though very reasonable, came unexpected.<br/><br/>A few very minor complaints I have are concerning the limited role of Forrest Whitaker (could be bigger), the android (it felt there was more potential in the character), and maybe the blind Jedi-ish guy (a bit of an overkill, though I liked him). I might have also liked it if there were some aliens among the group.<br/><br/>Lastly, the music, not by John Williams, still made good use of the classic themes when necessary, while adding something different to the mix."
"terrellrobinson71","9","2","7","18 December 2016"," ""Rebellions are built on Hope!""
","When ""Rogue One"" was announced, I was a bit nervous about how this one turned out. First, after last year's ""The Force Awakens"", I was so thrilled to come back into the world of ""Star Wars"". But, did they need to excite us again for a standalone movie set in this universe? Second, the movie had a troubled production history. To be fair, it seemed like it was necessary (or not, depending on what you think of it) to bring ""Rogue One"" to the screen. And the results are stunning. Gareth Edwards, who directed the low-budget ""Monsters"" and a big-budget ""Godzilla"", was the right choice to take on a standalone ""Star Wars"" movie. It turns out that the story is set between the events of ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope"". And there are a lot of clues that will remind us of what is to come in Episode IV (The big clues are the best ones). A long time in a galaxy far, far away, we discover some amazing new characters, some great wonders, and a rebellious wit and heart interwoven into the stunning action sequences. Felicity Jones is wonderful as Jyn Erzo, a feisty rebel who, as a child, saw her father (Mads Mikkelsen) being corrupted by the power of the Empire to build a very dangerous and legendary weapon. (I think you what this one is.) Now, in her later years, she becomes part of the Rebel Alliance in order to steal the plans of this planet-destroying weapon. Joining them are Captain Cassian Andor (a superb Diego Luna), a Imperial pilot named Bodhi (Riz Ahmed), a blind kung-fu monk, Chirrut Imwe (the awesome Donnie Yen) and his trusty companion Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen) and K-2SO (the incomparable Alan Tudyk, in motion-capture form), a Imperial Robot whose memory was erased and was made to serve to the rebels. Of course, she also get help with a message that sent to her mentor, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). And of course, we have to keep a lookout on our baddie, the specialist of the Imperial Weapon who knows no mercy. That one is Orson Krennic (the fantastic Austrailian actor Ben Mendelsohn, bringing some sharp villainy). Now, I can't reveal the rest, but you will see how this rebel force brings the heat as their plans are set in motion. ""Rogue One"" is crazy fun and sensationally surprising from start to finish. It's visually exhilarating and the action sizzles with enough energy to punch us into hyperspace. And there is quite an strong emotional side to it. Is it a perfect ""Star Wars"" movie? Not quite. Sometimes the movie does show its stitching and the exposition does get in the way of the development of the characters. But the universe is alive and constantly surprising us every step of the way. As I'm prepared to wait for Episodes VIII and IX and its standalone Han Solo movie, the ""Star Wars"" series knows that there are more stories to tell. Being the first of their standalone films, this has the opportunity to explore a different side of the rebellion in which we haven't seen anything like it before. But more or less, there are plenty of opportunities to pull some facts from the mythology of ""Star Wars"" and expand it further. When that happens, I'll be there waiting for it. It definitely sums this wonderful line by Imwe: ""I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me."""

","So, almost everyone on this planet saw the original trilogy. If you did not - go watch the classic, you losing so many. And this is not a film for you. OK, Rogue One - is great, but with some conditions.<br/><br/>First impressions: at the last seconds of a movie, I almost cry, because of all memories that movie awaken in me. As for fan of IV-VI episode - this movie is the top of the cake. If you are the fan - go, you will not regret.<br/><br/>Story. It is not a secret that this is a movie about stealing of Death Star plans. And we all knew that this plans will be stolen (The start of New Hope). But the details was unknown (Extended Universe does not count). It was very interesting to follow the story for me, movie passed really fast, there was no boring moment in all film. The story is going around Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen Erso - one of the creators of Death Star. Jyn wants to find the father, rebels want to destroy Death Star, and the story go. It had no really unexpected events or unbelievable story turns, but it is interesting.<br/><br/>Characters. They are good and fit a movie well. I was afraid that it would be a movie about ""impossible"" task, for which the bunch of ""heroes"" with ""unique"" abilities needed. But it's good that it is not, our heroes are just people, not Jedy, not some other super-human, they are ordinary, but they fight against the empire. Everyone is interesting despite the fact, that their stories mostly was not told, but their simplicity make believing in their fillings and motives really easy. Droid K-2SO - great comical character, Baze - cool bad-ass warrior, Chirutt - a monk who believe in Force, Cassian - rebel soldier with dark past, and Jyn - who probably tries to find herself. They are not unique, but they fit this war drama just well.<br/><br/>Owerall. War - is the main theme of the movie. This war is darker and crueler that wars in other StarWars movies. There is no Jedi, there is only hope, and this hope is so small, that fighting only for this chance really hard. But it is worth to fight, what else you will do? This movie is dark, but it is Star Wars from the beginning to the end. Old desert spaceports with different aliens, war bases and spaceships of empire. Stormtroopers (still bad in aiming), space dog-fights and lasers all around. It's old good Star Wars, but with better graphics. Battles were awesome. The movie is really beautiful.<br/><br/>Cameo of our old friend also really good. Darth Wader - was just perfect. Tarkin - still so ruthless. And much more. This little moments creates the home mood around.<br/><br/>It is a great movie in Star Wars universe, and if you are the fan of the last one - you need to go. If you did not saw original trilogy (How it possible?) You probably did not understand many things, this movie is not separately standing one, but it complements other movies as it must be.<br/><br/>P.S. It must be 9/10, but I just cant=)"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","7","18 December 2016"," Pretty good
","I thought The Force Awakens was a highly entertaining film, but it also suffered from being way too derivative and formulaic. As a result, it hasn't stood to be as memorable as one could hope. Rogue One does well in limiting the amount of humor (there was too much in Force Awakens), but it also sometimes comes off as too serious. It also has some trouble in developing this new story and the new characters, it becomes a little too jumbled. Once it settles in, it becomes more enjoyable. The one thing is has over Force Awakens is that the visual and special effects are absolutely fantastic, and the action set-pieces really impressive. The story here is a bit lacking, but more than enough positives make up for the negatives."

It was tense, there were tears of nostalgia and sadness, there was the scene at the end that made me realize Darth Vader is and will remain the greatest villain of all times. It was beautiful, the cosmic battle and the scenery, it was even more beautiful to see stormtroopers and ATs at the sea.

"Oberrated","8","2","7","17 December 2016"," Slow starting --- Great action --- Boring leads --- Entertaining supporting characters
","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' ultimately is black and white for me. As far as a final result and my reaction of the film as a whole, it was great entertainment and a lot of Star Wars fun. The action, once it started up, was fast-paced and constant. The effects were a, as expected, beautiful sight to see and also a lot of fun per usual. And lastly, the connection of this film to the Star Wars universe was very well done. So regardless of what I am about to say, Rogue One is definitely worth the view or two as it is a treat to see a new take, or at least, a more detailed take on events that happened within the Star Wars story line.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: Even though it is entertaining, how bad can a Star Wars movie honestly be with all the previous ground work already laid out? This film was great when based off of the action, the Star Wars feel, and a story that is already so developed, it is easy to create something within it. Now what about performances? This film was great when no one was talking. The leads, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, lacked charisma and presence while on screen. I felt no major connection to them nor did I feel I cared about them in the least bit. Easily, the more entertaining characters were within the performances of Alan Tudyk and Donnie Yen who played K-2SO and Chirrut Îmwe. These two held attention and were loved characters for the personality that they brought to the screen. Not to mention, I am saying that a robot brought more personality than two humans... That is an issue to me... So beyond the two very weak main characters, the early first half portion of the film starts out very slow. For what may be the first thirty minutes, it is frequent location jumps and story development with little enticing moments leading up to what begins the fast-paced action that easily makes the movie worthwhile. Just to put the slow-paced start in perspective, I watched this movie once at a 10:30 PM showing on pre-release night and fell asleep. Yes, it is that slow.<br/><br/>So, regardless of my negativity, the Star Wars fan in me was extremely satisfied with what I was given. The overall Star Wars feel of these movies will more than likely forever give me a satisfied feel when I reach the end of it but as I stated before, Disney would have to try very hard to fail when they have a tried and true formula already laid out before them. They are going to need to make new characters that can deliver powerful performances if they wish to come back to the status that Star Wars was at when 'A New Hope' and the original trilogy first came out.<br/><br/>--Oberrated--"

","Those were the words I spoke to my friend who had never seen Star Wars before...<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the best Star Wars prequel. To be fair, there wasn't much competition since 2 out of 3 of the prequels were crap, and Revenge of the Sith is still not as good as Rogue One. <br/><br/>This isn't your average Star Wars either. It has no opening crawl and only has 3 characters from New Hope, two of which were CGI. One of the CGI characters was Tarkin, and the other I won't mention. Let's talk about the characters.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso may just be my favorite female Star Wars character. She is the definition of a rebel, and has great motives. Felicity Jones' acting was also incredible playing this character.<br/><br/>K2, the new droid is my favorite droid to date. He's funny, but he's also useful (unlike C3-PO). <br/><br/>Cassian Andor I felt was just a little to similar to Han Solo, and just wasn't very interesting.<br/><br/>But we all know why we were excited to see this movie, Darth Vader. I don't consider this a spoiler, but he was barely in it. However, when he was in it, it was awesome. This is perhaps the darkest portrayal of Vader, and it is great.<br/><br/>The action was incredible. The third act is by far the best part, due to just how well directed the action is. The visual effects have never looked better in a Star Wars movie, and enhances the action.<br/><br/>Almost everything about it is great and it is my third favorite movie in the series. Had certain characters been more interesting (especially the main villain) and the ending was little less predictable, I would have given it a 9. However, it gets an 8, and I think that is justified.<br/><br/>A must watch for any Star Wars fan, new or old. Hell, this is the perfect introduction to Star Wars."

I struggled to watch this beyond the 30 minute mark as I am considerably over ten years old and so far only the original first three films have been any good. Badly cast and acted with a bad script and gross overuse of CGI in a failed attempt to disguise the many flaws, the music was not up to much either. Take away ""Star Wars"" from the title and its IMDB score would be considerably less as this would result in reviewers being more honest and not biased towards it with ""Star Wars"" in the title. The only character with any personality was the friendly Imperial Droid with the biological actors being very wooden and not connecting with the audience.

","I was so grateful for the release of Rogue One after the disappointment of Ep7 The Force Awakens. The latter currently scoring just slightly higher than Rogue One on IMDb (at 8.1). Sure Ep7 serves a purpose and clearly satisfies it's contemporary demographic. But it's one that I do not associate with, myself being a massive fan of the original trilogy from back in the day. <br/><br/>Rogue One really understands the Star Wars ethos and plays out all the beats of the originals, staying true to the lore with integrity and originality. You know watching Rogue One that the director is a fan and is 100 percent invested, making it all the more easy for the viewer to invest also. And that I did.<br/><br/>The real highlight of this movie is the return of Darth Vader, who's ominous presence is felt throughout and as the tension reaches it's climactic crescendo he gives us a moment of such awe and dread it's right up there amongst his most iconic scenes. <br/><br/>With all the superficial remakes and expanded universe franchises being churned out today. Rogue One took us back to that familiar world of A New Hope, where the sense of peril and wonderment is back to it's visceral best. <br/><br/>Kudos to Gareth Edwards for this standalone movie. It is so well crafted, brilliantly acted and tidily scripted. But more importantly it truly is the love letter all Star Wars fans have been longing for. <br/><br/>10/10"

","""Rogue One"" relates the events leading up to the beginning of ""A New Hope,"" explaining how the Rebel Alliance got its hands on the plans for the Death Star. In tone, it's far more somber than any of its predecessors. The characters are all beleaguered revolutionaries, and the predominant mood of the film is gritty resolve. By definition, this means that this entry is lacking the sense of whimsy and adventure that defined the original trilogy, and its biggest flaw for me was the absence of compelling and colorful characters.<br/><br/>But on its own terms this is a worthy entry in the ""Star Wars"" canon, and I think I liked it more than ""The Force Awakens."" While that film certainly had fun and adventure to spare, it was thinly written; in contrast, ""Rogue One"" has a much richer and more sophisticated screenplay. The last quarter of the movie is incredibly exciting, taking the story right up to where ""A New Hope"" starts, and I dare any true ""Star Wars"" fan not to mist up at the very last scene.<br/><br/>I had a lot of trouble getting past the absence of the iconic ""Star Wars"" themes (John Williams did not do the music for this one). Brief strains of them occur here and there throughout the movie, and the main theme plays during the end credits, so I'm not sure why the original music couldn't have been incorporated more robustly into the entire film.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I was completely blown away by this movie. While I have seen all 7 of the other movies, I really don't acknowledge episodes 1, 2 and 3 as I did not enjoy the silliness. If you are not familiar with the plot to this movie, do yourself a favor and read up on it!!! I went with a group of 10 and those that didn't know what it was about were lost and did not enjoy near as much as I did. All you really need to know? They are stealing the plans for the Death Star for destruction in episode 4. That's it! <br/><br/>Many did not like the digital imagery for Grand Moff Tarkin and Leia but I thought it was fantastic. Gave me chills when I saw Tarkin, immediately knew who it was, and he turned around and stared into the camera.<br/><br/>Darth Vader? Did not see that coming. The final scene with him in it is one of the greatest movie scenes of all time!! Badass!! <br/><br/>I left the theater very happy! Just to warn you though---some in my group were not near as enthused."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","9","3","13","15 December 2016"," A grown-up and refreshing Star Wars story.
","The trailer made me assume something, that Star Wars has grown up, and I wasn't wrong. There's a strong sense of verity with Rogue One. It's different, doing away with certain techniques, yet still baring a few Star Wars' trademarks and honouring other captures that instantly remind you of the rest of the saga. The small elements that nod to the previous movies should invoke plenty of grins among fans, it follows basic Star Wars formula but is dressed up so well it's refreshingly brilliant. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones is so fitting as the estranged anti-heroine, Jyn. She's nothing short of amazing and the emotion she brings is some of the best seen in Star Wars. She's a stubborn survivor, a fighter with a good heart which makes her the ideal rebel. <br/><br/>Diego Luna plays Cassian Andor, the rebel's rebel. We quickly learn he's not as heroic as we might expect which actually raises a question with the alliance making me think of our own current affairs. Lucas has previously drawn his story from many of our own atrocities and cultures, and the writers here seem to be making a point, one I'm not totally comfortable with; which is actually a big plus for me. He's a great choice, reminding me a little of Vincent Cassel. <br/><br/>It must be such a challenge to invent a droid fitting for a new yet old Star Wars film. Awakens did so well with introducing BB-8 to the droid family and Alan Tudyk reprises a robot, baring a slight resemblance to his Sonny from I, Robot. K-2SO has a presence of a T-800 with a high level of abrasive sarcasm, basically a risk-calculating C-3PO with bolt-on aggression that disobeys all of the three laws of robotics.<br/><br/>I'm so glad they didn't repeat the same mistake that Blade II editors did with Hong Kong screen legend, Donnie Yen, which was nothing more than a disappointing tease. Yen has been around since the 80s but possible reached wider audiences with the Ip Man trilogy and having him play the blind and spiritual Chirrut was an excellent choice, having some of the key parts and best lines, I just wanted to see more. <br/><br/>Ben Mendelsohn brings a strong sense of realism to his character, Imperial Director Krennic. Just like Jones, he brings good, strong emotion into his character. In fact, checking the rest of the cast, they all perform superbly. Mads Mikkelsen, Riz Ahmed and Wen Jiang really make up the supporting cast and stand out with the film keeping a good balance. Forest Whitaker's extreme activist was probably the weakest character. <br/><br/>There's a destroyer load of action, more than what I expected and is in typical Star Wars fashion. It embellishes the classic Star Wars style without going so far to distance itself for its parental source. There's certain scenes that'll have you silently shout ""YES!"" You can tell Gareth Edwards is a loving fan and knows his Star Wars well. See Mr. Lucas, this is what happens when you let the fans continue your legacy. <br/><br/>The film frequently jumps around at light speed for the first part, which starts to become off- putting but it soon passes and is necessary to make sense of the plot. What comes after is a non-stop, epicness on a galactic scale, the starships and the incredible, fluid star battles go above and beyond amazing. <br/><br/>It's shows a different light of the rebellion, providing an intelligent, better understood foundation of the alliance, being exactly what they are, rebels but disjointed, possibly misguided and not entirely united, not everyone singing from the same page. It's about those that hate the imperial rule yet sit just outside the governance of the alliance, I think where a lot of us can relate to with our current climate. This gives the rebellion cause and a firm footing, the key stone to the original trilogy, a prefect bridge in terms of story making more sense to A New Hope and seeing what actually happens behind closed doors. *winks*<br/><br/>It's predictable but not in a bad way, you know what's coming but instead of sighing at the inevitable you eagerly look forward to how it'll play out. Being given a taste of these characters with little background, similar to what the A New Hope did with characters like Han Solo and Chewbacca, they making them likable yet only hinting at their history. I want to know more about these characters too now. <br/><br/>There's a successful mix of CGI with real costumes, locations and cosmetics, gladly not making the mistake Lucas did back in the 2000's. They do a fine job of replicating that '77 look especially when going TRON with a couple of familiar faces. It's like walking into a zoo of Star Wars characters saved from extinction, your eyes pointing at each one acknowledging who or what they are. <br/><br/>But where does it place among the rest of the saga? I find Rogue One far superior than Force Awakens for a number of reasons. While it has its humour and wisecracks, it's not silly or as clichéd as Force Awakens. It lacks the forgivable mistakes of Awakens, but don't get me wrong, I rated Awakens quite high giving it 85% (read the review here), but that was mostly because it was for the fans made by a fan, a proper Star Wars movie. Edwards has simply raised the bar above J.J. Abrams, but that's what we want right? Wouldn't be satisfying if it was worse and anticlimactic of if it was equally good. <br/><br/>Of course, I will be watching this again, possibly multiple times, I was even tempted to catch the 3:15am showing straight after if it wasn't for work and aching bum cheeks. It's the intergalactic western that mimics the sacrificial heroics, war and western movies did so well. This is the Star Wars film you have been looking for."
"Dannyboi94","9","3","13","15 December 2016"," A great war movie and an interesting Star Wars film
","I have loved Star Wars since as long as I can remember, I love every single movie, 1-7 all of them. I was very hyped to see this film, and I was not disappointed. This is a great movie, with some epic moments, but also some minor complaints.<br/><br/>First of all, the look of this film is absolutely brilliant. From the mixture of particle effects, mixed with CGI, from the colour, the look, the cinematography, is all brilliant, with no faults at all. It feels very much like a part of the original trilogy, but some aspects come straight from the prequels too, which I am thankful for. The make- up, the production design, to the sound effects, are all done to perfection. <br/><br/>But by far the greatest thing this film has going for it, is its visual effects. BY GOD ARE THEY AMAZING! I could not fault one single frame which held CGI, it is done so dam well. There are two motion capture characters in this film, and they are done so well it will leave you completely shocked. You know they aren't real, because well, without spoiling anything, the actors are either too old or dead, but it is just fascinating how they achieved this.<br/><br/>Now for the characters and story. Each main character in this film is done very, very well, with all if them having their own personalities and traits, and all bring something to the table. Many critics have moaned (as they always do) about stupid things like them. The characters are great, yes some of them are given no backstory at all, but they are so good to watch, you don't care.<br/><br/>The story is very well done, and if you have seen episode 4, you know what is going to happen, but it is done so well, and keeps you invested. <br/><br/>Now I know everyone wants to know about Darth Vader, and I will say this, he has two scenes ... yes that is it ... two bloody scenes. However, these are very, very good scenes. Hearing Darth Vader speak gave me goosebumps, and I wanted to cry from all the epicness. He has one outstanding scene, which I won't spoil, but it was ... ahhhh soooo gooooooood!<br/><br/>I have few complaints, but they do not necessarily effect the movie, itself, one is that there is no opening crawl. For a kid who goes to see this movie, they will be very confused why there is no crawl, nor the Star Wars main theme, yes that's right, no Star Wars music blasting in you face, which brings me to my next complaint. The music is ... disappointing. There is not one memorable score in this film, not one at all. It is shocking how, bland it is, when the composer is an Oscar winner, who has done great work in the past. Every Star Wars film has dozens of epic scores that you find yourself humming after hearing, this had none. The next is the ending, the ending is pretty dam crap.<br/><br/>The movie ends to absurdly and fast that I was asking myself, right whats next then? But then you could just answer, go watch episode 4, because it ties directly into it.<br/><br/>This movie is great, it is slightly better than Force Awakens, but I would rank it behind, Revenge of the Sith, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. After watching this film, it gives A New Hope more meaning and depth, and the next time I watch it, I will be more engrossed than I ever have been because of this movie.<br/><br/>9.4/10"

It was not a FANTASTIC or EXTRAORDINARY movie, but after a few disappointments from previous franchises this one was a really god one. The CGI did all the difference , and this is what we all expected , and Disney and it's crew provided. Believe me, if , after eight hours of work i did enjoy this one, and along with me the audience of all ages , it worth the $15 i spend.

"bnthfddr","9","3","13","15 December 2016"," Essential entry in to the Star Wars canon
","I've been a Star Wars fan since the original ANH, and in the years since kept up to date through the prequels, Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy (and a host of other novels of varying quality), both Clone Wars animated series, the Rebels TV show and even the long-since-defunct West End Games' Star Wars RPG.<br/><br/>This is relevant because I believe this to be the SW film that people of my generation have been waiting for. It's very much SW for adults in so much as the characters are often morally ambiguous and it certainly pulls no punches when dealing with their fates. Do not venture in to the cinema expecting an ANH type-ending.<br/><br/>I was immediately hooked from the get-go. The imagery in this film is utterly stunning throughout. The biomes visited often bring something new to the lore (the presumably-perpetually raining) skies of Eadu and the lush tropical beaches of Scarif couldn't provide a greater contrast to each other.<br/><br/>Given that this is still a SW film and we perhaps shouldn't expect Branagh-like performances, I applaud the entirety of the cast for the jobs they've delivered. Diego Luna particularly stood out for me, along with the ever-excellent Ben Mendelsohn as the increasingly-ruffled Krennic. it seems as though most of the dubious dialogue witnessed in the trailers ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The pacing (for me) was excellent. There is a clear build-up from the first act's team-assembling activities through to the skirmish on Eadu and the (limited) bickering between the Rebels on Yavin IV before finally we reach a crescendo with the mind-blowing action of act III. And what action! The space battle alone is better than anything since RoTJ - even more so because it includes our old friends red leader and gold leader from ANH. Plus there is an amusing little cameo from a hapless Rebel which explains why Luke inherited the callsign red-5. The ground based action is brutal, fast-paced, jaw-dropping and at times moving. let there be no doubt that this really is a Star WARS film. Oh, and there's Vader doing what Vader does best.<br/><br/>The score was competent, although I do personally think that Williams was missed. He's been part of SW for so long, that you instinctively know when he's not involved! <br/><br/>I can honestly say I left the cinema numb. I realised immediately that I had just seen the SW film I've been yearning for since 1983. Anyone worried about the property being 'Disney-fied' need not. It's about as dark as SW has ever been (ESB notwithstanding).<br/><br/>Watch it."
"MrDHWong","9","3","13","15 December 2016"," A worthy entry in the series and fitting appetizer before the release of Episode VIII
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a standalone spin-off film in the Star Wars franchise. Proving once again that Star Wars in good hands at Disney and that Star Wars: The Force Awakens wasn't a fluke, the film serves as a worthy entry in the series and fitting appetizer before the release of Episode VIII.<br/><br/>Sometime after the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the evil Galactic Empire are in the process of building their ultimate super-weapon, The Death Star, as a means to control the galaxy. In an effort to stop them, the Rebellion recruits Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) to work alongside them to steal the blueprints for the Death Star and find a way to use them to put a stop to the Empire's expanding domination of other star systems.<br/><br/>Succeeding not only as a Star Wars film, but as an exciting heist film, Rogue One is highly entertaining and stands on its own from the series it originated. I especially enjoyed the effort the filmmakers went to make the film look as much like the Original Star Wars Trilogy as possible, complete with convincing practical effects and even some amazing CGI effects. Hardcore Star Wars fans should keep their eyes peeled for some clever Easter eggs and inside references to other Star Wars films. My only real complaint is that the first act is a bit slow moving. However, the brilliant third act more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

","Every Star Wars fan going to this movie already knows how the story will end, yet it managed to surprise me. The movie is fast paced and full of action while providing decent back story to our main character jyn. The shots of the many new worlds in this movie are absolutely gorgeous. It has the most beautiful shots of any star wars movie to date: from the action scenes to giant space battles. The music is amazing a must for every star wars movie (its a space opera after all). The battle experience given is that of the (foot) soldier, with the occasional overview. The acting is excellent overall, even though the pace is fast human emotions can be felt and understood. The movie feels like star wars with a fresh twist, something that was needed after the slight copycat feel of the force awakens. I think this movie is perfect to introduce people to the star wars universe. I can recommend it to all fan or not."

"brycebclark","3","3","14","16 May 2017"," Disney does it again
","Stupified characters with nonsensical motivations that can't be ignored no matter how hard you wish to neglect them. <br/><br/>For example, why does Gaylen confess when the Empire is about the kill the engineers, kill the very men who non-conflicting assembled the Death Star for the destruction of innocents? He should have enjoyed seeing the Empire destruct their personnel, as he so masterfully played his hand to stifle and destroy their intentions. And, additionally, he designed a critical flaw in the Death Star to explode and destroy the hundreds of thousands of people on-board, to begin with; what would he care if a few engineers died? Why does he feel guilty about the death of what are essentially sci-fi Nazis? Because Disney wants to impose its simplistic and dumb morality for a 'family friendly' b-rated, blockbuster that has little grounding in reality and is such a contrived and overacted, unfounded piece of garbage that it holds little integrity on its own. Just give me a job writing scripts, I'll give you a better narrative and more character integrity than this hack-job catastrophe."
"aharmas","10","3","14","16 December 2016"," Fresh and Revolutionary and Still So Familiar
","It took almost 40 years to take the original diamond and take to what might be its most splendid shape. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" ruled as the best of the bunch for over 30 years, and last year hope was regained when we saw ""Episode VIII"", only to realize at the end that it was really more of a set up, and one that mirrored the original. For a year, we have been hanging and hoping many of the new plot lines will live up to the very high expectations. Well, it's going to have to be much, much, better than we hope because ""Rogue One"" has raised the standard.<br/><br/>""Rogue"" is a direct prequel to ""Episode IV""; this time the prequel bursts alive with the same force that made believers of all of us the first time. It has a lot to introduce, and it's the sort of mythology that needs to be good enough to stand on its own and prepare us for the immediate sequel. The best thing about it is that it has been produced and designed to look just like the original 1977 film. The weapons, ships, costumes, and the villains are all back, like they never left us. However, technology has made it possible now, with the help of some brilliant editing, a killer soundtrack, and plenty of imagination to give us new perspectives, watching the rebels' ships move and do all kinds of maneuvers that were impossible when Lucas first directed his film. Lucas' original was greatly benefited from the superb editing job his wife did. This time it takes three people to improve on that, and the results are splendid, as three or four story lines are shown to us seamlessly, keeping us on the edge of our seats.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" introduces us to the chapter that allows to learn how the Death Star was designed and originated, who made it all possible, and who allowed the rebels to have access to the plans that will eventually lead them to succeed in their enterprise to stop the Empire, at least, temporarily.<br/><br/>Keeping us with modern trends and not disappointing us by introducing the skeleton of ideas that fall apart before being fully developed, this film has many new characters, and they're all memorable and not just a whim or an excuse to showcase computer animation, the one problem that sank I, II, and III. This time we feel like we are back where this universe started. We feel welcomed, and we welcome it. One moment that stood out in ""Episode 7"" is how cool it was to see Chewie and Solo say that famous line: ""Chewie, we're home!"". The rest of that film moved nicely, but it never hit that high again.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we go back home, to recreations of the original sets, with the computer graphics looking the same they did in 1977. It's a fast and exciting trip back in time to the source. Here you see the helmets, the gadgets the same way they were introduced, and the last shot in the film is sure to bring the house down.<br/><br/>We follow our new heroes as they track the creator of the Death Star, and they move forward to the location of the material that will prove to be very helpful to the Alliance. As this occurs, we see the levels of intensity reach new highs, and things eventually reach a conclusion that is bound to be both controversial and that lifts this way above what this type of film is generally perceived to be. ""Rogue"" is a masterful entry to the series, and one that honors the original material. This film gives us ""hope"" that it's still possible to bring new ideas, while using the original source without looking or sounding like a cheap imitation or an excuse to get extra cash from the audiences.<br/><br/>New stars will be born, exploding on the screen, and yet you see why this time around it's very important to take advantage of the moment and use what we have to its full potential. The entire cast is a joy to watch, and who can ever refuse a good villain like Vader, a character that if you can believe, grows even more malignant than we thought possible.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" is great film."

"msbreviews","8","2","8","6 August 2017"," Rating: B+
","I'm a huge Star Wars fan, I love the original trilogy, I mostly hate the prequels and last year's film was my number one pick for the best movie of 2015, so this is the movie I was definitely waiting desperately for since the start of 2016 ... And it did great!<br/><br/>I'll start with my issues with this film because there are some major problems that need to be discussed. The one that's bothering me the most is the lack of emotional attachment that I had with the characters. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is the protagonist and the only character with a backstory supporting her, so I did care about her and I always wanted her to be on the screen. The same can't be said for the others!<br/><br/>Captain Andor (Diego Luna) only gets a few seconds to express his feelings from his past, Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen) have a beautiful and super funny friendship, but I never got a single scene that explained why they were like that and K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) is the usual audience's favorite character due to his one liners and super funny scenes. However, when the character that you cared the most, besides the main one, of course, is a robot ... Something's not right. The emotional ending the director tried to achieve didn't quite have the desired effect.<br/><br/>Governor Tarkin appears a lot in this film and, if you don't know, he was also a major character in the previous films of this franchise. The actor who portrayed him at the time was Peter Cushing (died in 1994) and here comes the issue: he portrayed him again. His CGI face is amazing, almost perfect like CGI is in the rest of the movie, but it's still a manipulated face and I can totally see it. I could never get used to it and I doubt that anyone can, it's too obvious and it takes away all the focus of his scenes. I'm not saying ""it's a lack of respect"" like some critics' opinions, I actually think it was a great idea, but it should have been more subtle (like they perfectly did in the first scene he was in, with a mirror reflection).<br/><br/>Since I'm in the dark side now, I should talk about Darth Vader. Hum, this one's hard to discuss. The Star Wars fan in me wanted one of the biggest villains ever to show up constantly and kill a whole bunch of Rebels, but the critic in me knows that it's not something I should've expected since I knew that he wouldn't have a big part. With this in mind, I find myself in between something that is a problem with the movie and something that is a problem for me. Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is the main villain of the film and he's as good as I could wish for, as well as the actor who did a great job. However, I did feel a little bit disappointed with so little Vader. He has an AWESOME scene near the end that totally gave me goosebumps and it's the scene that I'll watch time and time again, but I wanted more from him.<br/><br/>The first act doesn't flow really well since there needs to be an introduction to all the characters and to all the places they are, which slows down the pacing. Jumping from place to place usually doesn't work, but it didn't last that long.<br/><br/>Don't worry, I really enjoyed this film and I think it's a great one! The visual effects are the best I've seen in the whole franchise, with action sequences unbelievably awesome. The space battle is as entertaining as one can imagine and the CGI incorporated in the film is near perfection.<br/><br/>I loved how they made this movie different from the others. The score is slightly different (great job, Michael Giacchino), the tone is also different: it's a time of war, the Stormtroopers are not as white- clean as before, not all of the Rebels are ""good"" and there are a lot of people injured from the battles and constant attacks on the cities. After the first act, the pacing picks up and I'm in a fast, entertaining movie with great performances and characters.<br/><br/>It's true that I didn't care that much about the characters by the end, but they're still entertaining. K-2So is super funny and I liked him very much, the friendship between Baze and Chirrut is compelling and funny as well, Andor and Jyn have the most serious parts and they're interesting and charming. All of the performances are good with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna having really great moments. Krennic is a good villain and Vader is awesome in every scene he's in (which are not that many).<br/><br/>My main praise for this anthology film is something that I can't really explain, but Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope just got its decade- long complaint solved in the most amazing way possible. So many memes and gags around this one thing just got completely deleted from history ... Thank you! This is a movie that stands on its one, it can't really be compared with the others since it's so unique and I can't express myself through words how pleased I am with Gareth Edwards' work. Great job directing this film, amazing action scenes, either with ground combat and space battles, and a breathtaking last act.<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is an action-packed film, with amazing visuals, great humor and funny characters. It does have some problems, it's not perfect, but it's not a bad movie at all. With my major issue being the lack of character's depth, this movie actually gives an entertaining two-hour runtime and a great time at the theater.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

","I really didn't know that to think going in. I really had no idea what the movie was even about so I went in with little in the way of preconceived notions.<br/><br/>Rogue One is not quite the fanboy orgy that Force Awakens was. Though it is there you just have to look a little closer. The beginning is very jumbled and a bit clunky. Not a deal breaker though. The ending in my mind has the greater sin in trying really too hard to tie hen into A New Hope. So forcibly is it tied in that it renders part of the start of A New Hope into contradiction.<br/><br/>The characters are good but nothing really to make you feel all that much for any of them.I really wanted to like them but nothing.<br/><br/>Really this film I would say is on par with Revenge of the Sith so a middle of the road film that does it's job but won't really be remembered. Heck it doesn't even get a number. Though considering that that number would be 0 I suppose I can get why they went this way."

Rogue One is the first spin-off film and a bolder film then The Force Awakens which was a repeat of A New Hope.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) saw her father (Mads Mikkelsen) being captured by the Empire and mother killed. 15 years later she had become a criminal with no allegiances until the Rebels free her so she can do a mission for them, meet a rebel extremist and Jyn's former guardian, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whittaker) who has vital intelligence about the Empire's new weapon.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a direct prequel to A New Hope, tying into the events of the first film and the writers, director and producers pulled off a marvellous trick, making something fresh and original, expand the universe for people who only the on screen version of Star Wars and tell a story that people know the outcome to. Director Gareth Edwards perfectly recaptures the look of the original trilogy in its set-design and costumes and puts his own directional stamp on the series. Rogue One takes away the famous opening crawl and trademarks like the screen swipes: it was a risk and it paid off.<br/><br/>Rogue One was what the prequel trilogy should have been - it was a darker tone like the prequels were meant to be and there is a clear emphasis on the 'Wars' part of the Star Wars title. It told a story where audience members knew the outcome to but still felt unique and not a carbon copy of other Star Wars film plots. It is an original story that is cleverly tied to A New Hope thanks to the screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy. The film also expands the mythology and science in the universe without being complete stupid i.e. midichlorians. Rogue One showed more of the culture and religion of the Jedis, with the Empire raiding their temples.<br/><br/>Another risk of prequels is that they could be seen nothing but fan service. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them were examples of being films obsessed with fan services and references for the sake of it. Rogue One had references to the series as a whole, some are recurring lines that are said in all the films, references that are tired into the wider series, like a certain Jedi and a few little nods for the fans. They are not forced and some even have a dramatic purpose.<br/><br/>Rogue One also marks the first time a live-action Star Wars film has been composed by someone other than John Williams: Michael Giacchino. Giacchino is one of the most celebrated composers around, working on films like the Mission: Impossible series, the rebooted Star Trek films and many Pixar films and he was able to recreate Williams' sound - it could easily work within the other Star Wars films.<br/><br/>The Star War series is a brand that supersedes any big name actors and Rogue One cast a collection of actors on the edge of hitting the big time, respected character actors and genre actors. Jones was cast after she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in The Theory of Everything and along with her roles in Inferno and A Monster Calls she had a terrific year. She was convincing in the action scenes and being the jaded young woman who isn't that interested in the rebellion but deep down got a good heart. One of her biggest moments was when she sees a message her father left for the resistance and sees him for the first time in 15 years. She was overwhelmed just by a hologram.<br/><br/>The big stand out performance was Alan Tudyk as a reprogrammed droid K2-SO. He had a dry, sarcastic delivery that was sometimes pessimistic and always bitting. Tudyk sounded similar to Anthony Daniels and his character came across as a more confident version of 3-CPO. Despite his pessimism K2-SO was loyal to Cassian Andor and was quite the badass in battle.<br/><br/>One of the biggest controversies about the film was using technology to bring Peter Cushing back from the dead - some commentators have said it was in poor taste despite his family allowing the film to use his likeness and the effect is seamless. The use of Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin was used sparingly. Whilst the film could have used a new character but it does add to a sense of continuity in the series, as well Jimmy Smits to reprising his role as Bail Organa from the prequels.<br/><br/>There were rumours that Rogue One was a troubled production - it was reported that there was a large amount of reshoots and that director Edwards was kicked off the project. If any of these rumours are true it doesn't show in the final product. Edwards is establishing himself to be one of the best sci-fi directors around, having already made Monsters and Godzilla and easily one of the best special effects directors around. He was able recreate the look and feel of the original trilogy and but his own stamp on the series, making a darker war film that uses some WWII iconography. The final battle can easily go down as one of the best in the whole franchise.<br/><br/>Whilst Rogue One had a great opening and closing act it was in the middle were the film suffered from a saggy middle. The film was just stalling to extend its runtime and try and add some extra emotional drama.<br/><br/>Rogue One works both as a sci-fi fantasy action for casual moviegoers and as an extension to the Star Wars series, showing that the films can move beyond the Skywalkers and Solos. It was truly an epic space opera."
"midas-jacobs","9","2","8","25 December 2016"," ""Rogue One"" is lacking in characters but succeeds in a lot of the rest!
","""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is about a group of Rebels, who are trying to steal the plans of the Death Star.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards was an excellent choice for directing. He really nailed to make a ""war"" movie, which is dark and gritty, yet manages to stay pg-13 and has no desire to be rated R. He is a director who has a knowledge of scale and he shows it. During the battle sequences we see everything from the ground up: from the perspective of the protagonists. Due to this you feel more involved with the characters and the enemy also looks more imposing and scary. Edwards also used shadow in a nice why, by which he created some good looking shots. He didn't only use it to create a nice shot, but he also used it in a creative manner, by only filming the shadow. An example is the first time we see Darth Vader. He films the wall next to Krennic, so the shadow of Darth looks very big next to the small Krennic. Again, to show that Darth Vader is very dangerous and stands above all. It gives cool shots with a meaning to them. That whole scene was amazing, actually. The action scenes he handled well too. Sometimes I found these to be quickly edited, but these were mostly in the beginning of the movie. He also exchanged hand-held camera with some form of steady cam, which really worked well when Chirrut defeated the group of Stormtroopers. That and the choreography made the scene good. The last act was absolutely fantastic: I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. During that act they also used some left over scenes from the original trilogy of pilots in X-wings. It was notable, but I found it to be a cool extra.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was not made by John Williams, which is pretty surprising, because he had composed the score of I believe, all the other Star Wars movies. The new composer, Michael Giacchino, did a very good job. He re-used some of Williams's work, but changed them a bit. He managed to create an original score, which had a Star Wars-feel to it, which I very much liked. The special effects were some of the best that I have seen this year. This really helped with the action scenes and also with the use of the laser shot from Death Star. They were able to portray the destruction very well. Gran Moff Tarkin looked very good. First I didn't even notice that he was CG, but at some points you were able to see that he kind of looked like a video-game character.<br/><br/>The acting too was good. Felicity Jones played a strong female protagonist, where she showed her emotions really well. She sometimes acted a bit flat, but most of the times I liked her very much. But that flat acting was maybe to show the wall that Jyn has built up, so people can't see how she feels, and I believe that this was their goal. Diego Luna I really liked. He performed well in all of the scenes. He did have good charisma. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang were both very good. They had good chemistry and it felt like they went back a long time. The antagonist, played by Ben Mendelsohn, was very good. He was menacing and fitted his role very well. The last thing I want to mention here is the character of Darth Vader. A lot of people said that he was underutilized, but I didn't think that that was true. He had good scenes and lines and also one of my favorite scenes of the movie. The scene where he plows through rebels like it's nothing. That scene was really awesome to look at. <br/><br/>The writing was good. The story was one that should've been told and it was strong on that aspect. I didn't find the story boring or lacking. What I did find a bit dull was that the character of Jyn was the only one who really was developed. From Diego Luna's character we only get one scene, in which we learn something about him, and that scene worked for me. In the beginning we also see that he is a rebel, but someone who doesn't go by as a ""good-guy"", because he shoots someone in the back. Now my problem doesn't lie with these two characters, but with the rest of them. They were not given anything, except for some emotionless exposition. The pilot, played by Riz Ahmed, got brainwashed, but just after a few scenes he was OK, even though Gerrera said that he would go insane. It didn't make any sense and would've been some character development. Due to the lack of rounded characters the ending didn't really emote me, whereby the death of them all was kind of useless. The acting was the thing that kind of saved this, because due to the acting I felt like they did have a character build around them. The dialogue had some good lines and was funny at times. Most of these comedic moments were given to K-2SO, which was by the way a fun character, just introduced by a lot of exposition. And that's all we get to know from him. Alan Tudyk did a good job at voice acting. The ending was very good and tied in with ""A New Hope"" well. Again they used CGI in that scene for the face of Leia, but I also think that that looked good. <br/><br/>In the end ""Rogue One"" was a very good Star Wars movie, whose story is one that had to be told. The ending was a nice conclusion. The characters were lacking, but the directing I found to be very good. The CGI, just like all of the shots, were good-looking and the acting was great. That's why ""Rogue One"" gets a 8.6/10."
"knight_ca","9","2","8","24 December 2016"," A great addition to the Star Wars universe
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story marks the first spin-off movie in the ever-popular franchise and tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance obtained the plans to the first Death Star. For those that wondered if Disney ramping up the production of Star Wars movies would lead to saturation, Rogue One may go some way to allaying those fears because it's a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>A Force Awakens, whatever you may think of it, was criticised by some for its lack of originality. Could Star Wars under Disney really deliver anything new? With Rogue One, that's a resounding yes. Unless you haven't seen A New Hope (those poor few), the ending of the movie is already determined, but this isn't about whether they did it or not but rather how they did it. <br/><br/>Rogue One marks its departure from the canon movies by removing the traditional rolling yellow introduction text and instead just goes straight into the story. This fanboy was momentarily shocked by that but it befits the tone of a spin-off story. We are given a whole new cast of characters (okay, there are a few cameos to watch out for, some minor, some not) and they manage to bear the mantle of a Star Wars story well. There are a couple of famous faces such as Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen but it's really Felicity Jones as Jyn and Diego Luna as Cassian that carry the movie. All the performances are worthy of praise even if Jyn is a little similar in character to Rey from The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>The inner workings of the Rebel Alliance are shown in more detail than ever before and we get to show how fractious an alliance it really is. There is a palpable feeling of despair as the creation of the Death Star is concluded and how this small band can possibly hope to stand against the might of the Empire. Seeing the immense Death Star appearing over the horizon is a genuinely chilling sight and the impending doom it will bring. <br/><br/>Rogue One succeeds in broadening the Star Wars universe and shows that George Lucas' universe is a rich place indeed and it's fascinating to see the events between episodes III and IV on the big screen. Rogue One manages to dish out its fair dose of suspense but seems perfectly timed at just over 2 hours long. There are no lulls and being a Star Wars movie, there is the usual dose of space battles. There are some innovative tactics by the rebels that will elicit genuine smiles but no spoilers here of course. <br/><br/>Rogue One puts the new Star Wars movies back on track and shows that maybe the franchise is safe in Disney's hands after all. Here's hoping that Episode VIII (scheduled for 2017) will take a few lessons from Rogue One. Keep this up and we Star Wars fans will be a happy bunch."

Next open your eyes to a new Star Wars world and a fresh beginning. Imagine there is a movie screen in this new Star world and Rogue One is the picture that is playing on a 24-hour cycle.<br/><br/>I had no idea that Rogue One was coming and it was so unexpectedly beautiful. I was imagining the same story line plus a new villain perhaps and contributory cast of 3 or 4 new faces. Wrong. So much more.<br/><br/>The movie was so entirely separate from what you might've expected that you might not even wonder if this were the same story arc, but it is, rest assured you freaks. <br/><br/>While the story line and characters introduced are exceptionally unique there are still the familiar bugaboos of Star Wars past. You still have your fleet battles you still have your monsters of incongruous proportions. It is everything you love about Star Wars and more and more.<br/><br/>The plot of Rogue One follows an original story arc in the Star Wars bible that has been added to and edited for the past 40 years.<br/><br/>You're going to appreciate this movie. One hundo p, guarantee."
"RNMorton","9","2","8","17 December 2016"," Caution - This is Not Star Wars 8
","Walking in I was assuming this was Star Wars 8. It is not. It is actually an independent story based upon one off-handed line delivered a long time ago in a movie theater far far away. I'm so daft that it wasn't until my 11 year old enlightened me going out of the theater that it all fell into place. The Rebel Alliance is afraid to oppose the Empire with its new rumored planet killer. In to the mix steps Jyn Erso, daughter of the unwilling weapons designer for the Empire. The Alliance receives information about a potential weakness in the planet killer, and Erso and Cassian on their own initiative set out to obtain its structural plans. They are assisted by, among others, a blind fighter and his friend, ably played by Yen and Jiang. Their primary foe is Director Krennic, the latest in a line of weasel Empire leaders. As it was I was sort of wondering throughout how this all fit in with the series, I kept seeing strangely familiar faces unexpectedly. <br/><br/>Jones and Luna are the real deal in their starring roles, the CGI is quite fine and not herky-jerky, the running time was good and the story just kept moving. There are a lot of worlds presented, all in their visual glory. For those who like hanging at the beach the last world is the best of all, although there isn't a lot of sun-bathing going on when we see it. Highly recommended, I might have given it a 10 if I had known exactly what this was about in the big picture, but I think the uncertainty of that was supposed to be part of the fun."
"jakeandelwood","9","2","8","17 December 2016"," Nearly 40 years after Star Wars there finally is the prequel
","Although the movie is more of a war drama than a space adventure, it manages to give you that Star Wars feeling that the prequel trilogy failed to do. Sure those prequels shared the well known characters but it lacked everything that is Star Wars. Rogue One, surprisingly, managed to pull you in the Star Wars universe with a completely different story and characters.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give anything away but the people who hated the Force Awakens, for being a copy of the original trilogy, will enjoy what this movie has to offer. But also the people that loved the Force Awakens will enjoy this one because this movie connects to the original trilogy as much as TFA did. With the right cameo's, the right nods but especially because of the balance between 'the old Star Wars' and the new imagination of the creative teams behind this movie.<br/><br/>To me Rogue One has overcome everything that the prequel trilogy wanted to offer. And in a way gives us more answers than the prequel trilogy did. Who would have thought that Disney would rescue Star Wars? But with TFA and now Rogue One they seem to understand this universe better than it's creator George Lucas.<br/><br/>When Disney anounced they were going to release a Star Wars story each year, I was very sceptic. But after Rogue One I must admit that I can hardly wait for the Han Solo movie. The Star Wars Universe has just expanded in a very very good way."
"Dragonsouls","8","2","8","15 December 2016"," A Star Wars dream come true.
","I rated this film an 8/10, the same rating I gave The Force Awakens, but for different reasons. Rogue One felt more in line with the George Lucas look and tone, and this film served the fans, despite being thin on plot;--it sure was heavy on nostalgia.<br/><br/>The first thing that surprised me was just how beautiful and visual this film was. Gareth Edwards is a master of smoke, silhouettes, shadows and action and is a far better visual director than JJ Abrams is. I also thought the pacing of the film was superb, and even though we knew that the rebel alliance would emerge victorious at the end, some of the scenes at the end were very tense! One of the things I hated about The Force Awakens was the musical score. Rogue One's score was pure John Williams. This was a movie that serves the fans. And as a 39 year old Star Wars fan, the darker tone of this film was welcomed.<br/><br/>I felt like I was watching a WW2 film with a Star Wars skin. It was pretty brutal at times, minus the blood, especially the ground battles, which were so well choreographed. On the topic of action, Rogue One is Space Opera at its finest. I'm not usually the one for CGI heavy films, but the CGI in Rogue One was so spectacular and well choreographed, that I couldn't possibly complain. This is Industrial Light and Magic's magnum opus! Before I get to the negatives of the film, I'll just say that this film did one thing to me that The Force Awakens did not and that was, bring me to tears. When I saw Darth Vadar at the end do some things, bloody things, I just lost it. <br/><br/>I'd rate Rogue One even higher if it wasn't for its thin lot. What the Force Awakens had was a unique, conflicted villain, central characters and a story that raised many questions. But in a sense, those strengths were also the film's weakness because unlike Rogue One, the Force Awakens didn't really leave you with a satisfying ending. Rogue One left me satisfied as the end credits rolled because it had a beginning, middle and end. I just wished it had stronger characterizations.<br/><br/>My final word is this;-- I hope Gareth Edwards directs more Star Wars films in the future! Period."
"sHabbadooo","8","2","8","14 December 2016"," Puts the war in Star Wars
","Firstly, this movie is very enjoyable. I wouldn't say it's a great movie because the story and characters are second to the action. The story is as follows, get the Death Star plans. That's it. It's a prequel so we all know how that turns out, but the ride is very enjoyable. <br/><br/>The first 1/3 of the film is the worst. It's a lot of new characters jammed in to a very small section. It's rushed, the characters remain underdeveloped and it ultimately is pointless. There's a lot of switching between story lines and planets that detracts from what's going on. One minute they're on Jedha, the next they're on Yavin IV, the next some prison planet, some rain planet, a floating asteroid city... they could have cut the prison planet out entirely, they could have cut the asteroid city out entirely and it still would have been the same movie. Forrest Whittaker's Saw Gerrera didn't need to be in the film, none of his scenes are important. They could have given his storyline to the blind guy (names are weird, complicated and easily forgettable in this film). We see some good action from the rebels in the cramped city streets, we see the Death Star, it's good! We also see CGI Tarkin, it's not good! Don't know why he was included, really distracting and detracts from the good Krennic scenes. <br/><br/>The second 1/3 is better, we get K2SO more, he's the toy every kid (and adult sized kids) will want. We're not jumping from planet to planet as much. We get some great TIE vs X- wing battles. Not much in the way of character development but it wasn't detrimental to the story. We do get the Rogue 1 team together for the first time. We see Vader, it's very good! All in all, very solid middle section sets up the finale. <br/><br/>The final 1/3 is FANTASTIC! It's everything about Star Wars that's great. Stormtroopers, AT-ATs, X-Wings, Y-Wings, the new U-Wings, TIE fighters, Star Destroyers, Mon Calamari fleet, the Death Star. THIS PUTS THE WAR IN STAR WARS! It's fantastically brutal, it's frenetic, it's BRILLIANT!!!!! We see Vader on a tear up. We see CGI Leia which is v.good. This saves what would have been a pretty mediocre film. <br/><br/>Pros: Scarif, K2SO. blind guy and his mate, VADER<br/><br/>Cons: CGI Tarkin, Too many planets, poor character development, pointless scenes, CGI Tarkin, Not enough Scarif, CGI Tarkin."
"trhliao","Null","3","15","13 May 2017"," One of the worst movies I saw in 2016
","I'm shocked that people thought of Rogue One so positively, in general. I almost never want to leave the theater when watching a film, but I wanted to leave for this one. It was such a boring, annoying mess. It was painful to watch. <br/><br/>Like so many other sci-fi/fantasy films lately, Rogue One gets bogged down in boring, ugly scenes that are hard to focus on. IT LACKS HEART AND SOUL. Whoever the filmmakers are - their tastes definitely don't match mine. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones was one of the worst things about the film. Stars of films are important, obviously, because you see them in most scenes, and they carry the film. She was fine in Theory of Everything - I felt for her, and her relationship with Stephen Hawkings. She was far better- looking than the actual Hawkings wife, though. But in Rogue One, Jones had none of the heart and acting chops she showed in Theory of Everything. Maybe being a rogue action heroine isn't her forte. Like others have mentioned, she had the same expression throughout Rogue One, and she totally lacked charisma. <br/><br/>Also, 2016 was the year of dumb filmmakers trying to appeal to women/girls by having a female lead that supposedly kicked ass. Very patronizing and unnecessary. Title IX happened long ago, and girls have been kicking ass forever. Filmmakers don't need to pretend to know what women like/want to see in a film. Felicity Jones was a failure as an action heroine in Rogue One. She took it all too seriously. If she relaxed more, she would've been more appealing, and would've carried the film better. <br/><br/>The love interest buildup between her and the Diego Luna character seemed superficial and forced. They didn't have a lot of chemistry in the film. In an ending beach scene, you just didn't feel for them. Throughout the film, it seemed like Luna liked her - I could see that in his eyes and facial expression. She didn't care much for him, though. It makes sense, though, because she is extremely attractive, while Luna looks merely scrappy-cute in his beard and vegan-like shriveled build. Usually charisma is linked with attractiveness, so I don't know how Felicity Jones screwed it up by being extremely attractive, but totally uncharismatic and unlikeable. <br/><br/>All these articles online talked in a very condescending way about how two Chinese actors were randomly thrown in the film to appeal to viewers in China. It's as if Chinese people and China were some inferior mass that you just look down on and talk down to. The most interesting thing about the film, to me, was the inclusion of the two Chinese actors, one from the North (Jiang Wen), and one from HK (Donny Yen). It's opened my eyes to two actors previously unknown to me, and it's piqued my interest in Chinese actors and Chinese cinema in general. <br/><br/>Online, there's been speculation about a homo-erotic undertone between the two Chinese characters. I don't think there's such thing, but people can dream. It seemed they were just close and loving friends in the film. I thought it was a bit silly that they threw the two Chinese actors in most scenes together. It's how people all think that all Asians like to band together, disgusting things that they are. In fact, Jiang Wen (Baze Malbus) was married to a French lady and has a hapa daughter. All Asians don't necessarily love and jive with each other, so there's no need to make the two Chinese actors best buddies in the movie and to throw them together in every scene. It's a stereotype that Asians enjoy clustering among themselves, and you can see stereotypes played out in so many American films. <br/><br/>Overall, this film sucked. But like all films, it says a lot about American/Western culture, stereotypes, preferences, and zeitgeist. It reflects the trends and preferences of the time."

"generationofswine","10","2","9","13 November 2017"," An Honest Review
","So, there seems to be two main points that the real haters are focusing on.<br/><br/>1) Fanfiction 2) SJW propaganda.<br/><br/>Now, I do believe these are both reactions to, well, The Force Awakens. The first just being a hatred for Rey, who was a Mary Sue and one that gave the entire movie a fanfiction feel.<br/><br/>And where that is true for The Force Awakens, its not Rogue One, at least it is not Rogue One if we are staying in the Star Wars universe...it COULD be fanfiction if someone warped Saving Private Ryan into the Star Wars universe and...yeah, not, It's not fan fiction.<br/><br/>The Second point, the SJW one, well, that could honestly also be a backlash against The Force Awakens as, yeah, anyone that called Rey a Mary Sue was accused of being a misogynist for, well...reasons.<br/><br/>Specifically for reasons that had NOTHING to do with why they didn't like Rey--at least why most people didn't like her...most.<br/><br/>And, in Rogue One, if the cast is multi-cultural of ominous political agenda reasons...it doesn't really feel that way. The diversity works and it works because you don't really notice it unless people point it out to complain about it..<br/><br/>...and the people that do, yeah, it is likely because of The Force Awakens and they are forgetting that this takes place in a Galaxy Far, Far Away and, well, by definition they are all aliens anyway, so, you know, trying to force diversity in a movie entirely comprised of according to Hoyle aliens...wouldn't that mean a LOT more alien looking aliens? So, a lot of that is lingering from The Force Awakens and, well, some of it is understandable, if not for the movie itself than because of the backlash against people that thought Rey was entirely too perfect.<br/><br/>Another reason for that hate could be a lack of lightsaber battles and, I really feel the fanboys on this one...but, no, really this was a Star Wars movie that felt like a war movie and the lack of blatant force powers and lightsabers until the very end worked...<br/><br/>In fact it worked so well you did kind of get a Saving Private Ryan feel off the movie, a lone rogue squad taking on the entire Nazi?...Sith?...the entire Intergalactic Empire.<br/><br/>It was really fun to watch and, not sense the Evacuation at Dunkirk that was the planet Hoth, did we see a Star Wars ground battle that really looked like it was a war. So this was pretty cool.<br/><br/>And then there is Jyn. Now a lot of hate gores to her and I can't figure out why. She seemed like a real character. Rey could have been a feminist SJW transplant that was made super awesome because...reasons. But Jyn had serious flaws, she had issues, she seemed like a real person. So props to Felicity Jones for bringing that awesomeness to life.<br/><br/>No, seriously, props to her. Outside of Solo, I really don't think I've seen a Star Wars character I thought was that, well, cool, real, just fun in the way that you could point to her and say ""I could know someone like that."" There were other cool characters in the saga...but none as realistically portrayed. And that doesn't just go for Jones.<br/><br/>The only main character that doesn't seem like a real person was Chirrut Îmwe and, well, we can forgive him for that because he was the kung-fu movie awesome that helped make the movie not just a war movie in space. He was the guy that brought the Force into the film and made it a Star Wars flick...so, who really cares if he doesn't feel like a real person? I know I don't.<br/><br/>And the last bit of hate is because, well, it doesn't have any of the real main characters, no Solo, no Skywalker and...well...it IS a stand alone movie, so if you came in expecting them, well, that is your fault. Disney made it clear from the get-go.<br/><br/>What you have here is a cool science fiction war movie. It fits into the saga and it doesn't, but that isn't a bad thing--prequels, the Force Awakens--as only 3/7th of the saga movies are really any good.<br/><br/>And, as a war movie, it stands on its own. It is actually better than a LOT of the war movies people tout as masterpieces **cough** **Thin Red Line** **cough** So, watch it, you should have no complaints...<br/><br/>...unless you are complaining about the SJW, the Fanfiction, and the lack of Skywalker or Solo, and if you are, well, there is going to be no pleasing you no matter what you watch."

","Saw this movie tonight on German sky pay TV, expected an fx focused / headed prequel to the 1977 movie. The old movies where focused on the story, fx was a helper, not the focus, that changed in episode 1, clone wars and the sith movies, my opinion, they just closed the story line. Rogue One is the absolute revival of the old movies and a perfect prequel to the original 1977 movie. The story is the main focus and extremely intensive like the first movie and empire strikes back which are my all time favorites, saw both at that time more than once in a Buenos Aires cinema, and I'm adicted to science fiction since then. Fx just helped the story look better. This is why I also love Star Wars Rebels hoped this series would keep longer, 4th season is last and shorter than awaited. Back to Rogue One, I am really impressed, this one makes it to my all time favorites. I would have watched this one in a 3D cinema multiple times having my tonight's experience.<br/><br/>This one is best STAR WARS original tradition movie and this really impresses me, thought such thing would never come back on business regards, money makes the world go round, it seems Disney found a way to combine both, 1 billion gross box office 'til today (boxofficemojo.com) let me hope this tradition will become popular.<br/><br/>Best, not less, not more<br/><br/>Best regards<br/><br/>Ralf"

","At least a movie with the essence of the sequel which is the baptism of fire of Star Wars Saga. I mean The Empire can strike back because the source of their power almost is in their weapons and storm-troopers.<br/><br/>This is an interesting story to pay attention even if you have never watched any Star Wars sequel. If you are an Star Wars lover you would guess about the end of this.<br/><br/>There are many characters representing the heterogeneity of the Galaxy. But, there is any main character who is not human."

","After the epic failure in SW Episode Vii my expectations for this movie were quite poor, however I couldn't miss this film. The film is a success. Having a rather simple plot, it manages to sustain the true atmosphere of the universe, reviving the golden era of the Emprire and the rebels. Most characters are not as plain as they could be, with an inner conflict and doubts. And it fulfills the ""Good-SW-Movie"" checklist, there are: a nice female protagonist, a passionate leader, a space fleet battle, a blind almost-a-jedi, a self-sacrifice, an intelligent humorous droid and ofc a Darth Vader. As a bonus it contains some truly dramatic moments and a rather bitter ""happy end"". Definitely, worth to be watched!"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","2","9","28 December 2016"," Felicity Jones is The Force
","""Rogue One"" is exciting fun. Felicity Jones as hero Jyn Erso is a star. Director Gareth Edwards's movie is visually spectacular and action driven. Screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy tell the timeless story of courage and family. Edwards's ""Rogue One"" is a standalone movie occurring in the timeline before ""Star Wars: Episode IV"". As engaging as the movie is, what is the purpose of ""Rogue One""? In the story Jyn along with renegade Rebellion members seek the plans of the Death Star weapon in ""Star Wars"". Jyn is drawn to the mission to rescue her beloved father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen). Galen was the scientist, who created the Death Star. Darth Vader voiced by James Earl Jones makes an ominous kick ass presence. Jones and Donnie Yen as blind warrior monk Chirrut Imwe are charismatic and bold. <br/><br/>""Rogue One"" enlightens the coming events of ""Star Wars"". After watching the movie, I thought it missed the possible character evolution in terms of the Star Wars mythos. Jones, Yen, and Mikkelsen are captivating. I saw the movie in a Dolby Theater, and the battle with X-Wing and Tie-Wing fighters was amazing. In the end ""Rogue One"" leaves us wanting more to the story. It does not seem as consequential in the bigger picture.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" opens as Imperial Director Krennic (cold Ben Mendelson) apprehends Galen (Mikkelsen) to complete his work on the Death Star. Galen schemed for this inevitability. However, tragedy consumes. Krennic murders his wife. His daughter Jyn escapes and is raised by friend, Saw Gerrera (solid Forest Whitaker). Saw is an Imperial soldier turned Rebel. Jyn (Jones) grows into a powerful warrior.<br/><br/>The Resistance Rebels and Cassian (Diego Luna) recruit Jyn as part of a larger conspiracy. Galen sent a message to Jyn about the designed flaw in the Death Star. Jyn heads to planet Jeda in hopes of discovering the whereabouts of her Father. There she meets Chirrut (Yen), and others. Is Jyn is a savior or pawn in the conspiracy? <br/><br/>Felicity Jones is the force in ""Rogue One"". She is spunky and beautiful. She humanely embodies bravery and sadness as the hero in search of her father. Her relationship with Mikkelson's Galen is the touching core of the movie. World class martial artist Donnie Yen lends gravitas as Chirrut, who is a believer of The Force, but not a Jedi. Mendelson is good, but his Krennic is relatively evil light. That is punctuated with the appearance of Darth Vader himself. <br/><br/>Director Edwards seamlessly ties his story forward to the Star Wars saga. He does so with perhaps a few too many characters. Jones makes this the great hero story. ""Rogue One"" is amazing entertainment. Yet with the encompassing conclusion, you may be left wanting more."

","This is the Star Wars movie fans have wanted for a long time. Gareth Edwards took a risk in making this Star Wars different, and it really paid off. What we get here is an excellent war film set in the Star Wars universe. Rogue One focuses on the ordinary soldiers of the rebellion. It is more intense and suspenseful than any other Star Wars movie. The third act had me in awe at the spectacular cinematography, while making me nervous for the fate of our protagonists. The movie was also surprisingly dark for a Disney film, clearly catering for a more mature audience. Rogue One deserves to be seen on the big screen. Go see it now!"
"thesar-2","9","2","9","17 December 2016"," The One to Bring Back the Balance
","Man, my faith in the force has finally been restored. In the biggest way possible.<br/><br/>After four disappointing entries, Disney finally brought the balance back with the very best Star Wars movie since Empire. So we went from the second worst Star Wars movie in 2015 (if you count the Holiday Special as dead last) to the second best just one year later. <br/><br/>Rogue One, ""a Star Wars story,"" is something barely short of masterpiece filmmaking. Where the copycat The Force Awakens was *supposed* to feed off our nostalgia for the Star Wars universe by bringing back most of the original cast, it failed in creating new and interesting characters with depth, people we cared about and have unique personalities. Rogue One accomplished all that in the first fifteen minutes and by a landslide.<br/><br/>I cared about these (new to us) characters. I loved their lines, their chemistry amongst each other, their heart and complexity. While this is all good and I highly praise Rogue One for this, I am sad because this was supposed to be Episode VII's job since that one carries us into the future and this movie was a stand-alone leading right up to Episode IV: A New Hope.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is another prequel and it marks the fourth of eight Star Wars sagas (now excluding the Holiday Special) that has to do with the Death Star. But, damn, the story is rich, the visuals – including the incredible background shots – were absolutely amazing and it was the most original and heartfelt Star Wars movie to date. I even had to battle my own tears back towards the inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>On the simple side, the movie tells the tale of the rebels who fought to bring back the Death Star plans to the Rebellion so Princess Leia, R2D2, et al can exploit the Empire's first of three Death Stars. I knew this synopsis going in and I actually did have hopes after being so let down with The Force Awakens. I just had no idea how much more complex it would be thanks to the expanded and interesting story and characters.<br/><br/>I loved this movie from the first couple of minutes, and it just got progressively better and better. It also helped the humor was spot on and had me rolling. Especially from my now second favorite droid, K-2SO just under C-3PO. <br/><br/>Since A New Hope began the series as the fourth chapter in 1977, this might be also a good starting point for Star Wars virgins. You literally can begin here and lead yourself into the original classic. The only downfall, with the exception of The Empire Strikes Back, you see the highest quality and best shot film of the series upfront and while some other chapters are still very well made, they do whither in comparison. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: No spoilers, but one of the best plot points of this movie was that they explained the biggest plot hole from A New Hope, one that people have made fun of for generations. And they do it in great detail. Heck, it's practically the whole movie. Well done.<br/><br/>Here's my list from best Star Wars features to least:<br/><br/>1. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back 2. Rogue One 3. Episode IV: A New Hope 4. Episode VI: Return of the Jed-I 5. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith 6. Episode II: Attack of the Clones 7. Episode I: The Phantom Menace 8. Episode VII: The Force Awakens 9. The Holiday Special (are we back to counting this?)"

","Rogue One is extremely darker than Empire, the tone of Rogue was in the same line with Disney's The Black Hole, which that in itself was very bleak.<br/><br/>This was far superior to The Force Awakens, which was just a lazy rehash of ANH, and was a complete member berry of a movie, and took no risks whatsoever.<br/><br/>Rogue One had subtle fan service, but they connect to ANH, so when you rewatch ANH it has even more of an impact, especially with the minor characters like the fighter pilots attacking the Death Star.<br/><br/>Rogue One has literally destroyed the prequels, nobody will revisited those shitty prequel films ever again. Star Wars fans now have a true prequel to the original trilogy, that is intelligent, and doesn't insult the fans.<br/><br/>This is The Dirty Dozen in space."
"maxdbarr","9","2","9","16 December 2016"," A return to the classic Star Wars franchise, for the modern age
","Story: I'll tread carefully, but this is the first film since the original three that feels like a classic Star Wars film, but with a modern twist that is welcome. At its heart, it is a war film, and doesn't stray from that, staying true to the feel of the originals. The secret is that it's Empire vs. Rebels, like the originals always were and the last four didn't follow. The story itself may drag or be a little slow at moments, but when you need it to pay off, it pays off. It takes the risk you want and gives you what you want to see. There is fan service, but it is done right. <br/><br/>Performances: First off, points for getting a pretty diverse cast, with Diego Luna, Donnie Yen and Forest Whitaker among many others. Everyone does a great job, speaks to their characters and the story very well. Some of the acting may get a little corny at times, but that's what Star Wars always was, and we love it for that. <br/><br/>Craft: We're back to some of the classic tropes, though a couple are done away with, Gareth Edwards did a wonderful job giving a modern twist on the classic Star Wars look and feel. The effects are some of the better I've seen this year, with pretty seamless CG to real world integration, some of these shots look perfectly real, and the practical effects are great as well. New planets give us beautiful new environments that widen our understanding of this galaxy.<br/><br/>Entertainment Value: As I say, this is what the fans have been waiting for. This is a wild ride that keeps you in even when it slows down to explore some character. In the space of two hours, an enormous amount of information is put forward. They clean up some things that have been bothering people since the first film, and create new lore for us to obsess over, as well as bringing back people fans have been longing to see again. <br/><br/>Memorability: This may be the best since Empire Strikes Back. It's the first time in my lifetime I've felt that I saw a true Star Wars film in a theater, and that is magical. This is perfect for fans and casual viewers alike."
"tjsdomer2","10","2","9","16 December 2016"," Renewed Hope
","I wanted to wait a bit to review Rogue One: A Star Wars Story so as not to spoil anything (this review is largely spoiler free). There are so many thinks I loved about this movie, and as much as I liked The Force Awakens, that film played it safe. This one did not. Rogue One essentially corrects many of the complaints people have about the prequel trilogy, from the sappy dialogue, bogged down politics, tame action, moody Anakin, and Jar Jar Binks. While this film fits within the Star Wars canon chronology (think of Rogue One as Episode 3.5), a Star Wars initiate can easily view this as their first film and understand what is going on. As I mentioned earlier, Force Awakens fits the traditional Star Wars formula, so much so that it is essentially a reboot of A New Hope. Rogue One is a whole different animal. The female lead, compared to Force Awakens, seems to be less of a Mary Sue with a bit more depth. As good as Kylo Res may end up being in the sequel trilogy, Darth Vader is, well, Darth Vader. While the Force is strong with this film, it relies more on it's brute depiction of intergalactic war (it is called Star WARS after all). For those of you who appreciate the original film, Rogue One does an excellent job of referring to that film with subtle references and throwbacks that Star Wars nuts will love. A few other highlights include the droid K-2SO who along with The Force Awakens's BB-8 will sure to become a fan favorite. The film makes effective use of Darth Vader in true terrifying form, and sure made me want to pop in A New Hope when it ended. Rogue One sure exceeded my expectations and is the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back."
"BillSims28","8","2","9","15 December 2016"," Five-Word Review: Sufficiently Different, Enjoyable, Solid Film
","Kicking off the Star Wars universe's foray into spin-offs, Rogue One serves as an almost gritty tale of war and sacrifice, as some rogue members of the Rebel Alliance fight against the threat of the Empire's Death Star, by attempting to steal the plans and exploit its weaknesses. An ensemble cast scattered with familiar faces makes up the character list, with a couple of surprise appearances thrown in. <br/><br/>In fact the film is full of fan service and callbacks. What the film manages to do very well is combine the familiar self-referential Star-Wars-y elements with the new style and expanded world. The references and tie-ins don't become too much, either.<br/><br/>This is best exemplified by the much-anticipated appearance of Darth Vader, who is kept satisfyingly hidden for the most part, the dread surrounding him being slowly built up, and this allows the new cast to take centre stage. When he does show up, he steals the show, including one scene whose terrifying Vader portrayal ranks among the best imagery in the series so far. <br/><br/>Some other characters show up - Peter Cushing's CGI revival, though controversial to some, boasts some impressive visual work and eventually manages to overcome being initially jarring. It's worth it to see such a wonderfully villainous character come back to life, even if the character is perhaps utilised more than is necessary. <br/><br/>The best thing about Rogue One, though, is the style. Despite being burdened by the mammoth series with which it is associated, the film still manages to implement its own style, which is unlike any other film in its series, being close to gritty at times, and far more realistic. In spite of all the references and returning characters, it's not often like the other Star Wars films. <br/><br/>The colour palette is darker, the mood more sombre, the main character plot armour almost non-existent. Nor are there any magical wunderkinds upon whom the entire fate of the galaxy rests due to an ancient prophecy - just resourceful and determined people who are dedicated and good at what they do. <br/><br/>This doesn't make up for the disappointing one-dimension-ality of the majority of the characters. Felicity Jones does a stellar job as the lead, especially given some of the rather uninspired dialogue, whilst Alan Tudyk and Ben Mendelsohn (whose character is well set up as having ambition but no military mind) are rather good, but too many of the characters are not even memorable enough to remember their name, even taking into account cool traits such as the wise, blind old Force user played by Donnie Yen. <br/><br/>It's a bit of a shame given the talent of actors such as Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker (overacting like there's no tomorrow), and Mads Mikkelsen, but the film simply has too many characters to devote time to each, resulting in a rather disjointed final product, at least in the first third. <br/><br/>Though these flaws must be acknowledged, they do not detract too much from a film which is fundamentally enjoyable, and never bores. It zips from location to location and character to character, and remains fun, with an easily accessible and genuinely involving, intriguing plot. The ending also manages a near-perfect connection to Episode IV, with just the right amount of tie-in to not be overdone and also satisfy fans. In fact, it can be spliced almost seamlessly to the next chapter of the story and be coherent. <br/><br/>All in all, even though it can't quite match the pure thrills and initial excitement of The Force Awakens, it's ultimately probably a better film: less corporate and safe, at least somewhat, and hopefully indicative of the path these spin-off Star Wars films will take. With Rogue One's rather unique take on the war film, I am now eagerly anticipating the comedic possibilities of the Lord/Miller Han Solo film, purportedly close in style to a western. Beyond that, the possibilities are endless, as long as Disney allows its directors more freedom and autonomy to make their creative marks. <br/><br/>One of the better films in a lacklustre year, and definitely worth watching. 82/100"
"mrpicky","6","2","9","15 December 2016"," Thats better
","Gareth Edwards made a good side-story for the old Star Wars, explaining where did Leia get blueprints from. Don't get me wrong, it is still a rip off old movies, just not as blatant as The Force Awakens. We have Death Star again(third time!!!), yongling from desert planet, father-daughter conflict, new droid... facepalm. If Force Awakens was a soulless fake. Roge One was made with some love, you can feel it. It's not really dark, just more gloomy take on resistance struggle. There was no new stories, no interesting plot twist, but everything is just organic and in a natural flow. Good action sequences, some good jokes from droid, no brainless happy end. Now prepare your heads to be blown: there are no sword fights! Wow! What?! How did they make a rip-off from the Star Wars without sword fights, it's a mystery. Movie does not have the smallest smell of old Star Wars spirit, but it's OK. Lucas himself lost it long time ago. As people change! And masterpieces are more like giant coincidences from millions of inspirations, events, people on project and cultural scene of the period in general. So the best we can hope is new ideas or new take on old(and very simple) story. For now it's just a side-story. Guys please get some new ideas! You can't repeat the same thing over and over!"
"gricey_sandgrounder","8","2","9","15 December 2016"," Really puts the 'War' into Star Wars
","I have to admit the lack of the opening crawling text at the start was strange. But as soon as the film starts, you are already too busy being engrossed by whats happening on screen. Even though the outcome had massive implications, the story itself felt really small and contained. That was a really smart move, and it gave us time to concentrate on the characters and rather than trying and find anything that might link to the main saga. By the time the third act comes around, this films really puts the 'War' into Star Wars. It has such a strong finish that will make you punch in the air delight. It plays out like a war film really well throughout, and I think that was the perfect approach.<br/><br/>Also, it expands the Star Wars universe massively. We are transported to so many new places and meet countless new characters. That was really great to see, and that showed confidence in them not being afraid of being different from the main saga story.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards is at the helm for this one, and I must say he has done a great job. I really enjoyed his previous works 'Monsters' and 'Godzilla'. The gritty tone and general production design of it was spot on. Where the Force Awakens seem to lack in imagination, this has it in abundance.<br/><br/>His use of practical effects was really impressive, and managed to look really similar to the original trilogy. Edwards and his team also managed to merge in the visual effects will no flaws whatsoever. I can certainly see that getting an Oscar nomination. The camera positioning of heavy visual effects moments gave us real scale of the objects. That is something Edwards did really well in Godzilla, and it really shows here as well.<br/><br/>The performances are all great, Felicity Jones is a strong lead and is another memorable hero being added to the franchise. Her relationship with Diego Luna's character was solid and made their outcome really powerful. There were so many fantastic minor roles to speak of. Alan Tudyk pulled his role off well with some good comedic relief. Donnie Yen was terrifically bad-ass and quite possibly stole the show for me. Ben Mendelsohn was developed really well and became such a fascinating character to watch. Riz Ahmed continues to show how great of an actor he is becoming, and this film shows it. Forest Whitaker was really good for the short time he was on screen. Also Wen Jiang and Mads Mikkelsen did a solid job.<br/><br/>Lots of things to like from the technical side. The action is phenomenal, both on planets and in space. It is just like the action we have seen from the original trilogy. From the way it is paced, to the structure and execution of it. This film certainly feels more like it belongs with episodes IV, V and VI than anywhere else. The writing was really good. There was really meaningful dialogue moments that was vital in developing the characters......but only up to a point. There were some characters that we hardly knew about, and yet they were on screen for some time. Thankfully, it is a very minor problem as the script on the whole is very well constructed. The score by Michael Giacchino was pretty good. It is nowhere near as strong as John Williams' scores, as they seem to become a character in themselves. But Giacchino's is good enough to move the film along nicely.<br/><br/>While I have given it a lot of praise. I would like to be nit-picky for just a moment. While I am giving it a high rating, it won't get to the heights of any of the original trilogy films. The main reason for that is that first and second acts did have dips in its momentum. It wasn't strong throughout. It was only until the final act when I was fully engrossed with the film.<br/><br/>That being said, I think this film is a lot of fun and one of the most enjoyable films of the year. I can see some people going into this film thinking that it just going to be all nostalgia and the story won't have any impact as we all know how it ends. I feel confident that you will come out completely disagreeing with your past self. It is clear that the film-makers don't come into this with a safe approach. They really go for it and they make story engaging, well developed and it made the execution of it all really satisfying. The action is amazing, the characters were entertaining and it is one of the few blockbusters I have seen this year that I would rank as high as the awards contenders.<br/><br/>One huge positive is that it ties into A New Hope so so well. It teases stuff from the originals in such a way that was really clever in its execution. The references are there, but they never over- power the film or feel shoe-horned in. That for me shows trust in this story and that it engrosses the audience.<br/><br/>I must give a word of warning. While Star Wars has always appealed to peoples of all ages. I'm not so sure if young kids will get into this one as they did with The Force Awakens. There is a lot of war- esque action, and it is most certainly not light-hearted. It is clear that the general feel of it is more for adults. But I think older kids will be able to cope with it and truly appreciate it more than younger ones."

"deloudelouvain","7","1","3","6 April 2020"," From the five I watched thus far this one was the weaker one, still good though.
","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, it's now time for Rogue One. I read some reviewers stating this was one of the best one but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. It's still good enough for me though, just found the story confusing sometimes. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. The CGI's are better than in the earlier movies, what makes perfect sense as the technology is just better now. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the fifth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one tonight will be A New Hope in the hope the quality stays the same, looking forward to it."

"oneofthesilence","9","1","3","13 March 2020"," Easily the best of the Disney Era
","I always liked this movie since it came out in 2016. But for some reason, when I rewatched in August 2018 it really struck me. I just went from thinking that it was good to loving it. The movie itself doesn't do a great job setting up the characters on its own, but I've read some books surrounding this movie since that help flesh it out. A book called Rebel Rising which was all about Jyn, and a book called Catalyst which was all about Galen, both of which were pretty good. Especially Rebel Rising. So this time with the background knowledge, the movie was more effective.<br/><br/>Well now for the actual movie. All the technical aspects of the movie are fantastic. There is great action and visuals all throughout. I can only recall one or two scene where it felt at all fake. (Borgullet & the resurrected actors). All the backgrounds and all the planets felt real. And the Death Star effect was spectacular.<br/><br/>The characters, like I said before, are better with the books. I guess that is kinda lazy on the movie's part, but it doesn't bother me personally. The best character in this movie if you exclude any literary content I'd K2-SO. He's hilarious and his death was the only one that really made me sad the first time I watched it. The comedy in this movie is great and it's mostly thanks to K2.<br/><br/>And the movie has an interesting story to tell as well, and it answers probably the biggest question left by A New Hope. Pretty much all the details of getting the Death Star plans. For most of the movie, it's interesting to watch this plot unfold. It is a little slow at points unfortunately. Though it never makes the movie unbearably boring. Most of the characters deaths are effective as well. Although I could care less about Bodhi.<br/><br/>And finally. This movie probably has my favourite scene in all of Star Wars. The Darth Vader hallway scenes is just perfection. It gives me chills and I have a smile on my face every time I watch it.<br/><br/>This movie gets 92%"

Instead they flubbed an original story and served us fan service as damage control the rest of the way. If you have to see any Star Wars movie's watch a new hope, empire and this one right here.

","'Rogue One' is the best Disney Star Wars film, which is not a high accolade, and the best Star Wars franchise film since the original trilogy, which is a similarly low threshold sadly.<br/><br/>In its own right 'Rogue One' manages to tell a decent tale; plus show respect and sympathy to its originating source material and, as a vehicle for Disney, it manages to establish a reasonable start to Disney Lucasfilm's desire to produce self contained anthology spin off Star Wars films.<br/><br/>Built upon a foundation of such films as 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'The Magnificent 7' a random ragtag group of individualists pursue a common purpose for an almost common goal against the backdrop of a powerful military threat 'Rogue One' tells it's story straight and without too much originality. As it is attempting to justify its own newness as a Star Wars anthology film this is probably a reasonable restraint in narrative invention.<br/><br/>However there is a more involved level of treatment in the films themes, which focus on generational split, trust, manipulation, opposition of agendas and the experience of youth in an already established world created for them, by their elders, not by them. All these themes are played out via character traits, interactions and discoveries and under the pressure of the sprawl of an oppressive, destructive and hateful Empire pressurising every enmeshed characters realities.<br/><br/>As an anthology film 'Rogue One' is positioned as an unofficial prequel to 'A New Hope' which it respects in its iconography whilst expanding on in cannon: the idea that the oppression and extortion that the Galactic Empire functioned by had caused the Death Star itself to have deliberately had a design flaw worked into it as a personal rebellion by its Chief designer.<br/><br/>There are certain problems with the narrative delivery of 'Rogue One', the plot development and characters that prevent me from giving a higher rating however.<br/><br/>The plot is overactive and loses a lot of its focus with jumping left and right at every opportunity to the next world and set piece action routine.<br/><br/>There is an overall loss of direction for the actors and scenes as the film enters it's second half.<br/><br/>Too many supporting characters fail to be characterized in their own right but are instead given just one identifying feature/function; this may be due to the declining directing of the film, or the writing: simply put there are too many characters doing similar things to satisfactorily differentiate.<br/><br/>The juddering midpoint sequence of the film where the ""Rogue One"" team and mission forms up is not so well prefigured and is therefore uneasily established.<br/><br/>The level of contrivance needed to get a desperado team (Rogue One.) from within an over cautious rebellion at that juncture takes some accepting.<br/><br/>The climactic battle, happening in and around the imperial library has the sense of being designed for a computer game and not a film. It's echoing of infiltration on the Death Star in 'A New Hope' and the confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader in 'Empire' doesn't outweigh that it is utterly unbelievable as a developing story.<br/><br/>The space fleet battle around the planetary shield gates in orbit above the library is even more garbled. The entire shakedown of that battle suggests the imperial forces affording every opportunity to the rebels. Again like a computer game opponent.<br/><br/>I rate 6/10 for a Star Wars film that I prefer to any other made in the last 35 years. It honours it's sources and builds carefully upon the visuals and themes of the original trilogy. Whilst developing it's own comments about the damage done by tyranny and resistance via it's own characters. Larger problems with the film are balanced by these strong attributes."

Darth Vader, James Earl Jones reprising his voice role, chilling, Mustafar thrilling, Vader in his tank, the lava lake reservoir Citadel, the place where Obi Wan left him hacked and burned, but now the source of his spiritual strength, read Darth Vader comics by Charles Soule, issues 20-25, watch Star Wars Rebels and Clone War cartoons to learn about Mustafar and its link to the eternal, and lastly a mostly disregarded comic by an unpopular author called Darth Vader annual 2 that came out last year which is the prequel to this prequel it's the story of Darth Vader, director krennic, Governor Tarkin and Geonosis and how that all connects because an entire new world of Star Wars comes with Rogue One, that's how good this film is.
Felicity Jones is so good in this role the rest of the cast also terrific, the male lead from Mexico his accent is so thick that it made some of his lines unintelligible that's really my only flaw in the film and that we don't get more Vader and Tarkin.
The scenes on Jeddha, don't miss the Jedi mountains lying alk over Jeddha, the destructive power of the Death Star, that travels in hyperspace, the sacrifices on Scariff, terrible tragedy in Jyn's family all make this a true tearjerker and it's also an action adventure Thriller the Space Battles the battle with the planets force field on Scariff, all of this is just A+ material and it's much better than the last Jedi, The Last Jedi and even Solo, neither are as good as this film, this film becomes Maybe the second best Star Wars movie after Empire Strikes Back although I love the prequels I think they get a lot of bad press just because people who don't know anything about Star Wars shoot off their mouths remember the prequels are really George Lucas's Opus where he lays out the real Canon of Star Wars.
The final 20 minutes of the movie when you realize things aren't going well and the final scene with Darth Vader might be one of the best scenes in Star Wars history the fear the awesome power of the force used by Darth Vader against those troops and the clever use of actual footage of Carrie Fisher at the very end, it's a real tear-jerker and now we know exactly what the crawl in episode 4 is all about when you read the crawl in a New Hope they're describing this film you always took it for granted that somebody showed up with the plans for the Death Star, Rogue One a Star Wars Story finally tells us exactly how we got those plans and what terrible cost.

","Rogue One is the emotional equal of The Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows anything about screenwriting knows, or ought to know, that the bottom line when attempting to judge whether a movie is good or bad, is ""Were you moved by it emotionally?"" <br/><br/>Depending on the genre of movie, the viewer will be moved to different emotions. But the viewer will be moved to the emotions intended by the writer and director. The emotion will not be bafflement resulting from confusion.<br/><br/>Rogue One puts the war in Star Wars. It is more of a war movie than a ""space opera"". The tone is unusually dark for a Star Wars movie. Think ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Hacksaw Ridge"" for example. It includes one of the most spectacular climactic battle sequences in recent memory. <br/><br/>Rogue One is the equal of the best Star Wars movie to date, The Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps even better. Rogue One spared none of the protagonists. It sacrificed every one of them to the rebellion. It is hard to put into words the pathos that evokes, which paradoxically makes Jyn Erso and her fellow rebels even more heroic and more unforgettable than major characters such as Leia Organa. <br/><br/>That some viewers have harshly panned the film utterly baffles me."

","First my thoughts on the haters, if you read crap on this movie they either never liked anything about Star Wars or they aren't going to be satisfied by any new Star Wars project. Craping on Rogue One or Force Awakens is something that makes sh*t heads feel good. The fact is Rogue One was the perfect start to the Star Wars anthology series and the darkest and most adult Star Wars tail by a wide margin. It you have watch the original many time like even the mildest fans have, you will have a pretty good idea about how this is going to end but the well told story and character development will make you care about what happens to the team that sent the Death Star plans to the rebellion. If the Han Solo and Boba Fettmovies are half as good then the anthologies will do well."
"Icedooitle","8","1","3","16 April 2017"," Episode 3.9
","Rogue One has finally accomplished something that I might not have known was possible, Retro-Science-Fiction. Fads like steam-punk may be a stylized play on outdated technology, but Rogue One is something special. With prequals like The Phantom Menace and Prometheus, they are made after their source material but it's hard to believe they take place prior. Try as they might, filmmakers can't help themselves, they gloss up the production value and inert updated technology that undermines the story that should be taking place in the past. Rogue One fits like a forgotten puzzle piece to the Star Wars Universe, a veritable Episode 3.5. Everything down to the knobs on the control panels fit into the ""New Hope"" aesthetic. And with how the story hugs so satisfyingly closely to Episode IV, it might be more appropriate to think of it at Episode 3.9.<br/><br/>The story of Rogue One is mentioned without many specifics in Episode IV. Once by the roundtable heads of the Empire and also by the rebel base, referring to a great sacrifice made to obtain plans for a weapon of unimaginable scale. Rogue One takes our intimate knowledge of the original trilogy and monopolizes on it, sometimes shamelessly. Fans will never forget the look on Leia's face when Alderaan is destroyed with a single blow, followed by Ben's philosophical understanding ""Millions of voices cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced."" We know the deadly potential of this machine, Rogue One counts on it. The movie doesn't earn the audience's investment in the story so much as throw fuel onto a fire that hasn't been snuffed in 40 years. When an Imperial Engineer named Gelen Erso is forced out of hiding to build the moon-sized weapon, we will the story to throw anything familiar at us. Rogue One has almost nothing new up its sleeve, its greatest strength.<br/><br/>The daughter of Erso is Jyn (Felicity Jones), a rebel to both the Empire and Rebel Alliance. One of the beauties of Rogue One is how it doesn't paint a hard line between the Empire and Rebels as good guy/bad guy. The Empire has made the galaxy too desperate. Our idea of the Rebel Alliance from Episodes 4-6 may come across as endearingly rag-tag, but Rogue One presents them as a nearly lost cause with dark characters we begrudgingly accept. The rebels take what they can get, and some vibrant pseudo-heroes make up the bulk of Rebel Fighters. Cassian (Diego Luna) fits these criteria. We first see him painted into a corner by Storm Troopers, how he escapes can't be called ""honorable."" Jyn has reasons to hate the empire, but the methods of the Rebels don't act as a lightning-rod for moral unity.<br/><br/>Jyn is much like Leia, beautiful but not ""gifted"" with abilities. Her heroics stem more from a firm heart than a midichlorian count. She is not taken into the rebel base because of skill, but because of heredity. Erso is the head engineer in the Death Star project, and a glimmer of hope comes when Jyn reveals his allegiance is not one of morals but desperation. He is playing a dangerous game of wits, in the heart of the lion's den. Erso's counterpart is a sinister rebel, Saw Gerrera (Forrest Whitaker), who shows what will become of a man who opposes the Empire physically. Decades of fighting have left him more machine than man. There is the obligatory wise-cracking robot, but Rogue One is far and away the darkest chapter in the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>I mentioned that the film can be shameless in its monopolization of our knowledge of Star Wars. This allows for clever bits of dialogue and references that will make you nudge the person next to you. Things go a bit too far when CGI characters like the bullies from the Tatooine Cantina show up and disappear for no other reason than familiarity. However, for every scene like this there a dozen that respect the viewer and hone the edges of the story to fit into the saga seamlessly. Liberties are taken with cinematography and art but never story. If The Force Awakens was an enjoyable addition to the series, Rogue One is invaluable excavation of the holy trilogy, giving everything deeper meaning."
"henrik_piano","9","1","3","8 April 2017"," Sheer joy except for two small details
","Gareth Edwards did everything right. Rogue one is better than most recent biddings; a lot in many ways. This being despite the fact Rogue One doesn't have the benefit of the old characters or the Falcon. To begin with it has a story fitting more into the original saga and not borrowing from other episodes. There are more than a few nods to ep 4-6 and in particular ep 4 since it's ending more or less where A new hope begins. Second, Gareth has continued Abrams ambition of making special effects look real. Of course they use cgi but he really wanted to shoot on location etc. The result is everything I liked about A new hope but way better. As for the characters they are pretty much spot on. Even more so compared to ""Force"". The actors in TFA did an goodt job but the ones here seem more real or logical. Now, the only two things I can think of are these: Removing the classical intro with the crawling text is a bit like removing the barrel shot from James Bond. It's really a small thing but I feel it´s essential. And why for Gods sake did they alter the masterpiece by John Williams? I mean REALLY?? Why not ad Metallica-ish guitars to Beethoven?? If it hadn't been for those two the movie would have been a 10/10."

It seemed like they only did one-take for every scene and just moved on. <br/><br/>While it was cool to see some old Star Wars outfits/ships and the robot Alan Tudyk plays was well done I just thought it was a poorly written/acted flick that had amazing potential. 6.5/10 for me."
"Harhaluulo54","3","1","3","2 April 2017"," Worse than mindless action movies usually are
","The movie's title doesn't have the words ""Star"" and ""Wars"" in it. I call this honesty. Rogue One is non-canon filler taking place in the Star Wars universe. Pure milking basically. While this is not necessarily a bad idea as pure mindless action is often better than movies which try to be smart, but fail miserably - Rogue One's only redeeming quality is the CGI budget. <br/><br/>There is nothing that stands out. Nothing positive I mean. The most memorable part for me is the hideously bad acting - which sadly was the main basis for any entertainment value this holds. Mads Mikkelsen is pretty much the only person who can act. The rest are fellows you would expect to do kids' reality TV for living. Somehow they end up here. <br/><br/>The OST is horrible. It's basically Mad Max with 5% success ration. The movie is pure mindless action. There is no room left for character development, world or plot building - not even for pandering. Just space lasers making sounds in space because that's how science works and people hunting down a 3,5'' hdd because the future is so advanced and sci-fi. <br/><br/>Truly one boring experience which doesn't have anything to offer. Except great amount of overused clichés, logic failures, character flaws and visually told scenes which execution you can't but laugh at."
"curzon_dax","6","1","3","31 March 2017"," Unbelievably overrated
","We have reached a point in this franchise that the hard core fans of the franchise skew the rating very easily by giving so called ""automatic 10s"". This movie while not absolutely horrible, it has severe flaws that should not let it deserve more than a 6 with the most objective view possible. The characters are extremely uninteresting, cookie cutter and banal, the writing extremely predictable, the humor is embarrassingly bad and the tropes of the star wars franchise extremely forced, predictable and unfunny. Honestly, if anyone must watch all star wars there is,sure, watch it, it won't be a painful experience, but if you expect a masterpiece walk away as fast as you can. This movie is not the greatest of the year, not the greatest of the month and probably not of the week. The only redeeming quality is that it is watchable. You won't feel completely horrible about it. But don't be fooled, without the humongous budget this 6/10 would be a 5/10 at best."
"ethanwei","6","1","3","28 March 2017"," Over-hyped movie, would give it 6 star at best
","I consider myself an above average Star War fan (seen all the movies, knows all the main stories, played a lot of games, can call out most of the spaceship types and how many laser cannons they have etc.) but seriously I think this movie is mediocre at best. IMO SW movie values is held together by three aspects: quality of the space battle, quality of the jedi/sith battles, and special scenes or eye poppers; and recent SW movies' been poor in all three aspects. Maybe it's the fact that I'm not the die-hard type fan that I can keep my neutral judgment when it comes to movies from this franchise, but here are my two cents:<br/><br/>To start with I know it's difficult to really make a SW movie; you gotta appeal to those who's been loving it since the 80s for episodes 4 to 6, and connect with episodes 1 to 3 which I believe has great effects and lightsaber choreography despite the stereotypical story. I don't really want to comment anything about the story anymore; not sure about others but I'm really sick of seeing the Death Star for the 6th time. The special effects + costumes felt carried over from episode 6 and 7 in a way that it maintained an 80s sci-fi look; but seriously nowadays we've seen too many neat tech effects that I find it kind of lame. I'm not really sure if I'm watching this movie in ultra high definition with dolby sound effects or from one of those old TV with antennas on top.<br/><br/>Story-wise, given that the previous movies weren't that great in this aspect either, but they all have good effects for their time and some eye-popping scenes. For example, people loved Darth Maul in episode one with the dual light sabres and wowed when Yoda start dueling the Duku in Clone Wars and takes on Sidious in Revenge of the Sith. In Rogue One there were two scenes that could've been done very well or lengthened: one being stranded on a planet getting blasted by a death star and the other being Vader's killing spree. Both were almost non-existent and could've been done much better.<br/><br/>What really got me to write this review is that movie ratings have really become untrustworthy nowadays. Too many credits (and Oscars) were given just because movies explore some minority issue(s) or have too large of a fan following, or very artsy and glamorous but with the most important factor ignored: and that is ENTERTAINMENT VALUE. Beyond all else critics and viewers really asking themselves, ""am I enjoying this movie?"", if not, don't give it kudos in the wrong area. I admit that great effects may add to this entertainment factor, but it really depends. For example I can't imagine the superhero and Sci-Fi movies being good without good effects, but then again you got old movies like Shawshank Redemption remaining at the top of the list despite whatever new comes out. I'm really shouting out to the industry and the movie makers to ""keep giving us quality movies"", and from that stand point, I can say that Rogue One isn't one of them."

The plot was extremely simple and looked like an RPG game (go to A spot, get an item, get it to B spot), while at the same time it moved so slow. It put a lot of characters, that weren't developed at all and if you have seen it, you know that there was no need for so many characters. The main ""couple"" had no chemistry AT ALL. However, a really good thing this movie had going for it was the action. Sincerelly, it had the best action scenes in the series, along with the coolest Vader scene.<br/><br/>A sad thing is that this movie is literally a story that had no need to be a movie. It covers just the quote ""Many spies died for these plans"" in Episode IV. I am hopeful for a future movie with better story with the action scenes of this one, like maybe an Empire-based movie.<br/><br/>So, knowing what most people think about this movie I'm expecting a lot of people to disagree with my opinion. However, this doesn't change that the things I've said are the truth."
"YourFamilyExpert","9","1","3","7 February 2017"," A delight for fans and casual movie-goers
","WHAT'S ROGUE ONE ABOUT? Disney's first Star Wars spin-off film (read: not a Skywalker ""Episode"") is part heist movie, part war film as Rebel forces steal the plans to the Death Star.<br/><br/>IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: A) At this point one can look at the Star Wars franchise as a series of individual films or as one giant story; I prefer the latter, as the connective tissue between prequels, excellent animated series, original trilogy, and new trilogy is part of what makes the saga so satisfying. Rogue One ties in to most of these in incredibly rewarding ways, but also serves up a unique story and characters, dazzling action and effects, and a moving arc about fighting to give others hope.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards proves a wise choice for director, composer Michael Giacchino is a fine stand-in (but could never replace) John Williams, and the cast is terrific. Disney's emphasis on strong writing and acting is much appreciated, though I would have enjoyed a longer film if it had meant getting to know these characters better. Still the performers do strong work, with Felicity Jones providing an inspiring lead, Diego Luna nicely-layered, Alan Tudyk delivering wry comic relief as a reprogrammed Imperial robot, and martial arts superstar Donnie Yen giving us impressive moves and the film's best line. Forest Whitaker (as Clone Wars character Saw Gerrera), Mads Mikkelsen, and Ben Mendelsohn all shine.<br/><br/>Rogue One strengthens the story of A New Hope, patching up a few holes, and improves the prequels by association (much like the fantastic Clone Wars animated series does). You may know how the basic story ends, but the fates of the individual characters gives the film its heft. Casual moviegoers will have a great time; fans will be ecstatic. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Rogue One is rated PG-13. There is no language, drug use, or sexuality. There is plentiful action violence with persons and aliens killed by lazer blast, explosion, and debris. There are many intense moments and some heartbreaking deaths. Several of the protagonists are self-described shady characters who've done ""awful things"" but want to fight for a good cause. One scene near the end may be terrifying for small children (or they may love it; to say more would be to spoil it).<br/><br/>ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES? No matter what you've done in the past you can do the right thing now. Liberty and standing against oppression may require you to risk your life. There is no greater love than to die for a friend. Evil can only be overcome through unity."

How on earth as an actor do you move from Stephen Hawking's long-suffering wife in academia to being an action hero (with the small matter of dying of cancer in A Monster Calls somewhere in the process)? She did it. She is clearly made of tougher stuff than her sweet diffident English appearance seems to show. Altogether this film demonstrates one of the reasons why movies need making - drama, excitement, action, and at the heart of it, a real person that can be identified with and/or admired."

","I watched it last night, and I enjoyed it a lot more than The Force Awakens. Here is what I liked about Rogue One (spoiler-free) 1) It is mostly a war movie, and in that sense it is darker/ grittier /more pessimistic than the mainstream Star War movies 2) Within the ""war-genre"", I would put it in the ""bunch of guys on a mission"" genre, kind of like a Dirty Dozen in space. A bunch of flawed characters have to work together to pull something a lot bigger than them 3) It is mostly Jedi-free. No lightsaber duels (even though there is a 2-3 mins lightsaber scene with an iconic character of the franchise). I have nothing against Jedis but it is nice to see a movie not relying on their presence/ mythology in the Star Wars Universe. 4) There is no A-list actor involved. Again, it is interesting and refreshing to see a Star Wars movie working with some young- not-so-famous people in the lead, and some very good character actors (Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker) in the supporting role<br/><br/>Here is what I did not like <br/><br/>1) Some acting in the smaller roles (e.g the X-Wing pilots) seemed a bit stiff (nothing that would ruin the movie for me anyway) 2) This is more a general comment since it was inevitable, being a prequel to a New Hope, that the story revolved around the Death Star. But with the exception of the prequel trilogy, it looks like the plot of every Star Wars movie has to be centred on that thing: find the plans or whoever has the plans/ find the flaws of the Death Star (or a Super Death Star like in the JJ Abrams movie). I hope in the future they will come up with something different"

","Rouge One - Star Wars first part of the anthology. It stands out very clearly that the fans who like the original trilogy are very afraid of what occurs before A New Hope. For many, just as it is signed prequel dignity overrated relative to the original trilogy. For this film has more coupling between the third film and the fourth film in a clear way, then it is the group in this film that sets off the whole spectacle in the original trilogy. It promotes up a dark tone, realistic invited evident in the Empire strikes back. It has an intelligence in your narrative structure that is well appreciated just like the humor and what we identify ourselves with the well appreciated franchise. <br/><br/>It has an entertainment program value greater than Episode 1 or 2 actually or Episode VII also. The compliment this movie and really anchors the story with their characters better than Episode VII ever did, is that it does not contain as much of the light-sabers, causing the film to refrain from repetitive and monotonous narrative components. It highlights a different perspective of the same fictional world, which allows one to appreciate it more. It has the same elements that one can overlook a Star War film but does not concern the characters we are familiar with, which somehow feels comforting yet a replica of what Disney was trying to make a reality in the seventh film. But here, however, manages them by expressing the dark tone contained in the fictional galaxy and how this affects the main characters. <br/><br/>Although John Williams classic and iconic songs are not heard in the background seen again characters like droids, Darth Vader, references to classic characters that connect with the fourth part.

Jyn ERSO (Felicity Jones) - the main character who is constantly in focus, create in a short time a contract with the audience and convinces with its tasteful charisma and attitude that gives a stronger role presentation than Rey ever achieved in the seventh film. It also appreciable characters K 2 SO, Cassian, Chirrut Îmwe and Galen ERSO just like other new and old characters. Since the film has a central focusing point that permeates the entire film, there is a story. <br/><br/>A clearer one than what JJ Abrams produced. This no prequel, it has to take in and understand. It is a kind of spin-off based on events that occurred throughout the original trilogy. Rouge One is something that does not have the same elements as the original trilogy, but the visual effects that actually offers and the Impakt of war that the forfeits, creating still an unpredictable and realistic war film of the beloved fairy tale. It has much more brutal tone that is more realistic in relation to what we are used to.

","Rogue One has a slow start and I found I didn't really care very much for the father and daughter relationship that was the basis for the plot. It just wasn't that interesting or compelling. Similarly, most of the new characters were not that compelling either, with the possible exception of Cassian Andor. I had a couple of minor gripes too. In particular, you could sometimes tell that this Star Wars universe wasn't quite the same as the universe of the original trilogy. Those small differences are jarring if you hold the original in the highest regard.<br/><br/>The second half of the film was better and the progression to the inevitable climax was very well done. It was the Star Wars universe I had wanted to see and the battles, spaceships and other elements made me happy! So overall I think Rogue One is a good Star Wars film, but not a great one."
"jephtha","7","1","3","4 January 2017"," Satisfying, But With a Pervasive Sense of Untapped Potential
","After two viewings, I remain uncertain how to feel about ""Rogue One"". Originally, I was prepared to label it a depreciation from ""The Force Awakens"", but the second round was notably more enjoyable, and leaves me regarding it, for the time being, as more or less on the same level as the 2015 feature. Whatever the case, this is an unorthodox, sometimes frustrating and sometimes poignant addition to the Star Wars canon.<br/><br/>On the level of functionality as a prequel, ""Rogue One"" is adequate. It reveals the events that led up to the beginning of ""A New Hope"", much of which is entertaining, but little of which enhances the pertinent conflict. Too much of the runtime is devoted to either gathering the main group or shallow attempts at a typical war movie moral ambiguity; it's a needless complication that further affirms that the people behind these movies are all too insistent on bowing down to fan demands. Keeping track of numerous individuals and agendas can be moderately difficult, but this problem is significantly reduced in subsequent viewings, after one understands where everything is headed. Strangely, substantial numbers have objected to the film's dependence on the context provided by ""A New Hope"". Oh my, the EIGHTH entry in an iconic, long established film series assumes familiarity with that series? What an outrage! How dare they make a Star Wars movie specifically geared towards Star Wars fans? <br/><br/>As has been trumpeted in most circles, the large cast of characters is underdeveloped. It is notable, however, that most everyone is given a personal reason for being involved. These aren't fully capitalized on, but they are there, and bring just enough substance to the key players to make their endeavors engaging. Jyn Erso, despite some good fighting scenes, doesn't resonate for most of the runtime. Her ideally solid motivations aren't given weight until the mission at Skarif, when she gets to act upon them. More interesting aspects of her character, such as her family's belief in the Force and her ability to lift morale, are underutilized. Cassian Andor is notably better, and the only member of the group convincingly molded by war. ""Rogue One"" should have devoted much more effort to this angle of exploring how the war effected people on a personal level, rather than shoehorning an overly clamored for moral grayness.<br/><br/>The villains are overall better, primarily because of familiar faces. Krennic is a letdown. Though he certainly stands out with his distinctive white uniform, he falls victim to the bewildering new trend of turning Star Wars villains into pathetic pretenders in a cheap attempt to elicit sympathy. Plus, his attempts at humor are out of place.<br/><br/>Some were quick to criticize Vader's final scene as intrusive, unnecessary and inappropriate, claiming that it overrides the impact of the climax. Considering the greater context and the villain's purpose in the movie, I would say different. Vader's inclusion here (essentially an extended cameo) is preparatory to his role in ""A New Hope"", and his final scene builds momentum and anticipation as ""Rogue One"" segues into the conflict of the succeeding chapter. Additionally, the transmissions, the fruits of the main characters' efforts, are also followed during these final scenes, keeping the significance of the climax alive.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards once again shows a talent for impressive sights, and ""Rogue One"" is filled with great looking settings and excellent cinematography. While this is yet another instance of answering fan complaints, specifically the abundant use of green-screen in the prequel trilogy, it brings a sense of scope that helps set this entry apart from its immediate predecessors. Nevertheless, most of these places work better as sights (and very good ones, to be sure) than supplements to the story. Jedha, for example, feels less like a city ravaged by war than a settlement that has simply always been harsh. Any undercurrent of suffering or struggle fails to manifest itself. As is, the visuals mostly amount to the ""used future"" concept dialed up to 11. ""Rogue One"" needed more moments like the scene aboard Andor's ship after the escape from Jedha, where one can feel how shaken the group is by recent events.<br/><br/>The end battle is an ambitious application of the multi-faceted climax structure first seen in Episode VI. The space engagement is top notch, while the ground battle is a definite improvement over its Endor counterpart. At times, it is easy to lose track of the proceedings, but if one pays attention it is impressive how everything is planned. Furthermore, this is the primary segment of the film to carry narrative weight in the larger context (although the stakes are clear even when only considering this film). The actual procedure of stealing the technical readouts is a little protracted and could have used more involvement by the main group, but it does what it has to. It creates a sense of challenge and commitment, and gives the heroes opportunity to contribute to something critical. My only issue with this sequence is the palm tree filled setting. It's disconnected from the style seen in the rest of the film, and makes the battle seem more like it takes place in Malibu. Regardless, the closing scenes are terrific.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" is a reasonably entertaining and at times bold addition to the film series. It provides further background on the original story, gives us a few good actions sequences and memorable moments. Nevertheless, it's high time the series broke away from the Galactic Civil War. Filmmakers are going to have to move past the restrictions imposed upon them by fan complaints if they intend to expand the horizons of this franchise. Otherwise, the day will not be far off when the great Roger Ebert's comment on Star Trek in 2002 will also apply here: ""gradually it occurs to me that ""Star Trek"" is over for me. I've been looking at these stories for half a lifetime, and, let's face it, they're out of gas""."

There are no glaring flaws. On the other hand, nothing special occurs.

The closest I came to caring was for K2, a robot.

","Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>Star Wars has been my life since I was 5 years old and this is the ""New Hope"" I've been waiting for. This isn't JJ Abrams/Disney ""Star Wars"" and it isn't the poor interpretation of it as done by Lucas in the prequel trilogy. This is Star Wars as it should be. This is Star Wars as it should have been. This is the Star Wars we called out to the force for when we collectively clamored in horror when Jar Jar Binks appeared in Episode One. The script could have been written by a hardcore Star Wars cosplay fan. Yes, it's all fan service. But fan service never looked this good. I didn't expect to be so invested in characters like the Erso's and Captain Captain Andor and even K-2SO! People audibly gasped in the theater when the DROID died a dramatic death! And that huge set-piece battle with the AT- AT's and the Tie Fighters and the space cruisers, rebel troops, Storm troopers and the kitchen sink thrown in there? That's how we used to play Star Wars when we were kids. We'd just throw all of our action figures together and have these huge battles to secure the Death Star plans (or whatever) sometimes literally in the kitchen sink! Spoiler: All the protagonists die in the end in an ending that's more Tarantino than Disney! And the CGI looked great. Of course you could tell it wasn't really Peter Cushing but he's been dead for more than 20 years and he's in the film. Give them some credit for that! The only thing that took me out of the moment was Vader telling a joke. ""Don't choke on your own aspirations, Krennick"". Vader doesn't do jokes. Sarcasm yes, not jokes. And the ending freaked me out but that's because Fisher died the same day I saw the movie. <br/><br/>If you're a straggler, you need to see this damn movie right now!"
"NicolasCostoglou","4","1","3","28 December 2016"," No threat as/in a/the movie...
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story...a hard film to talk about, at first it seems to make mostly right decisions and it looks like a Star Wars movie...but the more you think about the wasted potential, the more it falls apart. (And to be clear from the get-go, i'm not a hardcore Star Wars-Fan, i grew up liking the original movies pretty much, but i'm more the Indiana Jones/Lord of the Rings guy)<br/><br/>The big problem is the strange anticipation most people nowadays have with the Star Wars license. Star Wars is a great fantasy tale, which was never meant to be a saga, but got to be, because of it's great success. The reason the first movie came to be was that George Lucas had a idea for a movie which combines all the films he grew up with and his favourite genres into one hybrid, which worked out extremely well. (Here's a video which explains fairly well what i'm talking about, just for better understanding: https://youtu.be/6V42FVqsaI4)<br/><br/>But then came the prequels, and George Lucas seemingly thought that he had to expand his universe, and with expand, he meant explain. The force was now something scientific, the backstory of a guy had to be told which was just the big bad villain in a fantasy story, with a little twist to it, and because the original movies seemed to ""simple"" they crammed politics into the main story...<br/><br/>Most people already know all of this, but i just wanted to get across why this movie, while being Star Wars on the surface (and don 't get me wrong, very entertaining) isn't a real Star Wars movie, or with better words, not the kind of Star Wars movie we ""need"".<br/><br/>This film was marketed as kind of a war movie, which is gritty, dark and more realistic. Most people seem to think that this would be a plus, but (like i explained) that's not what Star Wars is about, it 's supposed to be a fairy tale about true heroes who fight dark forces, get the girl and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the things that work really well, and which are mostly technical to say the least.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very good, the movie looks dark, but you get what's going on, and the landscape shots are beautiful.<br/><br/>The effects are really good, and surpass the okay effects of The force awakens by far. But the motion capturing is pretty much hit and miss. The robot played by Alan Tudyk is masterfully done and you forget very fast that it's not a real machine, and Gouvenor Tarkin works for the most part, but not without an uncanny valley effect, which also includes a young Princess Leia, which is by far the most unconvincing and needless effect in the whole film, and the worst part is that it's one of the last few shots of the movie...so that sticks with you a long time...<br/><br/>So that was that, let's get back to the stuff that didn't worked as well...<br/><br/>Storywhise the strongest part is the connection between our protagonist and her father, but these scenes are brief and far apart, which is made worse by the fact that we don't learn anything about their backstory, so that it's not even THAT much of a connection. And this is one of the most obvious weaknesses of the film: The characters.<br/><br/>Most of them can't even be called characters, because they are none. They are just people without personality, and you learn nothing about them, which is even more sad, because all of them die so that we'll never get to know them, or even care about their death. And that's really sad, because the actors are very charming and do their best, so that i really WANT to like them, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Also the story(-telling) on itself isn't that good, apart from the Titanic-effect, that means that we all (obviously) know how it will end. Which also means that the movie doesn't work on it's own, because it 's highly unsatisfying to see a movie about people who just find the plans for a big destructive weapon, but die without getting the chance to stop the grand threat which is set up...<br/><br/>That's the content, but what about the promised action, does it deliver? Well, on a technical level yes, it works really well in that regard and is very exciting, most of all the last act, but on a dramatic level, not that much, mostly because of the weak character connection, but also because it lacks the kind of suspenseful sequences the original movies had. They just do their stuff, and every problem get's solved so quick that it never get's really intense. The space fight has the same problem, but it's way better than the one in The Force Awakens (which is a movie i prefer).<br/><br/>And yes Darth Vader is in this movie, but it's nothing more than brief fan-service, but good one to say the least...<br/><br/>There is much more to talk about in detail, but these are my general thoughts on this movie. <br/><br/>It's entertaining to watch, and on the surface fairly well made, but it lacks in content and mostly in providing characters to care about, which is needed to make this kind of story investing..."
"billjanes1","Null","1","3","19 December 2016"," Characters Plot Tension Action
","The best Star Wars movie since the first one. A dozen or more clearly drawn characters; not a weak one among them. A plot and subplots involving family, comrades, rebels vs the bad guys, etc. Tension within family, among comrades, within the rebellion, within the empire, within and between some key characters. Action all over the freakin' place. The characters were all knew (at least to me) and seemed very real, multidimensional, gritty and driven. I invested in characters, their struggles, well-being, etc. In the case of the rebels, their objectives. The film makes you work to learn the plot and places - many new, some related to original Star Wars. The audience knows ""the next chapter"" and we want to know how we got there: This is the story of how we got there, how we got to the first Star Wars movie."
"vincent-malisse","7","1","3","18 December 2016"," One with the Force?
","I don't believe this movie to be ""One with the Force"", aka it could have been better, but in all honesty, the movie was not bad either. <br/><br/>It starts out a bit slow with some character development, but picks up the pace in the second half of the movie. All the usual Star Wars elements are in there and that does give you the somewhat ""I have seen this before"" feeling, which is a pity, since the Star Wars universe has potential and room for some different story development. But the cameos and the setup of the planets make up for that.<br/><br/>One part of the CGI (the stars in the background) I really disliked as they could have done much, much, much better than that. I just hope it was done on purpose (nostalgia from the older movies?), but other than that it was all nicely done. I very much liked the ""new"" places they went to like the grassy mountains in the beginning to the tropical beach in the end. <br/><br/>And since we're talking about the end, the end scene is one of the best and powerful scenes in all the saga. It (finally?) shows Vader's real power, it shows the feeling of dread and it makes the movies somehow come full circle. <br/><br/>*** Major spoiler ahead *** And one more thing: this is the first movie, where almost every single one of the major characters dies in the end. Interesting take."
"jessflower-48881","9","1","3","18 December 2016"," Excellent and enlightening, but takes some effort...
","Just in case you missed it, there are a couple of SPOILERS below.<br/><br/>Many of us that write reviews like this remember waiting in line for Episode 4. We marveled at the blockade runner desperately trying to avoid the massive destroyer chasing it. We left the theater breathless, wondering about the massive universe that had just been dangled in front of us, ate up everything that followed, and geeked out on anything Star Wars for years. Until the prequels -- but that's another story.<br/><br/>Now those of us who are in this realm (and I'm included in this number) easily ate up this first ever ""side story"" with nostalgia and absolute joy. However, I was able to view it from my young teenager's perspective as he was my movie companion. He wasn't steeped in the lore. He wasn't familiar with some of the references. He didn't giggle at the blue milk, the cantina-guest-appearances, the references to the ""Whills,"" or even smile with a little heartache at a very-serviceable Grand Moff Tarkin recreation.<br/><br/>It's not like it was a confounded mess of tax federation discussion and trade tariffs (*ahem*) but it took some engagement to see how things were playing out -- and I for one was really enjoying myself. It wasn't a kid movie. It was an interesting ""time of conflict"" film that explored the nature of war. <br/><br/>Characters were all very solid and interesting, and while K-2SO is absolutely amazing in so many respects, it was VERY fun to get invested in the heroes -- only to be truly upset at their fates in the climax. The stakes were SO high, and it was an absolute joy to hope they might make it -- and somehow escape to another quadrant and therefore avoid all the future battles of Episodes 4-7.<br/><br/>Truly, though. This would normally get a movie a 7 or an 8. What bumped it to 9 for this moviegoer was the perfectly crafted finale -- where tensions rose, sacrifices were gut-wrenching and powerful (I actually thumped my thigh in frustration when K-2SO made his final stand) and the sacrifice for the future of the rebellion came to full fruition.<br/><br/>And Holy Nerfherder. That Darth Vader slaughter scene at the end was worth EVERY dollar of admission. As the plans were being passed to each sacrificed Rebel soldier, I became more and more afraid of the Dark Lord of the Sith. It was refreshing to be intimidated by Vader again, and not smirk or roll my eyes thinking of him yelling a mechanized ""Nooooo!"" <br/><br/>As long as Disney/Lucasfilm continues to bring fresh takes to story and character, and not get into a cookie-cutter ""superhero"" mold, we should be good to go."
"dvdbvvmn","8","1","3","18 December 2016"," How much you like this film depends on how much of a die-hard fan you are!
","SPOILERS!!!!!<br/><br/>I will pre-amble this by saying I'm not a true die-hard fan who knows everything about the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see Jedi knights and lots of light-sabre duels, be prepared to be disappointed. Remember this is a SW stand-alone story and shows a different side to the SW universe, not a part of the main saga.<br/><br/>The whole point of the introduction for each of the main films is to provide the set-up for each episode of the saga as a whole. I understand why the crawl was not included as (a) it is a stand alone film and (b) we know the plot and we can pretty much guess what will happen at the end of the film by virtue of how ANH starts. In that respect, the story is predictable as we know they will have successfully stolen the plans. <br/><br/>Rogue One comes before ANH so the audience had to anticipate an original plot (unlike the TFA which was a rehash of ANH). As another reviewer said, this film takes Star Wars seriously and as far as the feel of the film is concerned I would put it very close behind TESB.<br/><br/>Having said that the part in ROTJ where they use the shuttle to land on Endor was again used similarly in R1 which I found slightly disappointing. Otherwise I couldn't see any other obvious plot similarities to those films.<br/><br/>The downsides is that the film started off slow and, given the necessity of stealing the plans, didn't have the urgency of ANH or TESB. Though we know the outcome of the story, I think the urgency to steal the plans could have been much more life-and-death in the plot like a ticking time-bomb.<br/><br/>There is very little in the character motivation especially Jyn aside from the fact that her father is centrally involved in the design of the death star.<br/><br/>I understand why some of the die-hard fans will pick lots of holes and have very high expectations but I personally think it is, overall, an entertaining film."

Fast paced space and ground battles with all the necessary trimmings and space troopers galore. Not to mention the funny android with an attitude problem and more personality than most humans. It is all there.<br/><br/>The music score is very much in line with the series, yet still unique in its own way. This only adds to the overall feeling and knowledge that this is a self contained movie.<br/><br/>The opening of Rogue One departs from the big score and introduction scrolling across the screen. I found this part a tiny bit disappointing - it is kind of a Star Wars thing after all. Even I know that, and admittedly I don't know much.<br/><br/>The Story<br/><br/>Set between Episode III and IV Rogue One tells the story of a band of rebels who are trying to get the plans for the Death Star. They are lead by Jyn Erso, who is the daughter of Galen Erso, the man who reluctantly developed the machine.<br/><br/>During the construction Galen had secretly built in a weak spot at the core, hoping that the rebellion would be able to destroy the deadly weapon before the Empire had a chance to use it.<br/><br/>His wish did not exactly come true, because the evil Orson Krennic uses it to destroy Jedha City in order to show its power to the Empirial Senat. This makes the task at hand all the more urgent and the rebels are prepared to sacrifice everything to complete their mission.<br/><br/>The final showdown happens on the planet Scarif where the plans are stored. Star Wars fans who have been with the franchise for a while will probably know or at least guess the outcome of the movie. In my opinion that does not take anything away from the glory of watching it all happen in such a spectacular fashion on the big screen in 3D.<br/><br/>Sequel yes / no?<br/><br/>Rogue One is a stand alone movie but rumours continue to linger that there may be works in the pipeline to continue the story.

They are currently working to get the chapter of that out in 2017. If the trend continues then the next movies after that is not due until 2019, which leaves the perfect open spot in 2018 for something else. But that is just speculation on my part.<br/><br/>Final thoughts<br/><br/>I have never been a Star Wars fan. To tell the truth the first movie in the franchise I ever saw was Episode I, and that only partly. I watched it years ago and the only part I remembered is the pod race. The first Star Wars movie I consciously watched was indeed The Force Awakens last year. After watching Rogue One now I am determined to make a marathon session over Christmas out of watching the entire series in one go. I will be off work for a few days, so that will give me the perfect opportunity to do that.<br/><br/>There are two reasons for that. First is my newfound appreciation for the story. And secondly there is the knowledge that I am missing the overall picture. I can't really place any of the events around those two movies within the timeframe of the entire story. As I am certain, that there will be more films coming and I am also certain that I am going to watch them, I want to be able to see the whole picture when I do that."

","I'll be the first to admit my lack of faith in the success (critically more than commercially) of Rogue One. As a fan who, like many others, live and die by Star Wars, the initial idea of a live- action film spin-off seemed risky. How ever was my lack of faith disturbing. Rogue One not only delivers a highly compelling, exceptionally entertaining film of its own accord, it undoubtedly strengthens the story of A New Hope (Episode IV), and the entire Star Wars saga as well.<br/><br/>This was no easy task for director Gareth Edwards and his staff of writers; to be trusted to produce a worthy spin-off story in arguably the largest franchise in the world is a daunting undertaking. The conclusion was to tell the story of the rebel team who stole the original plans to the Death Star, a team we had heard about in Episode IV but never got to see. There simply could not have been a better choice for the plot of Star Wars' first spin-off, as Rogue One contains one of the best individual stories in Star Wars history. <br/><br/>There is a much grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling to this film, but even with the more grounded atmosphere, it still very much feels like a Star Wars movie. We see a new approach to the storytelling; new worlds, new characters, new stakes, and we also see classic vehicles, characters and more. It's a shot of fresh air into the lungs of what fans have come to expect, yet maintains the heart of a Star Wars film. Seeing the touching sacrifices that each member of the Rogue One team makes is powerful and enticing, making character connections to the audience that strengthens the depth of the film. The pacing was excellent for the most part, with some minor hiccups here and there. Possibly the greatest narrative strength, however, belongs to Rogue One's ability to tie into A New Hope flawlessly. This is, after all, a prequel film to Episode IV, and with it the foundation of A New Hope shifts heavily in the best way possible. We get so much more insight on the events of Episode IV, including an explanation to arguably the biggest plot hole in the entire saga. All throughout, Rogue One secures a spot among the best stories ever told in the galaxy far far away.<br/><br/>As good as the story is, Rogue One's undisputed backbone is the phenomenal set of characters leading said story. The ragtag squad that is Rogue One is filled with wonderful characters, lead by Jyn Erso who is fantastic. The real stand out, however, is K-2SO, a new droid who constantly makes you smile, providing wonderful comedic relief. The new set of characters are rounded out by rebel Cassian Andor, solid new antagonist Director Krennic, Jyn's father, Galen Erso, and the awesome duo of Chirrut Imwe and Baze Malbus, who have great on-screen chemistry. These new characters are terrific in Rogue One and help further the roster of lovable Star Wars characters for fans to cherish.<br/><br/>Though Rogue One introduces new characters, it's some of the age-old classics are show stoppers. Aside from Darth Vader (who I'll get to shortly), the digital recreation of the late Peter Cushing's iconic Grand Moff Tarkin is a staple of the film, and is executed brilliantly. We also get to see Mon Monthma, Saw Gerrera, Bail Organa and even a brief shot of Princess Leia herself, who also was digitally redone for her short scene. Seeing the connection of new and old characters is splendid and to see them all bridge the story into Episode IV is even better.<br/><br/>The actors themselves bring each character to life beautifully. Felicity Jones is solid as Jyn, Alan Tudyk plays the voice and mo- cap of K-2SO perfectly, Ben Mendelsohn is aggressive and intimidating as Krennic but the gold star goes to Guy Henry, who, aided by CGI, recreates Tarkin so well that it's almost indistinguishable. Without going on too long, the cast was excellent from top to bottom.<br/><br/>Of course, Star Wars is known for its big-budget action scenes, stunning visuals and masterful audio, and Rogue One continues the legacy of what to expect from a Star Wars film. The action sequences are intense, exciting and intriguing, especially in the third act with the superb final battle between space and on land. The different locations give way for gorgeous set pieces and CGI, and while not composed by John Williams, the score fits the style of the film and keeps the Star Wars feeling intact.<br/><br/>It'd be a disservice if I didn't dedicate a section to the final scene of the film. Darth Vader, one of the most legendary names in all of fiction, makes his triumphant return to the saga in Rouge One, becoming the center of what is one of the greatest scenes in Star Wars history. Vader boards the rebel ship which holds the stolen Death Star plans, and in desperation to retrieve them, Vader mercilessly slaughters numerous terrified rebels in his path. The iconic glow of his red lightsaber, his overwhelming power of the Dark Side being showcased to a maximum, this is the Vader every fan has dreamed of seeing. The scene completely stole the film, and also lead directly into Episode IV, giving it legitimacy as well as being down right epic.<br/><br/>The Star Wars galaxy is large with many stories to be told. Rogue One might not traverse too far away from the original trilogy, but that doesn't for one second keep it from being an astoundingly entertaining piece of film and a more than worthy entry into the prestigious Star Wars saga.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","I panned Force Awakens (you can read my review). Due to my disappointment, I deliberately kept my expectations low for Rogue One. If you felt the same about Force Awakens, GO SEE ROGUE ONE. Great story, amazing CGI, good character development, no ridiculous villains, no characters mastering Jedi skills in 10 minutes. Music, script, acting all very well done. Felt like a genuine chapter of the original series. With Force Awakens, we got the rousing musical score at the outset and the traditional Star Wars logo and story script, then it all went rapidly down hill. Force Awakens did not deserve the Star Wars brand. Rogue One doesn't have these traditional opening features, but it deserves to. I call for these features to be re-mastered into the DVD version..."
"ericstevenson","9","2","10","25 December 2016"," Hello, Vader!
","I remember first hearing about this movie and thinking that it simply couldn't be good because a ""Star Wars"" spin off movie has never worked before. Every single one of them was worse than ""The Phantom Menace"". I find it astounding everyone still complains about it when there's four films that are worse. I just got done with ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"", the first of these, so I didn't have high hopes. I consider a ""Star Wars"" spin off film to be any that doesn't have the ""Episode"" in its title in some format. This qualifies and it's a great movie.<br/><br/>When I heard they were reshooting scenes, it made me think of that disappointing ""Suicide Squad"" movie. Even with the editing, it still came out bad, so I'm glad to know it actually worked here. I was afraid of J. J. Abrams not working on it, but it was great. I do feel kind of bad seeing as how I don't remember many of these new characters' names. At the time, this has a higher rating than last year's ""Star Wars"" movie. We are going to have one theatrically released movie in this series for a long time. I personally don't find it as good, but it's easily better than all the other spin off movies combined.<br/><br/>I remember watching ""Revenge Of The Sith"" and realizing that they were going to have to kill off all the characters that don't appear in the original trilogy. Yep, this killed off every single one of them, but dang, did we have fun with these guys. I have no clue if any of these characters were from Expanded Universe material. Will the HK-47 ever appear? Anyway, what I love about this movie is how beautiful it looks. We get all of these wonderful locations that are so unique. Some complained about the film being too long and I will admit that it is a fault. Darth Vader looks great and it's great to see him again.<br/><br/>It's weird to see Carrie Fisher being shown so young and find out that in real life, she might die. RIP Kenny Baker. The action scenes are great. This might be the first time they directly mention something from the prequels. They mention the Clone Wars, but I think those were briefly mentioned in the original trilogy too. Anyway, it's amazing how they build up to directly the scene before the original movie. It must be seen to be believed! The beginning is wonderfully subtle too. It's great to see behind the story of the canon. I have no idea whether any of my reviews will be liked, but vote however you want. See it! ***1/2"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","10","18 December 2016"," More of the same things you love about ""Star Wars"" movies
","""Rogue One"" is the first ""Star Wars"" film without the word ""episode"" in the title, but other than not following the main characters or narrative arc of those previous installments, what does that really mean? This was LucasFilm's chance to set the tone for what the ""A Star Wars Story"" movies could be. So far, it's more of the same, which is great news for ""Star Wars"" fans.<br/><br/>Count me among them. Director Gareth Edwards (""Godzilla"") vision is sweeping and expansive. The world-building he does as we follow Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and other Rebels to a few new planets in the galaxy echoes the same creativity and curiosity that defined George Lucas' vision. Edwards' sense of scale, as proved by his debut film, ""Monsters,"" and again in ""Godzilla,"" has a lot to offer the ""Star Wars"" universe and it makes ""Rogue One"" feel somehow more realistic and more imaginative at the same time.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Edwards applies these skills in service of ""Star Wars"" fans. At one point during its marketing campaign, it seemed like ""Rogue One"" would bring us a grittier, 'war film' version of a ""Star Wars"" movie, but the final cut, while it has grittier moments, plays out as homage to the original trilogy far more than a visionary interpretation of it. Edwards mimics a lot of the shots that defined ""A New Hope"" in ways that feel like a warm blanket of nostalgia. At the same time, you wonder if that indebtedness to the ""source material"" kept audiences from experiencing ""Star Wars"" in a way they never had before. That said, there's only so much criticism you can hand a film for not being something it isn't.<br/><br/>The script runs into much of the same kind of trap. Penned by Chris Weitz (2015's ""Cinderella"") and Tony Gilroy (the ""Bourne"" films) from a story by Gary Whitta and Jon Knoll, ""Rogue One"" finds itself locked into much of the same formula, tropes and storytelling devices of previous ""Star Wars"" films. We follow a young person swept up in a large-scale conflict she didn't ask to be a part of who meets up with other unlikely comrades sharing similar views and ultimately becomes the hero she was meant to be. ""The Force Awakens"" approached its story the same way and worked, so it's no surprise we get something similar in this film.<br/><br/>Despite the ""Star Wars"" clichés from droid characters who steal the show (Alan Tudyk's K-2SO is huge highlight) to climactic sequences in rooms where there's a long way to fall, ""Rogue One"" does have great story pacing and strong dialogue. The characters are also quite interesting, from the troubled but obedient Rebel soldier Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) to the enigmatic, war-torn extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) — the film just doesn't get to explore them with any depth, even Jyn. <br/><br/>True, the new characters in ""Force Awakens"" didn't require much backstory to grab hold of our affections, but somehow, perhaps because they're all adults, there's not enough to forge an emotional connection. Undoubtedly ""Rogue One"" doesn't tug at your heartstrings in the same way as ""Force Awakens,"" but the lack of a strong emotional component doesn't detract from the viewing experience in the way that, say, the prequel trilogy hurt itself with weak character-driven subplots. On the whole, whereas ""Force Awakens"" had stronger story notes, ""Rogue One"" is more visually arresting. Both lean a lot on the traits that have made ""Star Wars"" films so great in the past<br/><br/>The minds at Disney's LucasFilm have shown a strong ability to identify these traits and build extremely entertaining movies around them that resonate with fans. They've honed in on and identified the ""Star Wars"" brand and have been very protective of it in these first two films. Consequently, these movies can fairly be labeled as ""safe."" ""Rogue One"" was the film we thought would take more risks, and it just doesn't. Then again, it didn't really need to. It's a perfectly rousing space odyssey despite that familiarity. And considering ""Rogue One"" literally sets up ""A New Hope,"" thereby playing into the main ""Star Wars"" narrative, perhaps it was silly to think that this first anthology/spin-off film would be completely distinctive. <br/><br/>The debate between whether a beloved franchise should push the envelope or adopt the inertia strategy of sticking to what it does best doesn't have a right answer. So far, we know that the ""Star Wars"" strategy has been the latter. The big picture question is whether that strategy — if LucasFilm continues to employ it — has legs, or if audiences and perhaps even adoring fans will grow tired of it.<br/><br/>That said — and this is pure speculation as both a big ""Star Wars"" fan and a fan of good movies and storytelling — it's possible LucasFilm's intention with it's first main ""episode"" and first spin-off was to dip its toe back in the galaxy far, far away and build fan trust in order to take bigger risks in the future. Maybe that's giving them too much credit, but they have certainly earned that position given the quality of these new movies on the whole.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"Argemaluco","8","2","10","16 December 2016"," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
","If Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope was inspired by The Hidden Fortress, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story took the example of classic movies such as The Guns of Navarone and When Eagles Dare, in which a desperate group of individuals gets infiltrated into enemy lines in a mission of high risk... and also high reward. But that's not all. As part of a huge cultural (and, let's accept it, commercial) legacy, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story must complement its main story with strong bonds to the past and the future of the saga, integrating new characters in old situations and recreating classic settings with the most modern special effects, without losing the ""spirit"" which defines and identifies everything related to Star Wars. Is it possible to fulfill with so many requirements while bringing a satisfactory film on its own merit? Fortunately, yes. Director Gareth Edwards and co-screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy took a ""historical"" passage of the mythology, and brought it quite an energy and vigor, leaving behind the idealized ""space opera"" in order to face the physical and emotional challenges of a guerrilla conflict, in which the action might be less epic, but not less exciting because of that. The main cast is composed by various solid actors making a good work in their roles: Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang, Riz Ahmed and Alan Tudyk (of whom we only hear his voice). On the negative side, I think Weitz and Gilroy didn't invest enough time on the development of some characters (Bodhi Rook and Cassian Andor particularly); sure, I don't need a prequel of the prequel either to explain every small detail, but some more minutes of ""backstory"" would have strengthened those characters while leaving their function inside the narrative clearer. As for the villain, the great Ben Mendelsohn brings a perfect work as a bureaucrat who became a megalomaniac. And, sure, we can count with multiple cameos, references and hidden jokes for the fans. Some of those ""easter eggs"" seem self-indulgent whims, while other ones denote authentic ingenuity and love for the saga. I found Rogue One: A Star Wars Story satisfactory and very entertaining, but inferior to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which I received with so much taste after 16 years of resentment against the ""bad trilogy"". But anyway, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story confirms the viability of tangential ""spin-offs"" of the main chronicle, increasing the opportunities to experiment with new perspectives... exactly like the ""Extended Universe"" did so during many years in the shape of comics, novels, videogames and even TV series. They all enriched the saga, and now, we are starting to enjoy the same in the cinema. We are already in the right track; now, please don't let George Lucas get close."
"Screen_Blitz","8","2","10","16 December 2016"," This electrifying installment in the Star Wars saga delivers one of the best in its acclaimed franchise
","When J.J Abrams suited the director's chair for the widely anticipated 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' last year, he proved to be an obliging hand to drive the acclaimed franchise in a worthy, if slightly flawed direction. Though it fell short of expectations for some hardcore fans with many painting it's overwhelming similarities to 'Episode IV: New Hope', he managed to open light on a bright path for the series. This year, Hollywood brings us something new to the series in favor of the first stand-alone entry since the franchise's debut. Directed by Gareth Edwards, the man behind 2014's 'Godzilla'; this pins a spectacular installment that mounts a bridge between the chronology of 'Episode III: Revenge of The Sith' and 'New Hope'. Instead of revolving around the story of the family of Luke Skywalker, it tackles on the trajectory of the demise of the Death Star we witnessed in the fourth episode, with a focus on a whole new set of characters. This film follows Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones), a rebellion soldier with a grim past who must team with an Alliance Intelligence officer Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna) and his wise-cracking robot K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) to steal plans from the Death Star from the possession of former Republic leader Orson Krennic (played by Ben Mendleston). Joining along their side is a blind swordsman (played by Donnie Yen) and his faithful sidekick (played by Wen Jiang) in an epic showdown.<br/><br/>A stand-alone to the Star Wars universe is an idea fans everywhere have speculated for quite some time, and the final product Gareth Edwards delivers of this concept works surprisingly well if a few blemishes. Like in the previous entries, the story is biggest hallmark that defines the film as it focuses on a part-heist, part-action plot set to connect the events of Darth Vader's origins in George Lucas's often loathed prequel trilogy and the classic trilogy that started it all. Following the story of rebellion warrior Jyn, this film focuses on her journey to save the galaxy an anticipated doom conducted by the Death Star. When she eventually joins with some unfamiliar allies that, that is when we are introduced the plot along with a string of new characters that sadly do not carry the same heart and interest as the cast of characters from the first trilogy. Cassian Andor and his robotic sidekick K-2SO make a fine duo, especially with the latter cracking some comedic one-liners every chance he's on screen. But they definitely don't fall in line with Hans Solo and Chewbacca. Though the plot kicks on a rather meandering start during the first half, Edwards manages to serve justice in the second half once the big action combat scenes kick in and we witness our heroes engage in a tense, climatic showdown complete with stellar special effects and CGI. The space battles stir some fun too but perhaps nothing special beyond what we seen the last installments. And if you expecting good cinematography expand upon the beauty of the action, these scenes include that as well with Greig Fraser providing hefty camera work capture the heat of the bombastic mayhem.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones makes a likable appeal as our main hero Jyn Erso but the manner in which her character doesn't quite boost near on the levels of our more memorable protagonists like Luke Skywalker. Diego Luna, often known for more dramatic work in the Mexican film industry, delivers a charismatic appeal as Cassian Andor; and his chemistry with the wise-cracking robot K-2SO provides charm almost every minute they hit the screen. But like Jyn Erso, he falls of a memorable character. Working along their side is Donnie Yen who shows off an adrenaline-fueled testosterone as a blind swordsman in a few extravagant fighting sequences, and Jiang Wen who shares a close companionship with Yen but nothing remarkable beyond few catchy one-liners. Forest Whitaker as Saw Generra (based on the character from the animated series) makes the best of his rather short screen time, though his sore-throat like voice can get little pesky. Arguably the most stand-out figure aside from the lead character Jyn is the villain Orson Krennic who is played by Ben Mendleston with a fairly solid performance. But the arresting spirit of the franchise's previous antagonists such as the culturally iconic Darth Vader and last year's Kylo Ren is sadly abandoned in this villain. Lucky for us, Gareth Edwards manages the squeeze Darth Vader into the story in which furnishes him just a few minutes of screen time including one exhilarating quick-time action sequence during the final twenty minutes. Beyond this, it is Orson Krennic who mostly steals the villain's throne.<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars story is a fantastic entry of stand-alone anthology film of the Star Wars cinematic universe. It marks a fine achievement for director Gareth Edwards who successfully ties a string connecting the conclusion of George Lucas's prequel trilogy and the more acclaimed trilogy, and opens the door for an enormous (and predictable) success at the box office. At best, it keeps the franchise gearing for a bright future."

The supporting cast is the perfect foundation and includes a team of different personalities that all seem genuine.<br/><br/>Script-wise, it does the job well. Fans will be pleased that much of the original costumes, characters, themes and sub-plots are introduced also.<br/><br/>The pace of Rogue 1 is a stand-out feature of the film.

LucasArts of old. Our cinema audience applauded multiple times and introductions to these moments and to the finale, a testament to how thrilling these were.<br/><br/>Where perhaps the film is let down, is in the score. When the standards set by John Williams has been so high with iconic scores previously written (Rogue 1's score is not a Williams produce), it is easy to understand that this will be so.<br/><br/>In short, there is truly hope with this anthology series if more of the same follows. Meanwhile, I'm merely excited to re-watch this one."
"Johan-smedjebacka","9","2","10","15 December 2016"," The darkest chapter in the saga
","Rogue one is a very dark, but beautiful peace in the Star Wars saga. Telling the story of those rebels who became the rogue one group and scarified everything giving hope to other rebels. It's a tale also of the bad and the good imperial generals who built death star, Orson Krennic and Galen Erso. Rogue one is set just before episode 4 and specially the ending manages to show this greatly trough Bail and Leia organa and leaders at yavin 4.<br/><br/>The intro scene tells already what kind of movie it will be, full of hopeless situation and darkness. Galen Erso chooses against all odds to still help empire after they killed her wife and only in the end most will understand why he did it. His daughter Jyn Erso manages to escape and is the main character which the movie follows, not trusting rebels in the beginning but ending to be the one who leads a pack of rebels to one of the most important missions in the history saving the data file that later is the reason downfall of death star.<br/><br/>Rogue one introduces many interesting characters on of them being Chirrut Îmwe who clearly believes in force and also has the ability use it.<br/><br/>The movie is built up way better than episode 7 and makes sense. The empire is at it's glory controlling big parts of the galaxy and ruling with an iron hand. Now taking the rule in to next level with the finished death star. While episode 7 was a small group called First order who suddenly in a short time had built a much more powerful weapon. It felt like lazy writing compared to rogue one. It also makes sense now why there is so little fighters attacking death star in episode 4, so many were lost in the battle above Scarife There is still a bit cheesy feeling in some parts in rogue one, for example how are imperial stations always so badly guarded, but trough the movie you still get that feeling that rebels are badly outnumbered and just succeed to get the data file in the end because they sent all forces to Scarif. The ending is a beautiful tragedy that will make many cry as you watch one by one of the rogue one group die.<br/><br/>Rogue one manages perfectly to capture Tarkin's ruthlessness, twice sacrificing own men while testing death star. Krennic is an worthy competent to Tarkin, who even dares to face Vader and question him, but in the end getting a very ironical death by the death star that he built.<br/><br/>Imperial troops still feels weak skilled, but this time a Star Wars movie ends in tragedy and nearly all main characters are killed in the end. The movie ending in a very dark scene with Darth Vader slaughtering rebels.<br/><br/>Rogue one manages to be a interesting story even with giving only short scenes to classic characters as Darth Vader, Mon Mohtma, Bail Organa, General Dodonna Rogue one is in my opinion one of the best Star Wars movies."
"tuna-tezgel","9","3","20","26 December 2016"," This movie is one with the force, the force is with this movie.
","I'll try to keep it short. This is the most mature Star Wars movie ever made. They say it is depressive. Of course it is. It is the story of a rebellion. They say it is morally tangled. Of course it is. It is the story of a revolution. Do you think any of the past revolutions in the history that somehow helped you to live in a considerably freer and more just world today were totally innocent in their course? Were they worth it? You tell me that. Why do you think the extremist (!) (or militant?) rebel is named as Saw 'Gerrera'? Think whose name it resembles.<br/><br/>I think the biggest dilemma a revolutionist faces is to have to betray his own belief at some point. He acts probably because of ideals such as freedom, justice, equality, etc. There are raw emotions such as trust, compassion and love at the basement of these ideals. And at one point, in order to reach his ultimate goal, he realizes he has to lie, act as somebody else or even maybe kill someone who doesn't really deserve it. An oppressor might be never facing with such dilemmas because he wouldn't care about others as much as he cares about himself. But for a freedom fighter such dilemmas might exist. And how many movies do you know that bring this paradox up: the only way to serve your belief is to betray it.<br/><br/>This movie is a pretty mature and well acted, well directed, well edited one. Beside this general stance of the movie, i must say (spoiler this might be), despite i never liked Vader even as a Sith Lord (as someone into the lore, i must say -arguably- there were true Sith such as 'Bane' in the past), his short scene at the end was epic. There i felt the terror (of course partially) poor soldiers felt when he boarded the ship. That is how you describe the horror of a Sith, the horror of darkness.<br/><br/>A very good movie. I hope we'll see more of this kind of mature Star Wars movies in the future. Please make some Old Republic movies too.<br/><br/>This movie is one with the force, the force is with this movie."

"JustinFrederic","10","2","11","17 December 2016"," A Phenomenal and Emotional Star Wars Film
","Quite frankly I was blown away by ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"".<br/><br/>To start off, the new characters are intriguing and original. The introduction to these characters can be viewed as slow-moving at first, but once they all come together the plot really gets moving, and it is fantastic! Unlike last year's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", the story-line of ""Rogue One"" does not borrow any plot points from other Star Wars films. It makes the movie less predictable and more captivating for cinema audiences. The dialogue is great; no cheesy lines akin to the prequel trilogy, and there are some speeches by characters that are very moving and emotional. The visual effects and the action in ""Rogue One"" are glorious and exciting. Some shots, especially in the third act, can be considered as the best in not just any Star Wars film, but any film period.<br/><br/>One thing that ""Rogue One"" did better than ""The Force Awakens"" did was the original story-line; which as mentioned earlier kept audiences guessing and engaged. Conversely, ""The Force Awakens"" hit the ground running, and did not need a slower build-up like ""Rogue One did"". The beginning of ""Rogue One"" is a bit choppy at times, but once everything gets rolling the film turns into a captivating, emotional, and overall phenomenal Star Wars experience.<br/><br/>There were plenty of emotional moments ""Rogue One""; arguably more of them than in any other Star Wars film. The film's ending is shocking and extremely emotional, which I rather enjoyed given that so many films these days play things safe and refuse to take risks. The fact that the audience feels a connection between themselves and the main characters really magnifies the film's ending.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a phenomenal and emotional Star Wars film. In my opinion, it is the best film of 2016, is on par with last year's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and is a serious contender for one of the best Star Wars films ever made."

It's simply not for kids!<br/><br/>There will be the haters of this movie and those that love it and we're already seeing it in the reviews. If it wasn't under the title Starwars there probably wouldn't be any haters at all.<br/><br/>This movie stands far apart from the others as there are no goodies and baddies with the lines between good and evil being blurred! All our favourite vehicles back from the original trilogy and it's packed with easter eggs and visual references to episode 4. The biggest bonus for all the StarWars fans out there is that We finally get to see Vader go all psycho with a scene that puts the Yoda fight scene in Attack of the clones to shame!<br/><br/>I Don't know if this is the best Starwars so far but it's definitely the most original. <br/><br/>Kudos! 9/10."

","The Star Wars canon has been revived (following earlier tangents for the Ewoks), with miscreant Felicity Jones recruited by the rebellion to help locate the Death Star's famous weakness which is the spine to the climax of the original episode A New Hope (ANH). In the Star Wars lineage, Rogue One occurs between Revenge of the Sith and ANH.<br/><br/>Reckon Flick Jones is going to be crowned most feisty/sexy Star Wars female character in the galaxy once this goes viral, such are her cherub-like facial features tempered by the grit and attitude of a space cowboy. She's no princess, but a package of galactic goodness all the same. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is also inspired casting, a menacing Director Krennic whose tactical positioning in the Empire hierarchy adds another layer to a character that could easily have just become another cliché. The remaining cast has depth and there's a couple of surprises in supporting roles which might evoke some fond memories of the original trilogy, though I'm not too sure the CGI character was such a good idea, despite perhaps being well intentioned.<br/><br/>Overall I was pleased with this retrospective; it wasn't as derivative as TFA, Flick Jones really stands-out from the new breed acting crowd, and was a good balance of homage and originality. Whether the franchise has enough original material to crank these out in annual procession til 2020 is seriously debatable, but Rogue One is a pretty decent benchmark on which to start a new generation of spin-offs."

","This movie is great for any Star Wars fans. Even tho its from a different perspective of characters, we are still very close with A New Hope, in term of time and environment. The story line has nothing amazing but the acting is excellent and is not overacted like episode VII. The ending is beautiful done and far from cliché. I won't spoil it but this is what you will remember the most in that movie. The pro: acting, special effect (not over the top as episode I, II and III) cinematography The con: script doesn't develop the character enough, soundtrack (they kept tracks from the original Star Wars but added new one that sound weird)"

"murf6691","9","3","21","25 December 2016"," Some of the poor reviews seem to have a problem with a diverse cast.
","This movie was the best since The Empire Strikes Back. It was unpredictable, violent, and a great way to start off the original trilogy. I have read some of the reviews and would like to address some common problems that some critics experienced. <br/><br/>The CGI for Leia was done poorly. This is a true statement. I was surprised they allowed this CGI version to be released. While this movie was great, but not perfect, this problem can be easily overlooked and her appearance, while important, is very brief. <br/><br/>The characters start dying quickly before the audience has a chance to develop a relationship. While it's true many of the main characters die, this is necessary for the plot to continue and the trilogy to be kicked off. It's easily comparable to Saving Private Ryan in this regard. Rogue One is a true suicide mission and a respectable one at that. <br/><br/>The film gave us that classic Star Wars feel, with a dark rush of violence and excitement. That being said, this is not a movie that should be seen in 3D. It will take away from the film. If you're seeing this movie for the special effects, you won't be wowed. Instead, the development of the Star Wars world is expanded in past themes, while introducing us to new people, planets, and cultures within the Star Wars universe. <br/><br/>The costumes for extras and bystanders were done to perfection. They stayed true to the original trilogy, while introducing us to new features. The same can be said for the setting. <br/><br/>Some critics seem to have a problem with more diversity in the Star Wars universe. With the billions of planets that exist in this universe, I'm surprised some critics think this is some liberal mumbo jumbo. But I'm not here to talk politics. I'm here to say the Star Wars universe is vast and has heroes that will come in all different kinds of shapes, colors, and species. <br/><br/>Sorry if you were expecting Jedi's, but if you know the story, it was appropriate that they weren't coming out in drones to fight the Empire. Instead, the Empire had the upper hand. A feeling I have not truly experienced since first watching Empire Strikes Back, and briefly experienced in Episode Three. <br/><br/>This is fresh escape from episodes 1-3. Instead of feeling campy and adolescent, Rogue One came off as pushing the line toward action thriller. The film is very respectable. It's not what we've been used to, but in a universe as vast as Star Wars, some people will be happy and others won't. If you like the Star Wars films with Jar-Jar Binks, vehicle and star ship upgrades, and can't live without a Jedi to Sith light saber battle, then you may not enjoy this film. <br/><br/>Rogue One is fresh and at the same time reminiscent. <br/><br/>Hope you all enjoy the film as much as I did."
"James_De_Bello","8","2","12","15 December 2016"," 8/10
","It feels kind of pointless to give a synopsis for this film given the fact that anyone even half conscious about cinema knows this film is coming out, but, for the sake of it, lets give it a go.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" is the first film in the anthology series of Star wars, which follows separate stories from the main series which focuses on the classical characters. Here the premise is simple, we follow the Rebellion as it comes to know about the Death Star and how they came to steal the plans which kick off the start of Episode IV.<br/><br/>Now, as someone that had many problems with Episode VII and as someone that really despised some choices made by Abrams and his team I had almost given up on the Star Wars stories as I knew them, well Gareth Edwards and Lucasfilm have turned the ship here for me, this film does right everything that Episode VII got wrong, it adds to the mythology of the universe, it brings to life a story in a intriguing and absorbing way and brings to life the Star Wars Galaxy in the perfect manner.<br/><br/>What starts out slow paced piece keeps building and building throughout the whole film and culminates in one, if not the, best third acts I have seen in recent times. The flow of this film, its pace, the way it moves from a place to the other and converges in the end is breathtaking. You are carried away on an adrenaline ride and don't want it to end.<br/><br/>Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy definitely manage to evolve the concept of the stealing of the plans of the Death Star into a fully fledged narrative film and they also manage to, I never believe I would have said this in my life, enrich the original trilogy with impressive world building and attention to minute details that are added and that give the story an incredible resonance in the mythology. The characters involved are all welcome additions to the canon and some of the dynamics established between them really hit home. Jyn Erso's evolution is relatable and it is surrounded by a cast of unique supporting characters who all add both to the emotional dynamic of the film and to the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>The places we are brought to also have some beautiful design to them, we visit new planets and they all have something to add to what we've already seen. The visual effects keep pushing boundaries and the way in which practical creatures are seamlessly integrated with the CGI elements, which remain unnoticeable, is the best you could ask for. The design of new, unseen elements of the universe is beautiful and fits the tone perfectly.<br/><br/>Yet, what ultimately made this experience an edge-of-your-seat ride, is just how flawlessly put together the action scenes are, how brilliantly they complement the rest of the film, how perfectly they drive the story forward, the stunning editing that brings them together, everything about these scenes is excellence and brilliance in filmmaking and to see a new Star Wars battle brought to life in such a way was something I never would have imagined. There are moments in this film that you will not believe they actually brought to life. Darth Vader has probably the most amazing of them all. This third act is simply the best of the best you could ever wish for in action cinema and the reason it works so well is just how fascinatingly it is built up in the first two acts. You arrive at it at the perfect time, with the perfect set up and once it starts rolling, moment after moment I was holding my breath in disbelief, there are set pieces that had me gagging with joy and adrenaline, I was exuberant at the sight of some sequences that were built in a way I could not have ever imagined. This film works so well, it flows so beautifully, the characters all have an arch and their moment to shine and the catharsis you feel when these moments hit is deeply moving.<br/><br/>As much as I loved and enjoyed the experience with the film there are some flaws to be pointed out. Nothing capital, in the sense that the story, the characters and the film just blow you away and work seamlessly throughout the whole film. The flaws are all just little inconsistencies that made the film occasionally loose a bit of steam (only to regain it minutes later). Firstly, Saw Gerrera is a terrible character, played really off beat by Whitaker and he is the only person in the film that doesn't belong here. The film could have done with a 10 minute trimming around the edges, there are a couple of short moments that really don't need to be there and would have tightened the already dramatically arresting pace even more. Finally, I have to admit that Michael Giacchino had a gargantuan job in scoring the film and it shows, he does stumble multiple times and whilst a couple of new good themes emerge he does not manage to bring the old ones in an organic way.<br/><br/>Saving other minor nerd details that don't belong in this review, ""Rogue One"" is a triumph of blockbuster action cinema, it's a breathtaking experience, with one of the most effective climaxes I have ever seen and a relentless pace that swept me in a galaxy far, far away and reminded me of how great it is to be carried away by Star Wars when it is done right and how adventurous and touching its stories can be."
"pradeepbs-54966","9","2","12","14 December 2016"," Lots of action
","I found this move way more fast paced than the Force Awakens. It's also very different from the other movies in the Saga as the characters are totally new. The pace is on par with Attack of Clones I must say. The plot is very typical. So no surprises there. Vader scenes are absolutely chilling. A very surprise ending. Lots and lots of fireworks in the skies. Stunning visual effects, perhaps the best of all Star Wars movies.. The movie definitely has more dark scenes than any movie in the saga. However, the dark scenes are somehow brought to life extremely well. Cinematography is top notch, there was only one scene which just felt oddly fit in the grand scheme of things.

Special effects are superb, direction and cinematography is spot-on. Really, the only fault I can find in it is the two ""uncanny valley"" CGI characters.

"kokoshawnuff","10","1","4","29 December 2019"," The BEST Star Wars
","Seen all the movies multiple times (some over 10x), Rogue One is far and away the best. The story is perfectly self contained (even if you don't know what happens before or after), the acting is so much better than any previous or subsequent (every actor in this movie is a real pro, including a few truly great ones), the script and the direction are effortlessly just right."
"davidmvining","7","1","4","19 December 2019"," Men on a Mission
","It's a man on a mission story that focuses way too much time on one of the members of the gang to too little emotional impact, even though that's the obvious desire, to create an emotional impact. The movie ends up working despite the repeated emotional faceplants involving its main character because they're a relatively small part of the overall film, the rest being a pretty straight forward telling of a The Dirty Dozen type story...in SPACE!!!!<br/><br/>The emotional problems with the film stem from the fact that Jyn Erso's character is caught between two father figures and neither one of them develops a relationship with her in the film itself. There's her father, the Imperial scientist with whom she, as a child and through a different actress than we see through the rest of the film, has a very brief scene where her father, Galen, tells her to run and hide from the Imperial officers coming to their remote farm in the first act. The other is Saw Gerrera, an extremist Rebel who takes in Jyn, but we never see them together in the first act. If the point of her journey, and the movie's emotional delivery, is supposed to be Jyn dealing with her absentee fathers, the movie never gives us a scene where Jyn is actually with them in any normal capacity. So, when she gets reunited with both of them at about the 30 minute mark of the film, the scenes are played with sweeping emotional music, but they fall flat. She's crying at reunions with people we've never seen her with, so it feels like it comes out of nowhere because it does. Everything feels incongruous to the situation because of the distinct lack of emotional connection.<br/><br/>The majority of the film, though, isn't dedicate to Jyn's empty emotional connections but to the assembling of a team in a gritty warlike setting. The rest of the characters outside of Jyn have what feels like the correct amount of character. They're individualized enough visually to stand out with strong enough individual motivations to get them on board with the adventure believably. It's the sort of thing you would expect from a man on a mission type film.<br/><br/>The mission itself is, of course, to locate the plans to the newest Imperial weapon, the Death Star. It all hinges on the lead engineer, Galen, having built a failure mechanism into the plans and getting that information to the nascent Rebel Alliance. As a side note, I've always preferred my pet theory that the fault was because the thermal exhaust port lead engineer couldn't get the funding he needed for all of the safety mechanisms, so he just finished at least one of them without the proper safety protocols. Anyway, this fault exists and the ragtag group of rebels end up going to the Imperial data storage facility on Scarif.<br/><br/>The setup around Scarif is complicated, presenting the band with a series of obstacles that are clearly defined. The storytelling of the final large action sequence is some of the clearest in the movie, despite the visual chaos on screen. The rebels need to go from a landing pad into the tower of a facility, grab the plans, and then get to the top of the tower and the large satellite to transmit it to the Alliance. There arrives a space battle as well when the reticent Alliance comes to support the rebels on the ground who left without Alliance permission.<br/><br/>This sequence is some of the brightest and prettiest of any action sequence in Star Wars, especially the stuff in space. There's also an inventiveness to the action, like the ramming of one Star Destroyer to hit another Star Destroyer, that feels fresh and fun at the same time.<br/><br/>The antagonists of the film are a mixed bag to a certain degree. We have three, and only one was really necessary. The best of them, and possibly my favorite antagonist in all of Star Wars is Director Krennic. He's purely a bureaucrat who's driven by the fact that he feels like he's not getting enough credit for the completion of the Death Star and that he got passed over for a promotion. It's the sort of tangible motive that's missing from most characters in general in big genre films. His drive is really fun. Then we have Tarkin, the CGI recreation of Peter Cushing (that really isn't that bad, just still inside the Uncanny Valley), who functions more as Krennic's antagonist. He still fits the film, though I would call him as much a distraction as anything else. And then we have Darth Vader, who was obviously added greatly in reshoots. His contributions to the film don't move anything in the film, including his much ballyhooed fight in the hallway which looks cool but happens after the central conflict is over, providing just one more meaningless obstacle that wasn't previously established and is only there to give Vader, who doesn't matter to the film in any way, a moment to shine.<br/><br/>So, the movie has some biggish flaws, like Jyn's emotional black hole and an overabundance of villains, but it also does a lot right. The men on a mission story is well handled. The central villain is great. The movie looks good, and it ends with a very good final sustained sequence. Not great, but a solid entertainment."
"Hyliannoyed","6","1","4","16 July 2019"," The Only Time In History Where Stormtroopers Actually Fired In A Straight Line
","Heavily praised as an excellent prequel to the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Rogue One does have a lot going for it. The exposition provided turns a quick text blurb in the opening crawl of IV into a full-scale adventure, with great effects and some surprising twists. However, this is prequel-we-never-knew-we-needed is far from perfect. For one thing, the main cast is shockingly bland and lifeless as a whole. Felicity Jones' character, Jyn Erso, is incredibly boring, pre-programmed with a tragic backstory for sympathy, but lacking any real substance or character. It's hard to tell whether the actress or the writing are to blame, but it's probably a bit of both. Diego Luna's Cassian Andor is kind of a creep, and it's hard to sympathize with him after his actions early on in the film. With the exception of Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk, who both bring some humor and personality to their roles, the rest of the ensemble is serviceable, but not stellar. This weak cast of characters makes what is intended to be a gut-wrenching finale, where they all bite the dust, to be less effective than it could be otherwise. Also, can we just appreciate that this may be the only time the Imperials are able to kill the main characters? Why did their aim get so much worse after this? Additionally, Darth Vader's Evil Villain Castle, complete with lava, is hysterically cliched, and the CGI-faces for Tarkin and Leia aren't quite believable yet, giving off a rather bizarre effect.<br/><br/>Finally, amidst all this style, substance, and occasional cleverness, did this movie really need to exist, or is it just an attempt to milk the franchise dry? The number of ""Star Wars Stories"" we get in the future will probably answer that question for us. Let's just hope Disney is smart enough to leave well enough alone, although I seriously doubt they will."

"CinematicInceptions","4","1","4","10 June 2018"," A Ranting Review.
","Do not read this if you liked this movie. I cannot fathom why people liked this over the last Jedi. Yes, Last Jedi had a lot of issues, but it had a lot of good stuff in it too. But I thought this whole movie was a problem in itself. I am at least thankful, like I was for Last Jedi, that whoever was fighting for a good story picked the right battles to win. I'm happier that the actual new Star Wars movies are decent and that this one is bad instead of the other way around. <br/><br/>This was one of the most overall generic movies I've ever seen. There's nothing compelling about it. We have a flat heroine, flat supporting characters, a flat villain, if you can even call Krennic a villain, generic dialogue and there's not even any suspense because everyone know how it ends. What was really annoying about it was that I could tell that the writers (or whoever was giving them orders) were trying to make the movie cool and fun and interesting at a lot of points. But when you don't give your characters respect, there's only so much you can do. Jyn Erso doesn't make any active decisions, which is basically the litmus test for a weak protagonist. And none of the other characters don't really help her out at all. Seriously, I only finished watching this to say that I had seen it and to see the Darth Vader scene at the end that I'd had hyped up for me (to which I say ""Mediocre""). <br/><br/>Also, the whole premise of the movie is not that good. There is a reason that A New Hope did not detail how they got the Death Star Plans: it's not that important or interesting. It's just a thing that happened. Any conflict that came up in the movie felt completely contrived and fake. The characters basically get mad at each other to make it seem like tensions are high, but it's fake. None of them really have distinctive points of view, so the conflicts are only as interesting as the subject of each argument, which is pretty weak to begin with. Anyone in the Rebellion that doesn't think they should destroy the Death Star or try to steal the plan and stuff is just wrong, and we as the audience know that, so there's nothing interesting about seeing them argue about it. This made the one debate scene near the end possibly my least favorite scene in any Star Wars movie. It could have been good if it had been a character moment for Jyn. Had I written this movie, I would have made Jyn be more reluctant to join the rebellion and go along, just doing things because she had to. Then when the rebellion realized that they needed to go get the plans, they would ask for volunteers and that could be the moment when Jyn decides she's in. The supporting characters could have reflected the different sides of her internal argument, with one fully believing in it, another feeding her apathy and influencing her throughout. I think that would have been a much better movie. Cassian's line at the end ""Your father would be proud of you"" really put the last nail in Rogue One's coffin for me. First of all, that line should be banned from movies along with ""we got company"" because it's been used so many times and is basically just tacked on nowadays. More importantly, Jyn was never looking for approval from her father. Yes, she completed his mission, but that's not the same thing and a line about her doing that would have been much more thematic.<br/><br/>I don't particularly think that this movie should have been made, but it could have been much better than it was. Like it if you want, but I don't see a whole lot to like. I haven't heard great things about Solo, but I think it will probably be better than Rogue One because it contains characters that the writers know they have to do a good job with. But if this is the way that the spinoff movies are going, count me out. Overall Rating: 4.5/10."

","Lucas's movies has always engulfed millions of fans in his ideas and vision of the universe. Despite the fact that Star Wars was created about 40 years ago, films dedicated to the series are still being made and fans from different eras come together to celebrate the never-ending thrill ride. Yet, out of all 8 Star Wars films, ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" started off strong and ended off even stronger. Through spectacular visuals and sound and the outstanding creativity and originality lies a plot with purpose of acting as a bridge for the older Star Wars films. <br/><br/>""Rogue One"" is critically acclaimed for its stunning use of digital imagery and computer- based animation. Viewers are enraptured by the realism Garett Edwards achieves, especially through the vivid details included in CGI. In the movie, General Tarkin, the ruthless military power seen in many previous Star Wars films, speaks in his usual demanding and condescending demeanor to Director Krennic. To most viewers, Tarkins appears so realistically that no one would suspect he is merely a collection of millions of pixels rather than an actual filmed actor. State of the art technology is implemented to create realistic effects that seems almost real to the viewers, making them feel part of the Star Wars universe. Yet, the most human aspects of the ""Rogue One"" story is told through the perspicuous portrayal of emotion by the actors. <br/><br/>The actors played their roles superbly. Their motions, facial expressions, tones, and volume of their voice all matched perfectly together, making their characters truly come to life. There are many amazing actors in the film, they even brought in the legendary Donnie Yen, an actor famous for the movie series known as ""Ip Man."" His character is Chirrut Inwe, a blind ""monk"" who uses martial arts and a staff as his weapons. This allowed Yen to really get into his character, fitting into a role he is most comfortable as: being a martial arts bad***. Another amazing actor would be Ben Mendelssohn who played Director Krennic, the villain. He outstandingly fits his role as a short-tempered and selfish character. He portrays Krennic's nature perfectly during a scene when General Tarkin proclaimed that he would tell the emperor the success of the Death Star; however, viewers could clearly see Krennic's facial expressions twist in frustration and anger. He even glares sharply at Tarkin and shouts, ""We are standing here amongst MY achievement."" Krennic even had spit spray in the air as he yelled this words making his acting all the more better. ""Rogue One"" proved not to disappoint by providing actors and actresses who not only could play their role, but also become their role. <br/><br/>Through everything Star Wars is adored for, from its sound to its visuals to the acting, one thing fans could thank ""Rogue One"" for is the comedy. It has always been a Star Wars tradition to implement comical scenes here and there to lighten the mood for viewers and get a few good laughs. To be honest, there are lots of comical scenes in ""Rogue One"" that is worth bringing up, but it is better to just say a few hilarious scenes to not spoil all the good parts of movie to those who have not watched ""Rogue One"" yet. One very funny scene in my opinion occurs in Jedha. When the Death Star shot its ominous green beam into the planet's core. For the first time, Star Wars fans get to see the destructive power of the Death Star at ground-view level. That is what ""Rogue One"" did so well, giving everything the fans wanted. As imminent death approached, Alan Tudyk otherwise known as K-2S0, a re-wired imperial droid, jokingly stated, ""There is a problem on the horizonÂ….there is no horizon."" Star Wars has always slipped in a few witty jokes and funny scenes in all their movies. Those little actions just make the movie much more memorable and helps loosen up tension. In fact, ""Rogue One"" had funny moments occur at the perfect times. There have been movies like ""Don't Breathe"" who inappropriately brings up jokes that just spoil the mood and atmosphere. Yet, ""Rogue One"" did none of that, the funny scenes were used to lighten the mood and progress the story. <br/><br/>The reason why ""Rogue One"" was able to obtain a worldwide gross box office sale of over $1 billion was because the movie was used to explain how ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" all began. ""Rogue One"" delivers to story-line of dedication, hope, and sacrifice. It is the type of movie that you would never expect Star Wars to have in its franchise, yet it has so much importance to it. ""Rogue One"" has kept the nature and concept of the Star Wars franchise, something many Star Wars fans can appreciate, but just added new characters to fall in love with. Of course, ""Rogue One"" could not beat the original Star Wars films in the original franchise in terms of rating, but it still holds a special place in many people's hearts because of how the movie kept the people at the edge of their seats and was able to grab their attention all the way throughout. Truly in my opinion I believe everyone who has not watched the Star Wars franchise yet should watch the entire series from beginning to end. I will admit to being a Star Wars fan myself, but I genuinely believe that non Star Wars fans will come to love the franchise as millions of others around the world have."

","Set immediately before Episode 4, Jyn Erso is the daughter of Galen Erso, a senior scientist for The Empire. They have not seen each other in 15 years. Due to her father's position, Jyn is liberated from Empire imprisonment by the Rebel Alliance. Word has come to them that he is helping build a weapon that tilt the balance of power firmly in favour of The Empire - the Death Star. Reluctantly, Jyn is drawn into the struggle.<br/><br/>Pretty formulaic but reasonably interesting. Set up is pretty basic and plot feels implausible and contrived at times, plus the characters are not that engaging. <br/><br/>Character depth, engagement and soundness of plot are not what this movie is about. Action scenes, adventure and CGI are, and here it does pretty well. Quite exciting, with a momentum that keeps you watching. Does degenerate into fairly predictable fight scenes and plot development towards the end though.<br/><br/>Overall: okay, and on par with Episodes 4-6. Certainly better than Episodes 1-3, though this is an easy feat."

","So before we continue with Star Wars 8 (or VIII to be more exact), we get this solo movie. And after Episode 8 we'll get the next (Han) solo project to fill the time until Episode 9. This one concentrates on the story before New Hope, which was made fun of on the internet as many can imagine. People were talking about leaked pics of the sequel to Rogue One, posting pictures of Episode 4 (A new Hope).<br/><br/>If you are not too invested in the time-line or the franchise, you may not see all the small details and hints to the other movies, but you will still able to enjoy a Science Fiction movie that is suspenseful enough and which does what it set out to do (no pun intended).

Star wars is always famous for its involvement of unknown actors for the roles, but here we had felicity jones( who i loved in theory of everything), mads mikkelson(Hunt), forest whitaker(phonebhooth, TLKS, other new actors almost did their part . When it comes to story, we all know how the movie is going to end, but even though it was predictable, they still manages to keep us focused. overall i would say IMO The best star wars movie order is Episode 5,4,6,3,FA,Rogue one,2,1."
"TxMike","Null","1","4","30 April 2017"," With a strong resemblance to prior Star Wars movies it is good entertainment.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.<br/><br/>""Star Wars"" and I go way back, all the way to the ancient time of 1977 when the first one came out, later re-named ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" after three prequels were made. But that 1977 classic, the one that made Harrison Ford famous as Han Solo, will forever be the definitive ""Star Wars"" movie.<br/><br/>So, how does this one compare? Very well. They pretty much stuck to the original Star Wars sensibilities and even have short cameos with Darth Vader and an aging Princess Leia. The story is rather simple, the resistance is trying to get plans for the Empire's planet-destroying death star, and that requires travel to a number of different planets in the galaxy. The movie relies on frequent conflicts to generate action and cool sound effects.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, we first see her as a young girl hiding out as the Empire kidnaps her scientist father, he is needed to make the death star workable. When she grows up she leads the resistance effort to preserve the galaxy, far far away.<br/><br/>Good 'popcorn' entertainment and Jones is very good in her role, as well as a number of other good, experienced actors. But none of them are Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>As a final comment, our knowledge of science and space have come so far in 40 years. We now know that a galaxy typically has hundreds of billions of stars, likely billions of planets, and just to cross a medium sized galaxy takes light over 100,000 years. In reality human travel across much of a galaxy is impossible, the fictional Empire could not destroy the galaxy even if they had the most powerful weapon. Imagination and fantasy in movie-making are nowhere near reality, but that's OK, as long as we can reflect on that and smile about it."

","I didn't turn out to see this at the cinema - the first Star Wars movie I've ever missed. I was so disgusted with JJ Abrahams' soulless, shameful plot-holed rip-off The Force Awakens I stayed at home and saved my cash. But, like the dutiful Star Wars fan that I am, I gave this a try on blue-ray....and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Rogue One is not perfect - indeed its third act, the one supposedly changed by the studio, merely rehashes the original trilogy again to a large extent. with Imperial Walkers guarding the storage facility where the Death Star plans are hidden, charges planted, etc. The ground battle resembles Return Of the Jedi's sans Ewoks!<br/><br/>But I liked the story overall. This is a grittier version of the Rebel Alliance than any yet seen. It had some weight to it; and the sense of desperation engulfing the rebels is well-realised. This is not a romp. And it isn't intended to be.<br/><br/>The cast felt better than those in Force Awakens. A strong female lead, yes; but not a perfect jedi master without training Rey, or a sanitary attendant leading an assault on the 3rd Death Star. No emo sith-lord wannabes. Hurrah!<br/><br/>Characters are good. Needed a little more depth to really work. Donny Yen's character is great, but he needed more screen time. The best of them is surely the reprogrammed Imperial droid. He was great. Diego Luna was excellent.<br/><br/>Some downsides. Vader looked odd in his brief scenes. His mask/helmet was far less imposing; almost like something is missing. His first scene was pretty poor, his battle with the rebels much more like it. The CGI Tarkin was not good. The actor voicing him sounded nothing like Peter Cushing to my ears. If only Peter were still with us. What a class act he was. Leia's CGI was a bit better - probably because it was much briefer.<br/><br/>Director Garath Edwards did a fine job with this. Much better than the hack Abrahams. I enjoyed this film, liked the references to Kyber Crystals etc. but please no more Death Stars. Star Wars needs to move forward now, and give us something new. Not sure Last Jedi is going to deliver it...but fingers crossed."

Although you'll see a lot of its known gear movie-recycled again, robots, space ships etc., don't worry, it just adds to the fun. Way better IMO than the new sequels of the Star Trek saga. Graphics, CGI are remarkably excellent, and yet without excessive overuse. The story is surely simple, but solid, good enough. For the sake of the fun, a new robot is introduced, with better entertaining qualities than the previous R2-D2 IMO. Also in general the humor is appropriate and adds to the fun.

After the first hour the movie is enjoyable, but my thoughts of leaving the cinema during the first hour is probably the only thing I will remember in ten years from now.

The film focuses on a group of characters who do not appear in any of the first six ""Star Wars"" films.<br/><br/>This first ""Star Wars"" spin-off film had many things going for it. Unlike the previous year's ""The Force Awakens,"" this film had very little to prove, which meant that it was allowed to focus more on good storytelling. The media's emphasis on the regular episodes of the main ""Star Wars"" saga meant that far less about the plot of this film was divulged to the public. This movie featured more than one surprise, none of which will be disclosed here.<br/><br/>Although this movie was a spin-off, it was every bit as engaging as the regular episodes of the ""Star Wars"" saga. The characters were interesting and likable. The film featured a nice mixture of humor and drama. The space battle sequence as well as many other visuals in the film were spectacular.<br/><br/>While this film was not one of the episodes of the main saga, fans will undoubtedly find the film to be a very satisfying viewing experience.

The film is highly recommended!"

","With this movie not being an episode there was an opportunity to curate an original working title to add to the Star wars universe. I was very disappointed with the final cinema cut. At over 2 hours you would hope for some interesting deeper story lines not just providing context on previous events to ""A new hope"" but providing a further insight into the Star wars universe. Instead the first 30mins ticked by with little explanation (nor was it required) jumping between planets like a child learning how to Po go stick. This pace slowed as the film seemed to draw on inspiration from ""Interstellar's"" TARS and went into special effect overdrive similar to episodes 1-3. The fight scene logistics seemed particularly bad with plenty of repeat footage thrown in from all angles and the climax was predictable. Overall I was quite disappointed hence the midway rating."

","What do we expect? Yet another StarWars installment, Disney's uptake on an eternal story, on a supposedly meaningful universe to tell infinite stories in. That's not the stuff of legend.<br/><br/>With those expectations you certainly can't complain. Disney continues to nourish Star Wars back to health, adding some grim, dark side to this universe. It is a rather safe approach, using the biggest untold yet referenced mission the good old films had to offer. The characters are likable, the force is rescued from overuse and receives some mystic balm. Yet again RedLetterMedia delivered Disney's road map - not a bad thing. The cameos were a bit overdone and first get us into the film to then question the film's own comfort as a stand alone. All in all a job well done - no more and no less. The routinely qualities Disney brings in are exactly what Star Wars needed after George Lucas' debacle. However: it remains to be seen whether Disney allows innovation and growth. They do continue gathering the right ingredients to make it possible. Although it is necessary, even commendable, to cling to safety and stability for now the same concept would come down to morbid necromancy after half a dozen more films like this. They'll need courage and a keen eye later down the road, to allow Star Wars to actually change, to offer new stories in an old universe. For now it couldn't be any better. There is hope for the Yedi universe.<br/><br/>Decent entertainment, professional through and through. Overall a good film and worth recommending to all the Star Wars fans out there. 7/10"
"yapmd","7","1","4","16 January 2017"," Better than the last SW
","I like that this had a story rather than just a reboot! The story is book-ended by the original Star Wars, re titled a new hope. The story moves at a slower pace than I would have liked. Fell asleep twice near the same spots because it was slow, and the scene was dark for the prolonged night scenes. Did wake up in time to see the ending, with the actions and daylight views. Am I the few that noticed both the last two pictures were dominated by female heroine? More for girl power! They did bring back a few characters from the original Star Wars, so best to know who the original stars are. I guess they used a lot of cgi, or else those actors did not age much over 30+ years ago. I hear Disney plans to release one movie a year to recoup the expenses to buy out George, this is a better effort but I cannot see the franchise make mega bucks for the next one unless the story and special effects improve. Who wants to watch another remake?"

"skanklover_69","6","1","4","9 January 2017"," Not a stand alone movie
","Rogue One is NOT a stand alone movie. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>It is a direct prequel to Star Wars IV: A New Hope. The ending directly links straight into the beginning of that film. It sets it up. <br/><br/>Really the numbering of the whole movie series should be changed. Rogue One should be Star Wars Episode IV, and the others after it should be incremented by 1. For example New Hope should be V and so on.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself I didn't really like any of the characters. While the sarcastic robot made me laugh, he still can't hold a candle to R2 or C3PO. For this reason the fact that... <br/><br/>:MASSIVE SPOILER:<br/><br/>literally everyone dies didn't worry me too much.<br/><br/>The plot narrative became quite confusing at times and was hard to follow.<br/><br/>Ben Mendelson's character was a really weak villain.<br/><br/>The action scenes were solid CGI fests.<br/><br/>The final act, with the appearance of Vader, joining right into the start of A New Hope gave me chills though. That was a great pay off. Also the scene with the two main characters holding each before they died had some emotion. Having said that they could have milked it for a lot more. Sacrificing themselves, not knowing if it was in vain, could have been focused on. I guess it's a family movie and you can't make it too gut wrenching.<br/><br/>If this was indeed a stand alone sci-fi movie I would probably give it a 4. It was a turgid mess with no engaging characters. It's because it does add to the movie series story that it's worth watching."
"TheSunnyBoy","Null","1","4","9 January 2017"," Dull and unmemorable characters in an otherwise great movie
","It's effortless to say that Rogue One is a good movie and that most of its elements are worthy of praise. I was very impressed by the visual execution; given that it takes place immediately before A New Hope, the movie had to incorporate pieces of the 1970 sci-fi look while simultaneously keeping it fresh, a task that succeeded very well. Neither was there nothing wrong with the main plot, with a coherent and thoughtful story from beginning to end. Acting was flawless, the underlying dark tone powerful. The list of merits of the movie are clear. <br/><br/>However, there is one major weakness with Rogue One: poor character development. During pretty much the whole movie, I felt like I didn't care squat about the fate of any of the main characters. The fact that the background of Jyn Erso, the main protagonist, is only briefly explained might have been acceptable, but simultaneously seeing her character develop from uncooperative and quite emotionless to a highly enthusiastic, initiative taking leader of a rebel squad just like that was too much. While most of the rebels expressed their doubts as to her plans to steal the Death Star schematics on screen, none of Jyn's weaknesses had really been conveyed to us in the audience. And the more you only focus on portraying someone's strengths, the more that character becomes a mere object; like a robot that cannot be symphatized with. This was particularly true of the blind Chirrut Îmwe who, based on his fighting skills, might just as well have been the inventor of the Jedi order. I mean, even my garden gnome has more soul than that character! And truth is, it's hard to have emotions towards characters without souls.<br/><br/>Of course, my lack of sympathy for the characters might not all be the fault of Rogue One; given that Disney's revival of the SW universe has led to a horde of new characters having been introduced to the Star Wars universe in a short amount of time, maybe it's just too much to process for a brain that is rarely exposed to the world of Star Wars. I recognize this might be true, and don't therefore want to be to hard on the movie. But still, I feel that SW would greatly benefit from characters that are fallible and imperfect, whose skills and fates are unreliable and unknown and therefore have a soul (ironically, the droids C-3PO and R2D2 are my favourite characters precisely because of this). <br/><br/>It's unfortunate that Rogue One despite its many merits failed to deliver such characters."
"Teyss","7","1","4","9 January 2017"," Solid Episode 3.9: an extra brick in the SW edifice
","After all, it is not so complex to make a good action movie.<br/><br/>DON'TS. No Jar-Jar Binks. No ridiculous Ewoks. No Muppet Show, as in Jabba's lair at the beginning of Episode 6. Don't cast the worst actor of the galaxy in the main role, as in Episodes 2 and 3. Don't uselessly plagiarise previous Episodes, as Episode 7. No gratuitous and/or inflated action. No awkward situations. No idiotic dialogues. No blabbering about the Force. No pseudo-Freudian heaviness about being one's father, about killing one's father, about finding one's path.<br/><br/>DO'S. Keep it simple, at last. Build a solid plot without inconsistencies. Maintain pacing, alternating fast and slow scenes. Justify action scenes with coherent reasons. Edit effectively. Insert funny dialogues. Cast talented actors (Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, etc.). Use efficient special effects for a valid point. Show gorgeous landscapes. Pay attention to details (examples: the broken glass falling into the vault highlights how imposing the place is; when Darth Vador emerges from darkness with his lightsaber at the end, the effect is striking). Renew the soundtrack and only hint at standard SW themes instead of recycling them throughout (although this can feel underwhelming for real fans). Resurrect late actors with CGI (Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher), even though the result is not entirely satisfying. Have a mixed ending, where the mission is fulfilled but at the cost of many casualties.<br/><br/>Also, solve Episode 4 flaws. I have been wondering for almost 40 years: why the heck did the mighty Empire allow such a dangerous weakness in the powerful Death Star, which they built with great care? And how did the Rebels manage to get the secret plans? Now we know. ""Rogue One"" convincingly links with Episode 4: it purposefully stages situations and characters of the latter; it probably ends a few minutes or hours before Darth Vador jumps into an Imperial spaceship to chase Princess Leia who just flew away (regarding this, it would have been even better to see R2-D2 in her ship, in order to fully reconcile with the beginning of Episode 4, when she gives the plans to the droid). Nonetheless, the movie is more than just a spin-off: it is a full-blown Episode per se, with a developed story, credible new characters and real qualities. References to Episode 4 are not invasive: there is a fair balance between connection to the saga and autonomy.<br/><br/>WHAT IS MISSING? The movie is not very original, it feels rather formatted; but then is it possible to completely overhaul a franchise that already has 7 episodes? There is not much character depth; actually the most touching role is K-2SO and we almost feel sorry when he goes down. Apart from Chirrut's fighting skills, action scenes are standard. Some emotional scenes are a bit silly, although they are limited. This is why I can only rate the movie 7/10. Good, but not amazing.<br/><br/>STILL ""Rogue One"" is for me the best of the franchise to date. Here, I have to confess I am not a huge SW fan (sincere apologies to the real fans, the Force is not given to everybody). Second best would be Episode 4: pleasant, not too serious, sets a mythology, however the style and special effects are dated. Third best would be Episode 5: truly great scenes, yet there is too much talk about the Force and Darth Vader's revelation he is Luke's father falls flat (sorry, fans). Then Episodes 2 and 3: some good scenes but mostly over the top. Episodes 1, 6 and 7 have already fallen into oblivion.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" reviews are very contrasting. Some fans find it great, others feel cheated, which I can understand: the movie is not overwhelming and does not renew the saga. Yet it is entertaining, no-nonsense and visually impressive.<br/><br/>Indeed, appreciating action movies is very subjective because the border is thin between good and terrible. There is a subtle balance to find in dialogues, pacing, action, emotions and music: too much or too little of an ingredient, and it flops. Also, impeccable acting is paramount: the same role can feel awesome or awful depending on who plays it. For instance in ""Rogue One"", Chirrut and Baze are credible, individually and as a pair; however with less good actors they would just have been laughable. Likewise, the same dialogue can feel right or inane depending on how it is said (for instance between Galen and Orson or when Jyn and Saw meet again). Hence appreciation can easily fluctuate from one side to the opposite.<br/><br/>The main reason for this volatility is that action movies essentially rely on form with limited content, and form alone is always on the edge since it cannot be compensated by interesting substance. To me ""Rogue One"" passes the test, to an extent."

","Finally we get to see Star Wars movies are more than just finding the weak spot of a gigantic weapon, opening fire and destroying it. Rogue one had a wonderful plot which connected the construction (and the weaknesses) of the Death Star to the beginning of A New Hope. The formation of the Rebellion, how and why the Empire had its weakness about the weapon, how the plans of that were acquired were all executed in a delightful way. The overall setting was constructed with respect to the original movies. Storm troopers, imperial structures and star ships, rebel alliance ships, and (obviously) the main characters were aligned to the original story line. Not much deviation from what Lucas had in mind, yet such diversity in planets, species, robots, soldiers and many more. Hopefully the next movies will be like this one, more than presenting unknown characters and more gigantic star killers!"

"veensepeper","7","1","4","2 January 2017"," Awesome action. Bland characters.
","I'm sorry. I like to write reviews without spoilers, but this time there is no way to work around it. So let's just jump ahead to the spoiler part, you'll find my opinion later on.<br/><br/>The reason I spoil, has to do with the rewrites and re-shoots. It shows. It painfully shows. Due to them, character motivations made no sense and plot point either came out of nowhere or went nowhere or both. Most prominent examples (spoilers) are the mind reading tentacle beast that was supposed to drive this one pilot crazy, and the reasons for the Forrest Whitakker character to remain on the planet that partially exploded. He said he was tired of running. But no hint was given in the movie of him even running at all. He was - for as far as he was established - established as a fighter, not a runner. Him staying behind MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!<br/><br/>Beyond the re-shoots, characterization is lacking throughout the entire movie. They are not properly built op, so they rise no viewers interest. Most of them are so unmemorable, you don't even get to remember their name. They hit plot points, but they have no character arcs. Well, the ninja zen guy was coming close to being a memorable character. But overall, K2S0, the robot, gets to have the most personality.<br/><br/>The whole movie is plot driven, not character driven. It really really really hinges on being related to Star Wars. As a viewer, you get to care for the mission and the rebellion, but not really for the individual characters. Therefore, scenes that were supposed to be very emotional, such as the respective deaths of Forrest Whitakker and Mr Urso, lacked all impact whatsoever.<br/><br/>Some of the nods to Star Wars were great, some were out of place. Most awful was the appearance of 'testicle chin guy' and 'you'll be dead guy' for no reason. Kind of like cramming Chewie and Boba Fett into the prequels, just making the universe smaller. Then, there was Darth Vader's agility in the final scene. Him doing all this lightsaber acrobatics in the final scene looked great - but made no sense. You don't see him this agile at any point in the original trilogy. Vader living on Mustaphar made no sense, but not in a way that was disturbing. Just... weird... Who would build his house at the site where you got your limbs chopped off by your friends?<br/><br/>The incorporation of Mon Mothma and Senator Organa into this movie was done pretty good. Knowing these characters from previous movie provided the emotional anchor that the original new characters lacked. They didn't steal the show, though. They worked as side characters, and did their jobs correctly. Going back to Yavin4 was good. And the C-3PO and R2D2 cameo was done perfectly. It wasn't dragged out, and it made sense for them to be where they were. Perfect.<br/><br/>Digital Tarkin and digital Leia were... okay I guess...<br/><br/>And general not-Ackbar... was... there... Did he have to be a fish person? Either have the fish person be Ackbar, or have him be another race. Or, if you insist on having him a fish person, then at least make his character significantly different from Ackbar. What are you saying, Star Wars? All fish people are the same? That's racist!<br/><br/>But, the final battle was pretty awesome. However, if you expect the scene from the trailer of the Jyn character facing a Tie-fighter, while only wielding a blaster... IT'S NOT THERE! I enjoyed seeing a Saving Private Ryan type of movie in the Star Wars universe, but it would have been so much better if it had actual characters.<br/><br/>PS; what's the deal with the tentacle mind monster thing?"

","Again, I'm not showing favoritism because I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan. This is my honest and unbiased review and feelings of this side story of the ""Star Wars"" franchise. This film was awesome! It starts off a couple of weeks before Episode IV and leads up to the opening scene of it. It's so perfect and the ending of this film had chills going through my body! Along with Episode III, this prequel more than made up for my dissatisfaction of Episode l and Episode ll. Even if you're not really a ""Star Wars"" fan you will enjoy this film. My father-in-law knows nothing about ""Star Wars"" and he saw it and he even enjoyed it. He was all in to this film. Gareth Edwards did a magnificent job in keeping this film close to the original trilogy and bringing that feeling of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy back to the big screen. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones, playing the part of Jyn Erso, and Forest Whitaker, playing the part of Saw Gerrera, brought a wonderful addition to the ""Star Wars"" franchise. As a fan of his work I just wish I could have seen more of Forest Whitaker in this film. It would have been nice if he had a larger role. ""Rogue One"" was action packed and it had enough drama to balance it all out and the special effects were breath taking. Of course the story-line and plot were simple and direct but hugely effective because it simply had to sum up the beginning of Episode IV. At first I didn't know how the idea of having a side ""Star Wars"" story being plugged into the main story- line would be but the way George Lucas and Gareth Edwards laid it out, it was pure genius! I even had to give applause at the end of this film.<br/><br/>I knew this film was going to be something great even before I pre bought my ticket. I didn't even have to look on this website to see what kind of ratings it got and I didn't even want to. I bought my ticket early on a Friday for a Tuesday the 27th night showing not knowing the fate of Carrie Fisher, low and behold she died the day I was set to see ""Rogue One"" so when I saw the end of the last scene of this film chills ran through my body. ""Rogue One"" is a definite must see and this film isn't over hyped, it's as good as everyone says it is. I highly recommend seeing this film rather you're a fan or not."
"GomezAddams666","8","1","4","31 December 2016"," The BEST Star Wars movie to date
","This is my last Movie Review of 2016, so let's make it count.<br/><br/>I think this is by far the Best Star Wars film I have ever seen. This felt like a very well made war movie and those who know me know I'm not a big fan of war movies but this one made the exception rather clear, while explaining why I'm not a fan of the genre at all.<br/><br/>In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story there is a battle between the Rebels and the Empire just like in every other film of the saga, but what made this one different is that the Rebel army is presented just as vicious and blood thirsty as the Empire. Traditional war movies and even the previous Star wars films make it clear as day who the good guys and the bad guys are, but since the ""good"" guys are just as ruthless as their evil counter part I felt myself inclined to root for the Empire more than once.<br/><br/>Technically speaking Garrett Edwards did an amazing job directing this talented assemble cast led by the amazing performance of Felicity Jones. And while Diego Luna, Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker, Mads Mikkelsen and the rest of the cast are good, this would not have been nearly as good if it wasn't for Felicity Jones and her amazing performance that leads the audience into following every step of her heartbreaking story.<br/><br/>Speaking of casting it was very emotional to see Peter Cushing on screen again, the FX were so good that you could actually feel it was him on screen.<br/><br/>All and all I thoroughly enjoyed this film, a great movie to end the year and ta great excuse to still be emotionally attached to the events that happened ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."""

","I consider rating movies starting from the topmost vote, i.e. 10, and then detracting for each weak spot/issue I think to discover. This movie is a 7/10 and here are the weak spots:<br/><br/>1: CGI - I don't think it was necessary to have Takin and Leia fully featured close to real actors - holographic transmissions could have done better if they didn't want to rewrite the story. The point is, while it looks good, it isn't convincing at all! I think all of this because they 2: desperately want seamless story integration: this is neither feasible, it seems, nor it does make any sense: why do you have to put figures in it that we know already and are not taking any part in this story? Just to ""recall"" that we're in the Star Wars universe? What's the reason to briefly show the two criminals from the Mos Eisley cantina or R2D2 together with C3PO? Why does the movie end there right where episode IV/I takes off? If there wouldn't be this pressure, a lot of wrong issues could have been avoided: a CGI Leia, a insanely mad Vader (at the beginning of ep IV/I his mood is then different), the story about the death-star plans (did they examined the dialogue between Vader and Leia in the beginning of ep IV/I precisely before writing/shooting Rogue One)? 3: Music ... incredibly, there's no Williams music expect for the ending. Which could have been a good thing IF the music was inspiring and compelling... it isn't. The sad thing: I noticed it somewhere in the first third. It sounds like a disinterested music score, not really amplifying what's going on screen.. as if it was written for another cut of the same movie.<br/><br/>The plus point go to the actors, to the action sequences, to the story (expect for the above aspects) and to photographic shooting. Some shots are astounding. <br/><br/>However, it's Star Wars. I won't watch this one a second time, but will wait for the blu-ray release."
"RyanEardley01","6","1","4","27 December 2016"," An interesting start to the Star Wars Anthology movies.
","Rouge One was directed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla)and was written by Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) and Tony Gilroy (State of Play) and I myself was very happy with the outcome of this film not really the writing but I loved the action scenes in this movie and the fact there was so many nostalgic moments. The story follows Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything) helping the rebels get there hands on the plans to the death star now going in I thought there would be no real surprises but they throw in a lot of surprises there which explains a lot about the original trilogy and the Death star. So I would say the writing was there but it just didn't feel like I had that connection to the characters like I did with the other movies even if this is one movie unlike the three with the original movies or prequels or even the new I didn't care about a single one.I will admit going in I was kind of worried that this movie might suck not because its a Star Wars prequel but because its something new they have never done an anthology movie and this is there first attempt and they did a really good job and due to the lack of advertising compared to last years episode 7 which was everywhere. Overall there are cool nostalgic stuff in this movie for hardcore Star Wars fans but should be a good film for the casual audiences."
"derwatz","7","1","4","22 December 2016"," Like >>Guardian of the Galaxy<< only worse
","First, the technical specs are bad. There is this shaky camera, I do not like so much. I 3D, the picture jerks and becomes very blurry. They should have done it in 60 fps. Some scenery's make no sense at all and the action is illogical in some places. For me, episode 1-7 were much better. Its a good film, but not god enough to be Star Wars. Only the robot had some funny moments, the rest was dark, cheap and dusty. At the end, everyone is dying, thanks for that; not! At last, the cast was not bad at all. If You are a STAR WARS fan, You possibly understand what I am trying to say. Their could have been so much more of a god story, but they spoiled it for me."
"commonacquaintance","8","1","4","22 December 2016"," A fun film though not perfect
","Star Wars Rogue one is, in my opinion, the best prequel to date and I'll admit that I enjoyed it more than The Force Awakens. However that does not mean that this film is perfect.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>One of the first things that stands out about Rogue One is the visual effects, which are very powerful and really help to bring the star wars universe alive. This is also helped out by the CGI which was a bold move, though worked. There was also a surprising amount of humour which wasn't over used. Furthermore, while there were battle scenes similar to what we have seen in the past, this was probably one of the more well completed ones. You did get a real sense of good vs evil and how the whole world is effected by the imperial's. In addition there were also good nods to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Cons: Now while I liked many of the main characters I do feel that they were a little wooden in places and that the script could have been richer. Also the plot felt similar in some places (a space battle where a base must be destroyed in order for the good guts to carry on with their mission)though this wasn't a major issue. One thing that I didn't like about this film is how all the main characters died. I knew it was probably going to happen anyway, but I didn't feel like that all had to die in the final act. If, say one of the characters had died unexpectedly, this could have made the imperials seem like more of a threat that the storm troopers just missing their targets all the time.<br/><br/>In conclusion I enjoyed this film and think that any star wars fan would love it."
"secretzfan","7","1","4","20 December 2016"," The first Star Wars anthology works well
","To preface I did read Catalyst: A Star Wars story before watching the movie so my opinion is through that eye. This movie for me was amazing. I mean I really loved this film quite a bit. I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did with Force Awakens, but I still came out with a huge grin on my face when it was all over. <br/><br/>The film starts a little bit slow. It takes time to introduce all the characters and tie up some plot points that were left in the book. The movie is a bit bumpy with the lack of a opening crawl which I felt was a huge issue for me and something this movie could of used to better set the scene and explain to fans where this movie takes place in the Star Wars time line. <br/><br/>But from the second act to the last the movie really ramps up and gets really intense. Characters die at the hands of enemies. Things start to falter very quickly as the rebels fight to make sure that the death star hands don't get back into the hands of the Empire before it is to late for things to change. <br/><br/>The character of Krennic is a really interesting character who you can't help but feel bad for. This is a man who wanted nothing than to be accepted by Darth Vader and Tarkin as a equal, but sadly was never able to do that as the two absolutely shun him away, and never hear him out. <br/><br/>Felicity Jones I thought could of used a bit more depth to her character though. We get some idea of what type of person she is and her back story, but it sadly isn't enough to really make us care about her in the way we do for some of the other characters. <br/><br/>This whole film really is lacking in the character department as it focuses a lot on plot. And that is a little bit of a hindrance and makes it not as fun and vibrant as the Force Awakens, but even so it is still a very strong film that is a much needed add on to the rest of the Star Wars universe."
"NDbportmanfan","7","1","4","20 December 2016"," Disney Goes Bleak this Time Around... and it Works
","Star Wars: Rogue One focuses on a team trying to capture the plans of the Death Star right under the Imperial's nose. That is all you need to know going into this movie. Well that and the fact that Rogue One takes place before the original trilogy but far after the prequels. It was a great set up movie for A New Hope. <br/><br/>I would like to point out the fact that this movie felt more like a Suicide Squad movie compared to the DC mess we got in August. The whole story was told in such a dark tone. The mission they went on no one else wanted to take or for that matter thought could be accomplished. The team consisted of members that one could deem anti-hero's as they did both morally just and unjust things. Audiences didn't care about their pasts and still rooted them on when times got tough because they were given enough backstory on the main two characters.<br/><br/>As for the minor characters they all did well in their limited screen time. Especially K-2SO, I didn't understand the praise people gave BB-8 as he seemed like a rehash or R2 but people like what they like I guess. K-2SO was very funny. The jokes were well timed and were fitting for the situation the team was currently dealing with at the time.<br/><br/>I found the action to be very entertaining as well. I've heard people say there is too much of it but compared to today's action blockbusters I'd say the movie is well balanced. When I think of too much action my head goes to the Transformers movies as they are a real headache to sit through especially in the theaters.<br/><br/>The sets looked nice and well done and the face rendering work done was top notch. I truly wasn't expecting to see Mr. Cushings face on the screen. I was half expecting the role to be recast but I was happy it was not.<br/><br/>The only real fault with this movie is the lack of a larger story. I know the movie is meant to be a little piece to the SW universe but I can't honestly give a movie that is focused on action scenes and basic story higher than an 8. An 8 is still very good in my book."
"bencevazulwoller","8","1","4","20 December 2016"," The beginning of everything
","Rouge One is the first Star Wars episode which explains things to us.<br/><br/>First, we start to understand why the civil war began. Secondly, we understand the beginning of the original 1st Star Wars episode which came out in 1977.<br/><br/>This film contains loads of new information and high technologies. These technologies like 3D animation didn't exist in the old days or if they did, they were very much in their infancy. The actors were good and the acting was awesome too. Especially I really liked the overwritten robot's style. I was a little bit upset because Han Solo didn't take part in the film. What made a big impression on me was that Darth Wader was in the film. (Thank you Star Wars!!!) The music was brilliant again. The music is a little bit remade but it sounds very cool. Many thanks to Michael Giacchino. The main character was Jyn Erso, who is a girl. It's a bit strange for me after the old versions of Star Wars films that the main character is a female. Like in the Force Awakens.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the plot is interesting, the effects are breathtakin' and the whole story is amazing. I really enjoyed the film and I absolutely recommend it to everybody. Many thanks because you read my little review of the Rouge One. Have a great time."
"ielixzia","9","1","4","19 December 2016"," Fast Paced...for a Reason
","Rogue One tells the story of what's effectively the birth of the Rebellion - it was dark, and it was dirty, and it happened very quickly.<br/><br/>The story is told effectively from the viewpoint of Jyn Erzo; we learn some of her backstory, but not the entirety of it - just enough to understand who she is, and why she'd be selected by the Rebels for the initial mission.<br/><br/>However, we don't get a whole lot of time to cozy up to the other characters for a huge reason - Jyn didn't. The entire Rogue One team, in some respects, didn't know each other all that well, aside from individuals who had met before meeting Jyn. So in essence, we know them about as well as Jyn did.<br/><br/>The entire pacing of the movie is at Jyn's pace - we experience her role within the rise of the Rebellion as she does, and that is more worthwhile than any exposition, in my opinion...it made it more real for this moment.<br/><br/>A lack of exposition about all the characters leaves open the opportunity for Extended Universe writers to come in and flesh out the new written EU. We can find out about these characters' backgrounds prior to their time in Rogue One in new books, something that has delighted Star Wars fans previously. Their histories were never meant to be in this story - this was about this moment in time, not what was before it."
"piercetownson","8","1","4","19 December 2016"," A worthy Star Wars film
","When it was first announced that the first ever spin-off Star Wars film would be based around how the Rebels managed to get their hands on the plans for the Death Star, the choice seemed odd and I didn't think there was a story to tell but I remained positive as Disney had delivered with last year's The Force Awakens. I am so glad to see they have done it again because this story deserves to be told. Right off the bat, I have to admit this film is not perfect and I am going to restrain myself from ""fanboying"" over this film just because it has Star Wars in the title.<br/><br/>This film is GORGEOUS. Gareth Edwards deserves praise for his direction as this movie is a pleasure to gaze upon. One thing that he did well in Godzilla (2014) was the sense of scale, and that is mirrored here in Rogue One as the Death Star and the Imperial fleet has never felt more menacing. The Special Effects team have brought us the most beautiful looking Star Wars yet; the CGI is almost flawless. Which leads me to my first minor complaint: The motion capture. Grand Moff Tarkin was brought back in the form of mo-cap and it just doesn't quite pay off; it is painfully obvious it is CG, however, it did not bother me as much as it did other audience members as the story was enjoying enough to brush over this issue; never the less, it is there and remains a flaw which I don't think will hold up. Oh yeah and the space battles were AWESOME.<br/><br/>This is a much more controversial topic: Darth Vader. People have been complaining that he is not in this film enough; I have to respectfully disagree. He was only briefly shown in trailers and was never promised to be an integral part of the plot so I was not expecting to see a lot of him. That being said, the scenes we did see are some of the best in the movie, James Earl Jones nailed the dialogue and his final scene battling the rebels is probably the most winning moment of the entire film. We had 6 movies where Vader was a main character and I didn't need another.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film has no text scroll and this is also the first Star Wars film to include location text. Initially, I didn't know what to think but as the film went on I understood this is a spin-off not a sage film and these bold choices paid off since it is able to set itself aside from the others. The world we are thrown into is the one we all love from the original trilogy and it feels as real and lived in as our own but with an extra layer grittiness. This film puts the WAR in Star Wars and the new dark tone is fresh. Instead of our more tame interpretation of war in the saga films, when storm troopers enter a scene, you sense a real feeling of dread as our protagonists could be killed at any moment. <br/><br/>Speaking of characters, another complaint I have been hearing is that the character arcs felt shallow and people were not able to latch onto them and care, and I agree in part but I don't think that is fair. I am not going to go into too much detail but Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso great. I instantly believe she exists in that world and her interactions with Diego Luna's Cassian Andor are good, not fantastic but good. Mads Mikkelsen does not get a lot of time to shine as he is killed which provides some more emotional depth to Jyn and Cassian. Ben Mendelsohn's villain is quite typical but brings a lot of charisma to the screen and is entertaining. The rest of the Rogue One team is not given much back story at all. Wen Jiang and Donnie Yen's characters are friends and that is about all the information we get. Look, the whole team dies in the end so I understand the choice made to not give each character a fully fleshed out back story which would have made an over bloated mess of a story but the writing does feel slightly rushed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I had a blast with this film, it does take a while for the film to pick up since it attempts to introduce the audience to these characters they have never heard of but once its is there, you're in for a treat; except for the scenes involving Forest Whitaker. I don't know what happened there but he felt misplaced and need I mention the giant squid thing. Walking out of this film I felt fulfilled and on a high, it enhances A New Hope, it is worth the watch. An adventure to be remembered and a definite buy on Blu-ray."
"paultkyip","9","1","4","19 December 2016"," 8 out of 10
","A very entertaining movie. I felt it had all the components of a Star Wars Movie. The last act was extremely well done. I proclaim this to be one of the best executed Star Wars Movies!<br/><br/>I liked all of the new characters in this Movie. However, I doubt that any of these characters are of any significance in the Star Wars universe. This is a minor point as it is not practical to make any of the new characters important since the subsequent movies have been made. The writers maxed out on what they could do with these characters.<br/><br/>Some critics pointed out that they wanted to know more about the Main Characters but I was OK with it. Movie was over 2 hours, don't need it to extend any longer. Maybe there will be an extended version on DVD?"
"gogarrett","7","1","4","19 December 2016"," Loved the idea of a Star Wars side story, didn't strike all the right chords
","This was a great idea to give us a little Star Wars movie between the big Star Wars movies. Starting out with a family of farmers with secret identities hiding out on a remote planet is pretty standard fare for Star Wars, and all of the other story lines meshed with what we know. The audience is gradually led to see how all the new characters are to fit in, but soon enough figure out how it will all end. That probably didn't help this movie. The characters were likable enough or evil enough but my favorite character was the robot K-2S0, humorously played by Alan Tudyk. I was stunned by the return of Grand Moff Tarkin just as he looked in 1977 Star Wars and thrilled by appearances of four other 1977 Star Wars characters (2 were the original actors). It was amazing special effects. Better than the Terminator reappearances of a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger imo. <br/><br/>At the end of this movie we walked out feeling like, okay, so that's what happened. We also thought it causes problems for the story that picks up in Star Wars IV: A New Hope. I would have preferred a more elated or bereaved feeling at the end of a movie like this, and to not have questions about the Star Wars story plausibility. Also, the word Hope in this movie was pretty over used now that I think about it. Still a decent movie which answers a question. A question that could have just remained a mystery."
"reid-hawk","7","1","4","17 December 2016"," clichéd as hell, cheesy as hell, good as hell
","So yeah I really liked rogue one, even though it somehow manages to hit almost all the things I hate in big budget action movies today. This film has some sh**ty characters and cheesy speeches about heroics and yadda yadda yadda. It has jokes that fall flat. It has so many moments that just are not good at all. But if you can get through all of that, this is a really great movie, especially visually. The action scenes are all well shot and exciting, preferring to use practical effects mixed with CGI rather than solely using CG. Honestly, besides one of those ""bad guy gets caught monologuing for no reason and dies because of it"" and the over the top and sappy character deaths, I pretty much love all the battle scenes/fight scenes from this movie. The costume and alien designs also work really well , just like every other Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie I found overall more compelling and funny than in episode 7 (although many of them are still very underdeveloped, I personally enjoyed them), and many of them even existed in a morally gray area, which is unexplored territory for this franchise. In fact, this movie does a good job showing that not ever rebel is good, as well as the civilian casualties that are usually cast aside in movies of this nature. ""Rogue One"" is also very funny at times, where only a few jokes fell flat. Compare that to ""The Force Awakens"", where I think I actually laughed only a single time throughout the entire movie no matter how hard they forced jokes into it. The ""easter eggs"" and callbacks in this movie are pretty obviously thrown in your face, but I still enjoyed them and am sure other fans of the series will spend hours jerking off to them, unlike me who only pleasures myself to the soft tears of orphans. The ending of this movie is also very good, and without spoilers I'll just say is a fantastic lead in to ""A New Hope"". Heck, even the CGI characters this movie ""resurrects"" from the original trilogy look amazing (although not perfect just yet). Overall I actually love Rogue One, but its glaring flaws hold it back from being anything other than a solidly good movie. Oh, and this is probably a given at this point considering even the prequels did this right, but the movie's score is pretty phenomenal I'll give it an 8/10 or maybe a 7.5/10 I'm not sure yet why am I so indecisive."
"HotlineSF","8","1","4","19 December 2016"," Nice grittier and darker addition to the Star Wars Franchise
","This is a direct prequel to the original Stars Wars film and focuses on the mission to steal the plans for the Death Star from the Empire. We all know how this movie will end, and it doesn't bode well for our heroes.<br/><br/>It's pretty cool how the folks upstairs embraced the gravitas and dread this mission deserves. No happy go lucky characters in this one, and this is the darkest Star Wars movie, with morally ambiguous characters and unrepentant killing. I actually think the lack of a Jedi amongst the main cast helps the movie feel more intense (anyone can die at any moment), and at times this feels more like thriller or spy film than the standard Star Wars adventure fantasy.<br/><br/>The two main leads have good chemistry, Mads is always awesome even in a smaller role, and one of the bright spots is definitely the new robot character, who's effortlessly sarcastic and entertaining without ruining the mood.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is that in the latter half, this movie succumbs to the Hollywood clichÃ© where characters have long drawn out death scenes a la Sean Bean from LOTR. It happens a bit too often, which makes it predictable and saps some of the tension from critical moments in the story.<br/><br/>Otherwise, still a good movie! I can see why ppl say it's the most un-Star Wars movie, and hopefully this is a sign that subsequent films will also be original and creative."
"peytonfoster","9","1","4","18 December 2016"," My thoughts as a Star Wars fan
","It was an overall entertaining movie. At the beginning it did not feel like star wars at all, but it introduces the characters well. It surprised me there was no text crawl but I was pleased to see something to catch my eye. It shows what happens right before the text crawl of episode 4. Seeing characters you would recognize was nice but it didn't last long. Any ways my list of favorite star wars movies from best to worst are 5,4,7,rogue,3,6,2, and the disappointment of episode one. THIS IS A SPOILER ALERT. I wish all of the characters did not die or at least the main ones like Jyn. It did anger me that there was no romance at all or appearance of the Emperor Palpititne. I can not wait to see episode 8 with hopefully a return of Han Solo and long live Star Wars"
"paul-allaer","8","1","4","18 December 2016"," How the rebels stole the Death Star plans
","""Rogue One"" (2016 release; 133 min.) is the first stand-alone movie in the Star Wars Franchise. Others have already commented about or summarized key points of the plot so I won't go into that again and instead let me offer a couple of comments and observations.<br/><br/>The movie is, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, directed by Gareth Edwards, best known for his so-so 2014 Godzilla franchise reboot. Here he brings to the big screen the story of how the rebels were able to steal the plans of the Death Star which was built purposefully with one fatal flaw. If you think I am ""giving away the end"" of Rogue One, perhaps you are one of the few people on the planet who haven't seen Stars Wars: A New Hope. Indeed, Rogue One is set just before A New Hope, and we all know of course how A New Hope turns out plot-wise. It raises an interesting point, though, namely how to bring a movie of which you already know the ending before you enter the theater. Added to that is the fact that the viewer is not all that emotionally invested in many of these previously unknown characters. The answer, it turns out, is to bring a visually overwhelming spectacle, the likes of which we have never seen before in any Star Wars movie. The last hour of the movie, which is action-packed, is nothing short of eye-candy as we see dozens and dozens of spaceships do battle with each other, while all kinds of other mayhem is taking place around them. The lead actors are okay, in particular Felicity Jones as Jyn but even better is Mads Mikkelsen as Galen, Jyn's father and an imperial research scientist who includes the flaw in the Death Star plans. Kudos also to composer Michael Giacchino, who has the thankless task of taking over for John Williams but stands his own (and of course there are a few original Star Wars themes in the movie). Bottom line: this is an entertaining Star Wars movie, nothing more, nothing less. But I have to say that I'm REALLY looking forward to next year's Episode 8...<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" opened this weekend, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was sold out. I had bought our tickets several weeks ago, and it's a good thing I did. This movie will do mega-business at the box office, that much is clear. I was surprised to see quite a few young kids (ages 5-6-7) in the audience, and they seemed to get quite restless, which didn't surprise me one bit, as surely this is not a movie for that age category. All that aside, enjoy ""Rogue One"" for what it is, Star Wars fans, and let's get ready for Episode 8!"
"josephmistretta","6","1","4","18 December 2016"," No Empire Strikes Back!
","****May contain spoilers***<br/><br/>OK so the opening weekend for Rogue One is finally to a close and I've seen it twice back to back days (thurs night + Friday) 2D and 3D Imax. I just don't understand what the craze is about this movie. Im a HUGE Star Wars fan. Im an even BIGGER Vader fan. I don't like how he looked or sounded. I get James Earl Jones' vocals aren't what they use to be but the movie just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie to me. Don't get me wrong, it was an entertaining movie. The beginning lagged, I didn't really connect with any of the characters except for K2-SO and Chirrut (Blind guy.) I honestly didn't care how the movie was to end with them. The end of the movie, especially with the last scene with Vader was bad ass and awesome and I don't care if it doesn't fit with the continuity of Episode IV's Vader. We needed to see how ruthless he really is. But aside from that and the cameos (that some felt shoehorned in and unexplained) I feel like the movie was flat and just an action sci-fi movie. I hate that almost every scene we fell in love with in the trailers were cut and it just seemed like a totally different movie. Not to mention the cuts they did to Vader's scenes! Its like they said lets make a mediocre movie, throw some nostalgic and non explanatory cameos in and then in the end btw look at Vader go! After the Force Awakens I couldn't wait to see it a 3rd and 4th time, I just didn't get that with this movie. As a Star Wars fan I wanna love this movie so much, I just cant. I think too many people are overlooking the problems with the film just because Vader is in it and because its suppose to be this nostalgic tie in to A New Hope. I also think calling it just as good or right up there with Empire Strikes Back a huge fallacy. Not even close! Its not even better than Jedi. Heres a film that had the structure, the story was already there with an ending we all already knew. Its a disappointment. I couldn't wait to see the Sith Lord on the big screen again. At least he got his big moment, albeit very brief..."
"neil_mitchell","10","1","4","18 December 2016"," So nostalgic... it made me feel like I was a kid again.
","**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Simply put, If you're a Star Wars fan then you will undoubtedly love this film, from it's story, to the characters and great acting, new settings and the many soon to be considered classic scenes. <br/><br/>So what if you're not a Star Wars fan? Well... the chances are that you're going to enjoy this film anyway as it's well put together, fun, has great acting and a story that anyone can relate to. <br/><br/>This is therefore a must see for anybody and everybody and if you haven't already seen it - please just stop reading these reviews now (including mine) and go and make plans to see this film now!<br/><br/>I grew up surrounded by the original trilogy and this film took my right back to my childhood days and made me feel like I was a kid once again. Well at least for an hour anyway but even days after seeing this film (I viewed Thursday afternoon) I'm still smiling on the inside. It's like I'm in a daze.<br/><br/>Everything from the space battles and the original design Stormtroopers to seeing Vader in action once again just made this film so cool and also so retro. This is possibly now my second favourite Star Wars film although I just need to go and see it again just to check and be 100% sure of that.<br/><br/>It also has to be said that aside from a certain scene and lightsaber battle in Bespin I never expected or thought a Star Wars film could make me feel that emotional. This is especially worthy of note given that it was obvious from when the first details of this film emerged well over a year ago that none of these characters could survive in order for everything to fit in with Episodes 4-6. <br/><br/>Yet despite fully being aware of this, when they became trapped on the surface and it became clear they wouldn't get out - I felt a sense of loss as so many great characters had been sacrificed.<br/><br/>Everyone that perished from the Blue Squadron X-Wing fighter pilots to the many Rebels fleeing Vader while desperately attempting to keep possession of the Death Star plans . It could have never been foreseen that the scale of sacrifice had been this great to obtain and keep hold of the plans.<br/><br/>Fan service moments are littered throughout and while a few were not at all needed there were some that made the film even more special such as the digitally added in Red and Gold leaders from 'A New Hope'. This made the film tie in even better and made it that little bit more special.<br/><br/>The scene right at the end will surely now go down as one of the greatest ever Star Wars moments, from the look of horror and desperation on the Rebel fighters faces to Vader using the full force of the dark side on them. This scene has reinforced why Darth Vader is the ultimate movie villain.<br/><br/>On my way out of the cinema I saw a dad coming in with his young boy complete with Star Wars jumper and I wondered what impression the loss of K-2SO (who was brilliant) or Vader at his most evil would leave on him. I suspect he would be sad but also in awe cementing his fandom for life. <br/><br/>This is a 9/10 for me with a slight mark down due to minor gripes with imperfect CGI faces of Tarkin and Leia along with a little unneeded fan service - do we really need to see R2 and C-3PO?<br/><br/>Please take note of this and get the CGI fixed (particularly Leia or just cut her out) before this goes on mass release on DVD / Blu-Ray / 4K - Gareth & Disney.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards - thank you.<br/><br/>P.S. Godzilla was still awful."
"Maladjusted_1","8","1","4","18 December 2016"," Moments of brilliance hidden within a weak narrative
","At the time of writing this review, only 11% of IMDb voters have awarded ""Rogue One"" a 7/10, which places me in a minority of people who liked this film but didn't love it. As you'll see in my following comments, my thoughts on this title are divided between my disappointment in many of its narrative aspects, and my considerable praise for its technical performance. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards' ""Rogue One"" is the first standalone live-action feature film in the ""Star Wars"" series. It sets a precedent, and does so with occasional bravery, but offers a sluggish first half-hour. I think it's the slowest start since ""The Phantom Menace"", although the early subject matter is far more engaging (unless you have a passion for trade disputes). The scenes involving two of the film's greatest talents - Mads Mikkelsen and Forest Whitaker - are a bit of a let-down, although the former actor's character, Galen Erso, is the focus of one of the film's best scenes (which occurs about 45 minutes in). Whilst the film does have moments of brilliance, the bulk of 'Rogue One' does little to excite the imagination or evoke any significant emotion. <br/><br/>I'd wager that most of the main characters in band-of-rogues films like ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" have their own fan-bases and have inspired a substantial body of art, ""fan-fic"" and merchandise. I struggle to imagine Baze Malbus enjoying such popular success, and I'll explain why. We aren't really given a reason to care for most of the members of Rogue One. Cassian Andor and Bodhi Rook (the two most unremarkable characters) are certainly on the right side, and I knew as I watched ""Rogue One"" that I should have been rooting for them. But I wasn't. I was never driven to invest in these characters, and so the film's pervading theme of sacrifice doesn't hit home. I'd even say that some of the characters are quite forgettable - including our protagonist, Jyn Erso. I don't blame the actors for this - their performances are rather good - but a standalone title demands sharper writing than a series of films, as we have only a fraction of the time to learn and love the heroes. The members of Rogue One had the potential to be interesting. Unfortunately, they all seem to climb aboard the Rebellion with nothing more to say than, ""I hate the Empire, too."" That might work for a twenty-minute episode of ""Star Wars Rebels,"" but not for a film which exceeds all of the Original Trilogy titles in length. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most problematic character in ""Rogue One"" - at least, from a storytelling perspective - is Orson Krennic, the high-ranking Imperial officer who is tasked with the elimination of the rebels. Several times throughout the film, Krennic is either undermined or threatened by Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader. Certain scenes, and Krennic's failure to really rise above them, prevent him from seeming like a primary antagonist. Despite enjoying far more screen-time than his fellow Imperials, he always seems secondary or even peripheral. A galaxy capable of producing figures like General Grievous, Darth Maul and even Kylo Ren will inevitably find difficulty in trying to make us fear an intelligence officer carrying a pistol. <br/><br/>(Most of) my criticisms aside, here's what I liked about the film. <br/><br/>""Star Wars"" is more a visual experience than a narrative one for some people - after all, the AT-ATs from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are almost as iconic as the ""I am your father"" line. You may be wondering why, in light of all my complaints, I have still rated this film 7/10. The answer largely lies in the visuals and the technical excellence of Gareth Edwards' crew. Photorealistic animation is used throughout the film to bring back Peter Cushing's Tarkin. (This effect is also used for another familiar character in a very brief appearance.) The effect is handled brilliantly, and the implications of this success are very interesting to think about.<br/><br/>Another technical aspect of the film which won my amazement is the vastly improved space visuals, which are particularly noticeable during hyperspace sequences. If a standalone film about starfighter pilots is ever developed, these are the people I want to see working on it. <br/><br/>The ""Star Wars"" films have given us some fantastic landscapes and locations, from the dunes and settlements of Tatooine to the swamps of Dagobah and the forests of Endor. I was disappointed by the failure of ""Rogue One"" to replicate earlier films' (including the prequels) success in this area, as I felt that Scarif and Eadu - two of the main settings of the film - were significantly less imaginative. Or perhaps the problem is that the camera doesn't leave our heroes' side long enough for the splendour of these new planets to leave an impression on the viewer. (On the other hand, directing attention away from the characters may have exacerbated the issues I pointed out regarding the narrative.)<br/><br/>It seems fitting that as I reach the end of my review, I am going to give comment on the ending of the film. Whilst I'll uphold my earlier promise of no spoilers, I'll share this: it is the greatest ending since ""Return of the Jedi,"" and the most exhilarating conclusion of any ""Star Wars"" film. If the preceding two hours were executed with such boldness, this could have been the greatest entry in the series. As it stands, 'Rogue One' is a work of technical excellence, but suffers from an absence of character development and a lumbering first act."
"El-Kapitoshka","7","1","4","16 December 2016"," Disney are the Rogue Ones.
","When I found out Rogue one was being made and the story line being focused around the Death Star- I worried when seeing Krennic as the main man in Mos Eisley. I wondered where and what Disney had done with Grand Moff Tarkin, even yielded to the possibility that they had twisted his legacy and wouldn't bother with him. <br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>On Grand Moff Tarkin (GMT)<br/><br/>He is in it, and yes - he is excellent. They have re created him using CGI and using the voice of Stephen Stanton (Who does the voice for the TV show Rebels too) to great effect, that for me - his appearance was the highlight and most likely so for many GMT fans. Unfortunately, there are still some concerns about the direction Disney are taking it. It seems they portray Tarkin (unlike the book) as merely just jumping on the bandwagon of the Death Star after it's first firing mission's success. This is a small point, the film wasn't ruined by it - but it does seem to undermine GMT's lore somewhat.<br/><br/>That aside, it does still show you just how powerful GMT was in his peak. Krennic gets treated quite badly by Vader at one point after appearing desperate and power hungry - something that would never happen to GMT. Krennic is feeble in comparison actually and I think the film overall reflects that thankfully - in the end. <br/><br/>The final Battle on Scarif <br/><br/>The rebels go to Scarif and insert a small team of around 9 people on the ground to sabotage and search for the Death Star plans. These 9 soon turn in to 90 - a silly inconsistency, later rectified only after the shield around the planet (see later) is disabled.<br/><br/>The Star Wars Universe seemed to of binned shields. You know those things that protect ships etc. In fact the only thing that does seem to be shielded is a planetary shield generator that is attached somewhat to the atmosphere of the planet itself and acts as a gate of sorts. AT-AT's get taken out by X- Wings incredibly easily -EA's battlefront players will be jealous of the easy kills that happen in the film. A sensor dome on a ISD gets blown up instantly without even using Ion canons...oh wait there's no need (until later when they use them on the ISD's??) because they do/don't have shields. Disney....make you're minds up and stick with it. <br/><br/>The engagement protocol of the Empire is severely lacking in anything, it takes them a long time to even mobilise Tie Fighters to counter attack the Rebel fleet that warps in over the planet. It's painful - the captains/Admirals of the two ISD's in the area......they need to go back to Presfbelt 4 Training Academy yesterday. The ISD's can't even be seen returning fire against the entire rebel fleet at all. If they did then I must have missed it blinking. Literally, I could arrange the counter attack better than them. No joke. <br/><br/>On Shore Troopers<br/><br/>I said this before the film and they really don't seem to be that special at all. They mix in with ST's like they were born together. In all honesty - they serve no purpose and just seem like pointless 'merchandise' filler. Another model for kids to beg their parents/wives to buy. <br/><br/>On Death Troopers<br/><br/>They had slightly more presence that Shore Troopers and have more of a use. They do seem to be better trained too and this is reflected in their combat engagements. Much better shots than the regulars - which is a shame because their were moments when I thought ST's were painted out to be pros, but this lasts for seconds. <br/><br/>On the Darth Vader<br/><br/>Thankfully, you see him as the death machine he really was. They capture the fear he instills and power of him perfectly. If you saw him, in a meeting or in battle you would do something in your underwear. He's an animal and extremely powerful.<br/><br/>All in all it was good. There were a few issues I had with it as explained above - but so much better than Episode 7. It sets you up to watch A new Hope right after it too - which I loved. It's a shame they didn't let the director of Rogue One (Gareth Edwards) do 7 too."
"dannyboyes","9","1","4","16 December 2016"," Well trimmed mish-mash
","There is a sense about proceedings that this movie could have evolved from a direction that Rebels didn't take. There are plenty of characters and genres plied together: at once an implausible martial arts fantasy, a dirty dozen war movie, a reflection on contemporary war and exploitation by superpowers and then again, a Star Wars tie together prequel. How does this work ? Well, it rolls along ... it gathers pace, the actors deliver, the set pieces have spectacle. The baddies are bunglers and the heroes have shades of torment. The big ships collide nicely. For me, the actors contribute greatly - Mads Mikkelsen, Riz Ahmed, Ben Mendelsohn, Wen Jiang, Donnie Yen, Alan Tudyk and Felicity Jones give good quality performances, Forest Whitaker is great and I really enjoyed Diego Luna. In a role I thought would be trite and 2D, I was surprised to enjoy his character arc performance. Lots of subtleties and variety from the cast. The CGI characters aren't quite spot on, but fantastic to see Peter Cushing eviled-up (though a tad over-old in detail). Good to see Darth in full swing, though he must have been wearing his B-suit helmet (or dressed a little hastily) in his initial scene - we also get to see his baddies-lair briefly which is a bonus. There is a lot crammed in, but the overall impression was of a multi-faceted enjoyable romp rather than disjointed vignettes. I can only assume there was a lot of editing and compromise involved in shaping up the final effort, but the end product gave my boys and I an enjoyable evening at the cinema. Surprised to have enjoyed it, would be pleased to view it again, though not sure I'd need to see it in 3D next time."
"billntoumos","7","1","4","16 December 2016"," A Great Entry to the Star Wars Universe
","First of all Star Wars has always been one of my favorite movie franchises! For that reason this was my most anticipated movie of the year. Last year I loved the Force Awakens and it was one of my favorites of the year.<br/><br/>So going to this movie I was expecting it to be amazing knowing the basic plot. Leaving the theater I was really happy but I wasn't blown away. That's mainly because of the first 2 acts that were kind of slow, but they had some great scenes. A lot of new characters were introduced but unfortunately I didn't connect to them, mainly because they were too many and we didn't know the backstory of its character. The new droid K2SO was really funny and had some great scenes. It might be the most interesting character to me..yes..the droid! The main villain, Crenic, I thought was just good but he didn't had the impact that Vader or Kylo Ren had in the other movies.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the awesome stuff..Well..DARTH VADER! He was in very few scenes in the movie but when he was...he was outstandingly awesome and i had a giant smile on my face watching those scenes!! Except from Vader, the 3rd act was amazing! It emphasised WARS in Star Wars... I was blown away with the visual effects...and I think it had the best space battle in any Star Wars movie. And that ending...just...GREAT!!<br/><br/>Overall I think this was a really good movie and different from the other Star Wars movies. If you are a Star Wars fun you will be very very happy with the movie. If you are not you are probably going to like it but you will not understand some stuff, because it has references from the other movies. Finally i believe that you should go and see the movie and I can't wait for the next chapter in the Star Wars films! Score 75/100"

","This movie is true masterpiece in today's movie-making. Almost everything works out very well in this movie, the actors, the sets, the plot and boy oh boy the ending! I already read some spoiler free user reviews here, where people were praising the magnificent ending and boy were they right. The fan service elements were nicely placed and subtle in a good manner. VFX were superb, even better than TFAs IMAO. For my taste there were too many different planets for their short screen time and the villain didn't appear as threatening as other villains in the Star Wars. This was not lack of acting, but more lack of screen time and depth of character. But altogether this movie is proof that Disney is serious about Star Wars. I as die hard star wars was very pleased with the outcome and would recommend it to everyone who likes the original trilogy.<br/><br/>I admit, the movie had its off-time when its halfway through and some minor flaws, but it was nevertheless a really enjoyable trip back to a far, far galaxy!"

","Typical 'fear men, not see this' story: poor repressed girl is abused by her father and his IDEALISM, REJECTS his idealism, LASHES OUT and CRY FOR ATTENTION by stealing the death star plans...
Didn't Leia steal those plans? Let's dig Carrie Fischer up and check in with her... but I'm sure she's happy; not only have we effectively killed Han Solo the character, but we killed Han Solo's legacy.
Interesting parallel with the whole consolidation of power to a single woman in this universe and how we glorify that just because she's female, while scorning men whose power is equal or greater--out of fearing the things she can't understand.

Well, give me 400 joules and clear, cause this series just came back from the dead! Unlike the last 4 abortions defined by excessive CGI, bad acting, horrible casting, mediocre scripts with cheesy dialogue, effeminate girly man villains, rabid feminist agendas and all ""new SW"" plagues, this is the total original feel SW everyone knows who saw the originals when they came out in the theater. You will recognize some old favorites and appreciate the prudent use of special effects. Took me straight back to 1977! I have no idea what took so long to make this installment worthy of being called a Star Wars film. Gareth Edwards certainly has the secret sauce. The franchise that began as Classic Coke, switched to New Coke for far too long, but is finally back to Classic Coke. I'm so grateful this finally got made after wasted decades I'm not even going to nitpick it. Hallelujah."

"jonahhenry-89032","6","1","5","18 March 2019"," Good movie, maybe not great for Star Wars though.
","Unpopular opinion for a longtime Star Wars fan, but I thought this movie was unnecessary and underwhelming.
Jyn Erso is almost an entirely blank character.
Cassian is fine. Nothing more to say.
K2SO was good. I despise ""jokes"" in star wars movies, but comedy is completely welcome.
Chirrut, Baze, and the Temple of Kyber change the entire lore around the Jedi, Lightsabers, and Kyber Crystals in a way that I thought was far more simplistic and far worse than the original lore. However, I did enjoy both characters, despite all of that.
'Director' Krennic is a generic imperial dude that holds a rank that nobody has ever really seen in the old movies, the old EU, or the new stuff, and it's unclear how high that rank actually is. He is intimidating and very believable. The rank-related gripe is all the negative I have for him.
Vader is 100% Vader in this movie and is therefore above reproach.
Saw Gerrera is MUCH older than when we last saw him, even though that was only like 20-25 years ago in-universe. It's a little jarring, but Forrest Whittaker plays the grizzled old warrior phenomenally. ""Bor Gullet will know the truth!"" However, it was really stupid that he didn't get on the ship and instead chose to get killed by a Tsunami of sand. ""I'm done running."" What the hell is this going to accomplish? Are you going to fight the mountain that's about to hit you? Just get on the dang ship.
The fight scene at the end threw a wrench into the banter between Vader and Leia in ANH. Her ship clearly participated in the battle. It's not like they jumped in and jumped out. Also, wasn't the ship supposed to recieve a transmission? Because they brought a physical disk on board. That's not the same thing.
Overall it was a good movie, but maybe not great for Star Wars."

The image and action sequences are well succeeded and keep the viewer attentive and interested. This is about a terrible super weapon the Empire has got and that is capable of destroying any planet. The Rebellion is trying to get the weapon plans to be able to turn it inoperative by activating a flaw that was put in it by the scientist who created it and was secretly supporting the Rebellion.

After the very disappointed Star Wars 7, Rogue one is offering a new story, which really stands up. We can feel the respect for the movies that were already made in the same universe, which is a relief if you are a fan, like me. The viewer's attention is total from beginning to the end of the movie. <br/><br/>What I really enjoyed was the way the characters were presented, one by one, and their strong relationships. For once, I had the pleasant impression that the story was at the heart of the movie, and the characters were here to stand for a cause and not to make a presence and discuss about their lives. There was this very inspiring movement of solidarity and pure friendship between them. People fighting for what's right, and nothing else. <br/><br/>I could mention the fact that Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor don't kiss at any point, how surprising? I mean nowadays big firms from the cinema industry, as Walt Disney and Lucasfilm, are making blockbusters movies based on the same weft: violence and love affairs. It really means the world to me that the characters from the movie have been all spared from useless visual and physical feelings, in a way the emotions become even more intense. The viewer is frustrated, he would like them to kiss, but there's not need to show it as we feel it. <br/><br/>Not to forget that special effects are breath taking. We're witnessing beautiful landscapes and very realistic explosions. As if it wasn't enough, the presence of some well know characters form the Stars Wars saga, recreated thanks to CGI and old footage, is so well done that I almost missed it (I'm thinking mostly about princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin)<br/><br/>Even if I wanted to, I couldn't find any negative facts about this movie.

","Well, at first I didn't know what to expect from this movie, because I tough it was a bit useless for the development of the saga. I went to the theater having watched one or two trailers at the most and I was absolutely amazed by this movie. <br/><br/>It's like a war film in the universe of Star Wars. It's more mature and dark than many of the other movies in the saga (and by far better than Episode VII). It tells us the story of a group of rebels who stole the plans of the Death Star to try to save the rebellion. The story is well established in here, with the feeling of a Star Wars movie but with no need of light sabers and the Force (well, at least not directly). <br/><br/>The character of Jyn Erso is portrayed by Felicity Jones in a superb way, making you feel what she feels and making you feel her pain, anger or hope. The other actors were also great, with the Mexican Diego Luna in the role of the Captain Andor, and also the two Asian actors in the roles of Chirrut and Baze, and the Hindu pilot Bodhi Rock. I have to mention the father of Jyn, played by Mads Mikkelsen, another great actor with a great performance. Also a special mention to the new droid K-2SO which surely will become a favorite, and Ben Mendelshon as the Imperial Director Krennic, an awesome new character full of power. There are other secondary characters that felt like a bit off place, like Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker).<br/><br/>One of the best parts of the film is the last third of it (no spoilers, don't worry), with all the space battles and so that remind me a lot of all the other Star Wars movies, and that makes you feel like the director is a true fan of the saga and he tried to give it that feeling, and for me, he achieved it. It's true that some parts around the middle of the film make it feel a bit long, but it's worth to watch it just for the beautiful and awesome cinematography and visuals, all with a score by Michael Giacchino (not Williams but still great) and one of the best scenes of the whole Star Wars saga (when you watch it, you'll know it)<br/><br/>I recommend it to any fan of Star Wars who wants to expand this universe, to the fans who felt the Ep VII wasn't bad, but wasn't great neither (a bit mediocre), but also to anyone who is not a fan of Star Wars but wants to enjoy a great action film with spectacular visuals."

","The Empire takes scientist Galen (Mads Mikkelesn) back to work on the Death Star, a weapon that will destroy planets. Jyn (Felicity Jones) is raised by Saw Gemera (Forest Whitaker) and when she comes of age she knows how to defeat the Death Star as she sees her father, Galen, in a hologram and he tells her he put a loophole in the Death Star Plans that will destroy the deadly weapon so others will know how to defeat it. Jyn joins the Rebel Forces now known as Rogue One to find her father, Galen, and to get the plans and transmit them to the rebel forces. <br/><br/>This is a prequel and we know this because we see Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), C3PO, R2D2 and at the very end: Princess Leia (Ingvild Deila, but the voice of Carrie Fisher) <br/><br/>The CGI cinematography is simply incredible and just to watch these scenes is worth the viewing with the sound off. Kudos. The music plays all throughout the movie and is very good.<br/><br/>Captain Andor (Diego Luna) is the supposed love-interest for Jyn, but nothing happens between them until the very end when they embrace. Felicity Jones as Jyn does an incredible job and she is very pretty too. HA!<br/><br/>Comic relief was very good with the robot K-2S0 (voice of Alan Tudyk) and he was given some spot-on lines. For example: when Jyn shoots a similar looking robot, the real K-2SO tells her, ""You knew that wasn't me, right?"" HA!<br/><br/>Most of the movie, of course, is all about CGI battles and it could put one into La La land, but they are exceptional and there is no denying that. Kudos. <br/><br/>Notables: Jimmy Smits in a very small role as Bail Organa, a Senator with the Rebellion; Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera and we see him again during the last big battle; and Ben Mendelsohn as Director Krennic, the Empire's chief engineer. <br/><br/>What I didn't understand was this: why didn't the rebels go after the Death Star Weapon, but only went after the Plans for it.

","I had the idea going in that Rogue One was a small side story, a footnote in the Star Wars saga. It turned out to be epic in scale, building up to the amazing climax. <br/><br/>The story fits in perfectly with Episode IV, and is likely to please most fans of the original trilogy. There were a lot of characters and places that are new to this film, so that it doesn't feel to similar to the other ones. Still, it's familiar enough that you could believe all these events had really happened during their place in the timeline. <br/><br/>One disappointment was the character of Gran Moff Tarkin.

","I came into Rogue One expecting great things after ""The Force Awakens"" but overall I don't think it lived up to the expectations. Despite this I still thought it was a fantastic film.<br/><br/>I believe that the film started off quite slow and took quite a while for it to get into the action and this is unlike most other SW films as they go straight into the action. <br/><br/>The characters for me made the film more enjoyable as I thought they made the film. I especially liked the Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) as he took his hope from the force and it showed the true meaning of the force and what effect it can have on people. K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) for me was a great edition, the droid was funny and powerful, he was a great edition to the story line. When we see Darth Vader towards the end when he is murdering all the rebels it reminded us as fans of the great antagonists he was. This scene was one of the best in the film.<br/><br/>Rogue One for me was not the best of the SW films but it still supplied me with the SW feeling and why I love this franchise."

","Rogue One proved that a Star Wars movie doesn't need a crawl, a lightsaber fight, or a Skywalker in a major role to be truly amazing. And it provided the best example of a true War in the Stars, with realistic action, plenty of death, close calls, drama, and risks. The force was strong with this one, as were the themes of trust, unity, hope, courage, and sacrifice. Jyn and Chirrut were the standout characters, each delivering many of the best moments, and best quotes, in all of Star Wars. To be clear, every character was good, but in these two the themes and ideas at the core of Rogue One resonated. Additionally, it perfectly set up A New Hope down to the last minute, and paid fan service by including many cameos from the original trilogy and references to the TV shows. This movie could not have been better. It was a beautiful, moving, and epic film and the best Star Wars has ever produced. Rogue One is truly one with the force, and the force is with it. It took the next chance, and the next, and it won."

","I was a bit wary of the star wars spin off stories when I first heard they were coming, and I'm still a bit apprehensive about the young Han Solo movie and I've never had any interest in a Boba Fett film, but if they're all to the quality of this then we've nothing to worry about. In fact if they live up to this then run to the cinema on the first day. I love the way this expands the universe but feels thoroughly grounded in and bonded to the originals. Its far darker in tone than much of the rest of the Star Wars universe and much of the humour of a Leia, Han or even a Po Dameron or a Finn is missing. But this is a war film after all and the stunning final act brings this home with the best and most realistic battle sequences ever in Star Wars. Some have marked this film down as they had no empathy or feel for the new set of characters but I had none of these problems and re-watches only made me feel more for the sacrifices they were making in the hope for a better future. Another so called problem was the CG re-creations of original characters but for me this helped bond this to A New Hope, for sure they were not perfect, but many people who did not know they were re-creations did not even notice. And to top it off we get probably the most bad ass Darth Vader scene we'll ever see. Superb."

","This 2hrs 13min |of Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi I gave it 10/10 as DirectorGareth Edwards who directed the 2014 Godzilla and the brilliant low budget monsters and his star wars is classic movie in the fold of the old and jj Abraham's one the force awakens . so lets blast off on this fun and original film The Rebel the weight of myth, Rogue One is a machine of a film that moves toward its inevitable endpoint with unrelenting determination. Although there are a few familiar faces, Edwards naturally drops plenty of references to the original trilogy – a certain pair of classically mismatched droids make a cameo appearance – . Rogue One isn't a new type of cinema experience, or unique. It's also a prequel, so the story has somewhere specific it has to end up. <br/><br/>With that in mind, Gareth Edward's movie is pretty close to an instant classic, in my opinion. It doesn't rush along, but give us ample time to get some sense of characters and locations. It doesn't dwell on exposition, other through character, and actual plot. <br/><br/>her mother, hoping that she'll be able to provide an entree to the militant radical Saw Gerrera (Forrest Whitaker), the recipient of a covert message from Galen borne by a renegade cargo pilot named Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), you feel for the pilot because he wants a to really help The purpose of Rogue One's opening movement is to assemble a ragtag band of fighters, one that also includes the blind Force worship per Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and the grizzled gunner Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen), who will take up the charge of stealing the Death Star plans when the Rebel Alliance gets cold feet. Yen and Jiang play their characters with a gruff tenderness that suggests their relationship may be more than platonic, and Alan Tudyk lends his voice and his movements to K-2SO, a wisecracking former Imperial droid with an unnerving penchant for calculating the precise likelihood of his comrades' deaths. That this literally motley crew's heroism is never so much spoken in the movies that follow it chronologically only makes their heroism more poignant: they are history's forgotten soldiers, laying their lives on the line while others carry the baton across the finish line. When the X-wing pilots show up with their bushy '70s handlebar mustaches, it brings the ends of the franchise's circle together, but it also reminds us how much has changed between then and now.<br/><br/>More important than Rogue One's contribution to Star Wars' plot is the way it inhabits its universe. JJ Abrams had the responsibility of extrapolating from the original trilogy, and George Lucas's prequels wound back the clock, but Edwards' movie is happening virtually on top of the first movie, which leaves him with a unique and daunting task: to make a movie with virtually the same elements as the original Star Wars that still feels like it was made in 2016 and not 1977. The film does this largely by engaging a multiracial cast from different parts of the globe, but also by a embracing the range of perspectives that come with it. When Jyn announces she's planning to end her brief tenure in the rebellion because it makes no difference to her who rules the galaxy, the one about Jedi Knights and galactic emperors with quasi-mystical powers, the next installment of which won't be along until this time next year. But a Star Wars story nonetheless, about people who don't have quasi-mystical powers and have never done the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs, although they're reasonably good with a blaster in a tight spot. It's an epic about extras, an opera about spear carriers This is the story about how the rebel alliance acquired the plans for the death star, and it manages to give the plot and characters in A New Hope more meaning, and gravitas. <br/><br/>References and Easter eggs from the original trilogy sprinkled throughout will surely encourage repeat viewings from fans and while not being the biggest Star Wars fan in the world, I have found myself a lot more interested in going back for another full viewing of series based solely on how much I enjoyed this standalone outing. It's been a while since we've had a series of films to look at as an annual Christmas tradition and having grown up watching Lord of the Rings in the cinemas year after year, it's something I've missed. After taking two big risks and pulling it off two years in a row, I have no doubt that the cast and crew and Disney and Lucasarts have it in them to provide that new seasonal tradition ever year, the movie is squarely focused on the new characters we've come to know, and the battle we've come to live. We know they succeed in their objective to get the Death Star's blueprints to the rebel comrades, but we've never known the cost of that success. Once we do, that knowledge holds the tantalizing prospect of making even Star Wars feel like something new again.

"bock_g","9","1","5","1 January 2017"," A ""new hope"" for spin-offs and a return to an old faith
","My expectations for this film was less than enthusiastic. Being a fan of the seven films (I never explored the expanded universe or the cartoons)I thought a spin off wouldn't be worth watching in theaters: I was wrong. Having watched this film twice, I came up with two conclusions: it a new standard for spin-offs and its the most faithful to the cinematic antecedent of the original Star Wars. The film takes the vital elements from the original and prequel trilogies (mostly the plot to steal the plans of Death Star) and adds a new layer of depth to the canon--a well balanced spin-off. An ethnically diverse cast (loved the blind master and his sidekick), there is definitely a worldly atmosphere that hasn't been explored in the other films of the canon. Given how simple the plot is, the filmmakers managed to create an engaging story with solid action and characters. Although there are a couple of minor CGI that bothered me (particularly the unnecessary shot of Princess Leia in the last shot, bless you Carrie Fisher), and some dull characters these flaws are a product of the inseparable faith to the chronology of the original film. This brings me to my second conclusion: its faithfulness to the cinematic antecedent. People forget that the original concept of Star Wars was George Lucas' tribute to the old Saturday matinée serials of the 30's and 40's (á la Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers) which were episodic.""Rogue One"" (while being a prequel) fits the episodic tone of those Saturday matinée serials: not being to over reliant on the chronology, but having enough elements that keep the series flowing."

","First I guess I should say that I am not your typical Star Wars Fan. I do like the first 4, beginning with New Hope, except for the fighting Teddy Bears in the Return of the Jedi. Yes, I liked Phantom Menace, which had the coolest Jedi - Qui-Gon Jinn.<br/><br/>The only part that I thought that was bad was the beginning. It was like flashbacks without the person present. Extremely choppy, discombobulated without real emotional ties to anything. It is bad enough that you may never recover, which I think many suffer from, when you also throw in that they decided to forgo the sprawling update at the beginning. If it was truly a one off film the I would have been okay with that, but it was truly a prequel to New Hope, so it was a bad decision. <br/><br/>Other than the very beginning, I really enjoyed Rogue One. The acting, the story line, the character development, the action, the dialogue and CGI is all excellent."
"bodhi-13262","8","1","5","30 December 2016"," The 'Force' may be strong, but it hurts.
","'Rogue One' is the prequel to 'A New Hope' and the sequel to 'Revenge of the Sith'. Confused yet?......I know. I don't consider myself to be a huge 'Star Wars' fanboy, but I do have respect for this property and have seen all the films up to this point. So I will try to be as fair as possible in this review.<br/><br/>1. Coming off his failed attempt at revamping 'Godzilla', director Gareth Edwards does an exceptional job with handling this movie. It was hard to believe, but Edwards does in fact prove himself to be the breakout director of 2016. Some of the shots in this film are beautiful, especially when it pans over the vast landscapes. The set-pieces are amazing for the planets that they travel to, and the production design is incredibly creative. ILM just gets better and better with developing CGI, which leads to amazing generated imagines, especially with the Starships and the infamous 'Death- Star' during the climactic battle scene.<br/><br/>2. My first complaint comes in the form of the characters and their acting. I am in no way a fan of Daisy Ridley's performance in 'The Force Awakens', but she overshadows Felicity Jones (Jyn) as yet another lanky British female lead with family abandonment. I know Jones has proved herself as being an exceptional actress, but there's nothing that special about her here. The same goes for Diego Luna (Cassian), but the performances in general are not that outstanding except for a few supporting characters. However, the humor displayed by the droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk), makes him a sheer scene-stealer throughout.<br/><br/>3. I must say, this film is probably the darkest of the saga thus far, which in turn plays to it's advantage. It's not as heavy-handed on the action until the last third, and I appreciate the fact that they saved the best surprises for last. Although, I personally felt that the film took a little too long to build the momentum in the beginning, but gladly it picks up. I must warn audiences though, with a dark tone comes sad and depressing moments. Not saying it's a bad thing, but many characters face tragic deaths throughout. With the stakes being so tense and the tone so dark, the film lacks the element of fun excitement, which can be a problem for some.<br/><br/>4. The true show-stopper of this entire movie is indeed Darth Vadar himself, voiced by the returning and legendary James Earl Jones. He is by far the greatest villain in cinematic history, and he is scarier than he has ever been every time he graces the screen. Ben Mendelsohn (Krennic) is the actual antagonist of the film, since Vadar's role is technically supposed to be a cameo/guest role. Mendelsohn does a great job, but not as a hands-on bad guy. The chances that this movie takes and it's badass moments, pushes it past 'The Force Awakens' for me, cause it is actually better. Once you can look pass the tone, it's truly enjoyable.<br/><br/>'The Empire Strikes Back' still holds the mantle, but 'Rogue One' comes in as a solid third just behind 'A New Hope'. Prequels usually don't feel as natural as they should most of the time, but this flawlessly transitions it's was into 'A New Hope' by the very end."

","I enjoyed watching this movie at the cinema. It is well directed and produced, for me there were no moments where I felt the movie was betraying anything from Star Wars and overall I felt like it belonged in the franchise.<br/><br/>That being said, for Star Wars fans, they know what the story is and how the movie is generally going to end, right from the start. There is nothing new brought on by this movie and that is, for me, where it failed at being better. <br/><br/>It is a story which you know how it is going to unfold and brings little to nothing new, but enjoy watching how it is executed nonetheless."
"joebloggscity","7","1","5","28 December 2016"," Long long time ago, a story worth retelling... Fine sci-fi war movie...
","I watched this two days ago, and sadly by coincidence Carrie Fisher (aka Princess Leia) passed away the next day, so for those immersed in the Star Wars universe this is a very sad time. It will definitely have led many to drag out their old box sets and the fan boys to again ogle over the Jedi pics of her in that golden bikini.<br/><br/>Back to the latest film, it's strange to think now that we are onto our eighth film from the Star Wars universe (nor including Ewok movies) but this one is supposedly a one-off tale, which is as much a filler as it is a self-contained episode. Regardless, it stands up well on its own.<br/><br/>Based around the time just before Episode IV, we follow our leads out to infiltrate and steal the plans for the Death Star for the benefit of the Rebel Alliance. So really you kind of know how this will pan out from early on. Despite that, the motley crew out to save the day are an interesting bunch, and you really do feel involved with them.<br/><br/>The story runs at a fair pace, and the main lines are intersected by scenes with the Imperial forces, which gives an all round look. It was engrossing, and we even get some CGI generated returns of some recognisable characters, which just about works. Okay, CGI hasn't yet perfected human features so those CGI 'actors' do look a bit puppet like, but it's a major advance over Tron Legacy which tried similarly but it wasn't yet good enough.<br/><br/>The action is a slow build till it becomes a fabulous war movie effort in the final acts, and it's worth the wait. Really exceptional space battle scenes which will remind you of the fun of the original films.<br/><br/>The major issue is the characterisations. As it's a self-contained movie there is minimal scope for character development in the limited film time, and that generates a flat note. It's a shame as I liked our lead two characters, although our leading lady doesn't seem to have much to work with to provide a fully-rounded character. Shame.<br/><br/>Also I still don't see the point of a few of the characters. They may add colour, but maybe they would have been better cutting them out and giving that added airtime to the lead characters instead.<br/><br/>Beyond that the story is great, and will appeal to adults instead of a dumbed down experience as in some prior 'episodes'. Some corny dialogue and scenes at times, but come on this is a sci-fi fantasy movie.<br/><br/>It's a very good offshoot. I wish they had allowed it to be built over a trilogy, but it works as it is. Ignore those being sniffy about it all. Fine film and a fine experience."

","Aside from Jar-Jar, the biggest problem I had with trying to watch Phantom Menace was: music. The orchestral score kept playing in the background during dialogue and other scenes where there should not have been any music, it became a distraction and basically ruins the film. Rogue One is great for a ton of reasons, but also suffers from this problem where about halfway through I started to notice that during dialogue scenes the strings just would not stop, and it becomes such a distraction that it's all I'm paying attention to - when is the music going to either stop or change? Irritation Level: High The best and most unexpected elements of this film are the story and plot elements that do not follow a Hollywood formula and take you by surprise."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","5","22 December 2016"," Episode 3.5 is a 3.5 (Out of 5) Star Film
","Rogue One is a YouTube fan-fic film with a budget. That's not (totally) dismissive; fans are often so invested as to not want to screw up what they love. Generally, director / fan Edwards and crew have brought this first ""Star Wars"" spin off by giving us what we love. It's a fully lived-in world, set on cool new planets, starring a group scrappy rabble-rousers partnered with a funny droid, and plotted to answer questions we have about the larger legend. Through all this, we are given some pretty fantastic star wars. So why is it below the best of the series? Because an action-packed, franchise-filling second half has to carry a humdrum first half. In both quality and genre, it's most similar to 1983's Return of the Jedi, a covert-operation used to battle the establishment. Taking place directly before 1977's Star Wars, this group of rebels is led by Jyn Urso (Jones) must steal the structural plans for the Death Star to learn its weaknesses. Visually faithful to the original trilogy, it fits nicely into its place. Edwards (Godzilla) continues to broadcast his skill for giant but coherent action, both in the epic destruction and the hand-to-hand combat (a martial-arts-focused jedi, a crowd-pleasing, effectively scary Vader scene). Otherwise, there are some issues. While Jyn has some nice motivations and stakes, much of the characters feel less like people and more like ways to push the plot. The dialogue is dull, the beats are predictable, the emotions are shallow, and the fan service is often egregious. At the end of the day, however, the building it does on the lore of ""Star Wars"" is believable and engaging to warrant seeing more from these spinoffs."
"KeroScee","8","1","5","22 December 2016"," A divisive gem
","Old and new fans alike will probably argue over the merits of Rogue One for the next decade. Sitting just outside the main series as a prologue to IV: A new hope' Rogue One attempts to bridge the divide between the contrasting narratives and styles that formed the bedrock of the previous (now 'old') trilogies of I-III and IV-VI. And it does so with great success.<br/><br/>Taking from Shakespearean motifs; the move is cleanly divided into three main acts. Comedy is injected tactically and without force to great effect. But will bring you in and keep you in your seat is of course the elements that 'Star Wars' has become known for; a fantasy story between good and evil set in space.<br/><br/>It might come as concern to some that the characters in Rogue One seem very much aware of the fairy tale around the series; and this is used to great effect. The force is fiction, as far as the folks on screen are concerned. A relic of a dead age, with the Jedi all but gone. Thus the characters are not mystic knights with high ideals or mystical powers; but men and women trying to scrap their way to survival with their wits. It makes Rogue One refreshing, more relateable, but adds tones of moral greys into the mix that many audiences will see as a too real departure from the fantasy the franchise is known for. I however think it works beautifully.<br/><br/>Acting performances are stellar, though some come across is a little overly stoic at times. But its the performances of Donnie Yen,Wen Jiang and Alan Tudyk (whom bleeds character even through his CGI exterior) who steal the show. Light hearted at first, these actors demonstrate a heartening and lifelike dynamic that keeps the film from falling apart. And perhaps more importantly, provides the film's ending with so much potency.<br/><br/>The story itself comes into its own eventually, but is not without its pitfalls. Trope savy viewers will definitely notice that there always seem to be important buttons to press and switches to flick that are all deep in the heart of danger. If anything, it may look like the production team wanted to make a much darker film about a certain British sci-fi franchise known for its morbidity.<br/><br/>Regardless; Rogue One is a modern gem. One not without flaws, but a solid piece that will be remembered fondly in the years to come."
"pmcanenny","8","1","5","21 December 2016"," Good but very different
","Rogue One is the first of a series of Star Wars spin off films that really had to set the tone, and I think it did so reasonably well, however as a massive Star Wars fan I left the cinema feeling that the film lacked something. <br/><br/>While the story itself holds up well and has plenty of nods to the original films for all the long term fans out there, I found it lacked a certain sense of adventure that the other films have. There was little characterisation which leaves you struggling to really get behind the characters. <br/><br/>But it wasn't all bad, on the contrary there's plenty of positives, with lots of action and the main battle in the film really taking you back to that galaxy far far away. The CGI was superb, with some really nice surprises popping up. The main droid character K2SO provided much needed comic relief in an otherwise rather grim movie, which is set in the same tone as Empire Strikes Back and seems to be aimed at the 30+ age bracket instead of the 12 year old's all previous movies were aimed at.<br/><br/>Overall the film is very good and definitely worth a watch if you're a Star Wars fan, but can also be enjoyed if you have never seen any of the other films. It's a different kind of Star Wars film that's less Guarfians of the Galaxy and more Saving Private Ryan."

","Well the story about stealing those pesky Imperial secret plans gets another re-hash but this time in AVX 3D with a few cameos by original evil villain characters and the story has a hanging ending alluding to yet another sequel... The story line, while not predictable, definitely reminiscent of Part IV right down to the farming family, cheeky android robots, space port outposts and space battle scenes. Totally dazzling CGI imagery even better on a big screen in 3D. To keep continuity a few key Imperial characters make a re-appearance and there is a somewhat surprising ending that leads the way to the opening scene of the original 1977 Part IV including an unexpected appearance by a presumably CGI generated young princess character....In some ways if you haven't seen Part IV then see Rogue One first but if you're the Over-50 crowd and remember seeing the first Star Wars then Rogue One both makes sense yet eerily follows the same basic story and plot."
"chewbacca-79476","9","1","5","21 December 2016"," Star Wars Rogue One is an absolute masterpiece. The film will keep you on the edge of your seats until the very end.
","Star Wars Rogue One truly kept to the Star Wars legacy. The movie is a great movie, and will not upset canon viewers. It was not like Star Wars the Force Awakens. While the movie was a fun movie, it did not feel like Star Wars. Star Wars Rogue One however stays true to the Star Wars heart.<br/><br/>Lets Start off by addressing the story of Star Wars Rogue One: (SPOILERS AHEAD BE WARNED). It starts off with our main character, Jyn Erso. Her father is being taken away by the Imperials. If you have not seen the movie yet I am not going into detail, so please go see the movie yourself for what truly happened. This leads to the events of the movie where Jyn Erso, and the rebels go to Scariff and get the Death Star plans. Then the true beauty of the movie happens. (SPOILERS) The Rebels finally get the plans up. The door gets jammed, and the rebels in the ship cannot get the plans over. Then Darth Vader himself ignites his red blade. This lights up the hole room, as Darth Vader deflects blaster bolts with ease. The plans finally make it over to the Tantive IV. Thus starting the original Star Wars film, A New Hope.<br/><br/>How it relates to the viewers. For this movie you do not have to be a hardcore Star Wars fan. While it would make much more sense if you are a Star Wars fan it is still a great movie for you. For the fans however this movie sticks to the canon, and delivers a true and classic Star Wars film for the history books. If you are a Star Wars fan then what happens at the end of this movie must give you chills. (SPOILERS) Darth Vader ignites his red blade, and rips through the rebels. This is truly the moment you were waiting for. The plans are handed over, and a rebel asks what is this to the Princess. Leia simply responds, ""Hope"". Even for the non Star Wars people watching the movie it must have given them chills. For the Star Wars fans you now know how Star Wars A New Hope truly began. As you remember what happens with these plans you get chills. If you are reading this, and have not seen the movie you have truly ruined the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the cast of the movie are great, the story is great. Simply everything about the movie is great besides a few scenes that could have gone better. Oh, and did I mention the amazing CGI that captured Tarkin. This actor died in 1994, but with the help of CGI Tarkin in the film looks like the Tarkin from Star Wars A New Hope. If you haven't seen the movie I beg of you see the movie, and compare Tarkin with his original counter part in the 1977 film, Star Wars A New Hope. This movie sticks to the canon, truly feels like Star Wars, and has one of the best endings to a Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I think you will agree as well."
"vasco_cid","7","1","5","21 December 2016"," Rogue One: Side story chapter I
","Rogue One is the film that The Force Awakens desperately tried to be and failed miserably. Make no mistake. Both films are short on originality, fall under the same plot schematics and cardboard characters, but where The Force Awakens did it ambitiously, Rogue One does it humbly: and that makes all the difference in the world.<br/><br/>Star Wars is Disney's new big cash-cow milked left and right through expansions on prequels and sequels using as triggers not only major characters but also McGuffins. Don't be surprised if, in years to come, there was a standalone film centered on the Blue Rhinoceros that plays the piano on Return of the Jedi. <br/><br/>Cynicism aside, Rogue one is a return to form on the great Star Wars films of the past; the sheer fun, excitement and engagement with the story grows as the film moves along, amounting to a been-there-done- that-seven-times-before third act, that I ended up not holding myself against at all. The film will go down in history perhaps as the one (or one of the only) case (s) where rewrites and reshoots worked out extremely well despite accentuating this on a much stronger second-half than a limp barely exciting kick-start."
"Eshan_2110","7","1","5","20 December 2016"," A rebellion built on hope
","It took a while to get invested, but by the last act, Rogue One had me on the edge of my seat in pure excitement. There is a certain quality that Rogue One possesses that The Force Awakens simply didn't have. It certainly felt more adventurous and less predictable, even despite the contained nature of the story. <br/><br/>The narrative is simple, a small group of rebels plan to steal the secrets of the Imperial's deadly weapon, the Stardust, otherwise infamously known as the Death Star. The film is set in between the third and fourth film and having watched A New Hope, I understood what the outcome of this narrative would be, but this is a story that hadn't previously been told and as such, we as the audience could not predict the fate of all the newly introduced characters. This meant director Gareth Edwards, who helmed the most recent Godzilla (2014), and screenwriters Tony Gilroy and Chris Weitz had a lot to experiment with. Our main protagonist is Jyn Erso, played by Felicity Jones. She is a fierce and skilled combatant, but without a family as established early in the narrative. Her father, Galen Erso, an engineer for the Death Star was abruptly taken away from Jyn as a child by the Empire. Throughout the film, we are introduced to several other characters who form the team. Diego Luna plays Cassian Andor, a rebel who will go to any limits for the cause. Riz Ahmed plays a former imperial cargo pilot who leans towards the rebellion. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang play the inseparable duo of Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus. The choreography of the fight scenes involving Donnie Yen's character were wonderful and unique for a Star Wars film, it was refreshing to see a focus on combat without lightsabers or blasters. My favourite character was Alan Tudyk's K-2SO however, who simply stole the show with his witty remarks and dry humour. I wouldn't argue that any of these particularly stood out by themselves but as a collective worked. I particularly liked how none of these characters felt invincible per se and as such could die at any moment. In some ways, this film is what I imagined Suicide Squad would be like. We see everything from their perspective, whether it be the lower angles used to show simply looking up to the AT-AT's in the beach battle scene, showing them to be powerless.<br/><br/>The antagonist of this anthology film is Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic, an Imperial Officer who whilst suited to the narrative, was not captivating enough. The character's primary motivation involves gaining a greater position on the imperial hierarchy, which did make him dangerous to a certain degree as it he was willing to do anything to get there. With that said, he does fall under the cliché villain trope of the quest for more power. I also didn't enjoy Forest Whittaker's character, Saw Gerrera, who is an extremist that separated himself from the Rebellion. I just found him hard to root for given his small screen time and being quite hard to understand (his voice was quite soft and mumbled).<br/><br/>The pacing of the start of the film is quite slow as we build our connection to Jyn's story. There is a lot of exposition through dialogue and so this film can be followed by someone who hasn't had the pleasure of watching Episode 4. We are quickly introduced to these other characters, which prevents us from caring for them much like we did with Rey and Finn in The Force Awakens. There wasn't a lot of character development.<br/><br/>There were great homages towards the original trilogy and prequels. There are a few special surprises for fans and they are handled wonderfully. It's very impressive as to what opportunities technology offers.The use of digital effects and CGI in the film were excellent. Much like The Force Awakens, the worlds feel natural and huge in scale through establishing shots. They feel alive and each have their own identity, this is aided by the practical effects and costumes. In fact, this was perhaps the most we've seen of the Star Wars universe in a single film as the character's explore many worlds in the film. <br/><br/>The iconic John Williams did not score the soundtrack this time around. Instead, the acclaimed Michael Giacchino, handled the score for Rogue One and used parts of William's score. I really did enjoy it and felt it certainly elevated moments of the film, especially the battle scenes. <br/><br/>Rogue One naturally fits into the established Star Wars time-line. The outcome of the narrative is particularly significant going forward into the Episode 4, but we already knew that! As a prequel, it works and creates an interesting story with characters that were not prominent beforehand. The film really comes alive in its final act and Gareth Edwards was able to show off his abilities as a film maker but also that he understood what makes Star Wars special. Themes of hope present in the original trilogy are used here. The way they handled specific characters was a wonderful treat for fans. With that said, Darth Vader whose presence was not heavily advertised might I add, was without a doubt in my mind, the most exciting part of Rogue One. He was menacing and the portrayal of him was the best yet. The costume was also fantastic and very true to the 1977 design. It is a shame to say that I wanted a lot more of him. This may sound like a negative, but this point derives from my own fanboy demands! Arguably,this film was the best opportunity to use him in a film again,especially considering his demise in episode 6. With that said I can understand perhaps the fear of audience reception and I respect the film makers for not feeling the need to focus heavily on him and trust the story they created."
"Jakemcclake","8","1","5","20 December 2016"," Good Story, but not quite the Uplift of ""A New Hope"" or ""Return of The Jedi""
","This is a powerful story of heroism, determination and bravery. It is based around the lines in the ""A New Hope"" Story comments on the screen that followed a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. <br/><br/>The Rebel alliance stole the plans for the Empire's big weapon the Death Star and were attempting to get those plans somewhere to diagnose them, and determine if there is a weakness. <br/><br/>In this movie we see the story of those brave rebels that performed that task. We also see the reason, they strive with tremendous determination to complete the task. <br/><br/>We know how it is to end although we do not know the entire story. <br/><br/>Not giving much away, it is hard to determine if ""The Force"" plays a hand in this story for the rebels. But bravery and mind over matter determination definitely show up here. This makes the story more about the ordinary people, who can become heroes. If you know the story of A New Hope, you will find the ending uplifting. But even if you do, you probably need to grasp the realistic nature of what is taking place on the screen as well, as it is not extremely uplifting."
"jjeffrey","9","1","5","20 December 2016"," Star Wars- this most definitely was.
","I went into the cinema with serious reservations about Rogue One and came out with them (nearly) all dispelled. One of the issues I had was whether a story which had an all too well-known outcome would warrant a feature length treatment; another was the CGI-ing of some returning characters that I'd heard feature in the movie; and finally, would it really be 'Star Wars' or just lavish fan-fiction? Well, the story is well plotted and very well paced (despite what some others have said), unfolding a very grown-up tale of redemption and sacrifice. There are a couple of jarring moments when seeing familiar faces remade by CGI, one at length, for those of us on- board since '77. When I asked my wife about it, however, she was unaware that the character had had a CGI-makeover. She thought she was watching a real flesh and blood actor, so, the job had clearly been well done. As for the nods and in-jokes, yes there were plenty but, nothing got in the way of the narrative drive towards Rogue One's spectacular, bitter-sweet climax. There are some really fine casting choices and quality performances on show that make the characters engaging. <br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling that I'd just seen a fine movie for the first of many times. My wife, who had only seen Ep. VII at the cinema reckoned that Rogue One was better, and I think she's probably right. This feels like a proper Star Wars movie to me and should not be dismissed as an exercise in milking a franchise.There were some very small children near us in the auditorium and I reckon may have nightmares for days to come after watching the extensive and gritty battle-sequences in this film - this really deserves its cautionary rating as did Ep.III. For us oldies, however, I don't think I'll be the only one watching double bills of this and Ep.IV on Blu-ray when Rogue One eventually comes out."
"namob-43673","9","1","5","20 December 2016"," One of the best
","I really loved this movie. And after watching it a second time, putting in ""a new hope"" straight after was amazing. The movies ties in so well together they could almost have been done at the same time.<br/><br/>Comes to the negatives I sort of agree with most of the criticism. The music was not the best and seldom enhanced the experience. A couple of the actors, most notably ""the Pilot"" and the female lead could have done slightly better. I can also find a few specific moments that sort of work, but they feel like they could have been done better, the interrogation scene with some blob creature comes to mind... If being very nitpicky there are also a few, very minor, plot holes.<br/><br/>So this is not a perfect movie, but it is almost perfect entertainment. This movie also delivers a more grown-up perspective of the rebellion and it feels like one of the best in the franchise. This is definitely a go-see film and I would rank this on pair with Civil War of the most entertaining movie of 2016, however I would still put this slightly ahead as a movie experience - growing up with the original Star War trilogy this is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>As a final Spoiler! I would also like to point out that I find it extremely refreshing that they killed off all of the main characters. Seldom see that in movies and from a Disney own franchise seeing these adult themes and everyone dying a heroes death was a great choice, and kind of surprising. It totally make sense, and I assume all of them dying would be the case, but I was afraid they would shun away from it. The feeling from this movie also enhances the pay-off watching ""A new hope"" because the joy and feel of pay back when they blow up the death star is, now, like seeing it for the first time again. Great stuff!"
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","1","5","18 December 2016"," Good but Not Really Star Wars Is It
","I sat sunken in my chair, anxiously awaiting as the lights began to dim. I had my Milkduds in one hand, popcorn in the other and a drink snugged neatly in its perch. The theater was stuffed to the brim, not only with the clamoring bodies of generations of fans but with an uncommon excitement. This was an event! A jovial celebration of all things Star Wars (1977-Present). The trailers passed, the crowd grew silent, and the opening crawl started.<br/><br/>This is not the experience I had watching Rogue One but rather the experience watching Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999). I was eleven; and as with everything I watched when I was that young, I was positively over the moon about that darn film. Now, seventeen years later, watching Rogue One feels like a pale imitation of what came before. Which is a shame because objectively speaking it's a pretty riveting film.<br/><br/>Rogue One tells a story stuck in between the margins of Star Wars lore. Jyn Erso (Jones) a rebel turned feckless criminal, is tasked by the rebel alliance to track down plans for the Empire's newest weapon, the Death Star. She's arguably best suited for the dangerous job, her father Galen Erso (Mikkelsen), is the weapon's unwilling architect and, along with a pilot defector (Ahmed) is the alliance's only real lead.<br/><br/>If Rogue One is guilty of anything it's covering the spread. Jyn and her rainbow coalition of hard-bitten allies are not the stoic, big-picture, ethereal-types that quickly learn the ways of the force and take down the empire. These small cogs are the pessimistic, doleful yet dutiful foot soldiers that churn the larger rebel machinery. Their internal conflicts are smaller, their skirmishes with the Empire, more devastating and their victory isn't a comfortable spiritual afterlife hanging out at Ewok parties; it's survival.<br/><br/>Thus what we get is less of a Star Wars movie than a rough-and-tumble war movie that parades familiar artifacts like blasters, droids and Tie Fighters. To many this is a welcome surprise; especially for those who felt The Force Awakens (2015) was nothing more than a calculated revamp of A New Hope (1977). Director Gareth Edwards, appropriately adds new and interesting worlds (at least new for Star Wars) into the larger extended universe and amplifies scale. The hand-held camera usage, creative implementation of elements such as rain, dust and dirt, the showcasing of tactical warfare are all layered on to properly mimic top-shelf war movies of the last decade.<br/><br/>Yet the characters, united by a sense of purpose, and a nebulous understanding of the Force can't help but feel rudimentary here. Without spoiling too much; the climax of the film involves our beleaguered heroes placing all their chips on a risky mission to destabilize the Empire's grip on the galaxy. Up until this point, the group has remained distrusting of each other and prudent towards their problems. Why shouldn't that? After all, they're rebel fighters, what's going to happen to them if they refuse to rebel, they're tried for treason? While Jyn's motivations are all but clear at this stage in the film, those of the others remain but a chrysalis of what is required for audiences to care. Sadly, it takes a lot more than constant reminders of riskiness and a mock John Williams score to get audiences to identify with the stakes.<br/><br/>This along with constant, slap-dash callbacks to other Star Wars films (which have little to do with the plot), cut through the hull of Rogue One like a photon torpedo. Add to the fact that the film includes some creepy CGI, this spin-off/sequel to an original/prequel feels like it's trying desperately to recapture the cultural event cashe the film series had when I was eleven. Well, I'm not eleven anymore."
"charliep14","7","1","5","19 December 2016"," As good as candy...
","Rogue one is a fun movie. It has fantastic action scenes, a great cast of secondary characters (Donnie!!!) and plays on the nostalgia of all the vehicles & sets of the original trilogy beautifully. It is so cool to see the original stormtroopers, AT-AT and other AT-ST. <br/><br/>It also features probably the grimmest war scene of any Star Wars movie. Almost reminiscent of Private Ryan in certain aspects; it is violent -definitely not for kids- and very well made. This scene makes the movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to point out what's wrong with the movie. It is like candy because, even though it is good, it lacks a point or purpose? Yes, it is a spin off and about the extended universe. But would one enjoy Rogue one without being familiar with anything from the franchise? <br/><br/>It does lack some elements that make Star Wars great: - the characters don't really fit in the bigger picture... so why do you really care? - the music is clearly not John Williams, that's a pretty big letdown. - the main characters are ... not as good as the ones from Episode 7<br/><br/>So yes, good movie, great visuals, fun times... but ""Empire Strikes Back"" it is not!"
"TheOneThatYouWanted","7","1","5","18 December 2016"," Reshooting this film may have saved the Star Wars cinematic universe.
","First off, this film is completely over-hyped. Seriously, you literally can not trust movie reviewers/critics anymore. Even the ones on YouTube are paid off because, as time will show us, this film is a C+/B- at best. Just so you know, I hated Episode VII. I would have hated this film just as much as Episode VII if it wasn't for the third act. The third act of Rogue One not only saved itself but the future of the Star Wars universe. <br/><br/>Anyway, this film, Rogue One is about the daughter of the dude who built the DeathStar leading a band of misfits on a mission to retrieve vital data on how to destroy the planet killing weapon her father was forced to build. As I touched upon earlier, nearly the first two thirds of the film are a mess. The characters are underdeveloped, the pacing is random, a lot of the scenes feel like time wasting filler, like the soon to be notorious CGI human old guy from A New Hope, whatever his name is. Not only was the CGI painfully noticeable and cartoony at times, but maybe 80% of his screen time and dialogue wasn't even needed to progress the story forward, add to character development, or even set a mood. It isn't the world's biggest secret that they nearly turned this film into a Hunger Games movie. You can tell by how much of the stupid dialogue from the first trailer didn't make it into the movie. But there was a stupid and very random speech the character of Jyn gave that gives us a glimpse of how bad this movie could have su@ked. But thankfully whoever reshot the rest of the movie did a great job. If you don't know the story, Disney saw the original final cut of the film and called it garbage. They hired a last minute ""second unit"" director and offered to pay him two hundred thousand dollars to reshoot last act of the film. The guy had to reshoot practically 40% of the movie and was ultimately paid 5 million dollars. Money well spent if you ask me because the final 40 minutes of this film are great. You see this team of misfits working together, developing emotional bonds and go to war in the Empire. The most notable character of the film is played by Donnie Yen. A force sensing Kung-Fu monk and the heart of the movie. The Final scene with Darth Vader is what everyone will be talking about. Anyway, it looks like Disney could finally be learning its lesson about giving us Hunger Games ripoffs, recycled Star Wars plot points and Mary Sues. Here's to hoping Episode VIII will be an actual Star Wars movie."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","5","18 December 2016"," A Star Wars story is just what I wanted: a war in the stars.
","Set between Episodes III and IV, Rogue One is about the rebel alliance trying to steal the plans to the Death Star in order to try and win the war. Sounds like it would make for a pointless movie with such little substance and possibly boring...thankfully Gareth Edwards has done the franchise justice and has given it new life. My word, I honestly thought this was going to be bad, I am so glad to be wrong. Firstly, the cast was solid as Felicity Jones has now proved to us all not only can she act well in dramas but she is now an action heroine and can take on a film at the helm. Donnie Yen is worth mentioning, originally I thought his character would've been out of place, in fact he is vital in restoring everyone's faith in the Force and he is still doing all of his own fight choreography! Ben Mendelsohn was a great villain, always in the shadows of a higher power and his character craves control, I thought he did well. Diego Luna, Riz Ahmed and Forest Whitaker were great additions to the canon. This film needed a good story, especially after the boring and tedious Episode VII, thankfully it did. As we all know the beginning of Episode IV, we know how this film plays out...but even so the character development is done so well that it was easy to become attached to them despite their untimely fate. Whilst some might think of this as predictable, I believe this to be necessary. This instalment was good for fleshing out the saga and filling in the gaps that were left from the dreaded prequel trilogy and it worked marvellously. Gareth Edwards oozed confidence directing this, a mixture of static landscape shots to a slight camera shakiness when the action arrives, enhancing the style. Talking of style, the visual effects were breathtaking. The planets were so different from each other, the architecture of some of the buildings were absolutely creative and CGI during the battle scenes were utilised excellently. The only time where the visuals were bad, was when a certain character arrives...the problem is this character is completely computer generated and unfortunately looks bad, it took me out of the film from time to time. The script was witty, particularly the lines delivered from the droid K2SO which turn out to blunt sarcastic responses. A much needed comic relief from the dark, realistic and gritty perspective. The soundtrack was a mixture of old and new and the remixed themes of classic cues felt refreshing. I do have to mention, the last act of the film is possibly the best 40 minutes of the Star Wars saga and the last 5 minutes is ridiculously powerful, you will love it! Overall, Rogue One was a much darker instalment to the franchise with great performances, stunning visuals and gritty action. Aside from the horribly rendered CGI human character, this film was fantastic and the last act was breathtaking...I can't stop thinking about it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","The expectations were so big that was very easy be disappointed, but Gareth Edwards has lived up to it. With a very different plot to the rest of the movies ""Rogue One"" tells us a story that allows us to fill a gap in the Star Wars story, how the resistance got the Death Star plans. <br/><br/>Without forget the original movies, making some references to iconic characters created by George Lucas, Gareth Edwards has wanted to expand the Star Wars universe creating new worlds and races, with the objective of remembrance the mythical scene of the Mos Eisley Cantina, where we could find a mixed group of aliens. <br/><br/>Although the plot succeeds in getting out of the typical Star Wars stories, the characters leave much to be desired. The performance of Felicity Jones and Diego Luna is not up to par of a Star Wars film. In conclusion: good plot, good memories of the first saga, better special effects, but the performances of the main characters are mediocre. <br/><br/>""I am with the force and the force is with me"""

For the first time since watching the sequels I felt the worlds and peoples of this galaxy could be touched and were not just a projection, or part of my imagination. It was as if the motives and stories of the characters blended together in a fashion unlike EP7.<br/><br/>Because this movie separated the partly amusing, easy-to-like characters of EP7 from these gritty, realistic and honest characters of R1. Because the passion came through with the performances, the script and locations felt true to the genre, and the movie was clearly written with a purpose of actually entertaining adults by providing real sci- fi value.<br/><br/>There are no spoilers needed to tell you that this was a joy to watch. It was a movie that exceeded my expectations and evermore made me excited for the future of the saga.

I would say this is ""The Thin Red Line"" to the other episodes ""Saving private Ryan"". <br/><br/>There is humor but its not presented like it would be in an after school special. <br/><br/>Things I did not like, the Music. I am sorry some of it worked but others I was wandering, OK how does that fit the mood of this scene. To be fair the scenes seem to jump a lot so it might be difficult for the composer to set a mood. The other thing I did not like were the CGI people, come on just use the new actors and the audience will accept it, don't be so George Lucas like. <br/><br/>The best part was this is just a story on its own and I wish they would do more of these. Also, it doesn't have to be a big screen movie, some have mentioned putting the Bane Trilogy on HBO, Showtime, or Netflix as a 10 part-er, and that would be great just add more violence, sex, and nudity and it would fit write in."

","Wow! Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was spectacular. I was able to see a screening on opening night and man was I pleased with the product. ALERT: If you haven't seen the movie yet and can spare to wait a few more days, read the book Catalyst. This book is a prequel to the movie and gives a deep backstory of how the Empire functions, the Erso family, and Krennic's connection to them. Knowing a little more backstory before was huge for me in terms of my enjoyment of the film, especially since there is no opening crawl. The great thing about this movie is that the worst part is the fact that there is no opening crawl, which for me being a huge fan and knowing what was going on, the absence of a crawl could affect a lot of people in terms of understanding the story. Furthermore, I won't get into any spoilers in this review, other than the fact that this movie is good for casual or non-fans, but excellent for hardcore fans. There are numerous nods to the original trilogy and prequel trilogy in this movie, some even in the form of characters. This movie mixes just the right amount of nostalgia with new lore. So, as I rap up this review, my final talking point is the 1st act and part of the 2nd act of the film. Once again, no spoilers, but from a watching standpoint the movie tends to be a little slow and sometimes boring in the middle of the film, but you must understand it is setting up these characters and their stories. After you see the 3rd act everything fits in nicely and I believe that upon rewatch, the 1st and 2nd acts will be much better. In conclusion, this movie is not The Force Awakens. It's a war movie with an emotional connection to the Original Trilogy. This is a true Star Wars movie and in my eyes Disney is 2 for 2 so far. <br/><br/>P.S. You'll like what you'll see from Vader 😏"
"brankovranjkovic","7","1","5","17 December 2016"," Rogue One – The Most Anticipated Film of the Year
","This is the first standalone film in the franchise, though with familiar 'Star Wars' references. Rogue One is about a group of rebel spies who band together in order to steal the plans to the Death Start from the Galactic Empire. This is the story just prior to the original 1977 Star Wars 'A New Hope'. <br/><br/>Anyone who remembers the original 'crawl' at the beginning will appreciate that Rogue One owes its premise to a single line from that opening crawl. Rogue One is designed to fill the gap and explains why the Death Star had such an exploitable weakness. <br/><br/>I found the film to be very similar to the 2016 'Magnificent 7' remake, where a diverse set of mercenaries unite, bond and head into action.<br/><br/>Rogue One starts well with good scenery and effective 3d depth. I found the middle draged a little but then picks up again during the battle heavy sequences, which I found to resemble a modern computer war game. There's an emotional scene towards the end where the two main characters (Jyn and Cassian) are caught in a gigantic bomb blast and die in each other's arms. In fact every one of the new characters dies in one way or another. <br/><br/>At the very end we see the rebels' handover the Death Star plans to a CGI Princess Leia. The plans are on the familiar small computer disk. The perfect set-up for the next instalment. <br/><br/>There was loads of hype behind this film, designed to maximise the money making potential (and why not!). I hope the next instalment doesn't try to make too much of a plot out of 'nothing'. For instance; Chewbacca gets a haircut or Vader gets the best shine from using windolene.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not bad but not great. This is an entertaining film with some good new characters, especially the reprogrammed sarcastic droid K-2SO. Probably aimed at hard-core fans though more casual fans (like myself) found enjoyable."
"christhomas-09512","7","1","5","16 December 2016"," A spin-off that makes itself right at home
","My main gripe with prequels, spin-offs and side stories is their connection with the main property usually feels forced. Details, events and characters are shoehorned in just for fan service. The story taking place doesn't matter much because the outcome is predetermined. New characters get introduced that lack the charm or charisma of the ones you fell in love with...well, I'm here to say Rogue One definitely breaks from that and offers one of the best and most action packed Star Wars entries to date.<br/><br/>True, the events set up here lead directly to the start of A New Hope, but the adventure getting there is well worth the watch. I thought Felicity Jones was great as Jyn and carried a lot of scenes very well. Alan Tudyk (much like in I, Robot) gives about as much heart to a CGI robotic character as an actor can and Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang and Riz Ahmed were solid complimentary pieces that rounded out our ragtag group of heroes. I found Diego Luna's Captain Cassian to be a bit lacking, though. He comes across as a conflicted individual; a man that's done the unspeakable in the name of the Rebellion. However, I didn't feel it translated well. He was bland and quite frankly, the most boring character of the whole crew.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple, but there's enough humor and on-screen chemistry to keep viewers engaged. Stylistically, there are a number of hallmarks Star Wars fans will pick up on and love instantly. At the same time, the movie is quite unlike any other adventure to the galaxy far, far away. I've seen a number of people call this a ""war movie"" and I think the description is pretty apt. You certainly feel like these heroes are fighting from the trenches. There are no elegant lightsaber duels. It's mostly shootouts on the ground with a few space dogfights near the end. The combat has is visceral and you do feel some tugging of the heartstrings when our beloved mismatched bunch starts getting knocked off.<br/><br/>The bad? Well, I must say that while it was quite the surprise to see a digitally resurrected Peter Cushing return as Tarkin, his role was a bit much. I felt like had he not been so prominent, the effect would have been much more impressive. There were scenes he looked nearly perfect and others where he looked liked a video game. I applaud the ambition, but limited screen time and keeping him in the shadows might have been better. I also found Saw Guerrera to be over the top. I was excited when Forest Whitaker was originally cast, but he gets wasted here and has a laughable death scene to boot. The beginning of the movie is choppy and the middle sags a bit. Things don't really start to pick up until the main Rogue One crew assembles and things take a dip until the awesome climactic battle(s).<br/><br/>Yes, there is fan service. However, it's all pretty well done. Darth Vader scores one of the best movie cameos I've seen in a long time. He is once again the menacing presence we all saw him as before he turned on the Emperor and we learned of his origins. He's cold, calculating and downright vicious in the bits of time he graces the screen. There is also another little surprise cameo at the very end that's a treat. All in all, Rogue One is an entertaining side street that leads to a road we know very well. It does a good job incorporating itself within the Star Wars universe while being its own self contained story. If this is any indication of how the other spin-offs are going to be, I say bring 'em on!"
"darioilg","8","1","5","16 December 2016"," Fan service, fan service...
","""Rogue One"" is the first of (probably) many side installments in the form of films in the Star Wars universe. Its reason of being is clear and, for once, legitimate: to explain how Leia got the info about a weakness in the Death Star and how to destroy it. Decades of discussions spun out of what many called a plot-hole, but which happens to be closed by this film. I won't get into the details because f*ck spoilers, but what they came up with is a half-satisfactory reason, which makes half-sense after thinking about it. Everything surrounding this purpose is more or less the basic plot of any blockbuster introducing ""new"" characters: the tough girl, tough boy, a funny stooge (as any SW film, a droid), and a few others. Actually, it's the few others that make for an enjoyable bunch, as Jyn Erso and (especially!) Cassian Andor are some of the most linear characters I've seen in some time; on the other hand, Chirrut, Baze and K2, while not being especially memorable, are fun to watch and get to you on the long run. The plot itself is nothing special: just another shoot-out, another space battle, another base infiltration, same old, same old. Also, two great actors such as Mads Mikkelsen and Forest Whitaker are criminally underused for criminally badly written characters. Only the final moments of the movie are particularly well staged, with an ending that managed to shock me -and, thus, please me- quite a bit.<br/><br/>When watching a sci-fi and more specifically a Star Wars entry, special effects and awe-inspiring visuals are vital. And ""Rogue One"" might very well be THE best one yet on this account, even surpassing Episode VII. A pretty bad story is structured so that the most awesome scenes could be made, and they are just as incredible as they should. Maybe the classic space battle near the end of the film could've been slightly better staged, though. There are two characters from the original trilogy that come back for this movie in the splendor of CGI: the one taking some time on screen is so well made that I could hardly realize it wasn't an actual person. The other, appearing at the very end, SUCKS TERRIBLY. He/she looks like a play dough doll, really shameful.<br/><br/>With its highs and lows, ""Rogue One"" is not an extremely memorable Star Wars film, being better than the prequel trilogy (and that is no hard task, if you ask me), but worse than any other (and that is not strange either). Hopeful and excited for next year's Episode VIII!"
"heatsink98","7","1","5","15 December 2016"," Starts a little rough but gets there, sort of
","It's Star Wars, and the events that led up to Luke setting off on his heroic journey. And there's no Jar Jar, thank the maker.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is muddy on plot and could have used streamlining to go straight for the goal of finding Galen Erso, reluctant Death Star engineer. It involves a convoluted storyline of the rebel alliance randomly finding and rescuing Jyn Erso from an Imperial work colony, or was it random? I couldn't tell.<br/><br/>Moving on, the plot next involves the rebel alliance convincing Jyn to work with them to find rebellious rebel and sometimes crazy person Saw Gerrera. They also want to find a traitor Imperial pilot who's working for Galen Erso to point everyone to getting the Death Star plans for the rebel alliance. Or something along those lines. The bottom line is: get the Death Star plans to the rebel alliance by using the traitor Imperial pilot as the courier of a message about the Death Star's weakness and Galen's family exposition meant for Jyn, only the courier goes to Saw Gerrera instead of the rebels and didn't bother looking for Jyn for some reason.<br/><br/>Right, the plot bobs and weaves until Jyn and her rebels track down Galen Erso, who promptly dies during a rebel bombardment of the Imperial research station where he's been working. Jyn and her companions then try to convince the rebels to do something about the Death Star, but they refuse. Our heroes then attack the Imperial data storage facility planet that houses the Death Star plans on their own, drawing in everyone for a fairly significant battle. The movie picks up here with the space combat and the assault on the storage facility, and was more interesting than the first half.<br/><br/>The film was mostly enjoyable, but there are a few logic problems that turned up, so it takes a strong suspension of disbelief to get into it. The Death Star plans and its weakness are summed up by Galen Erso in his hologram message smuggled out by the Imperial Pilot, so why need the plans if everyone knows the rebel pilots could fly down the trench and drop bombs in the thermal exhaust port? Also, why bother going after Galen Erso in the first place, if the Death Star is already built? If the space station were still in planning stages, this might be more understandable. A certain important character later ends up with the Death Star plans, and she's just been hanging around during the big space battle at the end for what reason? <br/><br/>Anyway, stealing the Death Star plans as the story goal is another problem, since this a prequel and everyone on this planet probably already knows the outcome of the mission. I suppose that leaves us wondering about what happens to the heroes of this story as a reason to watch it. But it's Star Wars, so watching is fun. Just don't focus on the logic problems and enjoy the big battle toward the end of the movie and remind yourself there's no Jar Jar."

","Its hard for me to admit, but this film is better than Episode VII. Its got an original story, visually stunning shots, great choreography during every scene--especially battle scenes, and has a great ensemble cast. <br/><br/>First lets hit a few low points: (1) The cameo of R2 and C3PO is poorly timed. They're watching the ships launch to go to the final battle, which Leia's ship escapes from with the Death Star plans... they're supposed to be on that ship already! Their cameo should have been earlier. It would have been better utilized if C3PO would have ran into K2SO. Can you imagine that encounter? (2) Tarkin's height. If you've watched the behind the scenes material from Episode IV, you've heard that Peter Cushing wore slippers during filming. We'll come back to that later. My husband noticed during our second viewing that when CG Tarkin stands next to Krennic, he's a head taller than him. Fast-forward to the scene where Krennic stands next to Vader... and Krennic's merely a head shorter than the Dark Lord. Wait, what??? So Tarkin and Vader are both a head-length taller than Krennic? Was CG Tarkin wearing his 1970s moon boots during this film versus slippers? I cannot complain about the CG faces because I personally thought they were fine. It was Tarkin's height that did not quite ""stand up"" to the original. I'm funny... I know. (3) In terms of musical score, I wasn't a biggest fan. Without the opening crawl that we're used to, things start a bit suddenly. I felt the music to start things off was a bit overplayed as well as a poor copy of John Williams' brilliant compositions. Michael Giacchino was not up to the challenge, and this would be my biggest complaint. Giacchino has done some big films recently like Star Trek Beyond and Jurassic World, and he just has not quite held up to the original film scores. Zootopia: good. Star Wars: meh.<br/><br/>Back to the great stuff. I love Jyn. Its so great to have some strong female anchors in these films. And a female X-wing pilot? THANK YOU! I grew up idolizing Princess Leia. She was beautiful, tough, intelligent, and could also hold her own beside an entire rebellion full of men (outside of Mon Mothma and the ""standby ion cannon"" female). What other 80s/90s characters provided a young girl like me this kind of female strength? NONE. Even though Return of the Jedi placed Leia in the midst of the fighting, they still had to put her in a bikini, which is basically how that film markets her look! Frustrating. I grew up constantly annoyed with the female protagonists in sci-fi and action/adventure films. Episode VII and Rogue One has really given me a girl power thrill that I'm ecstatic to share with my daughter. <br/><br/>The other characters are also great. Are they super fleshed out, no. But you get enough, particularly with Captain Andor. Both Jyn and Andor go through a lot of development. Other characters help round out a diverse and varied cast which all have great chemistry. Two of my favorites are Chirrut Imwe, a blind holy man, and his crack-shot companion, Baze Malbus. Chirrut is a man who still holds onto faith. Baze has lost his, but stands by his friend through thick and even thicker. Watching their final scenes during my second viewing actually brought a few tears to my eyes. Their faith, moments both lost and found, were such highlights and a refreshing touch to Star Wars which has otherwise been absent: the power of faith. Being a Jedi is one thing, but believing in the Force, an energy field which Chirrut cannot touch, is something entirely different that this film explores. Even Jyn has a piece of Kyber that she grips to find strength during times of life and death. <br/><br/>This film is laugh-out-loud funny. There are a few moments in the other films, but this script is so sharp. K2SO is hysterical. So many other comical moments infuse this film. It definitely is what makes you want to see these characters again and again. <br/><br/>As stated in my summary above, the visuals are so beautiful. I first watched this film in 3D and would not recommend it. My second viewing in 2D allowed me to revel in the beautiful landscapes and special effect shots. The close ups of the Death Star, the reflection on the ships as they passed by planets, the planet-wide shield over Scarif, the attack runs of the X-Wings... so satisfying to long-time Star Wars fans who've watched the films become more beautiful. And the planet landscapes, particularly Jedha (I love those giant robed men laying in the sand, probably once revered Jedi), were gorgeous. <br/><br/>Of course, let's not forget Darth Vader. James Earl Jones is the master in the way Vader inflects his points and dominance. And that final scene where he throws around some Rebel fodder... yeah, I bet your jaw dropped just like mine. This was the Darth Vader we needed, the confident and sarcastic Vader from ESB. <br/><br/>Finally, the directing. Its so well done. Can this director do the rest of the Star Wars films, please? Each shot was captured stunningly. Two particularly chilling moments were when we first see Tarkin's face in the reflection of a window and when Vader is revealed as a large and looming shadow towering over Krennic. <br/><br/>This film is satisfying on so many levels: great cast, great special effects, funny, and excellent characters that provide humor and heart. I really wish SOMEONE could have survived, but that is sometimes the price of freedom. Freedom isn't free. And many heroes are often unsung. Despite the heart-wrenching ending (yep, everyone dies), it ends with the theme of the entire film: Hope. And the final shot - loved it!"

","Like many others, I had lower expectations going into this given J.J. Abrams' Ep. VII and Gareth Edwards resume. But I too was pleasantly surprised. I had read Catalyst: A Rogue One story before seeing this movie, which I believe definitely enhanced my enjoyment of the movie. The book gave a lot of great background on the characters, especially Krennic. Krennic was a much better developed character in the book - very ambitious, clever, and having no morals or values. His character falls a little flat in the movie or rather just goes along with the story - this, however, is my only real criticism of the movie. The other characters, the art direction (I loved the 70's/80's retro look to a lot of it), the story, action, etc. are all very well done. I had a few other minor criticisms as well - I didn't like the computer generated faces for Tarkin and Leia, the movie jumped around a bunch of worlds initially, which was confusing, and it was too big of a coincidence that the Empire chose the same planet than Jyn was on to go after. But those are minor complaints of an otherwise amazing movie. The movie not only ties in well to the other Star Wars movies, it actually helps make them even better than they were originally (e.g. explaining why the Death Star was built with a flaw that allowed it to be destroyed so easily). Darth Vader and Governor Tarkin were really well done (despite Tarkin's face). Vader has a small part but nearly steals the movie - definitely left me wanting more, but Gareth gave him the right amount of time. And Felicity Jones does a tremendous job as the lead (and thank you Gareth for including more females in this movie not only with Jyn but the X-wing pilots and other roles too). My favorite characters other than Jyn and Vader were definitely the droid K-2SO played by Alan Tudyk and Chirrut played by Donnie Yen. They both in their own separate ways helped balance out the dark side of this movie making it a perfect balance and near perfect movie. I can only hope subsequent Star Wars movies are this good. But for now, thank you Gareth and team for delivering a most amazing movie and experience. It was awesome!"

","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a phenomenal film in almost every aspect. If it wasn't for The Force Awakens, this would easily be my favourite Star Wars film that Disney produced.<br/><br/>The cast across the board is terrific, but the clear highlight is Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso. She was wonderful, and the character has such a defined arc throughout the film. I also really liked Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic, and Mads Mikkelson as Galen Erso.<br/><br/>The narrative was constantly compelling, and, despite the fact that we already know how the film will end, I was locked in the whole time. Gareth Edwards did such a marvellous job of directing it. The entire third act is mostly taken up by impressive action set-pieces, but the whole film up until that point was engaging and the ending with Darth Vader is one of the best film scenes in recent memory.<br/><br/>The screenplay was mostly well-written, although the majority of the jokes didn't land for me and K-2SO seemed to be in the film primarily for comic relief. The droid had a very nice moment towards the end, but there didn't seem to be much narrative purpose for the character up until that point.<br/><br/>I also really adored the musical score because it completely fit the tone of the film, and some of the visual effects were breathtaking.<br/><br/>Overall, apart from a couple of issues with the screenplay, Rogue One is a fantastic film with a thrilling narrative, and it was nice to finally see this story being told on the big screen after all these years.<br/><br/>SCORE: 90%"

"littleging12","8","1","6","3 January 2017"," Battlefront: A Star Wars Story
","Disney looks to further cash in on its four billion dollar investment by making a prequel that precedes the events of ""Star Wars: A New Hope."" ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" chronicles the daring mission the rebel spies undertook to steal the Death Star plans. Rogue One has what you would expect: amazing special effects, exhilarating action, engaging story, and fine performances, but also adds rare complexity, grittiness, and easter eggs that does the old films justice. Yet what holds it back from topping last year's ""The Force Awakens"" is its erroneous mindset that bigger is better, its narrative flaws, and its awkward flow the ending leaves for ""A New Hope.""<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" delivers on what fans wanted. The action scenes are gripping and capture the same intensity as a war movie. The special effects are state of the art, as usual. The story is exciting and patches up the plot hole from the first film of an all-powerful Death Star having such an exploitable weakness. The acting and writing are also perfectly fine. Director Gareth Edwards displays a meticulous attention to detail (like making sure the costumes and technologies fit well with the original films). He also never misses a moment for easter eggs and Star Wars nerdom (Red Five, old X-wing pilots to name a few). ""Rogue One"" takes the next step in its franchise's filmography with its darker tone, war movie-like battles, and deeper thought-provoking themes. Having the rebellion vs Empire feud not seem so black and white was another great aspect because it offered for some rare complexity we normally don't see in a Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" features a whole new entourage of characters with a few familiar cameos. Some of the most memorable are Donnie Yen's blind yet still lethal 'Force' enthusiast Chirrut ÃŽmwe (who supplies the funniest line in the movie). Also there is the ambitious and cunning Orson Krennic played brilliantly by Ben Mendelsohn. There are plenty of others but those two are my personal favorite. The only problem with these characters is that you don't feel as emotionally attached to them as you did with the characters in the original trilogy, and even ""The Force Awakens,"" making for a less effective conclusion.<br/><br/>Though just like ""The Force Awakens,"" the film was never going to be perfect because Edwards (maybe the studio) chose to deliver the fans what they wanted instead of what they needed. The biggest gripe with this film is the obligatory final act. The final act doesn't flow well with the timeline of ""A New Hope."" The battle is so grandiose in its ambitions that it fails to logically set up ""A New Hope."" So then ""A New Hope"" would start out where Princess Leia is like ""we are on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan,"" and Darth Vader be like ""b@!$h you just blew up half our fleet!"" The scene that perfectly epitomizes the unnecessary overkill and pompousness of the third act was when Darth Vader wrecks twenty rebel soldiers who were trying to safely deliver the Death Star plans. The scene was completely unnecessary, and total overkill. It had potential to be the best scene in the movie but just fell flat and arguably was the worst scene in the movie. Also, the whole thing with the majority of the Rebel council declining the decision to attack Scariff was a bit ridiculous because they decided not to attack, then all of a sudden they send in a huge fleet to get the plans based off some sketchy criminal's claims (Jyn in this case). Like really, they risk all of that without any proof that Jyn is telling the truth.<br/><br/>""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" was like the video game Star Wars Battlefront. It was all-out war between pawns. It focused completely on the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Empire. It had no Jedi story lines, lightsaber duels or any sign of the Force. It was all about the grunts fighting in this war, and really excelled with its depiction of warfare and how the rebellion affected these characters. Exploring new themes and bringing a war movie-feel really helped this film feel refreshingly new. Yet it suffered from its lofty ambitions to wow its audience with huge space battles that maimed the continuity it had with ""A New Hope."" Overall ""Rogue One"" is another success and satisfied its audience with enough Star Wars magic to overcome its flaws. This was a good appetizer until we get the full meal in ""Star Wars: Episode VIII."""

In fact, It might be the best overall Star Wars movie in my opinion. In a New Hope, we knew that people had died to get the Death Star plans. Although a scant detail, it added weight to the Death Star's ultimate demise. We also saw the effort princess Leia and the others went through to get the information to the rebel base and the near impossible shot Luke needed to take to make it all work. In Rogue One we actually got to see all the bloodshed needed to get those plans. As a result A New Hope looks better but The Force Awakens looks even stupider. That ten second meeting where they figure out how to completely destroy Starkiller Base with some explosives, shortly after learning about its existence, feels almost insulting. Whereas Luke's miraculous shot is all the more fulfilling. <br/><br/>Because Rogue One is a prequel mostly absent of the usual main characters, the characters did not have the usual plot armor. As such there are a lot of character deaths which adds a certain realism to this movie. This felt like an actual war. The visuals were all very nice and there were no glaring plot holes that I noticed or couldn't readily accept. Dark Vader's scenes where all great. We even got Imperial Walkers which I love for some weird reason!<br/><br/>The humor was mostly great. I'd say the probability that you'll also find the humor to be great is very high. There was plenty of action of course. Perhaps more then any other film, and the end ties in nicely with the beginning of a New Hope. And I just love those wacky white helmets!<br/><br/>A great movie overall. I definitely recommend it."
"simodandrade","8","1","6","28 December 2016"," Disney does it again
","After seeing two straight star wars films that Disney made happen this and the force awakens, it brought me to the conclusion that George Lucas the man who made all of this possible just needs to keep his mouth shut and collect his paycheck. Rogue one is a prequel that covers the secret rebel army that is mentioned in a new hope.This army released out the plans of the death star and how to destroy it. Star wars has not had its luck in the box office with prequel movies, just ask George Lucas himself. So going into this film i was some what curious on how it was going to turn out. My overall review is this isn't a great movie but it is good. The first 20 to 25 minutes in this movie start off very slow but when the first action scene starts that is where it gradually starts to pick up. However in my opinion the one character who saved this movie when he makes his first appearance is the one and only (My favorite movie villain) DARTH VADER!!! When we first see Vader in the movie, Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job on making all of his screen time epic and giving us the Darth Vader that we as star wars fan love.Something that George Lucas failed at doing in the prequel trilogy. So I will say go see this movie even though it has a few minor flaws, it defiantly passes as a good star wars film."
"houghtonetet","10","1","6","24 December 2016"," The war in Star Wars
","Gareth Edwards here presents a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon, telling the tale of how the original Death Star plans were stolen and transmitted to the Rebel Alliance. The film fits seamlessly into the timeline, but is of a wholly different nature to the previously released seven movies.<br/><br/>This film is darker and grittier, and does not shy away from the bitterness and loss of war. There is some good acting here and a fair amount of psychology between many of the actors. The CGI is used moderately and not unnecessarily. There was a good feeling of ""reality"" on many of the planetary scenes. Some characters from Star Wars IV are present but are not used out of proportion to their involvement.<br/><br/>Humour comes mostly from K-2SO, a re-programmed Imperial droid. The two leads, Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, the daughter of the Death Star's designer, and Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a rebel captain, are intense and fit the mood of the film very well. There is good support from actors on both sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>There are no Jedi in this movie, but there is a priest who uses the Force in combat, and Darth Vader shows a trick or two, especially near the end, so the film suffers in that respect, but more than makes up for it in the quality of the set design and effects, the absorbing and interesting story, the chemistry between characters on both sides, the clever splicing in of rebel captains from A New Hope in their fighters, and the obvious love and care with which this film has been crafted.<br/><br/>See this movie, you won't regret it."

","Growing up watching the prequel trilogy to being of age and appreciating the well aging original trilogy, I found this movie to be absolutely fantastic. The title says it all. It does have the feel of a Star Wars movie, but it does so many good things to separate it from the episodic movies. Visually stunning and well acted, I was never bored during the 2 hour and 15 minute run-time. For the fans of the original Star Wars, this movie you will love, trust me when I say that. I had some of the wonderful surprises spoiled for me prior to viewing, so try to avoid those at all costs. Easter eggs are sprinkled throughout and wonderful references. Watch and enjoy."
"kirkir-17920","7","1","6","23 December 2016"," A New Hope?
","Now, I'm gonna go out and say: this is not as good as 4-6, but definitely an improvement over 7. The story was enjoyable, the characters were better and they all gave good performances. While I didn't love the Spock-like robot in the movie, he definitely had a few laughs. He sort of acts as the comic relief in the movie; in a good way. Another thing that makes this a good movie are the fight scenes. They are very well done; but there is a small problem. For me, the pacing of the scenes was very poor. One point, they had about 3 fight scenes in 5 minutes making me thing, it's that kind of movie. But then they go a full hour without one? I don't know, it just didn't feel right.<br/><br/>The only major problem I really had with the movie were the clichÃ©s. This movie was really enjoyable when it stuck to an original story, but when the clichÃ©s came out, I wanted to fall asleep. There were about 5 clichÃ©d ""Oh no I'm gonna get shot but guy I thought didn't like me shoots guy who almost shot me's,"" and two clichÃ©d slow death scenes along with a NOOOOOOOO!<br/><br/>Despite these problems, this is still an enjoyable movie. I would recommend this due to its good writing and enjoyable cast."

","I know many have wondered how many ties in between revenge of the site and a new hope that can be done In rather effective way while adding something new to the story? I will say this film explains how the rebels ended up getting their hands on the Death Star plans as a way of defeating the empire. I know that's most fans are use to the opening crawl which doesn't appear here or have the usual familiar characters like Han Solo or Luke sky walker but the movie is rather effective. The story deals with Jyn Erso whose father was a former imperial officer who was forced to built the Death Star. However he made a design flaw in the project that would allow the rebels to destroy it thus giving a sense of hope that is needed."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","1","6","22 December 2016"," Better than The Force Awakens and the best Star Wars prequel!
","This film surprised me in many ways and pulled of certain things better than The Force Awakens did including story, CGI and call backs to other films. This film is by far and away the darkest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back and is brilliant to see that Disney took a chance with this film with its tone and lack of light-hearted moments.<br/><br/>Lets start with the positives and the first is director Gareth Edwards who did a fantastic job with this film. You can really see the time, effort and heart that has gone into the making of this film and it starts with him. There is a good contrast between shots, there are big wide open shots of planets and locations that look brilliant. There are close ups of Star Destroyers to give a better indication of their size against its surroundings, which really works well. Also the ""hand held"" feel to the beach scene at the end of the film really makes you feel as if your there yourself. From the very start this was pitched as a war film and the final act definitely lives up to that name. Edwards has done a really good job considering all the fuss over the dreaded, end of the world re-shots that know other film has.....cough...... more like every film has. It never shows like this film has been chopped and changed.<br/><br/>Next the story is still interesting and fascinating even though, as Star Wars fans, we know the ending to the story. The film does a really good job of making the known ending a positive instead of negative and builds on the ends foundations and gives room from more creativity to the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Another positive is the CGI in this film and I must say this is some of the best CGI in a Star Wars film to this date. The effects in this film are so seamless that the practical and CG effect blend excellently well, tricking you to guess which is what. The space battle is some of the best action and CG in a Star Wars film, utterly brilliant and a wonder to watch. Its sort of like today's technology meets the beginning of Revenge of the Sith and the end of Return of the Jedi, truly brilliant. Even the AT-ACT's on the beach are brilliant done and bring a real scale to them that even Empire didn't achieve with them. The inclusion of Grand Moff Tarkin as a CGI character was probably inevitable due to the fact that he would be around in the Empire at this period of time, it would seem foolish to not include him. The CGI of the late Peter Cushing was good for the most part but I feel the technology is not quite there yet but it is a really good effort. It actually surprised me how much he was in the film considering this could and will be a negative of the film for some people. <br/><br/>The performances for the most part are just OK, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna as the two main leads give good performances but nothing ground breaking or new. The rest of the supporting cast was OK but again nothing that I could personally latch onto, which is a shame. However the two characters that I could personally were Ben Mendelssohn and Mads Mikkelsen. They were just a little step above the rest for me and had more memorable moments and interactions with each other and other characters. <br/><br/>The another positive is the call backs to the original and prequel films, which this film does a far better job than The Force Awakens because they aren't forced or just copied. Some of the call backs are obvious others and for die hard fans such as myself. Whether it be from blue milk, Ponda Baba and Dr Evazan to red leader and gold leader or to hints of Obi Wan Kenobi and the inclusion of Mustafar, the hints and nods to the other films were brilliantly done and handled. I was surprised with how obscure some of them were but it also shows the effort and attention to detail from Gareth Edwards. <br/><br/>The final positive is Vader, wow just wow, even though he has about four minutes of screen time in the entire film his presence is felt throughout the film. Especially the end where he probably has one of his greatest moments in Star Wars history, if only there was more of it, it personally brought tears to my eyes absolutely out of this world. If anything we need a whole spin off film of that end scene, please Disney please. <br/><br/>Finally the negatives of the film and yes there are a few. Firstly the first and second acts for me dragged a little bit and felt a bit slow, I think this could be an issue with re-watchability. However with knowing how good the third act is it shouldn't be a problem. The another negative with it is the supporting cast of characters that were simply not cared for because there was basically no backstory for any of them apart from Felicity Jones's character. This meant I didn't care for any of the other characters and what was going to happen to them. The final negative I have is slightly knit picking really but I would have loved for Darth Vader to be in the film much more than he was, he could have replaced Tarkin in some of his scenes without a problem. Its a shame really because this could be the last time he is in a Star Wars film. Finally this film is 80 to 85 out of 100 % for me personally doesn't break the 90% mark just because of its negatives but much better than The Force Awakens and the best Star Wars prequel....................thought the bar isn't very high!"

"RforFilm","7","1","6","20 December 2016"," Rouge One lacks memorable main characters, but fights back it's force of fun side characters and fantastic action
","A long time ago (a co) in a galaxy not so far away, Disney acquired the rights to the George Lucas- created Star Wars stories. Not only did they want their hands on the characters and famous movies from before, but they also wanted to kickstart a whole galaxy of new movies. Not only did they want to create a new trilogy to continue after the events of the original Star Wars movies, but to also develop spin off films that honestly have even more potential. As great as the old movies are, it's a fascinating idea to expand upon the characters and events that were happening within. <br/><br/>I'd personally would like to see several spin off movies. A movie about Yoda might be cool, if they expand upon the little mentor to look into his early days as a jedi. Boba Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi also might have potential with their own stories. Fans of the comics and video games have campaigned for a movie set within the events of the Knights of the Old Republic (which would be a prequel to the prequel trilogy!). Todays movie is set not too long before A New Hope with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. <br/><br/>Years ago as a young girl, Jyn Erso escapes the empire when they come to her family farm to take her father back to help build a super weapon with the capability to destroy planets. Now a young woman, Jyn (played by Felicity Jones) being taken to a prison, but the rebellion helps her escape. The rebels offer her a clean slate for her previous problems in exchange for help to finding her father. She agrees and with Rebel officer Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna) and droid K-2 (played by Alan Tudyk) head to the desert planet of Jedha to look for the one person who would know where her father is. <br/><br/>They run into a blind monk-like warrior Chirrut (played by Donny Yen) and mercenary Baze (played by Jiang Wen) where after a conflict with Stormtroopers, find Gerrera (played by Forest Whitaker). He reveals a hologram with Jyn's father that reveals his love for his daughter and that the Death Star was designed with a flaw that could easily destroy it. They are also informed that blueprints for the Death Star and it's flaw are in a secure data bank on the planet Scarif. Jyn Erso, her band of mercenaries, and even some of the rebels, plan an attack on that world against the empire and Darth Vader (played by James Earl Jones)<br/><br/>For it's first outing into a spin off story, Rogue One is entertaining. I say this because I think it's better at giving people what they want out of what to expect from Star Wars then delivering a genuine movie. That doesn't make it bad, but it does contain flaws. <br/><br/>I'll say from the start that Rogue One is shot better then The Force Awakens. Almost every frame could be captured and placed as a picture on my wall. Director Gareth Edwards really understands how to make his audience truly feel a part of this universe without 3D.<br/><br/>The action (especially in the final forty minutes) comes closer to the original series as they make everything feel large in this ironically small story. Seeing the X-Wing ships battle the AT-AT walkers almost felt like a scene right out of Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>What prevents this from being a great movie? Unfortunately, it's a big problem and it's the main characters of Jyn Erso and Cassian. Both actors are trying their hardest and make certain parts work, but there's not a lot to their personalities aside from tough loners. At least the side characters were there to pick up a lot of their slack. K2 got more laughs then he deserved. Even though Darth Vader's scenes are short, his presence is dark and frightening. That's all I can say without giving away any major spoilers.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven K-2s out of ten. While it's not the best of the Star Wars series, it's certainly the best prequel. I might pop this one again, but only on a large screen where the action looked the best. It has a good story, but it needed stronger characters to make an impact. Maybe this is why this story of Star Wars wasn't a major part of the original trilogy. Take what you can get, check it out, and may the force be with you."
"picturetaker","10","1","6","19 December 2016"," Episode 3.5 is Great stuff! Its how to make a good prequel!
","I entered the theatre to see Rouge One with great skepticism. I wasn't overly impressed with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as it basically a reboot of ""A New Hope"" so my expectations were low. I thought ""Oh no here we go again, some chick is going to be some undiscovered Jedi master again!"". I was wrong! My expectations ruined the start of the movie for me.<br/><br/>As it started it seemed as if my expectations were right. Some little abandoned girl (again), who later in life is recruited by the Rebellion and forced to go on a mission (again). That was about it. That is where the comparison towards our girl Jyn Erso in Rouge One and Rey in The Force Awakens ends. In fact the two characters couldn't be further apart in similarities besides being two female leads in two Star Wars films. Jyn is simply a much stronger character then Rey might ever be. And best of all Jyn never picks up or even sees a Lightsabre! She does not become a Jedi master, she will not ever get a trilogy and Rouge One stands alone as a good science fiction movie that has an actual conclusion. Which was great since this is essentially Episode 3.5! <br/><br/>The scenes throughout the movie were absolutely amazing. Planet after planet just looked, well real! In fact had I not walked into this movie expecting Jyn Erso to become a Jedi, I probably would have enjoyed this movie so much more. I guess I will have to see it again. Even the story while predictable, especially since everyone seeing this movie have probably seen ""A New Hope"" and knows what to expect was still very good.<br/><br/>It is an absolute perfect prequel that no one asked for but makes the Episode 1, 2 and 3 look so vastly inferior. This is truly how to make a prequel. I absolutely loved it."
"PackmanWSU01","9","1","6","19 December 2016"," Hope for the future
","I liked the Force Awakens, but couldn't help shake the feeling that it was an imitation of Star Wars instead of the real thing. Perhaps it was because the movie re-hashed the same origin story used in A New Hope. Maybe it was because the archetypes were too familiar. Maybe it was J.J. Abrams used a creature that was supposed to challenge Yoda on the small and cute scale. For whatever reason The Force Awakens felt forced. Thankfully, Rogue One is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>The world portrayed in Rogue One is morally murky. Spies, extremists, traitors are all here. Finally the rebel alliance is shown as having dirt on its hands. The movie complements A New Hope in extraordinary ways. Characters show up (many unexpected) that really tie the two films together. To those whining about not having ""memorable characters"" remember, this is a one shot movie which tells a story focusing on a mission. The rousing third act did something nearly impossible.... I felt an engagement to the film that I have not felt since Return of the Jedi. The ending is one of the most satisfying of all the Star Wars movies. So yes, come for the cameos and fan service ( they won't disappoint) but stay for a risky statement film that stands on it's own. If this film is any indication where the Star Wars universe is heading than it is in good hands."
"tyingling7766","9","1","6","18 December 2016"," Number 2 out of 8
","I'm just going to throw this out there right now. Here is my list of the Star Wars movies how I would rate them from worst to best: I, II, IV, III, VI, VII, Rogue One, V Yeah, I said it. One of the prequels is better than the original movie. Get over it. It is better. Now, Allow me to review this extremely well made Star Wars movie in Rogue One.<br/><br/>The thing I instantly noticed, and loved, about this movie was that the music had a slight change to it and there was no rolling scroll at the start. Right there, I thought to myself that I hope there are no light sabers in the movie. And surprise, surprise there aren't. At least until two minutes left in the movie. I won't spoil any of that for you though. Just don't be looking for any.<br/><br/>So, right off the bat, they establish that this is a stand-alone movie. As it should be. It's not about the force, so therefor it shouldn't really be connected with any of the other movies in the sense of the aforementioned cuts.<br/><br/>Acting wise, I personally loved everyone. Alan Tudyk as the wise- cracking K-2 is just hilarious. If you don't watch this movie for any other reason at all watch it for K-2. Working as the comic relief was a freshness this movie needed. I had my reservations about Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, mostly because of their previous work. I'm glad I underestimated them. I think it just made their performances better. Ip Man, I mean Donnie Yen, was just that. He was just a blind Ip Man throughout the movie. Ben Mendelsohn is a great, allow me to emphasize, A GREAT villain in this movie. If you've read the books, think of Darth Bane. Yeah, you get someone that good in the vein of evilness.<br/><br/>The story is more of a complex one than one is use to in the Star Wars-verse. We get to see some things about the Rebels and Empire we probably would have never seen if this movie wasn't made. The intelligence division for the Rebels is something that had been hinted at before, but never really seen. The science division of the Empire reminded of (and it should be for everyone) of the SS division of the Nazi's. Don't take that out of context. Lucas has said on numerous occasions that the Empire is just the Nazi's.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of the movie is the cameos. The mouse bot, the two aliens that want to fight Luke in IV, Grand Moff Tarken, Leia, and I could have sworn I saw Jabba's servant Bib in there at Saw's bunker. Having the cameo's, or easter eggs, whatever you want to call them, didn't take away from the movie. They were spaced out enough to the point of making sense.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards is a good director. Truth is, I had my reservations about him as well after watching Godzilla. Put them to rest if you haven't seen Rogue One yet.<br/><br/>A good movie and is strongly recommended. For the love whoever you believe in, stop what you're doing and go watch this movie. Now."
"hnt_dnl","6","1","6","18 December 2016"," Good movie, but far from perfect
","Interestingly, while the trailers for 2015's highly anticipated ""Star Wars:The Force Awakens"" failed to impress me, I loved that film when I saw it, while the trailers for ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) had me pumped up and excited and I left the theater somewhat disappointed and underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, there are several positives to this new offering to the Star Wars franchise, but there are several noticeable flaws.<br/><br/>R1 is a direct prequel to the 1977 classic ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"", telling the story of the band of rebels who actually stole the Death Star plans that we saw Princess Leia upload into R2-D2 in the first movie. The central character of R1 is Jyn Erso (earnestly played by Felicity Jones), whose father Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of 'Casino Royale' and the TV series 'Hannibal' fame) is the principal scientist/architect involved in the creation of the planet-killing superweapon Death Star. In the film's opening sequence (no crawl in this one), the elder Erso is compelled to come out of self-imposed exile with his wife and young daughter to return to construction of the superweapon by the Empire's high-ranking Director Krennic (passionately played by Ben Mendelsohn).<br/><br/>After the opening scene, flash forward 15 years to the time period of the film, where Jyn, now a young woman and a prisoner of the Empire, is rescued by the rebels and taken to the secret Rebel headquarters on the planet Yavin. Jyn is briefed by Alliance Leader Mon Mothma (well played by Genevieve O'Reilly) and Rebel spy Captain Cassian Andor (solidly played by Diego Luna) that they need her on a mission to the planet Jedha to find a rogue rebel Saw Gerrera (played by Forest Whitaker), who has made contact with Galen through a defecting Imperial pilot Bodhi (played by Riz Ahmed). Accompanying Jyn and Cassian on the mission is Andor's co-pilot K-2SO (played in scene-stealing fashion by Alan Tudyk), a re-programmed Imperial droid that now serves the Rebellion. The trio find Saw, who has a message from Galen on a flaw in the design of the superweapon. Along the way, they pick up Bodhi as well as a couple of stray Jedha warriors in Chirrut and Baze (humorously played by Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang).<br/><br/>The ragtag band of 6 rebels Jyn, Cassian, K2SO, Bodhi, Chirrut and Baze eventually gather help from a band of rebel soldiers and the team in the exciting climax execute a sneak attack on the planet Scarif, the location of the archive that houses the plans to the Death Star.<br/><br/>My general issues with this film are: <br/><br/>1) The characters are generally very bland and monotone. Ironically, the only character of substance was the droid K-2SO. Not one main human character really stood out. Forest Whitaker was utterly useless and a waste of screen time. Bodhi was a defector, but we never knew why. Jyn too easily fell for the cause, but the events of the film contradict that she should feel this way. And everyone just followed Jyn's lead for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>2) The Erso subplot felt almost like a retcon. The filmmaker made the entire key to destroying the Death Star a manipulative family melodrama instead of just having the rebels steal the plans so that the Alliance could examine them for any flaws, as was implied in the original '77 film. Basically, according to R1, EVERYONE in the Rebellion knew about the flaw prior to the events of the '77 movie. It almost makes the mission seem futile.<br/><br/>3) The casting of Jyn Erso feels too much like fan pandering. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rey in ""The Force Awakens"", but her story felt more genuine and like the filmmakers wanted to jumpstart the new trilogy with not just a strong female character, but a strong character. With Jyn, it feels like the filmmakers are saying ""screw it, we're casting a female as the lead and there's no other option"". I think this sentiment to only cast a female as lead devolves into dangerous territory where it begins to feel like shoehorned, disingenuous melodrama as was the case with Jyn and the Erso family in this. And Jyn being the main character failed to engage me or leave any kind of impression. She was just there, a nominal lead to say the least.<br/><br/>4) The film was actually too short, at about 2 hours, 15 minutes running time. It would have been better served to have fleshed out the main characters more and tossing the Jyn Erso-nominal lead in favor of a true ensemble dynamic. Speaking of the Erso subplot, the Krennic-Galen dynamic was a fail. I guess they were supposed to be old friends who ended up with different loyalties, but the director never expanded on it. Plus, Krennic's character was too much of a non-imposing villain, albeit Mendelsohn did the best he could with a vigorous performance.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned a few pros, such as the great K-2SO droid character, a few good human characters such as Krennic, Mothma, and Andor, as well as the great finale. A couple other pros as the inclusion of some of the characters from the original film, especially the iconic villain Darth Vader. There's a scene near the end that is genuinely scary and horrific, the scariest presentation of the character ever. It's really the Easter Egg moments like this that make the movie more watchable than most of the other stuff, which at times doesn't have the feel of a Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards did an admirable job and infused the film with noticeable elements of the original movie, as he kind of had to, but the overall story of R1 feels somewhat disjointed from the Star Wars mythology. Still, an entertaining movie overall nonetheless."

It's portrayal of the missing time between episode lll and lV was told in such a powerful and 'destructive' way, that even those casual Star Wars fans, can connect the dots. There's so much to like and admire about this movie, it's ability to be a standalone movie with its own unique storytelling, whilst also tying perfectly in with the rest of the Star Wars world.<br/><br/>It doesn't make light of a very serious storyline, which has great impact to the Galaxy. With the right amount of humour, used in the right places and times. The third act is what solidified the movie to be one of the best Star Wars movies to date, which I won't spoil, but was amazing! It's actually refreshing to see a movie that knows what it is, what it needs to be and doesn't deviate from that. Obviously, there was only ever going to be one outcome for this movie, but it could have been told in a way that takes away from the underlying storyline, but it did quite the opposite.

","Personally I enjoyed this more than The Force Awakens. It starts out a little slow but after things start getting real. Tons of action, fun and adventure with great characters and a great story. Plus it was actually pretty funny. I don't think I cringed once. Even if you are not a Star Wars fan you will probably enjoy this because there really is nothing not to like about Rogue One. By the end I was pretty sad (I will not say why) but thanks to the most epic Darth Vader scene in all of Star Wars boosted my mood from 0-100 in just a few seconds (P.S saying that there is an epic Darth Vader scene is not a spoiler because everyone knew Darth Vader was in Rogue One). Just like the Force Awakens, more outstanding special effects. Overall a movie totally worth your time and money, but everyone has their own opinion so go see it for yourself.<br/><br/>9.2/10<br/><br/>~Realsnipez"
"rockchester","8","1","6","18 December 2016"," Well worth the money to see in the theater
","Rogue One is definitely a well-made movie, very good acting, and is absolutely worth your time and money to go see in the theater. This film proves without a doubt that George Lucas left his baby in good hands. This is a great movie to take the entire family to see. I'm pretty sure that the kids will love it. Go see it, you'll be glad that you did.<br/><br/>This was, at least in my opinion, the most realistic Star Wars film. It just seems real in many respects. It might have helped that there aren't any Muppets or Ewoks but whatever.<br/><br/>The story takes a decided turn in perspective to the guy who actually made the Death Star happen. A sort of Oppenheimer-esque plot, as it were. And the goal of the Alliance becomes acquiring the plans to the Death Star that were integral to the original Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>Of course, there are aspects of the movie that cause it to not shine quite as brightly as it could have. In the first place, it's one of many films that are built on a formula that made the original movie so memorable. This makes it somewhat predictable and, well, boring in places. For instance, I could see the requisite three-part epic battle coming a mile away. That is, the big special effects battle in space, the battle going on down on the planet with the troops who landed with our heroes and the third battle going on in the center of the action between the heroes and the bad guy.<br/><br/>The other problems, there are two, that are pretty much built in to the movie are that: <br/><br/>1) Since we learned that the plans were successfully transmitted to the alliance at the beginning of A New Hope, the filmmakers had to pin the suspense on to how they did it rather than 'if'. It's sort of like watching a historical movie like the American Revolution. You know how it turns out. <br/><br/>2) Since none of the principles in this movie are in A New Hope, I was virtually certain that they'd have to all be killed off before the end. This is something that occurred to me almost immediately so if I can tell, probably everyone else can too.<br/><br/>So, the movie is a little boxed in with these restrictions. There's very little surprise in the movie and that's more than a little bit of a let down.<br/><br/>Still, as I said previously, it's a very well done movie that kept me entertained for the most part. There are plenty of homages to A New Hope and, of course, they found a way to slip a C3P0 and R2D2 cameo in towards the end. They were also able to bring Princess Lea, Governor Tarkin and some of the alliance fighters from A New Hope in to this movie with the use of CGI. Putting the faces of Carrie Fisher and Peter Cushing on other actors was a little creepy but it took me by surprise how good it was. The only real issue I had about it was that Peter Cushing (original Tarkin) was only 5' 11"" and The Rogue One Tarkin is 6' 4"" so Guy Henry (new Tarkin) kind of towered over the other Imperials. That might not be noticeable to a lot of people but it really stood out for me."

","'Rogue One' earns its stripes as another worthy installment in the Star Wars saga. The side-ways prequel tells the story of how the Death Star plans make their way into the hands of Princess Leia which serves as the McGuffin of Episode 4 'A New Hope'. Like it's tangential predecessor 'The Force Awakens', this is a rollicking good tale with a female protagonist, a fleet of scrappy rebel fighters and a return to the junk-yard sci-fi world that remains true to the original trilogy. Throw in a formidable caped villain Orson Krennic played to perfection by Ben Mendelsohn, a rag-tag of new lovable side-kicks, some necessary cameos by old favourites and you have a winning formula that harks back to the Saturday matinÃ©e sagas that the original Lucas film sought to emulate. 'Rogue One' is a backstory enhancement that enriches the Star Wars universe, with an ending that hurls you straight into the arms of the beginning of Episode 4."

","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a compelling and visually appealing Star Wars backstory. Don't misunderstand, Rogue one is exactly that, a back story which aims to take the franchise in a direction which it has yet to go.<br/><br/>This paired with the best visual effects of 2016 makes Rogue One a truly necessary movie going experience. While character death is often lacking, the film makes up for it in it's use of such characters to create some truly moving moments.<br/><br/>The downside to Rogue One is of course that it carries both ""prequel baggage"" and the weight of trying to introduce fans to a new cast of characters for now the fourth time. <br/><br/>All in all the positives far outweigh the negatives and Rogue One manages to fashion a story which points Star Wars in a new thematic direction."
"jedly","9","1","6","17 December 2016"," A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away some rebels stole some plans
","A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was The STAR WARS franchise's first spin off live action motion picture titled ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016). And, while this isn't included in the ""saga"" of episodes, it is for all intents and purposes the 'prequel to STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE. As previously reported numerous times it does not have the 'crawl', but it is still very much a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is the Imperial engineer tasked with designing and building the Empire's new space station. Instead, he flees with his family. After being hunted down by the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military,Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) his wife, Lyra (Valene Kane) is killed, their daughter, Jyn (Felicity Jones) narrowly escapes capture. She is rescued by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). Fifteen years pass by until the Rebels learn of Jyn, her whereabouts, and connection to this new super threat. In an effort to gain access to Galen in the hopes of finding a weakness to the Death Star, they recruit her. <br/><br/>Rogue One is a dark film, but it isn't without lighter moments, even among some of the more stoic characters. K-2SO (Alan Tudyk), a reprogrammed imperial droid is a more sarcastic, less naive version of C3PO. Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) is a Rebel Alliance Captain s almost a darker, gritty version of Han Solo. Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) is a blind warrior who believes in the Force but doesn't quiet channel it like a Jedi. Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen) is also a warrior and mercenary. He is also Chirrut's best friend. Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) is a defected Imperial pilot who has vital information about Galen's location, and then becomes part of this rag tag group of Rebels. <br/><br/>While all of the cast has something to do, and are all more than two dimensional characters, Jyn is the breakout star of this show. She is the protagonist of this tale. She's the strong, intelligent hero Hollywood needs, and Jones rises to the challenge. Part of me believes Jyn could wipe the floor with both Padme and Leia working together. It's a very physical role. There's a lot of running, fighting, shooting a little of parkour, and I can't tell you how many times Jyn had a pull herself up from the side of a ledge. <br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards and crew need to be praised. They masterfly meld the the 1977 STAR WARS feel with a 2016 flare. It's one of the most visually stunning Star Wars films. Also, despite the fact that we know that the crew of Rogue One successfully delivers the Death Star plans to the Alliance (There wouldn't be Episode IV if they didn't.) they still manage to give enough tension to keep the audience on edge especially for the last half hour.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this film, especially geeking out at the cameo appearances. (There are several.) Dare I say, it was even better that THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACk."

","I was NOT going to see this but when I read Abrams wasn't involved, I reconsidered. A big improvement over his P.O.S. rehash from last year. Except: 1) They had the Calamari fish-face dude leading the attack, WHY? 2) They blew up another Porkins: Rehash! 3) Would have loved a bit more Vader and a scene with Palpatine also, seems to me too many subordinates were assuming command in the story. 4) Erso sends his daughter a hologram about putting a flaw in the Deathstar. Okay, well why not just send her the PLANS for the damn thing rather than Jan having to get get nuked on Bikini Island? Cause at that point, there are no ""wrong hands"" the plans could fall into.<br/><br/>Quick CGI cameo of Carrie Fisher at the end plus a return of all the ""New hope"" pilots was a nice touch and allows this to slip right in chronologically between #3 and #4. Also James Earl Jones's voice is showing his age, you can hear it in the dialog. First thing I noticed was the absence of the opening text crawl.<br/><br/>The CGI of Moff Tarkin seemed weirdly artificial to me and reused too many lines from ""New Hope"" from 1978. ""You may fire when ready"", way too much rehash! Forest Whitaker's character was good BUT the voicing was horrible! He sounded like his balls were in a vice every time he spoke, not good at all. Lastly, James Earl voicing Vader: NOT GOOD! I could hear the AGE in his voice as he spoke the few lines he did, it was noticeably OLDER than the powerful voice we'd all grown up with. Well, at least it wasn't Samuel Loudmouth Jackson!<br/><br/>OH YEAH, the shield gate over Scarif: The last 2 ships that slammed into the shield, did they look like LEGO blocks to you too?"

"Garrett_Thorne","7","1","6","16 December 2016"," Disney had Done it again!
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the new spin off prequel to the original trilogy, about how the rebels were able to get there hands on the Death Star plans. This movie does a lot of things right, and down right perfect, but this movie also has it's flaws.<br/><br/>So the first thing I would like to talk about is the musical score in this movie, this was the first time that the score of a Star Wars movie was not done by John Williams but instead it was done by Michael Giacchino he did an absolute great job in this movie! He was able to take the beautiful music that has been in every other Star Wars movie, and he tweaked it just a bit, so it was fresh and fit with the tone of the film, but also didn't veer too far off of the traditional roots of the franchise! When you watch this movie, you will notice the amazing music that adds an amazing amount of realness to the film!<br/><br/>Star Wars has always been known for being able to push the envelope when it comes to visual effects, and this film is no disappointment. This is hands down the most beautiful film visually that I have ever seen. The creatures, the space battles, all the effects in this movie were just done so well. And I strongly believe that that is in no small part to the great job director Gareth Edwards, he made some absolutely stunning shots in this movie that just blow your mind. There is one scene in particular that I love, but I don't want to spoil it for you.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the characters in this movie, because that is what has always made us fall in love with the Star Wars saga. In this movie, if I'm being completely honest, the characters are one of the biggest weaknesses, rather than one of its great strengths like it should be. So I will just take it one character at a time and try and tell you which ones I personally liked, and the ones I didn't.<br/><br/>So let's start with Jyn Erso, played by actress Felicity Jones. For me personally I really didn't love her character, you can tell that they cut a lot of her story arc after doing all those infamous re shoots. Her motives in this film are vague and her past is really vague and it leaves you not knowing/caring about her character all that much. She does have some great moments as well in this movie that kinda balance out some of the bads. I feel like she is an OK character, but she won't be remembered as one of the greats from the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Next person I would like to talk about would be Cassian Andor played by Diego Luna. The casting of Diego Luna was perfect for this role! He embodies this character so well, he even has the perfect look for this role! But much like Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor really has no background, you know very little about him and it really sucks because I would've loved to see his past more in this movie.<br/><br/>K2SO voiced by Alan Tudyk was one of my favorite characters in this movie, he brought some great comedy moments to this movie that fit so well with the movie. Didn't feel out of place and it didn't take away from the film like a lot of the comedic moments from Disney's last major live action release Doctor Strange, where I felt like the jokes in that movie took away from the intensity of the scenes. But in this movie it felt perfect and they fit, much like BB-8's comedic moments in The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>All I want to say about Forest Whitaker's role as Saw Gurrera, is that his voice in the movie is annoying and I really don't like his character. I don't want to say more about him cause it makes my frustrated. (my apologies)<br/><br/>Orson Krennic was one of the best roles in this movie! He brings a tone to this movie that really drives the success of this movie. Without the great performance by Ben Mendelsohn, this movie might not be getting the great reception that it did, I'm not gonna spoil his character because I think it's better to just see for yourself!<br/><br/>Now the rest of the ""Rogue One"" team I will combine as one so characters like Chirrut Îmwe,Baze Malbus and Bodhi Rook, who were although played very well by their respective actors, just like many of the other characters in this film, where underdeveloped and felt very forced and like they just kinda through these guys in our face without showing us who they really are. <br/><br/>I'm not gonna talk about Darth Vader or Galen Erso in this movie because I don't want to spoil their characters for you.<br/><br/>One last complaint I have about this movie, which is like not a really complaint for most people, but I talked to some people about this film after watching it, and these people weren't big Star Wars fans, so they found themselves very confused after the movie. This movie has a lot of fan service, but not too much. So I think you should definitely go study up on your Star Wars knowledge or at least be able to see the other films somewhat recently before watching this film.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a very beautiful film, with great music, and it expounds on this great Star Wars universe, although its poor characters and character development, I think this movie is great and I would definitely tell you to go out and watch it right now I'm giving Rogue One: A Star Wars Story an 8/10"
"eddie_baggins","8","1","6","15 December 2016"," Rogue One is a fine addition to the Star Wars universe
","Elevated by an incredibly strong and in many ways brave final act, Star Wars first official spin off entry (let's just forget about those Ewok adventures shall we) Rogue One may not reach the grand heights of the series staple classics or last year's excellently conceived Force Awakens; that almost perfectly balanced out expectations along with introducing us to a whole new plethora of lore and characters, but Godzilla director Gareth Edwards and the team at Disney have certainly found themselves a winning adventure that's likely to appease the many die-hard fans of George Lucas's cinematic universe.<br/><br/>With the production as sleek and flawless as we've come to expect from the series (with an added helping of grunge in this particularly dark narrative, don't go in expecting to many hearty Star Wars funnies), Rogue One does a fine job of disassociating itself from the usual Episode entries using simple methods such as no opening scrawls, subtle music changes and a different feel to the action that makes it seem more immediate and threatening, right down to the fact it seems as though those pesky Stormtroopers have finally hit the practice range to sharpen their aim.<br/><br/>Edwards and his team should be commended for taking these risky moves in style and with the films plot, that while steers towards the formula a majority of the times, does distance itself from other Star Wars experiences and it's quite clear Disney are doing their utmost to make sure that these stand alone ""Star Wars Stories"" don't wear too thin on the actual Episode saga.<br/><br/>It also must be said that Rogue One looks stunning, whilst as per usual the effects, costumes and general design of the film is of the highest note, thanks to DOP Greig Fraser, Rogue One's varied locations from the dusty windswept landscape of Jedha through to the films finale on the watery planet of Scariff, Rogue One provides a true visual feast that deserves to be caught on the biggest screen possibly for your viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>With so much to say well done to, Rogue One's major issues stem from something that's never been a real issue in a Star Wars film, the connection to the stories characters.<br/><br/>Centred around Felicity Jones's feisty and determined Jyn Erso (a fitting female heroine to stand alongside Rey) who is the films standout alongside Donnie Yen's blind Force worshiping Chirrut Îmwe, Rogue One's collection of ragtag rebels, pessimistic robots and bland villains (other than of course a one Mr. Vadar, whose appearance here is worth the price of admission for Star Wars buffs) unfortunately don't stand alongside the entries other protagonists.<br/><br/>From Diego Luna's forgettable rebel fighter Cassian Andor, Riz Ahmed's underdeveloped pilot defector Bodhi Rook, Forrest Whitaker's almost comical guerrilla warfare leader Saw Gerrera (hamming it up like Christmas has come early to the Star Wars universe), Mads Mikkelsen's barely utilised scientist Galen Erso and perhaps worst of all Ben Mendelsohn's unmemorable new villain Orson Krennic, who does a whole lot of angry looks but not a lot more and Krennic delivers one of the Australian actors more disappointing roles through no fault of his own, especially when you consider the performers talents when it comes to playing the ""bad guy"".<br/><br/>Rogue One's weaknesses in connecting the audience to a majority of the tales characters is rather unfortunate, especially with the films aforementioned final act likely to have benefited even more so had the film tied the audience up with these characters in a way more than mild interest for the majority. There's emotion to be found here, just not as much as perhaps could've been.<br/><br/>Quibbles aside, Rogue One provides what's arguably the year's best blockbuster entertainment experience that neither outstays its welcome or fails to ignite those Star Wars feels we've become accustomed to over these near on 40 years of the series.<br/><br/>Whilst not as family friendly as past entries due to its leaning towards the darker side of the galaxy far far away, Rogue One deserves to find itself alongside the hits of the universe, even if it's not likely to be remembered in the same vein as the majority of its predecessor's in the years still to come.<br/><br/>4 data files out of 5"
"regula1","9","1","6","15 December 2016"," Between story and technology, a perfect bridge between trilogies
","WOW!<br/><br/>Going into this, I expected this to be good, but not THIS good. Deep down, we know overall how the film is supposed to end, with the Death Star plans in the hands of Leia with Darth Vader in pursuit. You know that going in.<br/><br/>What you want to see, though, is the character drama between the band of rebels together through a mix of plan, accident, and fate. Felicity Jones shines as Jyn Erso, but arguably she gets pushed to a supporting role on numerous occasions. On the rebel side, the reprogrammed Imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk is the wit and personality of the band, almost to a fault with the number of quips throughout the film.<br/><br/>And on the Imperial side, while his screen time is limited, Darth Vader is the undeniable star, back with more punch. However, on both sides it is also the characters brought back to youthfulness and from the dead through CGI: mainly Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia. Both look great, though CGI Peter Cushing is just fake enough to be distracting in every scene he's in with real actors.<br/><br/>Still, aesthetically this film looks great, with just the right blend of elements of Episodes 1-3 and the visual feel of A New Hope. This is especially telling in the look of the X-Wings. In Episode 7, it's clear the X-Wings have a new feel to them for a new trilogy. In this film, though, the filmmakers did a fantastic job keeping the look of the fighters true to the original physical models forty years ago.<br/><br/>In short: while you may get sidetracked gawking at every single homage to A New Hope they crammed into it, Rogue One truly is a Star Wars story, perfectly setting up THE Star Wars story. You do not want to miss this."

"coreyjdenford","8","1","6","15 December 2016"," The force is with us, we are one with the force
","This review of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is spoiler free <br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>In order to create a prequel of the Star Wars franchise especially in the post era of George Lucas, the director who makes it would need to have serious Death Star-sized balls in order to do it well. Ultimately it seems that, that isn't the problem for director Gareth Edwards whom since his stunningly assured debut 2010s Monster and a few years later creating yet another monster movie Godzilla, he has changed the era of modern film with each of them looking dizzying while this happens. Although Rogue One: A Star Wars Story isn't close to a monster which is the atmosphere that the director is used to. Though this isn't any ordinary Star Wars film as it doesn't have any lightsabres, it's all done practically using blasters during the dynamic fight scenes. It's essentially a war film which is set in space, but it looks dazzling while doing it as each blaster shot emits a bright light right across the big screen. The story is done well with each character although increasingly clever are all very dynamic who do well to keep their part in the story which at some points erupts over them, each scene during the first second and even the third act which will make every single Star Wars geek tremble with excitement.<br/><br/>Though not all the credit can be given to a very ambitious Gareth Edwards, as some of the of the credit can be given to John Knoll the leader of Edwards' effects team who is also a veteran employee of IML (Industry of Magic & Light) as he tries to implement the same special effects of the 1977 classic A New Hope, but it looks brilliant as the message is clear here that the special effects from nearly 40 years ago are still relevant even now. But also some other credit points have to be given to the screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who formed a clever script that can possibly go down as a classic Star Wars script, as each player are given some while fun, but also some very serious dialogue but is still rather quick on its wits and quick on its whims with some of the more dynamic characters. Each character plays their part well, delivering some brilliant funny one liners but also doing their part to fight the oncoming threat of the overreaching Imperial Forces who still can't aim straight. Even though there are no lightsabres it seems there is still much to enjoy in this origin story. Also to keep the story from strafing too far into the generics of the previous Star Wars prequels, there is a large seven foot tall, black, white and orange re-programmed Imperial droid K-2SO (voiced by the always charismatic Alan Tudyk) who says some of the funnier lines in which sense could be seen as the new C-3PO, what's not like? <br/><br/>At points, the film is a lot darker but earnest as it seems that like Luke Skywalker and Rey, our heroine in this film Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) also has a very dark past but unlike Luke and Rey who constantly try to hide Jyn, constantly has memories of her past with her father Galen (Mads Mikkeslen), who at this point was being taken over by the director of the Imperial Forces Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn). So to take her mind off her dark past, she must form with the Rebel Alliance who together form an almost Mission: Impossible style mission to find the construction plans for the Empire's most dangerous weapon the Death Star, yes you thought you saw enough of the ominous grey and black space station, well it seems we have to see it one last time. But don't let that put you off as the weapon looks exactly the same as it did in the 1977 classic, ominous and creepy so really it's exactly the same as other Star Wars movies at this point. The Rebel Alliance are constantly at risk of being destroyed throughout the galaxy so they must have one massive fight against the ever growing Empire, this is when the film looks its best with each shot of the camera moving in to show each shot of the blasters without the look of a J.J Abrams-esque lens flare taking over each inch of the screen.<br/><br/>At other points the battle scenes maybe dynamic but they feel a little long but that isn't the problem as when this happens you can always rely on K-2SO saying another increasingly funny line, although the final battle does take quite a while it looks very dazzling with John Knoll's special effects doing well at making the film look gorgeous, with Gareth Edwards' transitions and camera movements implementing a sort of documentary verite style with a mash up of close-ups and far away shots, but also there are points when this takes place in the cold ominous skies of space but again it looks spectacular, as the final battle not only takes place on the Empire's outpost but also in the depths of space with other Rebel Ships. But also like the title suggests it does go quite rogue on the plans but not so rogue that it loses the plot. It seems that the Star Wars universe can still keep going as it now has an elaborate and very beautiful origin story to show how it really began with the final act that will make every Star Wars geek cheer and applaud with glee.<br/><br/>VERDICT: More dark and more grown up than the other Star Wars films, but its quick on its wits and quick on its whims, it seems that this universe will still be here for years to come.<br/><br/>8/10 visceral experience."

","Rogue one.<br/><br/>It looks like a Star Wars movie, It sounds like a Star Wars movie but does it feel like one? I settle into my seat, there's the 20th century fox fanfare, there's the Lucasfilm logo and those famous words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" then... Alright come on where's my opening crawl? You can't have a Star Wars movie without an opening crawl! How will we know what's going on? No wait this looks Star Wars...ish! I settle back down into my seat and the magic begins to wash over me.<br/><br/>Rogue one is definitely a Star Wars movie and a bloody good one too. Apart from the early planet hopping that is more distracting to the story than helpful the movie soon settles down to a nice pace where characters interact with one another and we begin to root for them. This movie has its own feel. It's more gritty, even grimy perhaps? The characters of this movie aren't squeaky clean heroes. They have a little more depth and aren't afraid to get their hands dirty to get things done. Diego Luna's character (Cassian) displays this early on when he kills a defenseless man by shooting him in the back in order to save his own skin. Felicity Jones's lead role of Jyn Erso isn't your typical female hero either. She is a survivor at first reluctant to get involved with the Rebellion. A person who through the course of the film becomes willing to give her life for the greater good. Donnie Yuen as Chirrut Imwe has a wonderful Camaraderie with Baze Maibus played by Wen Yiang. They are Guardians of the Whillis. Monks who once protected the Kyber temple on Jedha. The temple holds the key to the Death Stars destructive power. With no Jedi left, the temple has fallen into the hands of the Empire who raid it of its special crystal. Chirrut and Baze join Jyn and Cassian along with K-2S0, a reprogrammed Imperial droid with a team of rebel volunteers to steal the plans for the dreaded Death Star. K-2S0 played by Alan Tudyk is the superb comic relief this movie needs. A very welcome addition to the Star Wars universe unlike the extremely irritating Jar Jar Binks from Episode I. Mads Mikkelsen plays Jyns father Galen Erso, the man responsible for designing the Death Star. A man who's conscience overwhelms him when he realises the monster he has created and is then forced to finish his destructive masterpiece by the evil Orson Krennic. Ben Mendelsohn relishes the role of the dastardly Imperial officer and is one of the films stand out performances.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with the opening crawl of episode IV will already know the outcome of this film and the fate of its heroes, but it's the journey to where this story ends and A new hope begins is what is so intriguing. The story of how those Rebal spies stole the plans to the Death Star and helped save the galaxy. Without those band of individuals there would be no New hope.<br/><br/>A difficult task for director Gareth Edwards to achieve was to make the audience care for the characters by developing them sufficiently within the movies run time. After all we haven't grown up with this bunch of heroes like we have with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie. Edwards does achieve his goal and has crafted a movie that slots perfectly between Episodes III and IV. As soon as this movie ends you'll be sliding A new hope into the Blu-ray player with an urge to see more Vader. Bringing me on to the point why most people will go see this movie. Darth Vader. The baddest bad-ass in the universe. One major disappointment with the prequels is that we didn't get to see enough of the man in Black. Except for that horrible pantomime end scene when he wails ""Noooooooo!!!"" If there ever was a moment that made me want to put my foot through my plasma screen then that was it! In Rogue one we get the scene we've always hungered for. Vader kicking some rebel ass like only he can. I swear when his lightsaber ignites and he starts slaying those poor dudes I was like ""Yes! Finally!""<br/><br/>Rogue one is a good Star Wars movie. Possibly my fifth favourite fitting in nicely behind the original trilogy and The Force Awakens. It stands out though due to the way it was made. The special effects are designed to look reminiscent of those from the first trilogy. Not too much CGi polish. There's a practical realism to them. More miniature models than computer wizardry. There's a texture to the environments on screen. Unlike the green screen fakery used in the prequels. The whole experience is well worth it due to the love and affection that is apparent. Everyone involved in making this film has a deep devotion to the Star Wars universe and it shines through on to the screen."
"vargavilics","8","1","7","4 January 2017"," The war continues: Rouge One
","Rouge One is the latest episode of the Star Wars series, although it isn't the part of the official series. It explains what happened in the original first episode. The script is more understandable than in the other episodes, therefore you can watch the film without subtitles. There are some accents in the film but overall it is OK. I liked that the music was a remake of the original Star Wars music, yet it was contemporary. It was interesting to get to know that the beach fight scenes were shot at the Maldives because I was there a few months ago. In the cast, there aren't any famous actors and I was disappointed about the fact that Han Solo didn't appear in the film. The 3D special effects were awesome. This episode is more about fighting and destruction than sci-fi. As a result, - although I am not a Star Wars fan - I liked this episode and I recommend it to everybody."

","Seen it three times already. The ratings are brilliant and yet still it's underrated as look at most films rated higher; they don't even come close in terms of quality. Will watch many many times more. Star Wars is beautiful both past, present and hopefully future. Not as good as originals but on the same level. Should easily be ranked in top 50 films of all time! Only trolls or click bait attention seekers looking for hits rate this movie badly, or edgy old men who love really bad unknown French movies. The story, script writing, characters, acting, designs, cinematography, etc were all amazing. Of course there is always room for improvement but this is truly a treasure. Watch it!"

","I read one good review of this movie and found out many online like it, so I let my movie theatre-working friend recommended me to watch it. He, himself, had seen it several times by the time I just watched it with him and he seemed to enjoy it once again as we were viewing this on the IMAX 3-D screen. It's basically a prequel to the original Star Wars-the one now called Episode IV: A New Hope-concerning characters not seen before which we find out at the end why. There are some familiar characters that do appear like the villain Darth Vader (once again voiced by James Earl Jones) and R2D2 and C3PO. There's also an appearance of Princess Leia as she originally appeared in that original Star Wars pic. I guess computer imagery really can make the impossible possible! Anyway, that's my recommendation to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. P.S. As I'm writing this, it's now the second day of Carrie Fisher's death. All I'll say now is-Rest in Peace, Princess Leia. P.P.S. I just found out her mother Debbie Reynolds has also passed not long after."

","It is complete coincidence that on the day Carrie Fisher passes away I'm writing this review. I just saw the movie last night and, as planned, I am submitting a review today. She will be missed.<br/><br/>I have no qualms admitting that I'm a Star Wars fanatic. Slap Star Wars' or George Lucas's name on anything and I'm there (I think I've just solved my vegetables problem. Star Wars brand peas and carrots!!). <br/><br/>So, I have disclosed my unabashed bias. Even still, that bias wasn't enough to overcome the stink that was episodes 1 thru 3--meaning, it can't be pure drivel just because it's Star Wars.<br/><br/>Rogue One was anything but drivel. To start there was some confusion on my part at worst and at best it was a little hard to follow. There were new names, new faces and several locations mentioned all within the first 15 minutes or so. But once that necessary staging was set and exposition completed things began to come into focus.<br/><br/>For anyone who Rogue One is their first Star Wars escapade then there will be a bit more confusion. As for Star Wars regulars, particularly to the original trilogy, then they will be able to follow the story well and with a keen interest.<br/><br/>The story was very simple for the most part. There weren't too many characters to follow nor too many factions. Essentially, there was the Empire and the Rebels and some important characters from both groups. The acting was solid and of course the special effects were on point. It was a perfect mid saga filler/tie-in that was well thought out and there was an excellent treat at the end."

","Finally a girl gets the job done I gave this film 8 out of 10 because I am a huge fan of Star Wars BUT this film was a bit slow BUT I'll forgive that because I love that a girl was in the lead to take down the Republic. The girl in question is Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones who's on a mission take on the Republic and take down the Death Star. Some of you guys might be confused about where this film takes place in the Star Wars universe, well it's a prequel to New Hope which is the 4th film in the series.<br/><br/>There we got that sorted out because my friend Stephanie had a hard time figured out where the film took place so I had to actually explain where and how it does. Okay the film itself is a prequel as a said above to New Hope in where Jyn and a group of brave men try to find the plan to the Death Star so they can destroy it. That's basically it to be honest. I did enjoy the new Droid that they had for this film his name is K-250 who is really funny and sarcastic in this film. He'll be a fan favorite along with R2-D2 and BB8.<br/><br/>Should you see this film...well yeah if you're a Star Wars fan you'll love it. Trust me.

"mrgaurav-35464","9","1","7","22 December 2016"," Rogue One Review:The Force Is Strong With This one.
","Rogue One Review:The Force Is Strong With This one.<br/><br/>The Force is strong with this one.<br/><br/>Last year - JJ (ironic to have the same initials as Jar Jar, arguably the most hated character of the Star Wars universe) Abrams resuscitated the behemoth franchise we all grew up loving and watching melancholic-ally its untimely demise with those prequels, even though the prequel movies had their moments.<br/><br/>Disney owned Lucas-films first joy ride was bereft of any risks. Considering what JJ had to sift through the prequel mess made before the turn of the century, the new awakened force gave us a somewhat unoriginal plot, a new leading lady and an intriguing villain. Also For oldies like us it was an reunion of the three leads. It had everything we loved about star wars, the pre 21st century saga. Still it felt somewhat hollow.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present, we have a Star Wars spin-off saga Rogue one. Instead of going for space opera of the mainstream Star Wars films, the planned spin-off movies of the future will be dealing with individual struggles and stories. Therein lays the biggest challenge for this movie. Star Wars franchise minus the legends of Skywalkers and Han Solos of this universe, this movie needs to deliver. Whether it does is something we just find out.<br/><br/>As an avid Star Wars fan, just a glimpse of Darth Vader (arguably the best villain of previous century) is enough to incite the fanboy-ism within. So the hyped excitement, not as much as the Force Awakens was still considerable,<br/><br/>The movie is set just prior to the events of new Hope. (Episode 3.5 maybe?)<br/><br/>The premise of the movie sets up the Star Wars A New Hope nicely. Empire is building the biggest weapon humankind has ever seen, the Death Star. While watching A New Hope if you ever wondered why the Death Star had such an obvious weakness in otherwise impregnable fortress, its answered here.<br/><br/>Positives<br/><br/>In arguably the movie is most visually stunning of the Star Wars universe; even surpassing the Force Awakens. The space battles are epic; nothing else even comes remotely close. It reminds you of the Lost Fleet saga books by James Campbell. The climax, albeit lengthy, characterized with stupendous action sequences is brilliantly crafted as well as portrayed. Character performances stand commendable, cinematography magnificent taking the movie to a different level altogether. Director Gareth Edwards leaves no stone unturned with sublime visuals, point of view (POV) shots of the X wing pilots captivating the immersive experience to yet another level.<br/><br/>Now let me let loose the fan boy inside me. Tighten up the seat belts guys for here comes the Darth Vader! His appearance on screen is nothing short of hypnotics. His parsimonious screen time, even lesser than the Joker in the Suicide Squad, calls for all praises. He defines intimidation. These few minutes will compel you to watch the prequels all over again. Full marks here to the cinematographer Greg Feiser! Panoramic shots of the planets and vistas are resplendent; a treat for the viewers' eyes. Production design stands impeccable. Different Worlds are quite well etched out. Even the Easter eggs and cameos are tastefully done and are not in your face.<br/><br/>Negatives<br/><br/>The movie has its flaws.<br/><br/>Character development stands compromised over pacing. Editing is choppy. The pace of the movie is relentless, even though some of the initial parts drag. Some clichés do hamper the fluidity, like a crying child in the middle of the war-zone. Then a necklace that has no relevance to the story. Music stands inferior as against the earlier series. The fan boy inside me stood dejected as to how Un- Star Wars this movie turned out to be. The movie began without beloved text scrolls. Light Sabre's show up only towards the end. Although, I am just nitpicking here.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>The movie makes some bold choices. Almost entire billed cast stood wiped out which was quite apparent with none of them appearing in the sequels. Bravo, yeah! Now the Death Star takes a menacing form as we see and experience its fury twice during the course of the movie. That the weapon bespoke devastation and terror has been portrayed beautifully here.<br/><br/>Well all said and done this could have been a standalone movie; say a masterpiece in itself. Now that it forms element of the Star Wars saga makes it all the more special. Moreover, this series deserves the same pedestal as the ""Star Wars Empire Strikes Back"". An achievement that you cannot afford to miss. Go get going and experience the force in its full glory. Let the Force be with you!"

","Walt Disney Productions clearly knew what it was doing when it purchased the rights to the ""Star Wars"" franchise from its creator George Lucas. ""Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens"" was a major success and the idea of having stand-alone spin-off movies looks like satisfying both the fans and the investors. The first of these oddities - appropriately called ""Rogue One"" - is a real crowd-pleaser that is set in the period between ""Star Wars III: Revenge Of The Sith"" and ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope"" with the conclusion fitting into start of the first film to be released like a piece of a jigsaw. It does this mainly through a narrative, inspired by visual effects supervisor John Knoll and crafted by Chris Wietz and Tony Gilroy, that explains how the plans to the Death Star were acquired but additionally we have glimpses of some of the characters that will appear later in the saga, in two cases using CGI eerily to create characters played by actors who are now either much older or dead.<br/><br/>We've has plucky heroines in previous ""Star Wars"" outings (Princess Leia and Rey), but this time we have a female character at the heart of the adventure in the form of the reluctant leader Jyn Erso played by the talented British actress Felicty Jones who was so good in ""The Theory Of Everything"". She is supported by an ethnically diverse team including rebel fighter Cassian Andor (the Mexican Diego Luna), renegade Empire pilot Bodhi Rook (British Asian actor Riz Ahmed), blind swordsman Chirrut Imwe (Hong Kong actor Donnie Yen), and Chirrut's partner Baze Malbus (the Chinese Wen Jiang) This is a ""Star Wars"" episode with no Jedi, no light sabres, and essentially no Force which makes the whole escapade more realistic. Also, although the movie has some humorous lines, essentially it takes itself seriously so there is nothing like Jar Jar Binks, who was generally derided, or even the Ewoks, whom some found just too cute. Instead we just have a reprogrammed Imperial droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) who is darkly droll. In past ""Star Wars"" episodes, our heroes have often found it too easy to escape from a threatening situation with the storm troopers rightly charged with very poor shooting skills but, in this anthology film, not all the rebels are going to survive.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent and there are some striking locations utilising Iceland, Jordan and The Maldives. I was fortunate enough to see the movie on an IMAX screen in 3D which meant that the third-act battle scenes of X-Wing and TIE fighters were especially exciting. We Brits should take special pleasure in that the work was shot at Pinewood Studios and the director is British Gareth Edwards."
"omerceran","9","1","7","22 December 2016"," Rogue One is a new hope for us.
","What makes a movie a Star Wars story? We can summarize what should be in a Star Wars movie as follows.<br/><br/>1. The War Between Good and Evil (And their motivations) 2. The Discipline of Force based on eastern philosophies (Taoism, Buddhism, Sufism) 3. Transferring the philosophy from the Master to his Padawan<br/><br/>THE WAR BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL Star Wars at its core tells us a war between good and evil. The difference between other good vs. evil stories and Star Wars is that, in Star Wars the line between good and evil is very thin and the motivation that makes a person evil is told very evidently. <br/><br/>Darth Vader prefers the dark side for a very noble cause, to save Padme. It is the same motivation that Darth Vader passes on to the light side, to save his son from the emperor.<br/><br/>THE FORCE In each episode Lucas tells us something new about the Force based on eastern philosophies. And this teaching is transferred from the master to the Padawan.<br/><br/>Episode: I is about the ""Living Force"" and the midi-chlorians. The master is Qui-Gon, and the student is Obi-Wan.<br/><br/>Episode: II is about ""Force of the Patience"". Master is Obi-Wan, student is Anakin. <br/><br/>Episode III: is about the ""Infinity of the Force"" and ""The Dark Side of the Force"". Master is first Yoda, then Palpatine. The student is Anakin.<br/><br/>Episode: IV is about ""the Force of Unity"" and ""Force of the Instincts"". Master is Obi- Wan, his student is Luke.<br/><br/>Episode: V is about ""The Force of Emptying the Mind"", and ""The Infinity of Force"". Master is Yoda and Luke is his student.<br/><br/>Part VI is about ""Light Side of the Force"", and the teacher is Yoda, and student is again Luke.<br/><br/>Although the name of the movie starts with ""The Force"", there is nothing about ""Force"" in The Force Awakens. We do not see a master or an apprentice in the movie. Force does not be transferred from the master to the padawan. It is soulless space movie. Jar Jar Abrams has no idea about Force and Star Wars.<br/><br/>ROGUE ONE Rogue One is more than a Star Wars movie. The film talks skilfully about the Force, and its transfer from the master to the padawan despite the fact that there is no a single Jedi. Master is Chirrut Imwe, padawan is his guard Baze Malbus.<br/><br/>We can say that Rogue One is about ""Submission (surrender) to the Force"",""Infinity of Force"" and ""Force of Mantra.<br/><br/>SURRENDER TO THE FORCE We have heard from Obi-Wan earlier in episode IV: ""Let go your conscious self and act on instinct."" We have a force-sensitive character in Rogue One called Chirrut Imwe. And he has almost surrendered to the Force.<br/><br/>""I fear of nothing. All is as the force wills it."" Chirrut Imwe<br/><br/>Let's look at this philosophy from Masnavi. According to this philosophy, there is no opposition, everything is my guest and happens for me.<br/><br/>""(The feeling denoted by the words) ""We will not submit"" and (the desire to raise) objection have gone from us (saints), since there is coming a great recompense for what has been lost. Inasmuch as heat comes to me without fire, I am content if He extinguishes my fire. Inasmuch as He gives light without, any lamp—if your lamp is gone, why are you lamenting? Now listen to a story of those travellers on the Way who have no objection in the world."" Masnavi - Rumi Book: III; 1875 -1878<br/><br/>ETERNITY OF THE FORCE Rogue One also refers to the Infinity of the Force. <br/><br/>""Chirrut Imwe said to Baze when he was about to die: Look for the Force. You will find me there."" Chirrut Imwe<br/><br/>""When the hú that passes away has surrendered itself to Him, it becomes everlasting and never dies. ('Tis) like a drop of water (which is) afraid of wind (air) and earth; for by means of these twain it is made to pass away (and perish. When it has leaped (thrown itself) into the sea, which was its source, it is delivered from the heat of the sun and from wind and earth. Its outward form has disappeared in the sea, but its essence is inviolate and permanent and goodly. Hark, O (thou who art like a) drop, give thyself up without repenting, that in recompense for the drop thou mayst gain the Ocean. Hark, O drop, bestow on thyself this honor, and in the hand of the Sea become safe from destruction."" Masnavi - Rumi Book: IV; 2615 - 2620<br/><br/>THE MANTRA OF THE FORCE Every doctrine has melodic expressions that will make you feel good when you repeat it. <br/><br/>In Salinger's book Franny and Zooey, Franny says: "" the starets tells the pilgrim that if you keep saying that prayer over and over again —you only have to just do it with your lips at first—then eventually what happens, the prayer becomes self-active  'Something happens after a while. I don't know what, but something happens, and the words get synchronized with the person's heartbeats, and then you're actually praying without ceasing. Which has a really tremendous, mystical effect on your whole outlook. I mean that's the whole point of it, more or less. I mean you do it to purify your whole outlook and get an absolutely new conception of what everything's about."" <br/><br/>For the first time in a Star Wars film, we are witnessing such a mantra. Chirrut Imwe repeats his mantra in many scenes.<br/><br/>""Force is with me and I am the one with the Force""<br/><br/>CONCLUSION After Jar Jar Abrams has ruined the Star Wars with The Force Awakens, I had a bad feeling about the future of Star Wars. However, director Gareth Edwards show that Rogue One is a new hope for us."
"sujanfaster","9","1","7","21 December 2016"," A film that draws the dots and connects them
","Last year this time, Star Wars fans rejoiced the rebirth of the Star Wars saga with Star Wars: The Force Awakens and while the sequel for that is under works, Lucasfilms comes with the masterpiece Rogue One which is a Star Wars film of its own kind. It is very hard to say whether Rogue One is a sequel or a prequel. But, Rogue one is a very good addition to the Star Wars saga and it's a treat for the die hard fans who have followed the franchise throughout the years. It is amazing how a single line from the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is made into a film as big and as good as Rogue One. Make no mistakes, the timeline of Rogue One is nowhere close to the recently released Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Rogue one is before the Skywalkers, before the princesses, before the Han Solo's and Chewabaccas. Rogue one is the story of the heroes before the heroes.<br/><br/>The script revolves around the events at the time when the Death Star is being built by the Empire. The protagonist Jyn Erso is the daughter of Galen Erso the scientist who is forced to build the Death Star by the Empire's director Orson Kennic. Having escaped from the hands of the Empire as a kid, Jyn Erso grows to be a rebel and a mighty one that is. The Rebellion captures her and sends her to make allies with Saw Gerrera on the moon Jedha (remember anyone?) for getting the message about Death Star which was sent through a pilot who works for the empire Bodhi Rook. The rest of the movie is about how Jyn Erso manages to unite the rebels to steal the schematics of the Death Star which contains the information on how to destroy it which was willfully planted by her father Galen Erso. As the film nears the end Star Wars fans are bound to get Goosebumps to see one of their favorite characters and how everything falls into place<br/><br/>While the story doesn't sound much complex, as one goes about watching the movie every bit of their Star Wars memory is tested. The movie makes references to both the old Star Wars and the not so liked millennial Star Wars (Released between 1999-2005). There are many Easter Eggs and references to put the pieces together. Although this is a new movie director Gareth Edwards makes sure not to go over the top and brings us the feel of Episode IV with superbly directed battle sequences. The visual effects are on point which rightly balance the new technology with the feel of the old films. Special mention to the CGI fore recreating the character Grand Moff Tarkin (played originally by the late Peter Cushing) and for another surprise character (I won't tell you who it is). The background score slightly lacks the feel of the original Star Wars at times. But it is understandable considering this is a standalone film.<br/><br/>There aren't many top billed actors in the movie, but the chemistry between the leading actors makes up for it. Felicity Jones reminds us how the female lead characters are creating their own space in the present Hollywood. Diego Luna as Cassian Andor is impressive. Ben Mendelsohn as the primary antagonist might not be as terrifying as Darth Vader, but has quite an impacting presence. Alan Tudyk brings the much needed humour at times with his voice-over for the droid K2SO the character which has already created a lot of buzz on the social media. Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen play small but vital roles in this film. The duo of Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang is a treat to watch. Last but not the least, James Earl Jones lends his voice to the character Darth Vader yet again whose role is well written to fit in this movie's premise.<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story may not be the magnum opus of the Star Wars, but it perfectly fits into the saga. Rogue one might be a standalone Star Wars film, but it reminds us of all the Star Wars films till date. Make sure you refresh your knowledge of the Star Wars franchise before watching this movie. Rogue One is beautiful, action packed, nostalgic and above all, emotionally captivating."

","After many years Death Star has been finished and now Galen Erso's daughter Jyn heads on quest to get a plans for Death Star so it could be destroyed. Rogue One is an incredible ride both visually and from storytelling point of view with many great characters put inside and great Whitaker in his seriousness but also emotional performance and somehow it managed to fade away towards the end. There was a ton of characters just put into movie and as time passed they all fitted and proved how worthy they were but Felicity has totally stolen the show and give an incredible lead in new beginning that ended probably too soon. There was also K-2SO which was funny to have him around and guys like Cassian who helped Jyn in everything, Bodhi Rook that played pilot which was sent by Galen and after proved to be a great ally. Thrilling ride was when all action scenes started then came all amazing visual scenes and some of the greatest moments of movie were there also destroying done by Death Star were absolutely miraculous. There was a lot of details and too many things put in the movie and after end came it felt like everything just was in vain even though it was amazing. Darth Vader scenes were also one of the most intimidating but at the same time beautifully managed. Directing at some points failed but considering overall feeling movie served it's purpose and it seems only like it was made to be entertaining which it was and to make some money for film makers which also will probably do. 3/4"
"Whingewood","8","1","7","21 December 2016"," Entertaining, looked & sounded good, good addition to Star Wars franchise.
","(Originally published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings going to watch this; I like Star Wars but I really did not like The Force Awakens. However, I try to keep an open mind, so despite some 'meh' trailers for the film, I went to watch it. Any fan of Star Wars will already know the outcome of this film, but the journey is important. <br/><br/>The film looked and sounded great. There have been mixed opinions regarding the characters of Tarkin and Leia; I think they looked excellent, particularly Tarkin, but I know there are those out there that disagree. Based on my own brief research into non-Star Wars fans seeing Tarkin, a lot of them didn't realize that it was CGI.<br/><br/>The overall story was known to everyone going in (get the Death Star plans), but the story around Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) and his role in the Death Star was good, and made episode four make a bit more sense (I know it's basically a retcon, but it works).<br/><br/>There's been a fair amount of criticism about lack of character depth for the characters that we are introduced to, and yeah, they don't have much depth, but do they really need to? Sure, you're never really going to feel much when waves of faceless Stormtroopers are mowed down (except maybe FN-2199, more popularly known as TR- 8R), but when that fella whose only contribution all film has been throwing out witty one-liners, and they gets shot to bits, you might be a little sad. Ultimately, this film is more story-driven than character-driven, which is fine.<br/><br/>So, what did it all add up to? Rogue One was entertaining, with great visual effects and a decent storyline. It gives more context to A New Hope, and is definitely a positive addition to the Star Wars franchise."
"mconnolly300","8","1","7","21 December 2016"," A darker galaxy with a deeper meaning.
","Rogue One is a movie which shows great potential and takes many risks to which audiences may enjoy or disapprove of. Firstly, this may be deemed a minor spoiler but the movie does not feature an opening crawl. As this is a Star Wars story, it instead shows a prologue introducing the protagonist Jyn Erso and her family. Secondly, the movie takes many cuts to different planets so we as the audience are thrown all over the place which does make the movie seem slightly disjointed to begin with. <br/><br/>However, once the movie finds it feet and all the characters are in play, the movie shows off its stunning CGI and many physical props, creatures and sets which are bursting with action! Rogue One is indeed a darker movie but when thinking about its previous movie, Revenge of the Sith, it makes a lot of sense as the galaxy has been plunged into darkness and fear of crossing the might of the Galactic Empire! As the movie develops you see characters gain hope and TRUST which is the main theme I got from this movie. It all comes together in an exciting finale and shows exactly what a Star War should look like.<br/><br/>PROS: Exciting action, some witty and humorous lines, stunning locations, adds to deeper context of some characters we know and some we meet for the first time and a final scene which gave goosebumps to many viewers I am sure!<br/><br/>CONS: A shaky start to the movie with cuts all over the place, many bits from the trailers not in this movie which makes it obvious how much has changed since the movie was released, CG characters which are very impressive but can take you out of the movie in certain scenes and a lack of character development for these new characters that many viewers have grown a liking to.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Rogue One to be a very enjoyable movie watching the first time, on a second viewing showed great subtext and depth which does make this a worthy Star Wars movie to add to the franchise, filling up plot holes and even adding to the lore of a galaxy far, far away!"
"andremiller-43293","9","1","7","20 December 2016"," Rogues, would you live forever?
","Rogue One is a film with plenty of imperfections, but is still an outstanding Star Wars experience when taken as a whole. In this way, it is the most natural addition to the franchise since Return of the Jedi. Uneven pacing and plot holes haunt the legacy of every Star Wars film (even The Empire Strikes Back), yet these stories endure because of unparalleled visual imagination and an unbreakably strong human element. Director Gareth Edwards and writers Gary Whitta and John Knoll all understood this. Combined with intense passion as both artists and Star Wars fans, they sought to create an offbeat tale within the mythos that proved that not every ounce of brand value comes from epic heroes combating the forces of evil with laser swords. In that respect and many others, the production team crushed expectations.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated (if there are any left), Rogue One is an ensemble war film, centered on acquiring the Death Star plans. It isn't intended to be optimistic and colorful like a typical Star Wars movie. The atmosphere is grim, depicting a galaxy drained of hope by an oppressive fascist dictator. Here the rebels have to walk on eggshells, working from the shadows to make calculated strikes at the Empire. As a result, the scale is somewhat smaller in this adventure and significantly more personal. Dialog is sharp, carefully representing a small team at odds with themselves. However, there is a surprising amount of levity in the script to offset the otherwise bleak narrative. In particular, Alan Tudyk's portrayal of the sarcastic droid K-2SO steals the show. Though Ben Mendelsohn as the self-absorbed Director Krennic and Diego Luna as the morally conflicted Cassian Andor also turn in memorable performances. <br/><br/>Yet acting of any quality is no substitute for a compelling plot, which is where Rogue One occasionally loses steam. The first act of the story jumps around liberally, putting crucial details in jeopardy of being lost to all but the most attentive viewers. In the second act, the story grinds to a halt so the female lead can fulfill her arc. It is also where one or two subplots are entirely dropped, leading to unnecessary confusion about the state of a crucial character. In the final act, the story picks up again and ties up every loose end with extraordinary diligence. Rogue One has arguably the most comprehensive and satisfying finale to any Star Wars narrative, including the entire gamut of expanded canon. It is also worth noting that even if the pacing is uneven, virtually nothing is out of context. Contrary to the insultingly shallow exposition of The Force Awakens, everything in Rogue One has a substantial visual or verbal explanation. It helps reinforce the plight of the team and flesh out the world they inhabit. Also, the attention to detail ensures Rogue One will be a pleasure to watch for years to come.<br/><br/>To that end, there is an item in Rogue One that will serve as a discussion piece both immediately and well into the future. In the film, a certain character from the original trilogy is recreated with the use of CGI. This is not merely a cameo, he is a fully functional cast member. His likeness, mannerisms and voice were entirely reproduced to fill a role. While it has handled with the utmost taste, the actor in question has been dead for over two decades. This sets a dangerous precedent not just for Star Wars, but for the future of filmmaking. Hollywood is desperate enough to remake any film from yesteryear, though now they can also remake people. While currently a gimmick with frightening potential, these techniques could one day become a crutch to the creatively bankrupt. Hopefully Lucasfilm and Disney discourage widespread adoption of this approach. Beyond that ethical quandary and a few missteps, Rogue One needs little improvement. A director's cut of the film with touched up editing would address the vast majority of complaints. The first act could slow its breakneck pace and add a bit more articulation to each action sequence. Cut content could be added back into the film to minimize the confusion caused by the dead ends in subplots. Perhaps a few more establishing shots on the tropical planet of Scariff would better emphasize how visually diverse and interesting it is from other locales in the Star Wars universe. Certainly the score could be more melodic, even if Michael Giacchino did do a phenomenal job emulating John Williams.

","This movie is perfect from a star wars fan, especially one familiar with the rpg and the world itself.<br/><br/>Palpatine's reign was no joke, the rebels were few and very, very, outnumbered. They were all brave, skilled, geniuses in a way or another but they were facing the almighty empire, in all its might.<br/><br/>For someone who has read the throng of material that describes how it happens between episode III and IV, the settings is pretty perfect. Everything makes sense, the female lead is perfect in every aspect.<br/><br/>However, this movie has a major flaw for me, it's dark, very very dark. Most of the people who go to a star wars movie expect it to be lighthearted. Lucas himself firmly believed to have all his heroes always survive thrive and mostly kick ass and have fun as it gave people hope.<br/><br/>Disney gave us Rebels and episode 7 which seem to be aimed at little kids, with ridiculous villains (Kylo Ren, really ???) and overpowered (way overpowered) heroes who destroy everything in their path without even thinking about what they are doing (like Rey who's Chewbacca + Han Solo + Luke Skywalker combined in one single person, making her the best mechanic, pilot and someone using the most Advanced jedi powers without ANY TRAINING, shame on you JJ Abrams) Rogue one will be a real wake up call for the masses to the star wars universe and i'm not sure that everyone will like it.<br/><br/>However, for me, as a 30 years fan, it's a 9/10, removing 1 for its inherent darkness."

It was this modern, soulless fun-for- everyone-even you who never watched Star Wars before typical Hollywood money maker. Whats worse, it was terrible in the technical department - acting was abysmal, script was stolen from the first one and so on and so on..<br/><br/>This time its the other way around - we all know whats gonna happened, so no surprise there. But, the way they are telling us this story, well, it did caught me a little bit off guard. Its respectful to Original Trilogy and the Prequel one too and its trying to fit in between 1977 and 2017 (in storytelling technique and movie industry sense) as much as possible and its mostly succeeds. <br/><br/>Star Wars movie (almost) without Force? Yes, its possible. Its possible with good director, fantastic actors (miles above those in New Trilogy - Kylo Ren ffs!) and more mature script. People in my movie theater were literary in shock at the ending - as I have said, way too many people are using cinema as dating places.<br/><br/>This one is worth watching, thats for sure."
"cdfurlong","10","1","7","20 December 2016"," Bring Back the Original Score and Crawl for the Next Stand-Alone
","A prequel to A New Hope is not a stand-alone, for a stand-alone is a movie which stands alone in terms of plot. Rogue One stands quite close to A New Hope, because it is its prequel. Therefore, Rogue One should be remastered with the crawl and the original music of John Williams. They were sorely missing, especially the crawl. I know some people have trouble reading it quickly enough, as I do myself, but that does not negate the fact that crawl gives the movie a storybook feel, a high drama nod to it being a science fiction drama. <br/><br/>As for those who rated Force Awakens one star and Rogue One one star for specious reasons, I have decided to rate this movie and TFA both ten to make up for your lies. The Force Awakens is definitely not a one star movie. You have purposely rated it one star because you are either sexist or racist. <br/><br/>In my opinion, The Force Awakens is a bit better than Rogue One simply because it has John William's original music and the literature- based crawl.

","Its action-packed, and the most dark and emotional story of the whole Star Wars Series !! I would even go say its the ""Game of Thrones"" of the Star Wars Series when it comes to going dark.<br/><br/>Its a story before the 1st ever Star Wars move (New Hope) and after the 3rd movie of the god-awful prequel series. So Rebellion has somehow discovered that the Empire is building a super weapon that can destroy planets (Death Star) and there's a scientist (Galen Erso) who helped built it and Rebellion is trying to find him. His long lost daughter (Jyn Erso) gets caught up with the Rebellion b/w all this and somehow joins the cause to go against the Empire and steal the ""Death Star"" plans.<br/><br/>The story is a little slow to pick up with the action because of all the character introductions that happen and once it does pick up, it is everything you'd hope for in a Star Wars movie, and in fact actually better. Felicity (Jyn) and Diego (Cassian) did a fairly good job being the main characters but my favorite characters were K-2SO (the droid) and Donnie Yen (Chirrut). They were both sarcastic and so much cool and actually made me care about their characters. Darth Vader's cameo was super awesome !! Couple of other old characters also had a ""CGI"" cameo which was well done, good fan-service.<br/><br/>Special effects and the whole war at the climax is top-notch and if you've been following Star Wars movies, it answers a lot of questions regarding ""New Hope"" movie and ties in really well with it. Overall, a must watch even if you're not into Star Wars."
"puppyrevenge","7","1","7","17 December 2016"," Better than 7 but not amazing
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>This film is pretty good. Both this and 7 are very similar in that they are both great in parts and bad in others. I disagree with everyone on here than the fan service doesn't spoil it. It MASSIVELY spoils it. They are just thrown in for no reason. The worst being R2 and C3POs cameo which although isn't awful it does beg the massive question WHY DO THEY END UP ON THE SHIP AT THE END IF THEY ARE LIGHT YEARS AWAY a couple of hours before. All they had to do is have them walking along, C3PO didn't even have to say anything, walking along the corridor at the end before the dude goes into see Leia. Simple. Why didn't anyone think of that. That was the single most possible thing i thought was going to happen at the end. Speaking of Leia. The Tarkin CGI is awful. Leia not so bad but it isn't amazing. I thought it was awesome that Tarkin was in it but then got really sick of seeing him so much because he was so badly done. Should have kept him in dark scenes. James Earl Jones sounds very old. DARTH VADER the comedian. ""Don't choke on your ambitions"" PLEASE DEAR GOD. Why did Vader have to say that. That isn't his character, the only scene of 2 he was in and spoiled by a stupid pun. Finally the thing i disagree most with everyone on here is K-2SO. Awful. Not funny. Boring. Stupid character. ""Prisoners to be taken to a prison etc"" ha ha.....he's an intelligent by the book droid for the whole film apart from that scene where he would know EXACTLY what to say instead of the hilarious comedy routine. I hated him from the start and loved it when he was destroyed. Rubbish. Nice to see Biggs and Red Leader. That was cool. On the whole great. Darker than the others and i was really surprised they all died. I assumed many of them would but every single one. Brilliant. Not because they died but because it created a great feeling of what it took to get the plans to Leia and really made the first 15 minutes of IV so much more. That's enough. Good and bad."
"TheFirstExecutioner","8","1","7","16 December 2016"," This is How You Make a Star Wars Prequel!
","I was so excited to see Rogue One, and wow, it was damn good. Rogue One is very entertaining and in my opinion is the way a Star Wars prequel should be made. It is for the most part very focused and clear in its direction. The performances are all around very good. Felicity Jones is excellent as the protagonist Jyn Erso, though the character is not as cool as Rey from The Force Awakens. The same can really be said about all the characters. There's nothing really special about any of them. Diego Luna is fine as well, as is the rest of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The story follows how the Rebel alliance discovers the Empire's plans for the Death Star. The first half of the film honestly drag. A lot of it has to do with the surprisingly slow pacing. This part of the movie just lacked the energy that Star Wars should have. However, the last hour is completely worth the price of admission. It is so jaw dropping during the battle sequences, and the pacing and energy of the film increase. The space and land battles are extremely well shot and very exhilarating. Darth Vader also has some pretty awesome scenes and you will love them! <br/><br/>Now for my favorite part of the movie: The ending of the movie is soo satisfying! The way it is put together and tied to A New Hope is so ingenious and any Star Wars fan will be so excited watching this movie end. That's all I'll say without spoiling it.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is a very good movie that I really liked, but fell just short of loving it. The movie starts out a bit too slow, and the characters lack that energy that keep the audience invested even if there's not a huge action set piece. But, the second half if the movie is so great, and the ending is simply phenomenal.<br/><br/>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gets a B+."

"dave-mcclain","8","1","7","16 December 2016"," ""Rogue One"" is an exciting sci-fi adventure and a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon.
","It's easy to understand why Disney would make a movie called ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (PG-13, 2:14), but explaining how it ties in with the other films is a bit more challenging. One tongue-in-cheek meme explains ""Rogue One"" this way: ""It is a sequel to the prequels of the sequels of the prequels that are the originals in which this is a prequel of, but not a sequel to the sequel of the originals."" That's both humorously accurate and confusing, so let me give it a try: In the chronology of the Star Wars universe, this film falls between the prequel trilogy (Episodes I-III), released 1999-2005, and the original trilogy (Episodes IV-VI), released 1977-1983. In other words, at the beginning of the film originally titled ""Star Wars"" (the one which first introduced our galaxy to the Star Wars galaxy in 1977), Princess Leia hides a disc inside the droid R2-D2 – stolen schematics to the Empire's planet-killing Death Star weapon – plans meant for the Rebel Alliance. ""Rogue One"" is the story of how the rebels got those Death Star plans.<br/><br/>Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is alone in the world. (Of course, in her case, ""world"" means ""galaxy"" – a galaxy far, far away from those of us who generally restrict our activities to a single planet.) When she was just a little girl, Jyn's mother, Lyra, was killed by Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn ), the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military, while Lyra was trying to prevent Krennic from taking her husband, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), from their home and out of retirement to resume work on the Empire's Death Star. Galen had no choice but to leave his daughter behind. Jyn hasn't seen him since. She was cared for by a friend of the family, a rebel named Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), a veteran of the Clone Wars depicted in Star Wars Episodes II and III. But Saw also ended up abandoning Jyn – when she was just 16 – and she's been on her own ever since. When we first see her as an adult, she's on an imperial prison transport ship, in custody for an unnamed crime. She's jaded, bitter, defiant and alone.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Jyn's rescued from the transport by rebel forces led by an intelligence officer named Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). The Rebel Alliance wants her help in finding her father so they can capture him to learn what they can about the Death Star – or kill Galen to stop his work on the deadly project. Jyn wants no part of the rebellion, but is motivated by the possibility of being reunited with her father. She goes with Cassian and his captured, reprogrammed imperial droid, K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk). They are soon joined by Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), an imperial pilot who defected in order to warn the Alliance about the Death Star's power, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen), a blind warrior who is not a Jedi, but is very devoted to the Force and knows how to use it, and Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen), a mercenary Rebel warrior, and Chirrut's companion. This rag-tag group is being pursued across the galaxy by Krennic and his Imperial soldiers, who are being directed by none other than Grand Moff Tarkin, played by Guy Henry, underneath the digitally-recreated face of deceased actor Peter Cushing. As this movie can be seen as a prequel to ""Star Wars"" (""Episode IV""), other characters from the original film make appearances (as do ships and places), but I'll reveal no more plot in order to avoid spoiling the fun for Star Wars fans.<br/><br/>""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a very worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. But this begs the question as to whether someone who isn't familiar with the franchise (if there is such a Movie Fan out there) can follow and enjoy this addition to the cinematic saga. In a word, ""yes"". The plot is well-explained and the conflicts are well-defined. There's plenty of action and terrific visual effects. Devoted Star Wars fans will appreciate all that, the cameos by beloved (and hated) characters, as well as the new characters, especially Jyn, who comes off as a female version of Han Solo. There are also numerous homages to Star Wars lore, including X-Wing and TIE fighters, AT-ATs and other familiar sights and sounds. However, some will be disappointed by the absence of the beloved John Williams music and the iconic narrative crawl at the opening, omissions which rob this film of some of its potential impact.<br/><br/>""Rogue One"" was originally conceived by John Knoll, a visual effects supervisor for the prequel trilogy (Episodes I-III) and the original script was written by Gary Whitta (""The Book of Eli"", ""After Earth""), but the final script was the work of Chris Weitz (""About a Boy"", 2015's ""Cinderella"") and Tony Gilroy (the ""Bourne"" films + ""Armageddon""), with Gareth Edwards (2014's ""Godzilla"" and 2010's ""Monsters"") directing. This group may not be Star Wars royalty, but they have honored the saga's history and maintained its spirit. The intrepid members of the Rebel Alliance have always been a motley crew, but ""Rogue One"" puts their courage and determination on display as well as any of the other films, and this one offers plenty for any sci-fi fan to enjoy. As I and another member of our staff left the theater, I looked around and commented that relatively few people in the audience had been born when the original ""Star Wars"" was released, yet the auditorium was full. With other Star Wars Stories about Boba Fett and a young Han Solo in the works the hits just keep on coming. 2016's Star Wars Story gets an ""A-""."

"jaredpahl","3","1","8","8 January 2019"," Rogue One: A Worthless Story
","As is customary when reviewing a Star Wars movie, I am obligated to begin by explaining my own connection to the franchise. I love Star Wars, but I am of the opinion that George Lucas' six-part saga is the only story worth mentioning in the cinematic history of the franchise. I find the post-Lucas sequels to be a disgusting affront to what is left of artistic originality and creativity in Hollywood. A hostile corporate takeover of what was essentially a uniquely auteur piece of pop art. I am against Disney/Lucasfilm's fan fiction on principle, but that doesn't mean I can't still enjoy it for what it is; Disposable science fiction action with a Star Wars branded coat of paint. That is especially the case with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Unlike its big Disney brothers, Rogue One doesn't try to pretend to be part of the same ongoing saga. Instead, it does what I might've hoped Disney's fan fiction would; fill in the gaps with a unique, smaller scale trifle whose purpose is only to entertain. Still, even with tempered expectations, I got little out of Rogue One. The sad fact is, this is a bad movie, littered with terrible decision after terrible decision, leading to a trite waste of the Star Wars name.<br/><br/>Rogue One is a different kind of ""Star Wars Story"". As a tangential ""one-off"" story about a group of Rebels only mentioned in A New Hope and their mission to capture the plans to the original Death Star, Rogue One is not aiming to be a new chapter in the saga. It is more like an attempt to recreate Marvel's reliable pattern of standalone films that bolster the ""main storyline"". And like those films, it feels unashamedly manufactured. There is a lot of heavy speeches and overblown melodrama, but really, this movie is only superficially ""big"". The story is small-scale all the way through; A tension-free, low-stakes, TV-style lark for action buffs. And all of this is despite the fact that director Gareth Edwards pulls out all the visual stops to make Rogue One feel like a war epic.<br/><br/>I understand that Rogue One wants to be a war epic, but the visual style of the film, for the most part, is a major disadvantage. Edwards does scale well, and the extended, multi-layered battle that takes up the film's last half hour is pretty spectacular. It's everything else that took me out of the experience. Edwards and DP Greig Fraser are obsessed with close-up, out of focus, handheld camera work, and the film's color palette is disgustingly drab. With the exception of that final battle (which takes place on a beautiful tropical military base), Rogue One is awful to look at; closer to a moody TV ad than an epic war movie. The visual style is a major miscalculation, but it is one of many.<br/><br/>Most notably misjudged are the characters. From the writing to the casting to the acting, this thing is a disaster when it comes to portraying people we are supposed to care about. Felicity Jones plays the protagonist, Jyn Erso, an insipid take on the lazy ""orphan-turned-leader"" formula that gave us Rey. She meets, among others, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, and Riz Ahmed. I don't find any of these actors particularly appealing regardless, but all of them give bad performances here. Whitaker makes some truly bizarre decisions as a Rebel extremist, and Jones is even worse. Her face lacks anything but a blank, detached, dopiness, and when she is forced to give grandiose rallying cries, it's impossible to not roll your eyes. The only one in the whole cast that comes out relatively unscathed is Donnie Yen as a blind wannabe Jedi with a pointy stick.<br/><br/>There is not much keeping Rogue One from being a mildly enjoyable sci-fi action flick. The story, as trivial as it is, is enough to hang some battles on and call it a day. This film should have been, at least, exciting. The final battle is, but the journey there is filled with far too many ridiculous errors in judgement. For all the production designs and cutting-edge CGI, Rogue One can't keep from shooting itself in the foot. The characters stink. The cinematography stinks. The dialogue stinks. If these aspects were merely tolerable, the action (directed quite well by Edwards) might have been fun. But there is so much that is not tolerable, so many distractingly bad elements, that it is hard to lose yourself in the battles. Even when Darth Vader shows up at the end, I could only get partially giddy. If you must exploit the Star Wars name, it has to be more worthwhile than this.<br/><br/>35/100"

The cast worked well for the film. Each character has a different motive for joining the rebellion. <br/><br/>This movie does a great job of tying in both trilogies, seeing Bail Organa aged and briefly seeing burned Anakin in his healing chamber. They did a fantastic job of recreating Peter Cushing in CGI, he looked so life like.<br/><br/>Seeing Darth Vader at the end when he mercilessly slaughters the rebel troopers and dismembers them, was awesome! You finally saw how dark Vader actually is and it was a more realistic scene as rather than the rebels trying to shoot him in a pathetic attempt to kill him, they instead flee for their lives like their in a cage with a wild animal, whilst passing the plans down to each other.<br/><br/>And finally it fixed the big plot whole of the original film, the Death Star's weak spot. Now instead of a stupid mistake we find out that it was deliberately put their by the constructor, so it would be an easy target for the rebels.

","...but the movie was good enough in spite of its shortcomings.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this movie was excellent because it offers a fresh perspective on the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>To get the negative aspects out of the way - almost every downside is a consequence of the amount of content presented in a very short time frame (2h15m~). In my opinion, the only way to present this content while keeping overall quality would be to make it a series of roughly 10 episodes.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna start breaking this movie down to would-be episodes but I'll mention one thing:<br/><br/>The most important issue - the lack of character depth - is directly related to the length of the movie and the amount of events. If the characters were properly developed we'd be reviewing a Star Wars version of ""The young and the restless"". The action and events would have to be ""implied"".<br/><br/>As it stands, the characters would easily evolve between Galen's ""abduction"" and his death (in a series). Once the characters would be properly developed, nothing would stand in the way of the rapid succession of events.<br/><br/>Now here's what I did like about the movie.<br/><br/>Unlike every other Star Wars episode, it didn't have that feeling of a PG12 rated film due to embarrassing dialogue and behavior and most importantly - it offered us a new perspective - that of non-force sensitive people.<br/><br/>The action is largely comprised of blaster shootouts, space battles and a few melee encounters (mostly Chirrut and K-2SO).<br/><br/>Those hoping to see some lightsaber action would be disappointed (mostly). Otherwise this movie offers great insight into Star Wars' background as a whole.<br/><br/>While the ending scene was truly masterfully done, it wouldn't mean anything without the rest of the movie. The entire action and the whole perspective I mentioned earlier lead up to this final moment. Vader shows up and cuts through the ranks of the rebels like an unstoppable force. There's no escape and there's nobody there to challenge him. There's only his presence and an overwhelming sense of doom.<br/><br/>If you're a fan looking to learn more about the Star Wars universe then this is right up your alley.<br/><br/>If you're in it just to see some lightsaber duels - that's not what's going on here. But you might wanna give it a shot anyway."

","A needed Star Wars movie!<br/><br/>Star Wars 7 was a let down for me. It didn't do justice after all the years fans waited for another Star Wars movie. At least to me. But Rogue One was the justice. An action packed movie that was very entertaining. It was a side story that brought the life of the Star Wars universe back <br/><br/>I was spectacle about seeing Rogue One. After being disappointed by how Star Wars 7 went. I almost thought I'd wait around and not see the movie in theaters. But I decided against it and went to a late showing because it's Star Wars and just had to see it on the big screen. And by goodness sake I was glad I did. The movie starts right away introducing the new faces, Rogue One. If you don't know what this Star Wars is about, during Star Wars 4 it was said a team of rebels stole the plans of the Death Star. This is that team and the story that goes along is way better than expected.<br/><br/>10/10 for the beautiful, gorgeous visual effects they pulled off!!<br/><br/>The way they tie Rogue One within the Star Wars universe was brilliant. It felt like I was right back into the Star Wars world. And the action and fight scenes were intense. The visual effects out did themselves in here. It was beautiful. It looked so good to the eye. You couldn't have asked for a better side story to the Star Wars franchise. From the new faces you see and old faces, the acting is supreme. Felicity Jones did an amazing job with Diego Luna. Alongside with the other cast members, they all did a wonderful job to get you to feel their character.<br/><br/>I usually have some elements that I bring to the table that they could have done differently or something I didn't like. But as I look back at the movie, it just felt right. It connected well with the Star Wars universe. And I can't say where they might have messed up on. With Star Wars 7 having its own issues. And with the success of this film. I have to only say I am excited that hopefully Star Wars 8 will redeem itself and bring on the story that fans want. <br/><br/>With that said I would recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and anyone who just wants to see some action pack thrill. You won't be bored nor waiting for the action to build up. The special effects is 10/10(I cannot stop thinking about how amazing the CGI was here), a must see. And you couldn't go wrong with the epic Star Wars music that always hits home. Again, you couldn't have asked for a better Star Wars story to add to the Star Wars universe."

","19 December 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Rogue One. All hail the marvellous minds that come together to bring us films like this. This is not Star Wars, this is setting the scene for an epic saga, full of characters we have never heard of, yet are strangely familiar. This is a tale of good guys and bad guys and grand battles, narrow escapes and people fighting for the causes they believe in. We are invited to join the story before it begins and along the way we are teased with seconds of familiar noises, cameos of familiar faces and moments of mirth which were totally unexpected. We are introduced to a different generation of droid, who not only enthralled us like C3P0 but also very much reminded me of Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory (bizarre I know). Some very clever film techniques brought us unexpected characters and re-introduced us to weaponry and battle strategies of old (or new depending on which film you are watching). This film has provided an excellent stop gap whilst we wait for Episode 7, whilst at the same time negating the need to waste time watching Episodes 1-3. Excellent filming, a wonderful array of characters, a mixture of human, tentacle clad, masked, and downright squishy which is brought together in bars and streets from distant ends of the galaxy. There is also a splendid mix of spaceships, old favourites and new designs which given the timeline actually work together and you accept them as already existing. Brilliant film, well done to all involved."
"r-fronimides","9","1","8","19 December 2016"," A SUPERB ""Deja-Vu""! As best as the ""origina"" trilogy was/is!
","Nostalgia... ""How great the old Lucas StarWars films they were"" (Episodes 4/5/6)<br/><br/>...We have the ""new"" trilogy (Episodes 1/2/3), filling the story, but not as good as the old trilogy was. They didn't have that ""smell"" of the old one - even if the birth of Darth Vader from Anakin (in 3rd Episode) was marvelous.<br/><br/>Episode 7th was a good effort... but that's all about, a good effort, not a good StarWars film.<br/><br/>...And what about this one, here, now?<br/><br/>REMARKABLE! A ""GEM"", no question about it!<br/><br/>Well, the producers & directors had less difficult job to do, as Episode 7 had to do. In Episode 7, they FIGURED the story how maybe will be. In this one, an episode BETWEEN Episode 3 & Episode 4, it fills perfectly the gap! In Episode 4, we're reading in the beginning's yellow text (that disappears in deep space) the story of ""Rogue-One"". Just few lines... And then, in the end of Episode 4, just before the final assault on ""Death Star"", Mon Mothma (the Rebels leader) is telling to the pilots that ""many Rebels died due the process, to get this plans into our hands"".<br/><br/>And that's it, WE HAVE A STORY to tell!<br/><br/>""Rogue-One"" is set FEW DAYS BEFORE the opening scene of Episode 4 began. In ""Rogue-One"", the Rebellion exists, the Empire exists, ALL THE MAIN characters of Episode 4 exists (!), DARTH VADER exists (and... he's amazing, for these few 15 or so minutes he appears!), the original StarWars feeling exists... ...it's an authentic StarWars film, period!!!<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film... you'll may surprised (no spoiling, just saying). And you'll turn to your mates right and left of you in the cinema and ask ""hey, what's going on? What's this?""... And you'll FIND OUT WHY the beginning was like this, at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The story is a bit slow for the first 40 minutes, because the director wanted (I suppose) to fill all the ""puzzle"" of young Erso's (main female character) background/story. WHEN ""AN INCIDENT"" happens (no spoils, just saying),... well... you feel like you stepped into a... Ferrari cockpit and you pressed the gas all the way down and you didn't let it go!!! The action starts like a F-14's afterburner... and keeps burns to the end, more and more!<br/><br/>If you know (or remember) the story (from the other films), you may not expect Jedi knights to see - it's not a spoil, just remember. In the end of Episode 3, the last Jedi knights flee and gets cover in the four corners of the galaxy, while in Episode 4 ONE Jedi appears to Luke (the old Kenobi)... So, don't expect light-saber duels. But EXPECT light-saber action! (There is STILL ONE ""Jedi""... well... Sith Lord!)<br/><br/>The film is dramatic, thnk God for that! No, you won't see like in Episode 7 ...an old grand-pa Han Solo and an elder Chewbacca along with a young inexperienced girl and a coward ex-stormtrooper to... set a whole Imperial base to hell! Here... is TRUE war! Here, they do BLEED,... a lot! And they suffering... a lot! And there is also dramatic ending, as there is ""A New Hope""...<br/><br/>(These are not spoils, you know from Episode 4 that it was VERY DRAMATIC mission, to steal the plans of ""Death Star"").<br/><br/>And... yes... for the love of God... and for the flavor of MILLIONS of StarWars fans, we DO HAVE (AGAIN) our ultimate character of ALL films, of ALL times: <br/><br/>VADER... IS BACK!<br/><br/>Truly... mark my words... just don't see the film, go sleep into the cinema and tell your guy next to you... to wake you up ONLY when DARTH VADER appears (about 7 minutes in the middle of the film, and about so - 7 minutes - and the end of the film). EVEN IF YOU WATCH ONLY THESE 14-15 minutes... you won't regret it, ever, in your life! Especially the last 7 minutes... well, is the BEST DARTH VADER APPEARANCE in every StarWar films, ever made!<br/><br/>(I probably had... orgasm, during that last 7 minutes of the film!)<br/><br/>I'm a huge StarWars fan; I'm 47 years old, and I was fortune to see (in cinema) the first film (Episode 4) in the single Greek/Athenian cinema, back then... After the movie, I remember (I was 7 years old) that EVERYBODY was talking about that remarkable ""Dark Evil Lord""... The film was about the good lads (heroes), the good lads won... but all of the people were talking about that dark-clothing tall, ""cold-blood"", extreme evil character... ...And yes, after all these decades, DARTH VADER is by far the GREATEST character of StarWars... and perhaps the greatest ""bad-guy"" ever created in the History of Cinema.<br/><br/>...And, HE'S BACK! He's alive! He's amazing!!! Mark my words... this Darth Vader's appearance, will write a new history in the legacy of StarWars.<br/><br/>(Jesus... why you made SOOOOO FEW scenes of him?! He was amazing! We could ""enjoy"" a quarter minutes more, for sure!)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Music was amazing,... cut-scenes were amazing,... battles EVERYWHERE (urban, terra, close-contact, you name it) were amazing,... the OLD CHARACTERS were amazing (thnk God for the CGI in modern cinema!), everything was fantastic.<br/><br/>The only thing it wasn't so good, was the screenplay of the actress with the main female character. She was good, but she may could act better - or the casting could find a better one. She was good, but not as the rest great parts of the film. That's why I gave 9, instead of 10 stars.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Epilogue... this is a remarkable film! You need to go NOW, I mean... stop reading, book a ticket, FLY NOW to this ""galaxy, far far away""!"

The villains were villainous, The reconstruction of old characters with CGI was respectable though noticeable. I was willing to forgive it. Old characters and throwbacks to the originals were not overdone and waved in your face through the whole movie, just enough to tie it together. The new locations and characters were interesting and fresh.<br/><br/>I will agree with some other reviewers that some of the characters were a little bland/unnecessary but still it was a good job all around.

","A must see movie. The best one in Star Wars series. Simply marvelous. Has everything anyone would expect - humor, tension, and probably the most important - iconic moments. Each characters role perfectly done. There were no moments where boredom would take over. Throughout all the movie my interest was at the highest point. The story of the movie is a part after the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, which allowed to see the background that wasn't on the surface of both original and the prequel series. To be honest, I didn't expect it to be this good, since it's more of a background story. But in my opinion, this is the best Star Wars movie to this date. No flaws whatsoever. Fully recommend to see it."

"thedrewdavies","9","1","8","16 December 2016"," SPOILERS : The star wars movie you wanted when you were 10!
","I didn't have the greatest expectations when i entered the theatre for rogue one. Rumors of re shoots, a half empty cinema and memories of the cynical sequel last year suppressed my enthusiasm. The director was not someone i knew much about and the premise sounded like a cliché. 'Spunky bad girl attacks the empire with nothing but a sassy attitude and ragtag bunch of forgettable Tagalogs' sounded too much like the post modern marvel dominated media that is starting to grind. <br/><br/>Then the opening shot came in. No scroll. Camera angle up then down. To most people no biggie. To the star wars aficionado it's a deceleration of rebellious intent and make no mistake, this is a film directed squarely at the super-geeks.<br/><br/>The motives are set out in rapid fashion but never feel contrived. There is a reason for Jan's mother's death, she can't bear to lose her husband. The imperials don't just kill her, there is an air of reason in their speech to contrast the psychopathic tendencies of later scenes. It is a mirror of the first act of the force awakens, yet shows it's reflections' sloppiness. Everything makes sense within the films' own logic, everything informs the main characters in the explicit. <br/><br/>The story moves between locations in Dune-esque style, setting up the pieces on the board. The locations will feel vaguely familiar, some straight out of McQuarries' sketches, others from the various expanded universe sources. The imperial research base was so familiar from the opening level of Jedi knight 2 that i instinctively knew parts of it before they appeared on screen. This gave the film what the force awakens desperately sought, true credibility. <br/><br/>However, where the force awakens used these throw backs as the whole basis of it's story, rogue one never seams to drown in it's references. This is exemplified in Ponda Baba and Dr Evazan's cameo (i only had to look one of them up to confirm the spelling, i hang my head in shame!) that is literally shrugged off as the story rolls on. <br/><br/>The story is quite remarkable as well. It seems like a dark retelling of the previous year's low-lights. The Syrian war, the rise of the far right and drone warfare are a subtle but unmistakable presence throughout the film. There is a reason that the daily mail and other right wing media outlets are pumping out 'controversial' reviews of the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if a 'too dark for kids' furore arose at some point, even as early reports suggest that the 12 year old demographic have lapped it up. <br/><br/>The plot, whilst slightly opaque at the beginning, pushes you through at lightning pace until you come to the third act. The best third act since Return of the Jedi. The land battle is tight and thrilling. The space battle blows away the mediocrity of the last 30 years. If you have ever played x wing alliance, the tactics and weaponry will seem like second nature. Of course the way to take down a star destroyer is to destroy the shield tower and then bombard it with a y wing ion torpedo raid. The end is bittersweet, Return of the Jedi as it should have been without the rewrite that replaced the Wookies with a cannibalistic Ewok celebration ending (how else did they get rid of the bodies?). <br/><br/>To the trained eye the references are obvious. There are flaws; the dark lord's pun stands out like a sore thumb and the repeated shots from a new hope will likely grate in years to come. However, this is more than the copy of a copy presented by the force awakens, a film that seemed like a cynical grab for fan support with it's replicated plot and it's callback fanfare. It think rogue one's genuine care for it's source material translated into how i felt during and after the film. It rekindled the love i had for the original films that were so tarnished by the prequels. I started looking into what was next, what other people though about the film, writing this love letter to it on IMDb. It's done something the prequels and sequels have failed to do, it's made the original films better. <br/><br/>And Darth Vader is bloody scary again too!"
"paulijcalderon","6","1","8","15 December 2016"," Brought a lot of good memories back!
","I liked the style and look of this movie much more than ""Episode VII"", but I didn't feel as invested in all the characters like in ""VII"". I like a lot of the new characters. It's just that my care- level wasn't as high as the filmmakers were hoping. Although it makes up for with the action, set-pieces and references to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>There were a lot of moments that surprised me and seeing some classic things again brought some good memories back. My favorite line from the trailer wasn't in it and the score didn't stand out. The beach planet was a nice location, but I wished we got there sooner because there were too many scenes on the spaceship.<br/><br/>It was overall a good enjoyable experience and it does leave you with a good taste in your mouth. So, yes, I liked it and I gotta say, I was really impressed with a lot of the effects. I do want to re-watch many scenes, but not all the scenes from the first half, since the second half is when I felt it really got going."

","Rogue One is a war film that is set in the Star Wars universe. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic film overall. It will manage to satisfy both star wars fans and new comers alike. <br/><br/>The actors do a great job of conveying emotions and portray characters that are believable. The music is good but nothing to write home about. But the standout in this film are the action sequences and the cinematography. The action is outstanding and gives me flashes of other great war films. The action scenes are tense, gritty and beautifully shot. The cinematography is excellent. This could be the best looking star wars film yet. <br/><br/>The practical effects are outstanding and makes the film feel like a true Star Wars film. The clever use of CGI, which does not overstay its welcome, is appreciated. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is very strong, technically.

"dougee_fresh","9","1","8","15 December 2016"," It stands on it's own 2 feet
","I felt I should write something, I had not watched any trailers or read up on this film before watching it this morning as I wanted to judge for myself if this could go up against the others. I've been thinking about the film since I've come out and must say, it does do a great job. It's created a narrative without having to rely on established characters, gave good foundations to the characters it's created and tied it to the main storyline almost perfectly. It isn't perfect, much like Episode 7 isn't, But it creates a story you can believe and characters you can root for. It's also quite a powerful storyline and I think this gives it the strength it needs to of been able to stand up against such a fan base of the originals. It's a part of the family, it just doesn't need to shout about it, if you get my meaning. 8/10, nicely done"
"peefyn","8","1","8","15 December 2016"," A side story
","There's some minor spoilers in this review, but to me they are not bad enough to ruin any of the enjoyment of watching the movie.<br/><br/>For the previous Star Wars movie, I was all aboard the hype train. For this one, I was looking forward to it, but I was not really following the press about the movie leading up to it, so I went in with less expectations (though still very excited to see it). And I'm happy with what I saw.<br/><br/>This movie is very much a side story, and it is felt throughout it. You can see the Star Wars saga in it, not just through the setting, but also through the feeling you get from it. It's a very contained story, on the fringes of the mythos we are familiar with. The soundtrack is and off-shoot of the familiar Star Wars soundtrack. The locations are partly familiar, but also new. It would be natural to watch this along with the rest of the saga, but it would be like a break from the Skylwaker-story, rather than an addition to it. So in the sense that it is a ""Star Wars story"", and not an ""episode"", it works really well.<br/><br/>There is a lot of elements and references to the other movies, and I know some has been critical to these. Mostly I did not have a problem with them, as many of the characters that were familiar, really were relevant from the story, like Tarkin, Vader and the heads of the rebellion. There are even some references that I'm sure most people won't notice (and many that I am certain I did not get). One I appreciated is that you get to see who had the call sign ""red five"" before Luke got it in the first Star Wars movie. One reference I can understand people are critical of, is the inclusion of C3P0 and R2-D2. While the fact that they are there probably is not controversial, they're scene added little beyond ""here we are!"", which kind of took you out of the film. But it was also nice to see them, and to know that Anthony Daniels didn't miss out on this film (as he has been in the rest of them).<br/><br/>Regarding Vader and Tarkin, I must admit that some of the scenes with them made me feel a bit uneasy. It was strange to hear Darth Vader talk in that setting, but say different tings than I have heard him say so many times. I'm sure that the voice was the same (the actor was the same, so it should be), but it still felt a bit off. Maybe this is something one gets used to after seeing the movie more times. Tarkin's appearance was a joy, but I still don't feel modern day CGI is good enough for this. I've spoken to people who didn't notice, but I was thrown into the uncanny valley as soon as he appeared. But I am still glad they included him.<br/><br/>This is a different type of Star Wars film, and maybe what I liked best about it was how it showed you the realty of a rebellion. How the rebel groups live dangerous lives, aren't always organized, and can be considered terrorists. This was especially clear in the fight in Jedha's streets. The parallels to the battle we there and what's going on the Middle East are obvious, and hit me hard. I did not expect that from watching a Star Wars film, and I am really happy that they went there. They even touch upon how rebels fraction into groups that work for the same goal, but in different ways.<br/><br/>And the fact that this is a stand alone film, also leaves them open to sacrifice more. I won't go into the fate of the various characters, but I will say that I wish we got to bond more with them, so that last part of the movie would have a bigger effect on you. I loved many of the character's, but I've watched other movies that had me care more for the character's in the same amount of time. I'm not sure if they held back, or if they just couldn't fit it all into the run time, but either way I feel we as the audience missed out on many good character moments.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment with this movie, was probably the music. It's good, I guess I am not complaining about it, but I felt that it was a bit underwhelming. There's some of the music from the sagas, but of the new music, it often just sounded like vague imitations, instead of new, powerful themes. Maybe this is also about having to get used to the music, and having it grow on you.<br/><br/>And as with all the major Star Wars movies, this is a movie that people will end up seeing many times. And with time, it will be another one of the classic Star Wars movies."

","What are you doing reading this? GO WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!<br/><br/>Personally I liked Force Awakens and I ranked it on the top 3. Well its now on the top 4 as its replaced by Rogue One.<br/><br/>The story is simple. A band of rebels embark on a quest to steal the death star plans. As I said the story is simple, somewhat predictable and we already know the ending. But the beauty is in the journey, not in reaching the destination.<br/><br/>The movie starts kind of slow but picks up pace as it progresses. The characters are pretty good. <br/><br/>Jyn Erso is on a dilemma of deciding if her father is either a hero or a villain. Very well played by Felicity Jones.<br/><br/>Cassian Andor is an intelligence officer who seeks to retrieve Galen Erso at all costs. Not really a fan of Diego Luna, but he did a good job. <br/><br/>K-2SO.... well Disney did it again. They ""replaced"" R2 with BB8 and now K-2SO is the new C3PO... a bad ass C3PO. BB8 is adorable but K-2SO is the ""uninteded"" comic relief and he gets the most laughs.<br/><br/>Chirrut and Baze join the rebellion apparently for no particular reason, but they actually fit. Donnie Yen is somewhat wasted IMO, but still.<br/><br/>Galen Erso is the scientist who is forced to build the death star, but he has plans to help tip the scale. Very big fan of Mads Mikkelsen and he doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Director Orson Krennic is the person in charge to build and operate the death star. I'm not really sold on his performance, but at least he doesn't get in the way<br/><br/>Yes Darth Vader is there. He has little screen time, but boy does he make it count.<br/><br/>There's a particular character that I won't name but its only natural that it appears on the death star. I'll only say this. Man the technology of face replacement done since Tron Legacy is now VERY CONVINCING.<br/><br/>Then there's the cameos, most of them expected but a couple seem a little bit forced IMO. <br/><br/>The special effects are top notch. It all blends together, you can hardly tell the difference between CGI and real models/characters.<br/><br/>The action sequences are among the best I've seen, although one scene is to say the least ""questionable"". The ground battles remind me of some WW2 movies. It's nice to see the storm troopers actually hitting something.<br/><br/>Now the nitpicking<br/><br/>I don't really like the Jedi but not Jedi trend. These characters that know the force but aren't actually Jedi. The only one that could have made sense was Leia and she didn't even know the force.<br/><br/>Some characters are underdeveloped. For example, we don't know Chirrut and Baze motivation to join the rebellion. <br/><br/>The worst IMO is WHY, please god WHY is this trend of cutting scenes that appear on the trailers? <br/><br/>Still its a great movie so...<br/><br/>What are you doing reading this?

I also loved the pilot, the main villain and the rebel senator ""Mon Montha"".<br/><br/>I really love the links to the original Star Wars and I like that they didn't rely heavily on constant reminders of the characters to come but rather just visit these connections from time to time.<br/><br/>Effects looked great. I actually saw some models in there which was fantastic. They still are the best, cause natural light hitting real subjects cannot be beat.<br/><br/>Music was awesome of course, I feel John is probably out of ideas now but it held up great.<br/><br/>I did miss the original titles...I guess the A.D.D generation has arrived lol.<br/><br/>Overall I felt they touched on an emotional level several times which is what all good Star Wars movies have done.<br/><br/>Going to list some things could have been improved but be aware this was a fantastic movie.<br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the droid jokes were simply not funny as some were. - I think the 2 lead characters were a bit too serious, they need to have a laugh once in a while to show they are human. - The intro 15 min was a little bit information heavy. Maybe a bit more linear script could have helped. - The pilot and the wire cable thingy, was cool scene, but the whole idea behind this task was a bit overly complicated. Perhaps if he had to simply take the data in another ship to the frigate that would have been better. - Where the hell were the BOTHANS???!!! lol</li></ul><br/><br/>Definitely will watch it again."

","I have always been a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise and I have never been let down with any film that has come from Lucasfilms and event the more recent ones that co-produced with Disney after Disney bough the rights to Lucasfilms. Rogue One was amazing, it kept that consistent Star Wars feel to it and it had everything that a Star Wars film should entail in it. I never once found myself drifting or being distracted by something else around me, it immersed you into the film, by showing you the background of the main characters and also by allowing you to get to actually know and understand them. This is what's so great about the Star Wars franchise you get to actually know the characters and you are able to feel like you know them on a personal basis through the magic of film. Anyway back to the review, it was action packed, entertaining, funny and out right brilliant. Although the droid was not a main character I found him hilarious through his sarcasm and how pessimistic he is. Highly, highly recommend this to anyone I encounter.

"jamesrupert2014","8","1","9","14 September 2017"," A worthy addition to the beloved series
","I saw Rogue One on the big screen when it came out and again on TV last night: the former was spectacular, the latter convenient (especially pause and re-watch functions). Rogue One is (IMO) by far the best Star Wars move to come out since the original trilogy. The story works – skillfully linking a new 'parallel' tale to the canonic original, thus avoiding the usual problems that often arise with sequels (trying to revisit, and redefine, original characters) and prequels (often adding unnecessary and unpopular backstories). The acting and script are excellent (for an Sci-Fi action flic), as are the special effects. Peter Cushing's simulacrum looked better on the small screen (although Carrie's Fisher's still looked like it had crawled out of the uncanny valley). There were a few slow moments and some excessively improbable events, but all-in-all, a worthy successor to the originals (which, of course, also had slow moments and excessively improbable events) and a great addition to the much revered Star Wars mythos."
"Bernnard_Black","10","1","9","11 May 2017"," Finally, a Star Wars prequel worth of the name
","So I grew up with Star Wars. I was a kid when the original came out, and I loved it from the start. And each following movie was great in their own way, concluding with Return of the Jedi. The movies had the ""magic"" for lack of a better word; they had the right blend of likable characters, compelling stories, drama, and humor that make a movie great.<br/><br/>And then came the prequels...<br/><br/>The Star Wars prequels are basically proof that Lucas forgot how to tell his own story. Instead of using dazzling effects to help tell a story, he wrote a story that would showcase his effects. Flat characters, a plot line that was an uninspired confusing mess, and truly horrific direction. For many, Star Wars died with the prequels...especially after the beloved originals were edited for the umpteenth time and the theatrical releases basically impossible to get.<br/><br/>So when Rogue One came along, I was hesitant. The story was intriguing; always wondered how the Rebels got the plans for the Death Star. And hey, Vader was back, and Tarkin, and that was something I really wanted to see. I was a bit worried about the director; Edwards has talent and tells a visual story really well, but his ""people"" stories are often lacking and can be flat; just watch 2014's Godzilla, and you'll see what I mean. <br/><br/>But wow, was I pleasantly surprised at this movie! It has all the things that made Star Wars so great in the first place. The story is simple, yet compelling and above all LOGICAL; none of this bizarre non-sensical plot lines from the prequel trilogy. The story made sense from start to finish, and that was a huge plus. <br/><br/>The characters are likable, as well, though you know if you've seen the original that things can't end well for them. The blend of drama and humor is spot on, with the humor largely provided by the voice talents of Alan Tudyk as K2SO, a snarky droid. <br/><br/>And as any Star Wars movie has, the effects were eye-popping. And I don't just mean the space battles and such; while excellent (and this is where Edwards can really shine), they were not the most amazing thing about it. No, that goes to the extremely clever way that characters from A New Hope were fit into this film in a seamless way. First you have Tarkin. Played in the original by Peter Cushing, the idea that he would be back bothered many fans; that's a guy you just don't recast. But with advances in computer tech, and using a good actor to play the part, Tarkin was back and bigger than life. He even has a bigger role than in the original, and unless you knew Cushing was dead you'd never know it wasn't him on the screen. It's nearly flawless, how it was done. And other characters were brought back as well; Red and Gold leader from A New Hope were in the film, too, by the simple trick of using unused footage from the original to get them in the story. It really helped make the film ""feel"" like it was happening at the same basic time as the original. <br/><br/>The attention to detail was impressive as well. Vader has the same costume as his original; it's not as advanced and ""shiny"" as his outfits from Empire or Jedi. The storm troopers and Rebel fleet troopers have on the same outfits as in A New Hope; indeed, some actually ARE the same costumes, pulled from storage. Everything looks and feels right, and that's a huge plus for the film.<br/><br/>And while one iconic part of Star Wars history wasn't involved - John Williams, the man behind the music - Michael Giacchino does a great job of putting his own twist on the classic themes of Star Wars while adding new ones of his own. <br/><br/>All in all, this was just a great movie. In many ways, it's not even really a Star Wars movie as much as it is a story like Where Eagles Dare or The Dirty Dozen that takes place in the Star Wars universe. But it's so well crafted and blends the surrounding story elements (from the cartoon series Rebels to the movies themselves) that it fits just fine even if it's not a classic Star Wars kind of story. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, and you didn't like the prequels or even The Force Awakens, give it a try. It just might be the movie you've been waiting for. It was for me, and I couldn't be happier with it."

","It is a great movie...better than the last one, and the ""bridge"" of this SW 3.5 it is well done! But this is a Star Wars crippled, because the original soundtrack is not of John Williams. Giachinno's it is a good composer, but only just goes as expected...there is no tears of geniality as had with John Williams...The soundtrack is not bad, it is good, but a movie cannot reach the class of ""Great"" without a great soundtrack. And Star Wars success owes much to John Williams music...Of course that he is irreplaceable!...Also the 3D effects are nothing of special!...But I hope to continue to have more and more Star Wars episodes!"
"SugarandIce","9","1","9","2 January 2017"," Star Wars has hope.
","Many people are under the impression that Star wars must have a certain feel and contain certain clichés. Particularly, if they don't feel like the original trilogy, these Star Wars products are inherently bad. The thing is, Star Wars has always been much more and its various stories in novels and games have not only understood that but often succeeded because of it. I must admit it was surprising that Disney and Lucasfilm gave the go ahead on a rather unique addition to Star Wars's cinematic universe. Rogue One is not like other Star Wars films. It is a war film and contains very little of the Jedi and Force elements of earlier films. It brings back the tragedy and dark elements of Revenge of the Sith and Empire Strikes back, perhaps even darker than ever.<br/><br/>This is by no means a perfect film. Its characters, while sufficient and not two-dimensional, don't get the screen time they deserve. Even characters I loved like Donnie Yen's character could have used a few more minutes to go over their backstories. There are also some plot holes and poorly executed scenes, much like Gareth Edward's last film, Godzilla. <br/><br/>What this film does right however is take chances and largely succeeds in its efforts. It is far more ambitious than any side-story cash grab has a right to be. This film isn't afraid to show the dark side of the Star Wars universe with multiple character deaths and violent massacres. The Empire feels dangerous in this film. The world building is also fantastic, the cinematography is spectacular, and this film has possibly the best space battles we've ever seen in Star Wars. If TFA (while not a bad film) made me wonder if Star Wars had become afraid to evolve, Rogue One has made me realize there is hope for this beloved franchise.<br/><br/>Critically, I rate this film 8/10 and 9/10 for personal enjoyment."
"ICMooVees","9","1","9","27 December 2016"," Rogue One review
","Went with the family to watch after Christmas. We all found the movie to be a great tie into New Hope by defining the lines spoken by Leia that the deathstar plans ""came at a great price or great cost"". Now we know what that great cost was. When you step back and take a macro view of Rogue One you can see how it provides a great backstory that leads into NH. Looking closer at RO, you can see the various characters and elements that contributed to the great sacrifice made by everyone, the power struggle and interactions between the Empire leaders of the deathstar, and even feel the pressure from Vader, who BTW we were treated to watching him let loose on the rebels even for just a couple minutes, really showed some of his skills. The destructive power of the deathstar was demonstrated quite nicely and it's final blast ""cleaned up"" the remaining characters. Yes it was a little sad to see all of them die, but gave closure to all of them since none appeared in NH. The fight scenes were awesome and the strategy used by fish-guy to ram a ship into a star destroyer and push that ship into another star destroyer to crash down onto the planet gate was AWESOME to see."

","Rogue one a star wars movies, by Gareth Edwards is a good cinema screen movie. One thing that i have always struggled with Star war movies is the number of characters and places, that i had a hard time keeping track of, this issue i felt resolved when watched Rogue one. People and missions originating from different planetary sources come together in a disciplined way, at the same time maintaining the richness of the story line. Humour is well delivered and movie as whole keeps your attention with out periods of boredom. Actors are sound. at times action can be over whelming but than its Star Wars. i will recommend this movie, particularly to the audience who are still confused about the other episodes, as ROgue one summarizes the other episodes to an extent and gets you up to speed for what is to come."
"fe_scolfaro","9","1","9","27 December 2016"," Some flaws, but overall my favorite film in 2016
","Twelve days after the premiere, and everyone and their mothers has written a review, so I'll keep this one short and only address what I think should be mentioned.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is as close to an action film anything in the franchise has ever been, so you have to keep in mind that once the characters have been properly introduced, they'll either kill or be killed, and it won't stop once it starts.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this was a major annoyance, the MUSIC was butchered for the first third of the film. There were interesting variations on the themes and some competent rearranging of the known themes, as a pointer to this film being somewhat a separate story to the true trilogy, however, in one of those moments a snippet of the Imperial March is played inside of one of the rearranged themes, just as a Rebel ship flies off into space. THIS IS A NO GO, it was the most confusing moment in the movie, and had me wondering if someone was switching sides or if I'd gotten the characters wrong. Childish mistake on a series of films built on leitmotifs.<br/><br/>Thirdly, once you get past the bloopers with the soundtrack (which returns to Williams' themes for the last third of the film) and this or that detail that has been failed to be properly considered, the movie wraps up towards a final act of incredible proportions. There's a mind-blowing crescendo towards the end, to a measure very seldom seen in modern productions. Vader's end scenes reach a high note, just as you see the story unfolding towards our known plot points, and delivers the final blow in a way that makes it hard for fans to hold back a tear here and there. The editing and directing here is a masterpiece, very faithful to Episodes V and VI.<br/><br/>Completely worth the watch, and I'd watch the whole trilogy, plus this and The Force Awakens again, anytime. Episodes 1-2-3 are BS, these last two were on point.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and memberberries. They taste oh so great."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","9","26 December 2016"," Unsung Heroes of Star Wars
","Well, this is probably the first full length feature Star Wars movie where the main characters of the original series only play bit parts. Okay, you do have Darth Vader making an appearance, as well as R2-D2 and C3PO (among a couple of others), but the main focus of the film is actually on a group of unknowns. Sure, they do have some of the bit part characters in the original film take a more prominent role, but the film itself sort of provides us with a bit of a back story which eventually leads up to the opening of the original film.<br/><br/>Basically, as many of you are probably already aware, this film is about how the rebels managed to steal the plans or the Death Star, which then plays a prominent role in the next (or should I say first) film – namely getting them to the rebel base so that they can use them to launch an attack on the battle station. This film takes a step back and has us looking partially into the construction of the ship, and also how the plans were stolen, and why Luke was actually able to destroy it with relative ease (even though flying through a canyon and lobbing a torpedo into an exhaust vent while being shot at from turrets and tie fighters wouldn't necessarily be considered easy).<br/><br/>The thing is that many of the people dished the prequels, and from what I gathered this was much more well received. However, until the prequels, which turned Star Wars into the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker (which is probably why it wasn't particularly liked because tragedies can take a lot out of you, especially when the main character that you relate to is slipping slowly over to the dark side – well, okay, there was also Jar Jar Binks), this film simply provides a small back story in a much larger picture – in a way it is sort of like the Clone Wars in that it is not so much a part of the major story but rather a side note which provides more explanation to franchise as a whole. It also makes me wonder where they are going to take the next couple of films that aren't going to be apart of the third trilogy.<br/><br/>The question that I raise though is whether this is technically canon, namely because there are quite a few comics out there (Dark Times in particular) that seem to explore the universe during the time of the empire (which didn't last all that long by the way because the empire really only came to fruition around the time that Luke and Leah were born, and collapsed when they were adults, which gives it about thirty to thirty-five years). This sort of made me wonder about the time line in this film, namely because our protagonist was a young girl at the beginning, which was about the time that the Death Star stared being built, and was an adult at the end. Mind you, at the end of the third prequel I do remember a scene where the Death Star was being built.<br/><br/>As for the film, it was quite enjoyable, and fun to see a collection of different characters, though I was hoping that R2D2 would play a larger role in the films (though I suspect that he might not, particularly since we have BB8 taking a major role in the next trilogy I suspect R2D2 might end up taking a back seat). The other thing was being somewhat familiar with the original films, I am starting to prefigure a couple of things in these films – such as working out the Han Solo was going to be killed about ten minutes before he was killed, and also the ultimate fate of the main characters in this film. The thing is that I guess this is inevitable, particularly since I am somewhat a fan of the series."
"rockman182","8","1","9","25 December 2016"," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)
","I had a few initial worries about this film. I'm a giant Star Wars fan and even a bit of an apologist for some of the stuff that occurs in the prequels. I also greatly enjoyed The Force Awakens and think the film held up on a re-watch. Saying that, I was worried that having another Star War film a year after TFA may have been overkill. I was also worried about Felicity Jones being a lead. Inferno was a bad film and I thought Felicty Jones was not very good in it. I thought the film was in a good filmmaker's hands, as Gareth Edwards' Godzilla (while not without flaws) was an enjoyable blockbuster. My bare minimum for the film was to just be better than the previous prequels, a feat that shouldn't have been too hard. Now after seeing the film I can say that I am satisfied.<br/><br/>This was my first IMAX 3D venture. I was unfamiliar with how IMAX 3D would look but it was amazing to see the characters pop out of the screen. The film immediately (without an opening scroll which was a bit disappointing) goes into who Jyn Erso really is, and her quest to find her father and recover plans to destroy the Death Star. Much like with The Force Awakens, you are introduced to a multitude of new characters and a new droid, K-2SO. K-2SO is a wonderful character, and its very obvious that he is the comic relief of the film. Its much needed to because its hard to rely on the other characters. Some of the other characters like Riz Ahmed's Bodhi Rook and Wen's Baze Malbus feel underdeveloped and its hard to get invested in them. I'll come out and say its hard to get invested in many of the characters as there isn't any emotional connection or dimensional aspect to a few of them. This even includes Diego Luna's Cassian. As opposed to Finn and Rey in The Force Awakens who you connect with instantly. I thought Felicity Jones for the most part did a solid job in a leading role, although I kind of cringed when she was trying to cry upon seeing a hologram of her dad. Its hard to criticize acting in the Star Wars films because come on, Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen were awful in the prequels and had some of the most awkward chemistry ever seen.<br/><br/>The films strongest point is most certainly the battles. The land battle is the best seen since the one in The Empire Strikes Back. The flying space battles are relatively great as well. The digital effects look good, especially in a certain scene near the end. I feel like if I wasn't wearing 3D glasses I'd be able to take in the giant nature of the expansive battles but that's just something I'll have to look forward to when I re-watch the film. The score of the film is grandiose as you would expect in a Star Wars film. It does not disappoint.<br/><br/>I think the best part of the film is, hands down, witnessing Darth Vader again. James Earl Jones returns to voice him. I'm not sure if its the case, but his costume model looked slightly different in the helmet but I might be wrong. His first scene is great and his battle scene is so memorable. Its nice to see an iconic character in film have a resurgence all these years later and still be so badass. Also don't even act like mentioning Vader is a spoiler; he's in the trailer.<br/><br/>I think Rogue One felt fairly dark. Star Wars is generally pretty family friendly. And while there is violence and adult themes in these films, Rogue One had an air of bleakness and hopelessness. You know what will happen to these characters, its already written. That's why in the third act we get a real sense of it with the fate of some characters. However, that hopelessness immediately turns into hope and the film ends in an exciting and prospective way.<br/><br/>Rogue One is not better than The Force Awakens for me. The Force Awakens was a cinema experience that was fun from start to finish. Rogue One is less show in a narrative sense and more business when it comes to the facts of the story and the technical aspects of warfare. Rogue One is still a great cinematic experience in the sense that the battles are still incredible to watch, and the film boasts a few moments that fans of the series will just love. Those moments bumped the films rating up a number for me.<br/><br/>8/10"

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","10","1","9","25 December 2016"," Way more than just hope
","As a long time fan of Star Wars I was extremely exited to see Rogue one, not just because it was another SW movie; a simple continuation of the saga, but something different and unexpected. Hopes were extremely high, expectations were huge and I must say that all of them were superseded.<br/><br/>First of all, the story itself is spectacular. The idea and premise are simple: how the rebels stole the plans to destroy the Death star. Now, it seems quite fun and entertaining, but the result is a dark war drama resembling Saving private Ryan. The way the story is told is quite intriguing. The very pacing of the movie is interesting and the contrast of the first and second hour of the movie is spectacular. The first hour is quite slow and drags on, introduces us to the characters, a few old and a bunch of new ones. We learn about their past, their ideals, fears and desires. It may not seem like there is much background to the characters at first, but the more one contemplates about it, the more vivid it becomes how layered they actually are. Every location the characters visit in the first hour of the movie has a different atmosphere and ambient. The very contrast between them is astounding, as well as how much each time they visit another planet one learns about each character. Also, it is important to emphasize that all of those locations and battles that take place there resemble a specific historic real world battle or war (e.g. Vietnam; Iraq; Afghanistan...). Then we get to the second hour of the movie, where (and I am understating it) the greatest space battle ever made in history takes place. So, in contrast to the first very slow and dramatic part, the second one rips every nerve in the viewers body. But, the most interesting element is the pacing that Edwards uses to achieve that effect. Everything starts slow, sort of drags on etc. And then, at one point he just starts to build up not only the tension but the visual spectacle and emotions. The movie culminates with one of the most nerve wrecking sequence ever made, giving every one the chill along their spine. Not only will the old SW fans be astonished, but even the new fans will find that one special scene the highlight not only of the movie or this year, but of the last decade.<br/><br/>Giving the highlight of the movie (story, pace, contrasts and ending), some of the weaker points include acting, editing and music. In my opinion, there was a complete miscast of Jones as the lead, and a complete under use of Whitaker and Mikkelsen. Still Mendelsohn was properly used and he did a decent job. The problem was that the characters themselves were not the main focus of the movie so they did not receive that much attention. This is a big flaw to the movie but taking into account that no one really cared about them compared to how much everyone was interested in the story, it is slightly forgivable. So, a stronger female lead should have been used, more focus, especially in the first part of the movie, should have been given to the characters and the result would have been a more emotional response from the audience in the very end (considering it is extremely emotional as is).<br/><br/>As for the editing, the crossing over from one planet to the next, taking the story forward could have been done in a finer manner. It feels a bit rough and unpolished, but not in a way that it destroys the overall impact of the movie.<br/><br/>The music on the other hand, was going over the top. Almost all of the original tunes can be spotted, but non of them were pulled to the end so that they become the original fan favorite tune. Besides that, the real problem is that the movie lacks an original theme. Going out of the cinema, one just cannot whistle an original tune and that sort of strikes the viewer out of balance.<br/><br/>All in all, Rogue one is by far the best movie of the year, it is something true SW fans have been waiting for over 30 years. It feels, looks like, sounds like and plays out just like and original SW movie and that is its main quality. A spectacular story with unprecedented space battles and a superb ending that I would recommend to all SW fans as a must see, and to all non fans as a spectacular war drama.<br/><br/>The Force is really with this movie."

Since acquiring the rights Disney has made two movies in this universe. The Force Awakens was great, but essentially a large budget remake of the original made for the fans. This one, I like more. The first third or so was a little slow but then it picked up to the point of me not wanting it to end. This movie takes place between episode 3 and 4 but is basically episode 3.9. The movie is a live action version of the crawl before A New Hope. The movie ends right where that one begins. The CGI that was used was perfect and allowed you to really be transported back to the original movie. I was a little hesitant at first because this wasn't part of the ""Star Wars Episode Saga"" but after watching this I have to say that this one fits right in perfectly and really adds so much to the original that it made be want to watch that one immediately after seeing this one. Overall, any worries about Disney taking over the franchise have all but vanished after watching this. This is the prequel the world has been waiting for. I give this an A+."

In a way it taught me as a kid about the proverbial fight between good and evil, and how with hope, sacrifice, dedication and faith, good will always triumph over evil.<br/><br/>The best of the lot was The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion. Till I saw Rogue One.<br/><br/>The ending of this movie made me very emotional. I sat there till the credits rolled to end, and felt happy and sad at the same time. And ""Wow"" was my sensation.

"MaximumMadness","8","1","9","21 December 2016"," ""Rogue One""- Though rough around the edges, the first ""Star Wars Story"" wows thanks to its wonderful direction, strong atmosphere and sharp writing.
","After plenty of worry and stress regarding whether or not Disney had what it takes to continue George Lucas' iconic creation, it can now be safely said... with the one-two punch of last year's wonderful revival ""The Force Awakens"" and this year's very strong spin- off release ""Rogue One"", ""Star Wars"" is clearly in the right hands. Though no doubt the fanbase will still have those odd members who think anything made after ""Return of the Jedi"" is sacrilege and will endlessly nit-pick every new film that comes out until the end of time, I do believe most long-time followers of the saga will definitely appreciate and enjoy this film. While it can be rough around the edges and has some issues holding it back from perfection, ""Rogue One"" still stands tall as a more than worthy addition to that ever-growing galaxy far, far away.<br/><br/>The film follows Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), a young woman haunted by the kidnapping of her father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) by the Empire when she was only a child. Having been raised by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), Jyn grew up strong but cold. Now, after being freed from Imperial captivity by the Rebels, Jyn is sent on a mission to track down her long-lost father, as he has working on the Empire's dreaded ""Death Star"" project and may hold key information on the dreaded vessel that could help the rebels to destroy it. She is joined by a diverse cast of outcasts and heroes, including rebel officer Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), blind spiritual warrior Chirrut ÃŽmwe (Donnie Yen) and his friend Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen), Empirial defector Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) and smart-alec droid K-2SO. (Voiced by the wonderful Alan Tudyk of ""Firefly"" fame.)<br/><br/>Directed by Gareth Edwards of ""Monsters"" and ""Godzilla"" fame from a script by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, the film is a very different beast when compared to other entries in the overall saga. Taking its cues more from war movies with an occasional hint of espionage peppered in here and there, it's definitely one of the darkest chapters yet in ""Star Wars."" It has an interesting sense of gritty, grimy realism that I wasn't sure would work for this particular franchise... but I actually think it comes together very well and for the most part feels quite organic. Especially when placed into the proper timeframe, as it is most definitely a prequel film taking place before the original 1977 classic. It's got a great sense of visual direction thanks to Edwards' keen sense of storytelling, and I especially admired the atmosphere of desperation he builds. It's never anything less than thoroughly intense, though he peppers in just enough levity so that it never overwhelms as many other modern films tend to do. I also really think the script is fascinating and consistently clever. My favorite aspect of the writing is that it shows us perhaps for the first time that even our heroic rebels can't always be entirely without flaw and fault, and that some dark choices must be made for the greater good. Really makes you think about the heroes and villains alike, as this shows us that it isn't always quite a black-and-white matter.<br/><br/>I also quite admired the cast, which are all perfect in their roles. Jones makes for a compelling and fascinating lead, and her relationship with her two father figures in Saw and Galen supplies much of the heart of the film. Diego Luna makes for a good supporting lead as a troubled but dashing rebel officer. Supporting roles by the likes of Whitaker and Mikkelsen are very well cast. Ben Mendelsohn is exceptionally good as our slimy lead antagonist, Imperial Director Krennic. But the real standouts are Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk, who routinely steal the show in every scene they're in. They are just wonderful additions to the series and I hope we see a little more of them in the future. It was also a lot of fun hearing James Earle Jones back as the villainous Darth Vader, though his role is quite small in the film. Add to that a very good score courtesy Michael Giacchino, the grand cinematography of Greig Fraser and seamless, top-notch visual effects from Industrial Light & Magic and you just have a wonderful team to bring this story to life both in front of and behind the camera.<br/><br/>That praise being said, the film does have its issues, some of them pretty significant, which is why I have to unfortunately dock a few points. To start, despite the effects being almost entirely true-to-life, there are several characters who are created with digital trickery (including some very fun cameos) that stick out so badly, it takes you out of the film. Also, the film is very much a plot-driven piece, and it sometimes comes at the expense of compelling character development. Jyn really is the only character who goes through any sort-of proper arc, and many of our supporting roles feel flat at times. And finally, I do think the first act is sloppy at times. It can be hard to figure out what's happening, how it all comes together, who each character is and their relations to the others... etc. <br/><br/>Those flaws aside, though, this is still a great bit of dark entertainment and a darned good chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga. Not only is it a compelling and entertaining watch on its own, but it actually does add a lot of weight to the other chapters in the series, and it makes for a near-ideal prequel to the original ""New Hope."" It's shocking how good this side-story is... and how much better it is than the previously released prequel trilogy. Bravo, Disney. Bravo. You've proved that you were the perfect fit for what is perhaps cinema's most cherished franchise.<br/><br/>I give ""Rogue One"" a strong 8 out of 10."
"alindsay-al","9","1","9","16 December 2016"," A fantastic star wars film that brings the war
","I have been the biggest fan of Star wars all my life and I was obviously incredibly excited for rogue one a star wars story and I believe this film definitely delivered. The premise of the film is set between the events of revenge of the sith and a new hope and sees a group of rebels on a mission to steal the death star plans. Felicity Jones plays jyn erso in this film as she is really good in this film. Her character is given the most depth out of anybody and you really get behind her performance and you really want her to succeed. She was a great female protagonist and I feel like she will be a great inspiration for females and a great addition to the star wars universe. Diego Luna is good in this film as the rebel officer in charge of Jones and he is good in this film. His character has a moral ambiguity to him that makes the rebel alliance way more interesting and his character way more interesting in this film. I feel like him and Jones chemistry is good together and you buy their development. Alan tudyk plays k2so the droid in this film and he steals the show in this film with a really humorous display that really works and adds allot of depth to the film. Donnie yen plays a character very heavily linked to the force and he is great in the action scenes and a very fascinating character with his friendship with wen Jiang's character working for the film. Also even though I don't usually like him I thought riz Ahmed was pretty good in this film and added allot to his character. Ben Mendelsohn plays director krennic in this film and he is a bit over the top but fully commits in this film and seems like he is happy to be in a star wars film and is a highly motivated villain. And yes Darth Vader is in this film for about 4 minutes and it is possibly the best 4 minutes in the film but just don't go in thinking he is in the film that much. The story has a real emotional feel to it an you feel the drama of trying to get these plans. The third act of the movie is amazing filled with so many emotional moments and great character depth. However, my main negative for this film is the first 30 minutes, it is very clunky and feels like just fill time to introduce these new characters and takes it time to get going and I just didn't get in to the film that quickly. The script is fantastic with really smart dialogue that mixes humour and drama incredibly well and makes you care about the situation and the characters. The style of this film is brilliant, the scale of the death star and the walkers really comes across in this film more than ever before and this is the best space battles ever put on screen. The ground battles are also incredibly raw and visceral and feels like a war zone more than any other star wars film. Overall this is a fantastic addition to the star wars franchise and definitely worth a watch especially if you are a fan it is a must see."
"ThomasDrufke","7","1","9","15 December 2016"," Rebellions Are Built on Hope
","Is it as good as The Force Awakens or really, any of the original trilogy? No, but it doesn't need to be. Rogue One benefits from its originality, even if it does tie directly into A New Hope.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good and plenty of not so good with Rogue One, but luckily the Star Wars universe is alive and well. And I think there's no question that the non-saga movies are here to stay. I think that's the biggest positive coming out of this film that Lucasfilm/Disney would like to hear; we fans want to see more of these movies. As great as it is to follow the Skywalkers, it's always nice to expand the galaxy with new stories.<br/><br/>This story, told in the opening crawl from A New Hope, is about a team of rag-tag rebels who band together to steal the plans to the infamous Death Star. The team consists of Jyn Erso, Cassian, Chirrut, Baze, Bodhi, and a droid, K-2SO. The majority of the cast does a nice job, particularly Felicity Jones (Erso), adding another strong female lead to Star Wars lore. The entire first act is structured around setting up the team and giving each character their own depth and reasoning for joining the rebellion. <br/><br/>Therein lies one of the main issues with the film, its pacing. It doesn't have the rapid pace of TFA, the plot takes its time, and there are points where that pacing starts to drag. Drag feels like a dirty word when it comes to filmmaking, but I think if the film was cut down 10 minutes or so, the film would have been more even. With that said, we know from reports that the film was restructured a bit after re-shoots and rewrites tweaked the tone. I won't say that its blatantly obvious, but there are certainly a few points in the film that don't seem to work alongside the rest of the story. For example, Forest Whitaker's character, Saw Gerrera? Completely wasted. In fact, his character was distracting and totally unnecessary to the overall plot.<br/><br/>Enough complaining though, let's get into the good stuff. Whether the reworked material was Gareth Edwards doing or not, I think he did a phenomenal job directing this film. You can tell he's a big Star Wars nerd by identifying all of the little cameos and nods to the original films (most of them really work). And the space battles? Wow. Some of the most impressive cinematography and direction I have seen in any sci-fi/fantasy film. The third act is truly remarkable. He makes some bold decisions, narratively. Really, really bold.<br/><br/>As with most Star Wars films, the droids tend to be the scene stealers, and the same can be said for K-2SO. The script itself has some questionably written dialogue, but I have no gripes with anything that came from Alan Tudyk's lovable droid. I also thought Ben Mendelsohn was great as Krennic, the Lieutenant Commander of the Empire. He gets a moment with Vader that is classic Star Wars at its best. He's also not overly cartoonish. He has his motives and his arc fits those motives. Something that was a bit cartoonish, however, is the CGI re- creation of Grand Moff Tarkin. It's not that the CGI was bad, but the amount that he was in it, and the fact that he had scenes next to real people, got more and more distracting as the film went on. However, I don't think the same can be said for the brief Leia re-creation towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is pretty awesome. The third act is relentlessly thrilling, with satisfying scene after satisfying scene. But there are plenty of messy aspects to the film as well. With every great thing, there is a little bad. Of course I love seeing Darth Vader rip through dozens of rebels, but do I think that fit tonally with the rest of the film? Absolutely not. There's a lot to love, but I can't dismiss the film for having no flaws. But without question, it is worth seeing.<br/><br/>+Great team for the most part<br/><br/>+Bold direction<br/><br/>+Updated space battles, cinematography<br/><br/>-CGI re-creation of Tarkin & Whitaker were distracting<br/><br/>-Some things were tonally off<br/><br/>7.8/10"

Well I would say I have a little mixed about them. I didn't like a few, liked the most. This Star Wars movie was dark, had less black and white people in it. There were many races in the movie and I honestly hoped I won't feel some awkward kind of quota on race and gender, where you have to make 50% female characters, one Hispanic, one black, one Asian, one native American, one Russian, blah blah. I saw the movie, and I could forget what skin color I see, and I was more than delighted, it worked well. They really looked like some random rebels with different background. Well made. <br/><br/>Politics. I guess some like it some don't. It showed a more realistic rebellion. I liked it, but I can understand if somebody isn't for it.<br/><br/>Story. I can tell I heard better stories from Star Wars universe, but this one really stands for a movie I think. I didn't have the expectation for like an ultimate plot, but I got a great story about colorful people.<br/><br/>Nostalgia. 100% I thing they now grabbed really what we all liked in old movies.<br/><br/>CGI: FINALLY they used on a right way. I don't want to shoot it, check it out. Okay not perfect everywhere, but it made me smile big time. On the other hand, I am happy to see, they really dropped the idea to make the last chair with CGI. It is good finally.<br/><br/>I can recommend this movie to all Star Wars fans. Check it out, and get a cinema ticket. It worth all cents."

After seeing Rogue One multiple times in theaters and at least as many times at home, it holds up and surpasses every other film. Gareth Edwards has directed a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It took me a few viewings to admit that this was better than each of the original trilogy, including Empire. A lot of reviews complain that there aren't any memorable characters, but if Jyn, Cassian, Krennic, Saw, Chirrut, Baze & K2SO had been introduced and integrated into the franchise like other characters had, they'd be just as memorable. Their flaw is that they were in a one and done film.<br/><br/>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this film includes not only the greatest ground assault, but the greatest space battle, and also the single greatest Darth Vader scene in the franchise. <br/><br/>The original trilogy is amazing and revolutionary. But I think a lot of fans attach that nostalgia to how they rate and rank the films. Rogue One is incredible and it's time we admit it is the best Star Wars film.<br/><br/>Also can we please get Gareth Edwards to direct more films in this universe?"

First there was The Force Awakens, which was fun, if not better than the original trilogy.

New characters and new worlds are featured, and it shows traces of the original trilogy we all know and love. Lots of action, and not Jedi-centered. Star Wars is more than just the Jedi and the Skywalkers. It's about war and conflict, and intergalactic battles. And this movie delivered.<br/><br/>Don't miss it!"

This movie is dark, gritty and full of emotion.

Last years Episode 7 was a return to form and delighted to say that Rogue One is another blast of escapism at it's best.<br/><br/>I thought this was Episode 8 beforehand, but it actually fits between episodes 3 and 4. It fleshes out one of the plot lines that is in the original Star Wars movie. We also get tantalising glimpses of many of the characters. <br/><br/>The main story line concerns Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) who is the daughter of one of the chief architects in the construction of the death star. She is charged with stealing the plans to the death star. Jones is excellent in the lead role and after the feisty Rey in episode 1 it is good to see female characters getting screen time. <br/><br/>The movie has the same sense of fun and adventure as the main Star Wars movies. It doesn't feel like an exercise to make easy money and for that we should be grateful. If you love the Star Wars movies you will love Rogue One."
"anubindtiwari-310-820214","8","1","10","24 December 2016"," One of the best Star Wars Films.
","The movie is made in a very different way from a traditional Star Wars trilogy films, and you will get to know this right from the start. The movie have a fairly simple story, but excel in the story- telling the director have done a great job in directing a Star Wars movie that is different from every other Star Wars movie yet feels so familiar. The movie starts with a young Jyn Erso and the story revolves her throughout the film. However there are a lot of other characters in the movie like Cassian Andor, Chirrut, Baze Malbus, Saw Gurrera, Bodi Rock K-2SO (My fav droid after R2D2), and each and every new character have been given a back story that explains how they ended up in the movie and what were they doing before. The best part is that each character is defined in a very decent manner that all have their own personality and combined with their backstory, this makes each character different form other, which is important when you are telling a story how people from different past and different origins come together to achieve a common goal and plays their part in the mission. Director Gareth Edwards have done a tremendous job in directing the movie; he gave sufficient screen time to all the characters while telling the story that takes place in different place (or planets) and connecting the entire event that took place before and after this movie. However I felt that the pace of the story is bit inconsistent at few moments and becoming slow, but it pick-up quickly and doesn't drag any scene longer than needed. The script is somewhat better than the story as is contain strong dialog, nicely explained characters and interlinked events and good amount of humor (which I was not expecting). All the actors have done nicely portrayed their roles, I loved K-2SO and Chirrut and I felt he was the strongest character in the movie and one of the best characters in the franchise Donnie Yen have done a marvelous job. Cassian Andor is another character I liked, I didn't like Jyn Erso much because I was expecting something else and she was entirely different. Director Krennic is an awesome villain. There are a lot of people you'll see in the film from the original trilogy but most of them either for support or make cameo. Darth Vader as we have seed in the trailers is there in the movie and let me just say it he is rad. (He is at his best in this film). The movie is filed with action be it on surface or in the space. The battle sequences are very well choreographed and the use of special effect and CGI is just incredible (although I don't like CGI very much in Star Wars). The climax and the sense after that are the best part of the film; I was literally jumping on my seat while watching it. Music is not very good in this movie which is disappointing but they did some of the original trilogy's music. CGI have been used extensively in the film. Overall this is one of the best Star Wars films. Do not miss this one and once you watch it you will definitely want to watch it again."

Many films either make the film seem too slow/boring or fast/hasty. Rogue One meets that perfect balance where you have some casual stuff all along, and then a million things happening at the same time with quick scene changes that dictate how fast are events happening.<br/><br/>Considering the fact that Rebels do stir the bee hive, ultimately it feels totally worth it."

This is the first instalment since return of The Jedi that I felt they have got just about everything right. <br/><br/>The mood, the special effects( very little cgi), and most importantly the interactions between the characters were excellent. The characters somehow felt more real like the original a new hope. The sets also felt real and gritty a throwback to a great films such as aliens, blade runner or a new hope. No longer are cgi storm troopers riding cgi Dewbacks or equally unrealistic cgi floating vehicles. Instead there are vehicles that you know will take an actors finger off if he puts it in the tank tracks. <br/><br/>The cgi is virtually unnoticeable and you could be mistaken for thinking the shots were done with traditional cameras techniques and models. There are a couple of bad exceptions but these are quickly forgiven and forgotten once the scene moves on.<br/><br/>The two main actors work very well together and become more likable together as the story goes along. All the actors are very good. There is a feel of the original star wars with the minor roles still given a voice. There is also a real Moments of emotion which comes primarily from the acting but also the very good dialogue and direction. <br/><br/>This film as a whole is not perfect, but the blemishes are so insignificant that to dwell on them would be doing the film a major disservice. <br/><br/>The force is with me I am one with the force again<br/><br/>Review from an 80's child watched in 2d"

There is a feel of familiarity and realism to the settings and it works.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a perfect movie. If you feel inclined there are few dodgy bits that could be pointed out, but they by no means ruin what is a very good sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>If you like Star Wars, Sci-fi or just a good action movie, then go see Rogue One, you won't be disappointed."

When the movie ended, my heart was racing and I felt like I needed to decompress somewhere. There was so much buildup and suspense. It was awesome!<br/><br/>The effects and the CGI were amazing and I will be very surprised if Rogue One doesn't win the Oscar for Best Special Effects. Also, there is a reason this movie has been described as ""Saving Private Ryan in space"". This is very much a war movie with very little down time for the characters (and the audience) to collect themselves before the next action sequence starts. But perhaps, this is exactly what the Star Wars series has needed. However, the new droid K-2SO was a great source of snark and sarcasm which was greatly needed for such a heavy movie. <br/><br/>It was great to see Felicity Jones in a movie like this after having seen her in so many period dramas or lighthearted comedies. She's quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses and I can't wait to see what she does in the future. <br/><br/>One thing I will mention: I highly recommend reading (or at least reading a summary of) the prequel book, Catalyst: A Rogue One Story.

","If there ever was a need to show how the construction plans of the Death Star were retrieved by the rebel forces, than this movie finally satisfied the eagerness of every Star Wars fan.<br/><br/>I, for my part, think that some things should be left for one's own imagination and not every little side note mentioned in the old Episodes needs to get its own movie, it doesn't bring the saga forward, it doesn't tell a really developed story, it's simply an account of the efforts made and the losses suffered at a particular moment during a war in space, so that Rogue One lacks the epic feeling and the ability to give wings to your own imagination.<br/><br/>It has a great battle scene in the end and that's it. I was looking forward to see Darth Vader back in business and got maybe three minutes of his bad-assness. They hired Academy award winner Forest Whitaker to wheeze a bit into the camera and than die. Mads Mikkelsen, whose handsome, masculine features make him perfect for long, moody close-up shots, had a few lines, gazing seriously into the air and than died. There was this cool blind warrior with his cool buddy and they died too. Felicity Jones, whom I adore, played the not so special, kind of outlaw heroine who kind of fell in love with this unknown male hero before they died, Oh and no Star Wars would be recognizable as such without a witty robot character providing some comical relief, only that this one got broken in the end; not exactly what you would describe as an uplifting prelude to A New Hope. And what stayed with me after the curtains closed, was this traumatizing image of a soulless CGI version of young Princess Leia.<br/><br/>Yes, finally we got shown how she gained the plans, they simply were handed to her, surprise, surprise!<br/><br/>Rogue One is a redundant money grabber, a spin-off with some good action scenes carrying the Star Wars brand, yet it at least isn't as corny as the George Lucas movies."
"NYRbrb89","9","1","11","24 December 2016"," The Star Wars movie we've been waiting for, especially if you loved Empire Strikes Back
","Rogue One is a Star Wars movie we can all get excited about, because it finally feels we have a movie worthy of being in the same conversation as the original trilogy, with many similarities from the masterpiece of Empire Strikes Back. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards excellently presents us with a dark, foreboding story of how a group of Rebels struggled and overcame challenges that immediately precede the events of A New Hope. We know where we will ultimately end up, but not how we will get there.<br/><br/>It is a true ""war movie"" at its very core, and has perhaps the most amount of outright war and conflict than any other Star Wars movie to date. Edwards' use of CGI in this respect is very well-received, with some of the greatest space battling I have ever seen in Star Wars (reminiscent of Episodes 3 and 6, but even better!). The ground battles are also fantastically done, set in a variety of breathtaking locations that contrast each other in line with the growing tensions throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Edwards also succeeds with the difficult task of developing an interesting plot in a story where viewers already know how it's going to end. I never found myself bored following along with the story in this manner because he distracts you with the new and unique characters you meet and how each of their individual roles is so important to the overall outcome. <br/><br/>The new characters are fresh and likable. Felicity Jones does a wonderful job playing Jyn Erso despite Episode 7 prominently featuring a new female protagonist. Edwards also cleverly introduces us to a new ""droid"" personality excellently voiced by Alan Tudyk. The role of the droid K-2SO in Rogue One is welcomed and fresh for the series since we've never really seen a true ""battle droid"" who can be so intimidating in combat and so crucial to the overall plot. Tudyk's voicing of K-2SO is also important contributor to the needed comic relief in this otherwise dark and ""serious"" movie. Lastly, Ben Mendelsohn's performance as a cold and calculating antagonist meshes well with the overall tone and mood of this period in the Star Wars timeline. <br/><br/>Rogue One has plenty for old and new fans alike, albeit I will echo what other reviewers have expressed in saying this is probably the least ""kid-friendly"" of the series. There is death, destruction, violence, cruelty and outright murder -- but appropriately so. Older fans who grew up with the original series will recognize some familiar faces who were included in a way that I did not find distracting or feeling ""forced"" just for the sake of being there. Other nods to the original series were almost missed if you were not paying close attention (I say that in a good way!). There are a couple of characters who I will not disclose that are ""CGI-ed"" into the movie and I thought in general they were well done. Some may disagree but that is for you to judge.<br/><br/>The pace of Rogue One also lends itself much more to the originals than the prequels/Episode 7. It isn't in any hurry to jump to the action and I respect that given what was done in Force Awakens. I will admit the very beginning seemed a bit disorganized, with the movie jumping from several different settings within minutes of each other to set up later plot points/characters. This was probably a side effect of editing/deleted scenes but it didn't detract too much. Once over that initial bump, the pace is appropriate to allow you to get to know the slew of new characters and appreciate the growing tensions between Rebels, neutrals, and the Empire that is so important to the plot of the movie. The pace then gradually increases in parallel to those tensions as you approach the climax. Rogue One (unlike any of the prequels or Episode 7) gives you enough time to ""take in"" the breathtaking worlds and settings that are featured without snapping quickly to the main characters. Like the original trilogy, the camera-work helps viewers feel they are immersed in an epic universe and not just jumping across wide swaths of land instantly. Likewise, the camera work prevents you from feeling claustrophobically confined to a tiny room on a space station or building because you're first introduced to the monstrously large facade of the place you are about to enter. <br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is the Star Wars movie we as fans have been waiting for. It is very dark movie, with a lot of death and destruction, but also a beautiful movie with some of the greatest camera work and CGI I have seen in the series. With that, it has some of the greatest space (and ground), but SPACE! battles that will quench your thirst for such action, but still cleverly leaves you wanting more because of how great they were. The acting is well done (especially for Star Wars standards), and the plot is interesting and enjoyable in a setting where the viewers already know the ending. It is a movie deserving of being included in comparisons to and conversations about the original trilogy, and I think that is the most a huge fan could ask for.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10 overall as a Star Wars movie (but probably more like an 8/10 when you compare it to any other movie that isn't Star Wars)."

","First of all, I would tell you that the film has exceeded my expectations by far, but then I would lie: I had none. After last years Episode VII, I wondered if the time would come where the Star Wars Universe would be a little bit more mature, with the spirit of a Episode V. Well, they did. It is by far grittier that you would expect from Disney and the Star Wars cannon. While having some weak spots as a very flicked looking plot, the rather 2-dimentional characters and dialogues, this film succeed where the others failed long time ago: The political aspect. We have it all, Wagner references in the score, brutal images, long-standing scenes of the destruction that represent the whole grim, aesthetic debate about its inner beauty, actual conflict zones drowned into a futuristic scenery,death presented as a stoic element without the whole religious aspect of the force. Overall, a very good movie for Star Wars standards."
"ZeekTheGeek","9","1","12","26 December 2016"," Rogue One puts the War in Star Wars
","The title of the movie didn't grab my attention as I thought it should have. And seeing that the trailer suggested no light-sabre battles was a bit of a let down as well. But being a true Star Wars fan, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and checked it out. And It Blew Me Away! This is probably the first film that showed the actual struggle that the Rebel Alliance were facing while battling the Empire. This film feels more like a war movie, rather than a space adventure saga, which is probably one of the points that may discourage some SW fans. It has a darker tone and intense battle sequences, but I thought it was a different but refreshing take on the saga. As it ties in with Episode IV: A New Hope, one of the main themes is Hope, to hope beyond hope and to never give up. Being one who's watched all the films in the saga, read the comics, stories and literature of the Expanded Universe, and played the games, I really enjoyed Rogue One, <br/><br/>I suggest you watch the film and judge it for yourself!"
"toddinvestor","8","1","12","25 December 2016"," Slight spoiler near end of review with warning: Star Wars is still a saga
","Firstly, if you're not a fan of Star Wars already this episode is not likely to win you over. Otherwise, I think it continues to set the bar of emotional intensity that hopefully upcoming episodes will match. <br/><br/>The visuals remain great: fantastic landscapes while continuing to blend reals sets and locations with CGI so one rarely gets that annoying 'my video game looks better' vibe. The big screen and 3D are once again the venue needed to take it all in. <br/><br/>I think this is significantly different film than ""The Force Awakens"" which I thought was a long overdue fantastic continuation and reboot of the Star Wars series. ""Rogue One"" is grittier, darker and really not family friendly. I could say it is the antithesis of ""The Return Of The Jedi"". Like others have reviewed, I would tend to call it a war drama, one that increases in intensity with war torn looking characters as the movie progresses. Every member of the rebellion is not a clear cut hero for the first time as well. <br/><br/>No spoiler in saying that the plot is retrieving the secret Death Star plans, and Episode IV already revealed of course they were successful. But this is still a standalone film in all other ways, even if an imperfect one. <br/><br/>I personally like characters that are expressive and complex, and for the first part of ""Rogue One"" I felt like I wasn't getting it. By the end I did.<br/><br/>Slight spoiler ahead not in plot but in my opinion why the character portrayal made perfect sense towards the end of the movie. As one learns more about the variety of 'protagonists', it becomes evident that every main person in the crew including the lead is traumatized. My understanding of traumatic response is one can lose their emotional affect and not have the normal range of highs and lows. These seem like real rebels: disturbed by their pasts, steadfast to their cause and resigned to their fate. If you never really hated The Empire and Darth Vader before, you likely will after this films ends. <br/><br/>For the first time in a long time, I will be going into future Star Wars episodes with high expectations of a poignant, complex and visually stunning journey into a galaxy far far away. Hard to imagine how they can keep it all going. If they do it should be amazing. Just no more Death Stars please."
"DoctorBuster","5","1","13","26 December 2016"," Like the super weapon of the film, it's flawed, yet entertaining
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is my most anticipated movie of the year and did it exceed all of my expectations? No, not really. Don't get me wrong, it's still an entertaining film, but it didn't quite felt like a Star Wars film. From the opening, it felt not right. We didn't get the iconic opening scroll as we have gotten with every other Star Wars film. But since this is a stand alone film, I can sort of understand why they did it, but what is a Star Wars film without it's iconic opening scroll?<br/><br/>The rest of the film is kind of a mixed bag of positive and negative things. I'll go on with the positives first. First of, this film looks gorgeous. This might be the best looking Star Wars film yet. I'm generally not a fan of the overuse of CGI, but CGI is near perfection. So that's already a big plus. The action sequences are phenomenal and shot outstandingly. With the two greatest action scenes been the fight between Donnie Yen's character and the group of Stormtroopers, and the final massacre of the Rebelions by Darth Vader. <br/><br/>By that I go straight into my favorite segment of this film, with that been Darth Vader. Vader in this film is purely a badass and the most sinister villain ever created for the big screen. Vader is beyond perfection in this film, so I of course wish we got to see more of him. Another great character in this film that was brought into this film with motion capture, is Grand Moff Tarkin. Originally played by Peter Cushing and brought back to live with motion capture. Unlike Vader, I wish a bit less of Tarkin. Don't get me wrong, I love the character, but after a while, you start to notice that it's a cgi face and not a real human being. <br/><br/>The films biggest flaw is its pacing. Although I found to be every scene interesting and fun to look at, the film felt utterly long. It made me wanna look at my watch for a brief second, but I luckily resisted. The characters also weren't as fleshed out as I wanted them to be. Some characters felt as if they had more story to them, but maybe with the re edits and re shootings, some of the scenes got cut. Therefore making place for other scenes.<br/><br/>So Star Wars: Rogue One is an entertaining film, filled with great scenes stretched throughout the film, but the final product isn't that overwhelming. It's still worth seeing in cinemas if you must, but I'd recommend waiting for it to come out on Blu ray or DVD."

"jdesando","Null","1","24","26 December 2016"," Some of the original's playfulness and plenty of Felicity Jones!
","""We have hope. Rebellions are built on hope!"" Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones)<br/><br/>Rebellion and hope. So goes the theme of the entertaining first Star Wars anthology story (not about Luke Skywalker and his immediate family), Rogue One. Jyn and Cassian (Diego Luna) are the swashbuckling leads, determined to lead a rebellion against The Empire. Hey, it's before the 1977 depiction, so all you need to grab is the fighting-mad vibe and wait for the grand entrance of Darth Vader and the impressive redo of the deceased Peter Cushing.<br/><br/>Is it as good as the original? No. Is it better than most of the sequels/prequels? Yes. Although it lacks the vibrant mischief and jokey immaturity of the original, Director Gareth Edwards has the sacrifice and determination against domination down pat.<br/><br/>Like Princess Leia, Jyn carries the feminist torch with a grace and petulance that makes you care. Cassian less so as he makes sure the voyages are successful and Jyn reconciles with her dad, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), whose employment by the bad guys makes him suspect.<br/><br/>The adventure serves, also, to answer nagging geek questions such as why the Death Star could so easily be breached. No further details from me because this is a fantasy adventure that thrives on surprises.<br/><br/>Sufficed to say, Rogue is a story of good people fighting the good fight against the powerful forces of evil that seek to trod down the already downtrodden. The Empire could just as easily be the Syrian government, an African repressive nation, Russia, North Korea, or any despotic leader who fools his people to believe he really cares about them.<br/><br/>The common denominator is the rebels, who always seem poor in belongings and arms, but whose will is selflessly focused on freedom with the accompanying ultimate sacrifice frequently exacted. Star Wars hit the right notes in the 20th century at a time when Viet Nam had spent our outrage so that anger was in danger of being dissipated by a surfeit of questionable wars.<br/><br/>While Rogue suffers from lack of the lighthearted carelessness of Harrison Ford and the charming dorkiness of Carrie Fisher, leave it to this franchise to keep us focused on the sacrifices we must make and the hope we must nurture to be a society of equals.

"The_Celluloid_Sage","9","0","2","6 April 2020"," Cracking spin-off that hits all the right notes
","In a galaxy, far far away.....I was slightly disappointed to not hear the usual rousing Star Wars music at the beginning. Then I thought to myself, this is not strictly a Star Wars film, but a standalone spin-off. I accepted the loss of the music shortly afterwards, but upon reflection now, I think it was missed opportunity. Every time that music starts when you're at the big screen, it makes the hairs on the back of your neck raise. Mistake not including it there I think. Staying with the music, the old familiar scores are there, but many are slightly different, changed. I personally would have kept with Williams' perfect orchestral scores in their original format, but I guess over time things slowly adapt. None of this is to say the score is bad because it is not. The score is fantastic and those familiar sounds are heard in all the right places.<br/><br/>Anyway, Rogue One is the story of the rebels who steal the plans to the death star. This is what happens immediately before Episode IV: A New Hope. Where A New Hope starts off Rogue One ends. For once I'm not going to give any details anyway or review the start of the film as I often do. If you want to know the rebels story then go and watch it. The script is above average for this kind of film and Disney do seem to have made a good effort of getting this one right. If you were less than impressed with A Force Awakens then this title will surely keep you happy. I thought this was a more like a cross between A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. The story is interesting and reasonably well told. I managed to keep myself spoiler free for this so was pleasantly surprised with what I watched. Any fan of the franchise (and certainly fans of the original trilogy) kind of know the back-story to the rebels obtaining the plans, but it is enjoyable to actually see that story and their sacrifice.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is pretty good, but let us be honest here, with the odd exception the Star Wars films in general have not been known or their Oscar worthy performances. Rogue One is no different really from any of the other films. Everyone plays their part reasonably, even the relative newcomers. The 'returning' characters (especially one in particular) are a joy to behold (in this reviewers opinion) and certainly heightened my enjoyment of the film. There has been some backlash from some of the CGI use but it never felt out of place to me though at times it's not quite perfect. As for the rest of the effects they are top notch indeed. This is a fantasy science-fiction film. It is Star Wars. The CGI and effects are strong in this one. But it is all done for the most part brilliantly. It truly is a big screen spectacle as any film in this franchise should be.<br/><br/>The cast is also a high point for Rogue One. While there are many unfamiliar faces, there are also many many returning faces from not just the prequels but also the original trilogy. This certainly was nice to see and gave us old fans something to smile about. If you have been following our Facebook page then you should know I was excited to see Donnie Yen and he does not disappoint. His solo scene is well done (and was probably expected from his fans) and I enjoyed his screen time though I wish he had more of it, or perhaps a more important role. Wen Jiang (who I am also a fan of) is also great as Yen's side-kick. As usual for Star Wars of late, the comedic relief comes in the form of the droids and Rogue One is no exception. K-2SO is a great character who is dry, witty and sentimental. Felicity Jones does a reasonable job as the lead and it's also good to see Mads Mikkelsen on the screen. Pity his screen time is very short though.<br/><br/>There are some continuity issues and the ending leaves some unanswered questions regarding the start of A New Hope, but hopefully these will be cleared up with a longer version release. The directing is more than adequate and the cinematography, set design and locations are all fantastic. The film does suffer from some slightly dragged out scenes at times but these are usually quickly followed by frantic action sequences. And those sequences come think and fast. With Rogue One Disney have truly captured that Star Wars feeling with a grand entry in the space opera saga. Many people, myself included were wary of Disney acquiring the rights to Star Wars and perhaps feared which direction they may take the franchise. After A Force Awakens I was personally still on the fence, but I knew what to expect with that particular film. Rogue One has definitely dispelled any reservations I still had. I'm actually glad Lucas sold it as in my own humble opinion he was starting to ruin the franchise. Disney's plans for the franchise are certainly ambitious (as you would expect given the price paid, they will want a substantial return on that investment).<br/><br/>Overall Rogue One is a very solid entry into the Star Wars universe and certainly the best film of the newer titles. The Empire Strikes Back will always be perhaps the best film, with A New Hope perhaps being the mostly fondly remembered, but Rogue One sits firmly alongside those two classic titles. Not as good as Empire for sure, but a very worthy addition to the saga and one that should surely please all but the purist of fans.<br/><br/>

"deloudelouvain","7","0","1","5 April 2020"," From the five I watched thus far this one was the weaker one, still good though.
","I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, it's now time for Rogue One. I read some reviewers stating this was one of the best one but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. It's still good enough for me though, just found the story confusing sometimes. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. The CGI's are better than in the earlier movies, what makes perfect sense as the technology is just better now. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the fifth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one tonight will be A New Hope in the hope the quality stays the same, looking forward to it."

It also answered the age-old question about why a flaw would exist in the original Death Star, something that was the object of more than a few on-stage jokes. Well, the joke is explained in a realistic and intriguing way.<br/><br/>If all of the Star Wars movies could reach this level of overall value, there would likely be no ongoing fan conflict.

","Rogue One may be my favourite Star Wars movie. It's smart, funny, dark, gritty, exciting and tragic all at the same time.<br/><br/>The designs in it are awesome, and Jyn Erso is an instant hit as the film's lead. Cassian and K2 provide the perfect back up for her, Cassian used to inject a little darkness into the light of the Rebellion and K2 bringing the humour. The rest of the team are fun but inevitably less mmorable given there's only one film to get to know them. Where the film really shines though is its villains. Ben Mendehlsson portrays their nemesis Director Krennic, and is one of the best Star Wars villains we've had - the perfect mix of villainy and humanity. The ghost of Peter Cushing stands behind him with the CGI reconstruction of Grand Moff Tarkin - a very impressive feat and perfect return for the original imperial officer. Perhaps its greatest accomplishment though is Darth Vader - swaggering back onto the big screen, more dangerous than ever, and stealing the film with only a couple of short scenes. That last scene though is the one that has had everyone talking ever since.<br/><br/>The film gives us a chance to see the darker reality of the conflict between Rebels and Imperials, showcasing the futility of Rebellion and the power of hope side by side. It feels real in a way perhaps no other Star Wars film does. Bravely, it doesn't shy away from the inevitability of its ending, embracing it in a powerful show of a true last ditch attempt and one of the most moving battles in sci fi cinema.<br/><br/>Freed from the constraints of the Skywalker saga, Rogue One feels free-er to do its own thing and stand on its own two feet, but its close proximity to the main series is its strength, feeling relevant in a way Solo didn't and far more powerful.<br/><br/>It might be a little long, slowing down a bit in the middle, and the darker nature of the film might not be to every Star Wars fan's taste but for me: Rogue One stands out above the rest at the top of my most-likely-to-rewatch list."

Disney, pay attention: This is how it should be done.<br/><br/>The film is not without flaws - the obvious problems are the couple of prominent CGI characters. The CGI on these two is noticeably uncanny. The second of these characters in particular is so jarring in appearance as to really throw you out of the moment. But it's a passing moment towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Immense respect to Gareth Edwards and the writers for crafting a coherent story in the Star Wars Universe, without falling back on the over-done Star Wars cliches, but still somehow keeping very true to the spirit and feel of the saga.<br/><br/>Highlights for me:
<ul><li>The final battle; very well shot, genuinely thrilling; brings some menace and exhilaration back to classic Star Wars designs and characters.</li><li>The droid - a genuinely original take on the faithful droid sidekick.</li><li>The main characters - what a pleasure to see heroic characters written with some actual nuance.</li></ul><br/><br/>Thanks Mr Edwards and co.

It doesnt lean on the popularity of the franchise to succeed. There are no Jedi, no lightsabre battles and none of the original characters (apart from some cameo's but they dont influence the story).<br/><br/>This is how the intellectual property should be treated. Just make a good movie and use the rich lore of the Star Wars world as a context, not as a main focus.

"georgenlee-61866","5","0","6","15 October 2019"," A refreshing prequel though not the best Star Wars movie, but better than the failed sequel The Force Awakens
","I watched this movie when it came out and it was at least mediocre when it came to Star Wars movies, though let's get things straight.<br/><br/>First of all, everyone was calm and it wasn't hyped like the Justin Bieber concert known as Ep VII - The Force Awakens that left everyone on Earth and even the natural animals erupting like crazy into thunderous applause.
Yet there was no screaming anywhere or even at the end with this movie.<br/><br/>It's better than The Force Awakens, because that was a rehash of the original trilogy.
Now people did say this was really dark for a Star Wars movie, and it was definitely darker than most, but NOTHING like the Force Awakens or even Ep IV - A New Hope (where Alderaan and everyone on it got destroyed), as the 1st Order destroyed the planets with the Starkiller Base killing all the inhabitants.
The Death Star in this was at minimal power and the results were just localized areas being annihilated, like cities and towns.
Yet good characters died in this, but they were NOWHERE near as important as Han Solo, who was killed off by his son Kylo Ren in TFA, traumatizing me and many others.<br/><br/>In fact that's the biggest problem with this movie.
All the good characters were killed in this, and that's become an unintended thing in the movie.
Plus there was blood in this multiple times (more times than on Ep III - Revenge of the Sith that's for sure).<br/><br/>Yet the 2nd biggest problem was that there were no lightsaber duels, which are a staple in the Star Wars franchise, and if Rogue One had those, it'd be more popular and get better ratings.<br/><br/>Another problem was that it failed to warn guests about the filming technique because the camera work was shaky for the majority and looked more like a vlog on the set of Star Wars than a typical movie.
Something that doesn't usually happen in the majority or entirety of a Star Wars movie.
I know it was supposed to be a gritty war movie, so that it would look like live footage of a war, but just think about it.
Imagine watching a 2 hour 13 minute YouTube video/vlog from one of your favorite vloggers who teleported to the Star Wars Galaxy vlogging his/her experience on the planet Scarif or Jeddah.
Yet some people are prone to dizziness and motion sickness, so there should've been warnings about that at the entrance and on tickets.<br/><br/>The plot focused on the fact that it took place somewhere between Star Wars Rebels & A New Hope (both after Revenge of the Sith), though near the end, the good guys were trying to save a town and facility on it, before the Death Star came and fired its laser (again at minimal power) on the target, killing off the last good characters in the movie.
Though ironic how the ships near the end moved like bath toys in a tub.<br/><br/>Though in the end it felt it was gonna continue leading to the beginning of A New Hope, though it was still different scenery (and Leia was clear in this and nailed her CGI well).<br/><br/>Overall it was a MUCH better movie than the Flop Awakens and certainly had great visuals and was a great idea that they decided to make a movie between Star Wars Rebels and A New Hope in the timeline."
"ericnelson-01809","5","0","6","15 October 2019"," A good prequel for Star Wars though not up to Original Trilogy standards
","When Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens was released, everyone went crazy and in many theaters around the world went into thunderous applause.
This didn't do any of that when started.<br/><br/>When it continued, there was no Star Wars theme song as it's obvious John Williams wasn't composing the scores for this movie.<br/><br/>Now for the real thing, the plot and story was a potential for being great as it was hoped to be the best Star wars movie since the Original Trilogy movies.
However all the good characters died.
That's in fact the biggest problem with this movie.<br/><br/>The bad guys won in this movie and it was too much and hard to watch all good go away like that.
I mean near the end of the movie, it seemed good was gonna happen, but then it was blasted away by the Death Star.<br/><br/>The Death Star in this also used only minimal power, therefore only able to destroy local areas like cities.<br/><br/>Now the other parts were pretty good and the visuals were stunning, yet it felt realistic and it was very vivid and detailed.
Yet there was a new perspective on the Death Star, though unfortunately it and many other objects were CGI, proving the downfall of traditional work, which is really hard and artistic.<br/><br/>There was lots of violence, MUCH more than your usual Star Wars movie and beat Revenge of the Sith in that matter though NOTHING like The Force Awakens even though they said this would be really dark, though it was PG-13.<br/><br/>Yet the camera work was unlike anything ever made in a Star Wars movie before it.
It looks like it was filmed Hunger Games style (I know I'm saying that as those were released around that time) and therefore it was that way for the most of the movie.
Therefore this movie failed to add warnings of motion sickness because you know some people get sick.<br/><br/>The ending felt like it would be the beginning of A New Hope, and after all this was a prequel to it.
Though Princess Leia (from Carrie Fisher which btw R.I.P.) was entirely CGI and so was Grand Moff Tarkin.
I know this was made 39 years after A New Hope but this was just insane.<br/><br/>This movie had good and bad moments, and I would've given it 8 stars if it weren't for all the good characters being killed."

"JamesRutland","1","0","6","7 October 2018"," the best on this movie is Darth Vader
","This movie wants to appear plausible but in vain.
Problems are the structure of the movie in general, and the usual succession of events too fast to make the characters reliable, furthermore there are too much apparent stupid choices, such as:
1) the imperial pilot traitor has long hair and beard;
2) the protagonist becomes the lead of resistance since the second meeting of rebellion;
3) the imperial regime could finish the Death Star but needs the help of a rebel scientist who makes the death star faulty. It's obvious;
4) the appearance of the rebel soldiers infiltrated is not plausible (they appear as rebels): ""cutting both beard and the hair so to appear as an imperial soldier"". As I said too fast events to make the movie plausible.
5) the movie is too much linked to the past narrative structure to be original - the viewer recognize this weakness so to be annoyed from it.
Another big flaw regards the possibility to introduce the original deleted scenes during the capture of the rebel cargo by the Imperial star destroyer when Luke observes the light in the sky of the fight as well as the dialogue between Luke and Biggs (you can see it on youtube) which would have enhanced the past events matching well between the Rogue One and A New Hope episodes in a wonder way.
I save only the final battle in the space although the absurd believer-fighter of rebellion who is not shot by imperial soldiers just because he repeats a stupid litany.
These reasons make both the storytelling and the directing mediocre as well, persuading me that by now Star Wars franchise is able only to give nausea to an illusory hope."

","This is a pointless, poorly written and acted cash-in, that wrecks several points of series continuity for no discernable purpose while adding nothing of value to the canon.<br/><br/>Godzilla (2016) director Gareth Edwards has another visually well crafted but otherwise empty action spinoff to add to his short CV; concerned with telling the story of the rebel spy faction that stole the plans of the first Death Star, mentioned in passing in A New Hope (1977), Rogue One is a sloppily contrived fan film peopled by two-dimensional (in some cases literally, with both Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher represented by doll-eyed CGI clones) characters and a tired storyline, the conclusion of which can surprise no-one who has viewed any of the original episodes.<br/><br/>Felicity Jones makes little impression in the lead, her permanent expression of sulky insouciance failing to endear, while Diego Luna is possibly the wettest leading man since Patrick Duffy. The supporting cast, including Donnie Yen as an amateur Jedi and Alan Tudyuk as a sarcastic droid fair a little better, but are given distressingly little room to develop.<br/><br/>Pace, narrative focus and dialogue are all of highly variable quality, and the shrill, hand-me-down score can never reach the evocative heights of John Williams' venerable theme music. FX (CGI Leia and Moff Tarkin aside) and visual compositions are predictably impressive, but without an emotional centre to the story it becomes hard to care, and with the outcome already known it's ultimately a wearisome affair, made worse by some egregious plotting that bungles the attempt to link with the original trilogy.<br/><br/>At least we are spared any embarrassing histrionics from Darth Vader, ala Revenge of the Sith (2005), but it's small consolation in a totally misconceived and gratuitous exercise in cinematic fan-fiction, that adds nothing and only further degrades the canon while trying to enlarge it."

","A grittier, darker, more adult treatment of Star Wars. For once, a Star Wars prequel takes full advantage of its chronology and the lore of the series, by fully taking advantage of the many opportunities to connect and tie itself into that herritage. The ending alone, warrants high praise. The action is also much more intense and mature. The feel is closer to a war movie (which the story really demands) as opposed to mere action-adventure. The tragic sacrifice of the plot marks the series finally taking full ownership and responsibility for the full scope and consequences of the subject matter used to form this now-classic story.

"gigitville","3","0","3","26 February 2018"," Sigh
","I was never all that excited for this movie, in all honesty. Upon first seeing the trailers, the main character reminded me of the ""badass"" characters I tried to write in middle school. The time it's set in (literally right before Episode Four) appealed to me, but that was about it. And working at Galaxy, the trailers got old. So, when it came out, I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't angry, I was just passive towards it. Once it came out, some of my coworkers said it was actually great so I had slightly higher hopes. And then I saw it. There were many more negatives than positives, and it kind of sucks. It's a Star Wars movie, I wanted it to be good. 
Throughout the movie but especially in the beginning, the pacing and tone was really scattered and unclear. It introduced all these characters, and never let you get to know them. I barely knew anything about any of the characters except their occupation and a bland view of their personality type. This also made me not care about the characters or events until the end of the movie. Like with Jyn, yeah okay she's a rebel but why? Is it because of her father? Was she angry that her father was working with the empire? Was she just pissed she was on her own? It didn't even show us her committing some crime like stealing food and giving some to a starving kid, then getting arrested. Since they (I think) were going for a ""rogue with a heart of silver"" archetype, this would've given us some insight into her character. Or maybe, once she's been arrested, have her trying to charm or fight her way out of it to show us what kind of person she is. But no, we just get her roots, then her in a cell, then going to a work camp. Why was she going to the camp anyway? We don't even know what she did to get arrested until she's at the rebel base.
Forest Whitaker's character was completely unnecessary. It felt really shoehorned and flat. And once Jyn is with the rebels, they suddenly trust each other? And care about each other? Why, why I ask you?? There was no characterization like at all, so I didn't believe the character's relationships. A lot of it didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie; adventurous, fun, emotional. I'm not saying it had to have the exact same formula, but it could've fit in a bit more with the rest of the Star Wars movies. It was different, which is good in theory, but it was different in an off-center way. Like it almost hit a homerun, but just missed in an unclear way. The whole thing didn't feel like a beginning, which it is because it essentially sparks the rest of the movies going right into New Hope. But it didn't feel like a beginning, it didn't even feel like it was passing the torch, it felt like an end. Which is this case, it felt like a stand-alone movie that was made after the originals, which it was, but it should've been an unspoken thing where it should've been made in a way that if someone were to watch the Star Wars movies chronologically, it would flow well.
However, the positives. I like that the end glided right into the beginning of New Hope. It felt nostalgic and gave a nice handshake to the originals. Despite the horrible CGI Carrie Fischer. But I digress. It sounds surprising, but I actually liked that everyone died in the end because it was refreshing and realistic, since it's a rebellion and not everyone would always survive. I also like that none of the main characters were a Skywalker or a Jedi. Same with the fact that they have a rebel character that's not totally good and pure, and they have an Empire character that wasn't totally evil. I also loved the lightsaber scene with Darth Vader. The robot K-2SO was also amazing, and surprisingly the character with the most heart."

","It has a dark mood compare to other star wars films, but with all the elements that a star wars fan wants to see on a movie. The main characters are more realistic than the ones we usually see, not mighty jedis nor terrifying siths, but normal people living in a galaxy far, far away; not perfect heros, but people that make mistakes but at the end try to do the things right. We also have the dark side of the Rebellion, we see people trying to do it right but making some choices that aren't the best for all. It humanizes the idealistic Rebellion. One thing that I really liked about the movie is the continuity it has with the whole Star Wars saga, it perfectly fits before Episode IV: A New Hope. Even more, there are a lot of eastern eggs from the original trilogy and some series that Disney have been releasing. The special effects are awesome and the music just perfect for the movie. We also got to see some commedy that doesn't seem forced, but natural and relaxing. In the other hand, we have all kind of fights (except the ones with lightsabers) that are really well-film-scences. This movie is a piece of art that every star wars fan will love and non-fan will appreciate. YOU MUST WATCH IT!"

","Ever since George Lucas created the first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, millions of people have fallen in love with the classic good vs. evil dynamic that has been very straightforward from the beginning. Rogue One has finally broken the cut-and-dry mold that has been, in my opinion, the downfall of every Star Wars movie. While this is arguably the best Star Wars movie to date it is also painfully similar, almost to the point of redundancy, to every film prior to it. From the harsh background of the main characters, the seemingly all-powerful villain, to the fact that R2-D2 and C-3PO make a guest appearance; watching this movie felt like I was rehashing all of the Star Wars movies that I grew up loving. There were many redeeming qualities however, the graphics and special effects used to make the alien planets won me over. Comparing the Empire to the current administration in the United States and the Rebellion to all those opposed to the current administration, I feel like the choice of planets was impeccable. Many of the places the rebels were camping out were barren planets with very harsh conditions to live, with Jedha being incredibly overpopulated and crowded. On the contrary the planet commanded by the Empire, Scarif, is beautiful, tropical, and pristine. With this being a Star Wars movie I was slightly disappointed with the lack of lightsaber scenes; however, the one that was added topped the cake in terms of Vader's fight scenes. Again, I contribute this to the advancements in special effects and CGI. The themes of sacrifice, faith in the greater good, and disobedience made this film more than the typical Star Wars movie every one was expecting, and was key in making it so successful. I feel like having a more realistic ending, ie: killing all of the main characters, transformed this movie from the feel-good campy Star Wars movie everyone knows and expects into a brand new war film with a lot to offer."

"andrewmdeakins","10","0","2","28 January 2018"," A dark but brilliant side tale to the star wars story (spoliers)
","I am puzzled by the negative comments to Rogue One as a lot of people rate ESB as the pinnacle of star wars movies and i'm guessing the whole reason for this is it's all about the plot, the end being of course a real WTF moment. Whilst i still think ESB still holds the ace card for being the best in the whole series, i think Rogue One is a close second.<br/><br/>Again, the reason for this is plot. I loved Rogue one for being gritty and there is a real sense of desperation in this movie (people being murdered for knowing too much and orders to kill, also loved the flashback to jin as a child and her father associating with director krennic). The rebels are on the back foot with the empire creating the ultimate machine to inflict terror on anyone who gets in their way. And this is another great point, we see the true terrifying power of the deathstar and its ability to obliterate anything in its path.<br/><br/>I have also read comments about there not being enough of the jedi, and I would ask people to look at the end of the first 3 movies (ok, they're not great) but the jedi were almost wiped out and so are hasbeens of a cult long forgotten with only a smattering of believers still left. Again, adding to the desperation of the rebellion.<br/><br/>There are moments which are a little annoying, it's a little erratic at times jumping around a little too much. but it is trying to tell a true story of self sacrifice.<br/><br/>As for the finale, the beach scene, i personally think it will be remembered as one of the best scenes in a star wars movie. It is truly beautiful and i don't think even Crait in the last jedi comes close to the magnificence of scarif.<br/><br/>Coupled with some light humour from K-2SO, a reprogrammed imperial droid who is a lovable and brilliant.<br/><br/>I also read that people are commenting on the lack of character build up, but in truth this is a one off story there isn't time for complex character build up. You have to appreciate the sacrifice that the characters made in order to get the plans away and i think it does this amazingly well.<br/><br/>As for the darth vader scene at the end, i don't think i have ever seen a darth vader more menacing, brutal and brilliant. If there was ever a scene that conveyed this mans anger, power and general hatred, this is it and its given to us in spades.<br/><br/>Its not without its failings, but I will forgive some of the minor flaws in the storybut all in all i loved it. In terms of the force awakens, i just found it a rehash of the original movies. i'm sorry, I wanted to like them, but I didn't find anything original in them at all.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion and im sure that I will be flamed, but Rogue one was brilliant."
"nhammond17","9","0","1","28 January 2018"," Loved It
","Recently I just viewed the film ,""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"", for class and I loved it. The main reason as to why I loved this film was majorly due to the way the story started out with the suspense and underlying tones. It all starts out with Jyn running away from the stormtroopers in order to save herself. However when she does start running, she turns around and tries to come back for her family but when she does, she witnesses her mom dying. This was most likely put in the film to show that Jyn remembers when her mom died, which is unique because it sets up the suspense. 
 Also when we first meet Cassian Andor, he kills the man he is talking to without any note of pain. This is almost like he doesn't care about this man, or he is used to killing people. The reason I feel for this is simply the facial expression he makes. He doesn't show the audience any kind of hurt when he kills the man in point blank range, in order to flee from being captured. 
 Another major thing I love about this movie is the CGI technology they use to bring back characters that have already passed away. Grand Moffe Tarkin is one character they brought back since he passed away but they used CGI to represent a younger Princess Leia. I honestly feel they did this to make the feeling of the film, that much more real. By doing this, it can make the audience more comfortable and relatable to this film. 
 However, there is one thing about this film I do not like at all. The ending is not my favorite. I'm not a big fan on how everyone at the end of the film dies while saving the plans. This frustrates me because the hero aspect of the film is destroyed. Normally in films the hero survives and there is more content on them but with this one, all of the heroes die, making it so there can't be anymore films based around them."
"shoppingtime-34409","6","0","1","25 January 2018"," Different, but not Necesarilly Bad
","Rogue One: A Starwars Story takes a largely different approach to the fantasy-like feel of past Starwars movies. Where the focus of earlier films was on the politics, jedi, and the force, this film follows a more realistic and war-like scene of the battle to retrieve the death star plans, as ships crash while trying to escape, and heroes commit controversial acts. On my first viewing of this movie, I was nearly thoroughly unimpressed. I say 'nearly' as K2SO did make me laugh. I found myself sitting down expecting to see lightsaber duels and chaotic masses of clones or storm troopers waging battle. I was then very disappointed when I found cinematic scenes that immediately took away the natural feel of a Starwars movie, poor character development, and practically no lightsabers! I did however, come back to watch it a second time, this time with a better idea of what I was getting into. This time I viewed it more as a war movie. What I mean by this is that the movie has a beach storming scene, and quiet reflective scenes, scenes exemplifying un-heroic deaths, and casualties galore. I came to like it on the second viewing as I accepted the more realistic take and came to feel the earlier movies were too fantastical, with one on one duels, and ship lifting with the force, etc. I do believe this story has flaws in how it fails to explain certain scenes and instances, however, also believe it did fairly well to describe the struggle of ordinary people in the fight for the galaxy. Instead of focusing on the Jedi, consulars, and emperor, this story focuses on people without grand talents, mainly people with simple blasters, ex-convicts, and even a blind guy with a stick. Overall, I believe the film was refreshingly different, even if the plot followed a very similar trend with daddy issues and the death star. It focused on a more realistic viewpoint of the galactic war, and on more realistic characters, characters that may not be wholly heroic for once."

","I must say going into this film I had very low expectations, I was sceptical of Gareth Edwards, I wasnt a big fan of Godzilla, and didn't really see this as a story that I needed to see, the whole plot of the film was explained in one line in A New Hope. <br/><br/>But I have to say I came out of the film happy with the end product. Visually it was stunning and looked like a war film. While the plot wasn't amazing I enjoyed the new characters, with Donnie Yen's character standing out in particular, and really liked the new villains. <br/><br/>I loved all of the references to the original trilogy, with the nod to Obi-Wan being a highlight. Sidenote both the Ewan McGregor and Alec Guinness versions of the character are my two favourites in Star Wars.<br/><br/>And finally, the ending Darth Vader scene is easily one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a Star Wars film."

","Only suitable for small children and the gullible - this isn't a criticism. YIKES the hero is about to be killed, WOW he's been saved at the last second (repeat ad nauseam). There is a decent squid monster and a few nice touches. The white male villain puts in a solid performance. The geophysics of the exploding planet is very poorly thought out. BUT the kicker was at the end. The baddies know the plans to Death Star have been stolen and that the plucky rebels are on their way to the top of the transmission tower to send them - the main villain even watches them climbing up the tower with the plans. Now you don't have to be a tactical genius to realise that one simply has to destroy the big radar dish on top of the tower to completely scupper the rebels. Instead they try hunting them down inside the tower, blast these small moving targets as they run around the perimeter, confront them in hand-to-hand combat. ANYTHING but destroy the huge radar dish that will enable the rebels to transmit the plans. The Imperium is doomed."

I had been made clear even before the film was released that it was the run-up to episode IV, and would end with Leia being captured on the Rebellion ship with the Death Star plans.
So going into this I knew how it would end, none of these characters have anything to do with the rest of Star Wars, so they'll either all die before the end or just fade into obscurity and so who cares.<br/><br/>Also the CGI Tarkin and Leia looked very plastic, and after the CGI Schwarzenneger in the new Terminator film I know it can be better.
Strangely they also towered over everyone else, regardless of how the original actors had looked.<br/><br/>I understand fans of the comicbooks etc will like it as they see comicbook characters on the big screen, but why not have done a sensible thing by going further back in time and making this a trilogy?

You might even feel a bit disappointed. <br/><br/>And can we talk about ""Uncanny Valley Tarkin""? They used CGI to reproduce the late, great Peter Cushing from the first Star Wars movie, and he just looks creepy. (They also do a similar effect at the end with Carrie Fisher, which is equally creepy and not just because she died around the time this film was released.) <br/><br/>So a character we don't care about gets involved in a plot to steal the Death Star plans, and the heck with continuity from the original Trilogy. Except the Death Star is already flying around blowing stuff up. <br/><br/>Also, they make this movie a lot grittier and more violent, and yes, all the characters die at the end, even the ones introduced to make the movie more popular in China. Heck, I'm taking off another star for that one. <br/><br/>Now, because Disney sees these movies as a way to rake in cash, we are going to get these ""Stand Alone"" stories between chapters of the new trilogy for years, I guess.

","The movie has had something new for a Star Wars, but still these unremarkable touch. I loved this film so much, because it shows the gross and raw side of the Star Wars Universe, combined with the old settings and some characters, that this is Star Wars.

"mb1456","8","0","5","25 October 2017"," Rogue One - Not Just Visually Grand But Has Heart Too
","I don't think any Star Wars movies I've seen(at least those released since 1999) thrilled me the way Rogue One did - it has all the characters (humans, droids, aliens from different planets) and all those space ships, weapons or mammoth space stations like the earlier releases that fascinates one about Star Wars but also, the effects and the dark tone really captured my imagination.<br/><br/>And I don't mean dark tone in a negative way. To see many of the major Alliance characters fight bravely and die in their war against the Empire only made the story of Rogue One more believable and likable for me. Of course there were moments that didn't make sense or fails to convince but that didn't matter, it was an enjoyable watch from start to end. It was also good to see many popular stars among the cast like Mads Mikkelsen, Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen or Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn as the ambitious, military director Krennic is my favorite performance among the lot. But my best part of the movie is when Darth Vader shows up in the climax - that entire scene of him is only a minute long but must have got the loudest whistles in the theatres. Verdict - this Star Wars is dark, funny, emotional, feel good, suspense...whatever I wanted or more from an action adventure, science fiction in space. A big thumbs up."

"avo-27100","9","0","6","13 October 2017"," Rogue One Review - Out of this World!!
","The movie's plot takes place between the third and fourth Star Wars films, and shows the story behind rebel soldiers attempting to steal the Death Star blueprints in hopes of destroying the new Death Star. The film did a good job of staying true to the story, even though it was considered a filler between. It was a little too slow at the beginning, and we didn't see a lot of action until towards the end of the film, but it was understandable in that it helped with the character building. It also stayed true to the lore. It added new elements, but still managed to fit into the universe of the star wars story. With regards to lore, it takes certain characters from the Clone War cartoons and incorporates them into the movie, like Saw Guerrera. It was well woven into the overall plot of the stories, and gives you a better understanding of questions that were left answered when the original films came out, i.e. how did they manage to get the Death Star plans? Which the diverse cast of people that were involved boosted the authenticity of the film, the cast were individuals who typically weren't involved in a science fiction type story, which made some characters, like Forest Whitaker, seem out of place. The overall feeling of the movie was more gritty and darker than the other Star Wars films. Because LucasFilms is now partnered with Disney, I didn't anticipate such a grim ending where everyone dies. The cinematic shots were very enjoyable. The film had a lot of good writing, and it wasn't just saved for the stars, even smaller characters. The writing brought on a lot of emotion and allowed the audience to connect to film more emotionally. The composer of the score was different from John Williams, who originally scored the other Star Wars films. The score was different from what John Williams normally does, but it did embody the Star Wars music that we've heard in the past. <br/><br/>Closing Thoughts - While the film was innovative in many aspects, it still managed to give Star Wars fans what they wanted. It did a great fan service to the audience, and was a spectacular addition the Star Wars film franchise."
"pkanzow","9","0","4","8 October 2017"," Star Wars for the rest of us Muggles
","This movie deviates from the Star Wars Episodes as it shows parts of the wars that ""ordinary"" heroes fight, non-Force users (I am tempted to say ""Muggles""). No Jedi magic and no light sabers, people have to fight with normal blasters, ""the better times"" of the more elegant light sabers are long gone.<br/><br/>So don't expect the usual Star Wars magic, but prepare for more like an earthly war movie, sprinkled with Star Wars goodies like X-wings, Star Destroyers, and, of course, the Death Star. Brand new, being tested, supervised by Grand Moff Tarkin brought to screen by a computer generated, almost believable Peter Cushing.<br/><br/>The story of Luke is told yet another time; young Jyn loses her family which runs a desert farm to the Empire, teams up with some rogue pilots and a sarcastic talking android, to learn about the Death Star and fight it. Same story, much rougher environment, no noble knights but fierce warriors, less space battles but more boots on the ground. And as I said - no baroque-style saber duels but 21th century warfare in Arabic-esque cities. And not even the clear line between good and bad - the Empire is on an understandable mission to restore order in the Galaxy, while the rebels question themselves.<br/><br/>At the end, the young heroine succeeds without using the Force, she steals the Death star plans and sends Princess Leia on her legendary mission to bring them to Alderaan, closely followed by Darth Vader, who like Tarkin and Leia looks a little CGI-ish.<br/><br/>No question that this is a movie worth seeing and owning, and I am excited about this spin-off which gives Star Wars a true Earthly touch.<br/><br/>There is one thing however that I would like to remark (SPOILERS AHEAD). We all know of the flaw of the Death Star: Too much power in one center, which is prone to explode if it is hit. This is the same error the dark side does over and over again: The droid army invading Naboo, both Death Stars and Starkiller Base - all suffer from being too centralized, not being distributed, not being redundant - they all are Single Points of Failure. This is the nature of the dark side, of the Sith: they gather around a powerful, authoritarian center, a dictator, a Big Brother who is meant to be the wise and powerful. Yet the dark side keeps failing because centralism and egomania is not the way you succeed, or how societies live in happiness.<br/><br/>Or so the franchise told us.<br/><br/>In Rogue One we learn that the flaw of the Death Star was intentionally built-in by an engineer working for the Empire but feeling for the rebellion. He built in a weak spot and documented it in the plans.<br/><br/>Now, not only that this means the ""hope to find a weak spot"" expressed in Ep IV was rather a certainty. Also, this implies that the Empire only falls by treason. Centralism works, the movie tells us, if it were not for traitors.<br/><br/>But that is wrong! The Death Star does not HAVE a flaw, it IS the flaw. This aspect is totally ruined by the treason story. If that one engineer would not have been a traitor, the Death Star would have worked. This is contrary to the message the other films brought.<br/><br/>What a pity, another of these plot twists that have the power to ruin your childhood memories. But on the other hand, nothing is more typical for Star Wars than constantly contradicting itself.<br/><br/>9/10, a great movie."

","There are more passionate Star Wars fans than me, but I've seen enough movies in my lifetime to know what is considered a good movie. Not a true Star Wars fan, I watched this movie just because it's available and have nothing else to watch. I've heard about Rogue One and thought to myself, ""Oh great. Another prequel??!?! You've got to be kidding me."" Well to my surprise, this prequel drew me in a lot more than all the other prequels did. It concludes right up to Star Wars: A New Hope, just to give you an idea of the timeline of this film. There are surprises in this movie that I did not expect. Familiar faces all across the board, it goes into the suspense of another group of resistance fighters in trying to defeat the Imperial Alliance.There are a few surprise characters that I was very happy to see and completed the whole Star Wars experience for me. It made me want to watch ""A New Hope"" all over again. That's how good it is.<br/><br/>The beginning was a little rough because there were quite a few locations and characters involved. I got a little confused at first, but it all came together towards the latter half of the movie. It was an emotional movie for me and especially at the very end. Some of the action sequences and acting were top notch. Again, it left me pumping my arm up and down to go with a loud grunt. There were proud moments when I wish I can just go outside and yell my head off to release some energy. Yeah, it got me that into the movie. That's how you know it's a good movie. If you are moved by it.<br/><br/>All in all, a somewhat typical Star Wars type drama. Just another prequel that adds more detail to the whole Star Wars saga and how things came to be. If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a must see. As for how the movie ends, wonderfully done! I can't explain the wave of emotions that hit me in the face when I saw who made an appearance. Those who've seen it, you know what I mean. Yeah, that good right?"
"troubledyouth66","6","0","1","18 July 2017"," If you know Starwars watch this film
","To me star wars has always been a space opera, and although CGI had to ruin the mix, it still felt like one in this film. Grand admiral and Leia seem really large, their features seem like the camera creates an up-close image and doesn't trick anyone. The plot is worth watching to understanding star wars. Rogue one, not to be confused with rogue squadron, is a rebel band of misfits whom create an alliance with the rebellion. The misfits have set against the rebel empire and call themselves rogue one as they enter the force field. They have an imperial cargo pilot, whom so dashingly escapes the unavoidable to retrieve the Deathstar plans from the planet Sariff, i mean Scarif. My guess is the empire really is stupid. If not for the CGI, and if this movie were made in the 80s, in tradition of star wars, it would have worked well. The bots and planets actually are convincing, where we conclude there are times to use CGI and not to use CGI. The ships not so much. Yet space opera is very much so British scifi space opera here. No plot holes here, death star doesn't need a force-field. The empire must have thought it was invincible. Some of the American acting however, I can not swallow. For instance, Forest Steven Whitaker is good, but his part was too short and overplayed. Yes, star wars fans, the death star does have a slow class 4 hyperdrive. I rec this movie, if you are a fan of star wars, and not Disney in general. I can't say this is bad, actually the props are well done and something tells me this is an 80s TV series or movie and it screams starwars novel or comicbook as well. However the cgi looks pasted on and the fact that its the British side of star wars may throw the continuity out the window. Is obi wan kenobi a British hermit, last of his race, or part of some race on the other side of the galaxy. i can't say its a starwars movie, but a starwars extension or prelude to the movie.

Also, how is it ""alive""? Is it God?

It was fun, entertaining with plenty of good, old-fashioned Star Wars action. I generally do not like prequels but this time I felt it was nice to get a bit of the background to the statement that ""a number of spies died to get this information"" in episode IV. We were even provided with a bit of an explanation as to why the Death Star had this silly weakness in the first place.<br/><br/>The actors were doing a decent enough job of it. The chatty android was fun without being totally silly. It was a nice roller coaster ride of action, improvisations, and gung ho ludicrous stunts inside and outside of various forms of transportation means.<br/><br/>As usual with Star Wars the science part of science fiction is somewhat lacking. What looks cool is what is put on the screen and screw science. When reading books I am more sensitive to such things but for a Star Wars movie it works well enough.<br/><br/>Some people seem to be dissecting the characters and dialogue, trying to put logic into it as well as wanting to have more emotions and ""character development"".

","When I went to the theaters all I was hoping was that Rogue One doesn't mess up the entire backstory to Star Wars like The god awful prequel trilogy did. I honestly thought this was gonna be one of those Star Wars movies that's ""Just there"" but not really.... I was blown away posting at the ending. It was GRADE A Star Wars! It perfectly described what the Opening Crawl told us in A New Hope. Rogue One actually feels like its in the same Star Wars Universe as the Original trilogy And The Force Awakens(Yes I said it, GET OVER IT!) Some of the problems the movie had was that the pacing was kinda slow and sluggish and it had call backs even more unnecessary than the force awakens.... Was showing Dr. Evanzan on Jehda really necessary? Let Alone R2D2 and C3PO on the Yavin 4 base? If they showed them getting on the Tantive IV I would have forgave it more. And the lacking of character development. Chirrut and K2SO were the most unique characters in the movie. The Battle of Scarif on ground and in space was amazing. It was exactly how I imagined Star Wars. I like the idea of Jyn Erso not killing Krennic because Krennic getting killed by his own creation is a bit better than getting killed out of revenge. <br/><br/>Hopefully they get the callback stuff out of their system and not make the pacing slow for The Last Jedi."

"justinpkelly","6","0","3","30 April 2017"," Good as a prequel, just OK on its own
","This movie was my most anticipated movie of 2016. I was insanely excited to see where they'd go with the story and with the characters who, based on the trailers, looked like unique and deep additions to the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, I feel as though they only got it partially right.<br/><br/>As far as positives go, I loved what this movie did for the universe. We got multiple great new locations that all felt tangible, dirty and real: Scarif, Jedha, Eadu, and Ring of Kafrene were my favorites. The creatures, costume design, and set design were all top notch just like they were in the Force Awakens. The acting was also great across the board; I don't think there was a single performance that wasn't as good as the rest. The action is also the best in the entire franchise by far. I enjoyed every action sequence in the movie, especially the stuff on Scarif. I thought that there were two great characters in the movie: K2SO and Director Krennic. Krennic is one of the best Star Wars bad guys that we have gotten to date; his ambitions feel so grounded and he is a very different kind of character than we've seen in the past. I loved K2 because of his sarcastic personality; he is one of my favorite Star Wars droids to date. Also, this movie enhances a New Hope in so many ways. We get so much rich history on the Death Star and the intentional flaw added so much to the overall story of it. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie, however, is the characters. They, for the most part, were bland, boring, and distant. Jyn Erso's backstory is fairly confusing and is not conveyed in a way that would make the audience connect with her. She also basically has no personality; she goes from a semi-jaded Han Solo-type character in the beginning to hopefully idealistic general in the end without any real charisma. She doesn't feel like a real person. Cassian seemed to be intriguing at the beginning, but they really did not give him much of an arc and he was incredibly one- dimensional. Bodhi is the one character that was truly given nothing. He is just there as a plot device. Chirrut and Baze were fine, but were really there for humor and action and nothing else (although their friendship felt so real and tangible). The first act is also incredibly choppy and jumps between locations way too quickly. The plot really doesn't get going until the beginning of the third act because of how much they had stuffed into the first two acts. The movie just feels too overcrowded with ideas and it could have benefited from being more simple. Also, Tarkin looks fake to the point where I feel as though he should have had a smaller role. The movie, in general, also has way too much fan service. Having a cool Darth Vader scene does not make for a great movie; having great characters, on the other hand, does. <br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One was a massive disappointment, especially after the excellently written and lively Force Awakens. Rogue One's positives outweighed the negatives, but just barely. If the characters were great, would have been able to easily overlook some of the flaws I have listed (such as the choppy story), but the characters are what make Star Wars the franchise that it is and unfortunately this movie dropped the ball in that area.<br/><br/>5.5/10 Grade: C+"

TFA ruined that with a story that added nothing except disappointment, being a sequel that turned out to be a blatant remake, and thus an insult.<br/><br/>Rogue One however, connected between the 1st and 2nd trilogy. It didn't have the annoying lead characters, the rushed story and the horrible acting that came with TFA. Rogue One almost stands on its own, while connecting some loose ends and introduces characters that are almost memorable, and certainly not bad or useless.<br/><br/>And it succeeds in (re)introducing Darth Vader, in a way that Revenge of the Sith couldn't. Not a classic, but a respectable effort and a decent follow-up that might ease the pain after TFA."

In short if the previous films didn't make you like Star Wars, this one definitely won't. It definitely is entertaining and not dull like Episodes I&II but it also isn't as engaging as the original trilogy or The Force Awakens.

"miachristinapink","8","0","2","8 January 2017"," As opposed to the Force Awakens this one has some silver linings and provides well....hope.
","***To restate, this review might contain spoilers*** I went to see this movie with my expectations deliberately managed and curbed after the uninspired cash grab that was the Force Awakens, a movie that made me write my first, severely disappointed, IMDb review.<br/><br/>Star Wars movies are not the ones I turn to for some kind of 'elevated experience', or a strong, character driven stories. There, as in almost all of the other Star Wars movies, this particular movie is for sure lacking.<br/><br/>It also has some plot holes, both within the movie itself, and especially within the greater story line that is the whole saga. If 10 years down the line someone who never watched Star Wars decides to watch these movies in chronological order I am sure they'll get very confused about this installment, and the New Hope's mentioning of the Death Star plans being secured by some thing called Bothan spies.<br/><br/>Still, compared to the shameless cash grab and horribly inconsistent and lazily written Force Awakens, this movie manages to hold its own. Granted, the actors are fairly mis-directed and are unable to deliver the chemistry as we got to enjoy in the original trilogy, but they are less absurd in their development and exposition. Ironically the actor I was looking to see most in this franchise was Forest Whitaker's, and sadly his character annoyed me the most. His role is set up to be that of a ruthless resistance leader who has crossed the veil in having become as much an agent of terror as the Empire is, to get that setup and then have him lay down and die so easily was just....confusing, and it showed Forest had trouble walking that line to deliver something convincing.<br/><br/>As opposed to many other reviewers I actually found myself very much enjoying and being invested in Felicity Jones' performance as Jyn Erso, evolving from a resentful, a-political loner into an invested and motivated agent for the rebellion - even if or because of her motives always staying personal rather than political.<br/><br/>Now with a production like this, no one will be surprised that the special effects are stunning and captivating, so that doesn't deserve much mentioning. As a reviewer however I would like to point out that the director here, in my mind, did something not so much amazing but for sure worthy of mentioning. The director under- rather than overstated. Where in Episode VII J.J. Abrams felt the only way to trump the Death Star was by making something that blew up even more planets and killed more lives, in this movie the Death Star is limitly tested, destroying cities and locales but shot in such a way that it feels as horrifying as watching the detonation of a nuclear bomb.<br/><br/>The nods to more obscure Star Wars lore were also largely tasteful I thought, nothing too on the nose, but simple, short homages. So too the inclusion of Darth Vader. Yes, good ol' Darth making a pun was a bit weird, but it was nothing that disturbed me as much as it seems to have done the more negative reviewers. In fact, one could choose to see it as simple hubris, as Anakin ultimately dies knowing he got enslaved by his own foolish ambitions as well. And then there is the final scene of Vader in pursuit of the stolen plans and it very effectively establishes him as a truly dark and terrifying force of his own.<br/><br/>So yeah, this movie isn't fantastic. It won't be a classic or a part of popular culture history like the originals, but as far as 'chewing gum for the brain' movies go, it was a nice flight of fantasy. 6 out of 10."
"triplex376","8","0","6","7 January 2017"," Much more like it than the Awful Force Awakens.
","I personally don't think the main Star Wars Saga will be where the real interest in this franchise will be and 'The Force Awakens' did nothing to disprove that point. <br/><br/>That story was over at the end of episode 6 'Return of the Jedi'.<br/><br/>Whatever they say George Lucas and Steven Spielberg never had a plan for the prequels and/or the 3 episodes that would follow the original trilogy when they were filmed. They maintain they did but the films we are seeing will only superficially do what they intended if at all. That is okay with me, as that is the creative process, but I do have issue with them saying otherwise.<br/><br/>I did see the point of explaining how we got to 'A New Hope' and the prequels gave us a history of those events but failed overall to really succeed with the wider audience.<br/><br/>The real fan interest will be captured by, and will remain with, the films that propose to 'fill in the blanks.'<br/><br/>Rogue One proves this but fails to really charm. It gives the immediate prequel to 'A New Hope' without getting us to really care. <br/><br/>As an events based tie in it is compelling and satisfying. The characters however fail to really connect with the audience and we don't really feel for them.<br/><br/>Overall a 8 out of 10. Loses one for the characters and one for not getting me to really believe in the rebellion but I was satisfied with everything else I saw. <br/><br/>Episode 8 is not one I am looking forward to but Rogue One has given me renewed hope in a Han Solo, Boba Fett or Darth Vader movie that will give us more of the Smugglers history or the Bounty Hunters fate, when he escaped the Jedi after his father died and then went on to get out of that Sarnak pit (because I like to think he did.) The fallen Jedi's actions in his prime pursuing the rebellion whilst perhaps being conflicted and his further descent into the Dark Side and an obsessional hunt for Obi Wan Kenobi perhaps?<br/><br/>These are much richer tapestries I think but the one that would break the box office would be the young Yoda. If that was done properly how good would it be? Remember how you lost it when Yoda confronted Dukku and absolutely lit him up!!!!!"
"Veteransson","6","0","2","6 January 2017"," Overall boring and uninteresting, but great visuals
","Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla), is the first live action feature film taking place inside the Star Wars universe that isn't part of the episodes. The events take place right before the first Star Wars movie from 1977 and tells the tale of the group of rebels that acquired the plans of the Death Star, as talked about and used in the 1977 movie. The main protagonist of the movie is Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who is part of the rebellion group that stole the secret plans of the Death Star. <br/><br/>Now, this movie wasn't necessary at all. Nobody asked or waited for this movie to happen, but it's Star Wars (!), so why on earth wouldn't you want to make another movie taking place in this universe? As long as you get a competent, enjoyable movie out of it, a lot of fans and non-fans won't complain too much about this movie being made. But that's just the problem. While the first sequence of this movie is intriguing, the remainder of the first act and the entire second act are boring, messy and utterly disappointing. You get introduced to many characters on different planets exchanging uninteresting dialogue, and although there are some funny moments and thrilling scenes, the point of it all was lost on me. The other issue, besides the uninteresting events throughout the first and second act, is the character development. And perhaps these two are related. There is no character development. Some characters do have a bad-ass scene or deliver some funny punchlines, but their characterization is so flat that it's truly impossible to care about them. You never get to know anything about them, besides from Felcity Jones' character, they're all simply 'profession characters': Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) is a rebel, Bodhi Rock (Riz Ahmed, great in 'Nightcrawler) is a pilot, Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) fights in this movie. But that's all we know about them, we don't really know their motivations or emotional baggage. This flat characterization had a huge contribution in why the movie was uninteresting. At moments where a lot is at stake, when emotional events occur, you just don't care. <br/><br/>It is however a 2016 Star Wars movie, and the visual effects were damn perfect. This movie looked beautiful, better than any Star Wars movie before (besides some CGI persons). The third act was one giant, epic war scene, taking place in an original setting. This third act is where the movie picked up, but still suffered from the flat characters and some cheesy, cliché sequences. There was so much at stake, but again I didn't care about what happened to whom. For the hero-villain climax Gareth Edwards chose one of the oldest clichés in Hollywood. The ending of the movie was interesting, and elevated the story, it was an ending that made sense. It's however sad to realize that the ending could have been perfect and hauntingly beautiful if only Gareth Edwards took the time to make you care about the characters. It's a shame this was never done. But again, the movie looked incredibly good, and should be praised for this aspect. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie would have been a train wreck if the visuals weren't this perfect. The visuals, some elements of the third act, and an amazing Darth Vader scene made up a little for the first two acts of the movie, but not enough for it to be a satisfying movie. Now, where does Rogue One fit within the Star Wars movies? It's way better than the prequels, but doesn't reach the level of 'The Force Awakens' and the original trilogy. These movies had great characters and a menacing villain."
"PartialMovieViewer","7","0","1","6 January 2017"," Not Bad - Not Great
","Well let me preface this with some negativity – the only two 'Star Wars' movies I really liked are (1) ""Star Wars"" (who really cares what they call it now-a-days – I surely do not), and (2) The one with all the little guys running around dressed in 'lhasa apso' outfits. The second movie I mentioned might be weak on plot – but it sure is strong on cuteness. The other movies I painfully sat through and completely forgot everything about them within a day or two. Oh wait - maybe not completely. There was this one redeeming character that I miss dearly. That character would have to be the eternal 'Jar-Jar.' Yes, Jar-Jar may have been the perfect model of bumbling annoyance, at least he was memorable.<br/><br/>So with all that being said, on my way to the theater, I really thought I had completely wasted my money. On my part, this was a family outing to the cinema and I lost the vote. Yes – I knew I was going to pay to watch something I expected not to like. But, as Yoda would say, ""Money you wasted – but wasted completely it is not – hmmmmm – ahhh."" Firstly the movie is way too long. About a third of the time was taken up by CGI and useless interactions between pointless cameo-characters – all of this could be deleted and nothing would be missed. If the editors had sliced thirty minutes, this movie would have easily moved into second place on my scale. Yes – this story would even top the cute little-furry-dog-creature movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that drove me up the wall was the multiple yelping references to, ""The Force."" Pleasewhine about ""The Force"", once, maybe twice and move onsheesh. On that point, I thought during this ""Star Wars"" time-frame, the Jedi Knights were some kind of a hush-hush mysteriously dangerous group that history forgot and normal space-folks simply refused to talk about. Eh - what do I know – or care for that matter? Other than what I mentioned above, the movie was OK. I do think the script writers actually delivered a really good product, too bad the plot was so muddied with all the lag-time between splashy space-scenes. Needless to say, I was losing interest fast. Ah but not to worry, redemption came in the form of three, late-entry characters. Yes those true heroes of this epic have to be the hairy likes of Baze Mailbus - wielding some awesomely destructive weaponry and a never-back down attitudes, and his bestest buddy, the master of one-liners and martial arts, Chirrut Imwe, and let's not forget K-250, probably the funniest robot - ever. I hate to say it, but without these three additions I would have lost all interest. Nothing bad about Felicity Jones, she was just a bit weak as a stand-alone lead. If the previously mentioned trio had entered sooner, this movie would have been excellent. <br/><br/>In closing, I think there was a lot of potential lost. It could have been shortened or Chirrut, K-250 and Baze should have appeared sooner. Felicity and these three would have made for a very entertaining movie. So there were parts of this movie I really enjoyed and I cannot give this thing one star – but it is not deserving of a ten either. For me I am glad I saw it, but doubtful I will watch it again."

By watching this movie, you can know how Princess Leia and R2-D2 get the design drawing of Death Star in the Episode 4. The movie was great and so exciting. Especially I loved a powerful blind monk who believed the ""Force"". I felt a little bit sad because no Jedi knight appeared in this movie. No light-saber actions, no force fighting, no usual ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" opening crawl. But there is no help since it is the world after genocide of Jedi knights. No Jedi knights except Obi-Wan and Master Yoda is still alive. The ending was really sad, but I was encouraged by this movie. I'm really looking forward to watch episode 8.

","Most reviews on this site I basically agree with so I won't repeat that stuff. I liked it but was not engaged like I wanted to be. I will nit-pick on stuff that took me out of the film. Simple logic problems that could have easily been avoided if someone took the time probably the director. 1. This has nothing to do with the film itself but we were exposed to 11 commercials and then only 3 trailers, all of which were high concept sequels AND then to yet another commercial for Cineplex before the film started. When did this become the norm? Yikes. 2. when the shuttle lands to pick up Galen and fam they land a mile awayfor no reason other than the Imperials on board need the exercise I suppose. 3. when the X-Wings attack the base where Galen and the Scientists are held, the shuttle that is on the landing pad between them and the attacking fighters, is not hit or destroyed even though it is a huge target. I am sure if it was hit in the right place it would produce a cool fire ball and explosion. If I were one of the Rebel pilots that would be my first thought of attack. But I guess they don't teach that in Rebel fighter school. 4. I have no qualms with a female hero or one that is sexy, pretty much a given within the film world for the past 100+ years but aren't we sick of ""heroes"" who can fight better/stronger/faster than any living human being? Uber choreographed fights that would make Bruce Lee's head spin? I am. At least Bruce could do the things he did on film, not so for 99% of these actors who seem to be doing it on a never ending basis in every other film released in the past 20 years. I can't sympathize with a hero who does super human feats and isn't a super hero. I can barely stand it when a super hero does it. 5. The rebel Blockade runner which rams into the Star Destroyer to push it to the other Star Destroyer; it seems the head of the blockade Runner is made of solid metal and suffers minor damage when colliding into the behemoth, yet both Star Destroyers seem to crumble like crackers when they collide at the same speed with each other. Maybe they were built by the lowest bid contractor and instead of metal substituted plywood instead to cut costs better spent on the Death Star. 6. A lot of people are jumping on the CG Tarkin and Leiayeah they aren't perfect but since everyone KNOWS that both are dead (or even those that saw the film before Carrie passed away knew it could not be her 19 year old self), we are naturally focused on scrutinizing the effects, just as I was even though I knew they were coming up in the film. It's better to have them in and flawed than to totally eliminate them from the story. Either way you can't win. I am sure there are many more but those are ones that jumped out at me upon fist viewing."

","If you're into the Star Wars odyssey by all means, pay the money, and see this one on the big screen. If you're even a lukewarm fan of the franchise, sure, go have a look because the film is visually entertaining with some interesting effects, in particular, the light and shadow effects as planets and spacecraft move around their respective suns. Notice I am not using words like ""outstanding"" or ""stunning"" because nothing about this movie qualifies for either of those adjectives, and yet it held my interest for two hours and 13 minutes but left me with very little to applaud.<br/><br/>The story is familiar and the lines spoken by the actors are nothing new but not so much so that I was left shaking my head or groaning though I did find myself sighing many times toward the end as the movie packed in one trouble after another and the dreadful denouement loomed large. <br/><br/>Momentary bright spot: The robot, voiced by Alan Tudyk, thankfully speaks his lines in a matter-of-fact way that was a blessed relief from all previous ""cute"" robots. And he had some good lines too. He is a complete departure from the earlier robots in that he's not there to appeal to children but rather simply there as comedic relief in this mercilessly dark story. Which brings me to my main criticism of this film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!! (Consider yourself warned) . . . . . I really did not like this movie once the story was told and done. I walked out of the theater feeling disgusted and gloomy, and that's not what I pay the price of a ticket to do. I go to movies to be impressed, amused, and diverted from my cares. To me that's actually the definition of ""entertainment"". But a movie where everyone dies is not entertaining. And if the writers of this movie honestly think they redeemed this dismal exercise in death by having the final word in their script be ""hope"" they are naive and completely underestimate the power of the medium from which they've chosen to make a living.<br/><br/>So, for the die-hard fans, sure, go, enjoy the special effects. For the rest of us who would rather not see a movie entirely devoted to death and destruction, save your money. For all it's good points, Rogue One is a miserable movie with nothing to offer but death. And right now in reality on planet earth with apocalyptic nihilists running around indiscriminately murdering people Rogue One seems particularly ill- timed and unhelpful. And no, I'm not comparing the rebels to terrorists but I am saying we, humans, have enough real death in our lives already. We don't need even more of it in our ""entertainment""."

","I hardly ever write reviews for movies with more than 200 reviewers, and this one has more than 800 at the moment. But since I have two major points to make, and since so many around, including some experienced reviewers, (not to say professional ones) complain about the predictability of the plot - hey that's a prequel, it has to be predictable, because we all already know how it ends. The room for surprising plot twists is almost non existent. The movie must aim for something different and it does. It carries further the exploration of good and evil, sometimes a bit superficially some times with surprising depth. But that's what comics is all about, especially a sci-fi comics - it explores the nature of people and the choices they make when finding themselves in hypothetical fictional situations, that test their moral core. The good ones do it with more depth than one may realize, as the story itself often seems simplistic. This one has some extra depth to it as it also explores the nature of Hope, what it does to people and how it can drive them with surprising and unexpected force.<br/><br/>All this is done very cleverly, using some real great characters, we don't get to see how they all evolved into the people we see on screen, but all those we do see on screen for more than a few seconds are fully developed characters, and most of the actors do them justice. The leading three: Felicity Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk are super, best of the three is Tudyk who does incredible job as the opinionated sarcastic robot, an impossible role which he performs with surprising credibility.<br/><br/>All this doesn't really matter you're all going to rip this review to shreds because I dare say that this is not really a science fiction, since science is not the issue here, and doesn't drive the plot. The issue here is the nature of power, the relations power has to being good or evil and as I also pointed out - the power generated by Hope. If you want to discuss this with me, my IMDb account is open to massages, I promise to answer whoever will write. I already know you probably won't write, just hit the not useful button. Have it your way, I'll keep writing what I think."

","This is the perfect prequel to A New Hope. This movie deftly takes you right up to the beginning of the original movie. You can literally pop A New Hope into the DVD right after you watch Rogue One and it would be almost seamless. Beyond that fine filmmaking chronology, I loved the amount of care the filmmakers put into making an authentic Star Wars film, right up to recreating some characters with excellent CGI and using archival footage from the original Star Wars. Awesome! The filmmakers didn't ""Force"" anything in this movie. Everything was well paced and character development was solid. I loved the new robot that they introduced, and the Easter eggs planted throughout."
"dsharp-4","9","0","5","1 January 2017"," So much respect shown for the franchise
","Disney has been extremely respectful to fans and the original movies with this latest installment. <br/><br/>So many small moments, technology, camera angles, lines and other head- nods to previous episodes helped weave this story in nicely between 2 pillars of the franchise. <br/><br/>Very enjoyable and original story with the right balance of humour, action and drama.<br/><br/>The new droid was a nice addition with his censor module turned off - great comic relief. My only criticism is that the movie was so PC with the casting of a female lead again and a deliberate, formulaic inclusion of gender balance throughout and race representation from across the globe. Nothing wrong with that - except when it's so forced as it is through American movies and TV shows. Too PC to be genuine.<br/><br/>Regardless of this, I'm loving the life that's been breathed back into the Star Wars story."
"DKosty123","7","0","1","31 December 2016"," Star Wars Episode 3.5
","After seeing this I understand the comparisons with the Empire Strikes Back, though I think the story here was not intended to make that type of comparison. This movie made it to theaters ahead of Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher's Death). Norwegian actress Ingvild Deila makes a brief cameo as a young Princess Leia and it is so short she does resemble Carrie Fisher though I think the camera shot is short deliberately.<br/><br/>The film borrows archive footage from Episode 4 of the same pilots in Rebel Fighters near the climax which only makes a lot of sense. The story does fill in between Episode 3 and Episode 4 quite well. This is darker for a very good reason. Line in Episode 4 - ""Many people had to die to get these death star plans for us."" <br/><br/>The first half of the film is slower paced than many of these films as it keeps quite busy filling in details of the story and developing the characters. Then the second half goes into light speed when the battle get going. <br/><br/>There is some humor in a few throw away lines though not really a lot. The one I remember the most is when a blind Jedi is being kidnapped and they put a hood over his head and he yells - ""Don't you guys know I am Blind."" Actually, that is kind of the summary of the plot here. When Episode 4 starts, this fills in the back story.<br/><br/>The action is great and even though a lot of people die, the movie does not slow down too much about the death rate of a lot of people on a suicide mission that must be done to save the galaxy far away."
"tihomir-badanjak","10","0","9","29 December 2016"," Rogue one - more then a star wars story
","I didn't expect much from this film but it surprised me. It shows that rebellion is not a jedi magic but sacrifice of many people. TFA was not bad but acting was awful, including Mr. Harrison Ford. And of course after all it's just a remake of the first movie. Actors were much better here in this movie, and only sad thing is we won't see them again. To bad for that, because Jyn and Cassian could become new Han and Lea. They surely have the potential. Together with Imperia and the first one (how they call it these days? A new hope?) it's the one of best star wars movies ever. It has continuous action from beginning to the end, without boring stuff like ewoks and ""oh no Padme is going to die"". And it's a part old story, the one we took for granted before."
"sohmflooring","7","0","5","29 December 2016"," Mixed fare...
","Some good stuff in this movie. A little closer to the original trilogy in approach to the genre, but too much stuff obviously thrown in to connect this to A New Hope. Inserting cameo appearances of characters seen in A New Hope, without making them part of the story, is distracting. Of course, for die-hard Star Wars fan this can be entertaining. I was amused by some of it, but it did draw me out of the story occasionally.<br/><br/>As for the story itself...interesting and does set the stage for A New Hope. I only wish it had been closer in tone to the original than what it was.<br/><br/>The acting was uneven by almost every actor. Don't know if this was due to directorial choices or the result of miscasting. I can understand that an actor needs to deliver a line in a convincing manner, but it should be easily heard and understood. There were times during the beginning scenes where I wished there were subtitles so I could have easily understood what the actor was saying. This could have been the result of casting actors with accents, casting actors with poor diction skills or ones who swallow their words.<br/><br/>I had to work hard to suspend reality in order to accept the CGI created characters. The lack of cartoon characters in this story was a relief in that I didn't have to do more work at reality suspension.<br/><br/>Obviously you have to have battle scenes in a movie about rebels vs. The Empire. The battles in space, near space and on the ground are well designed and crafted, although some action comes across as thrown in to serve those viewers who expect the kind of non-stop action found in interactive computer games. If the action does not support the story and is repetitive, then it easily becomes boring.<br/><br/>This is a genre I will still pay to see on the big screen, unlike some others that I gave up on because they strayed too far from the originals (the 007 movies for one example). I hope Disney does better with the next one and gives us a solid movie with a good story, believable characters and just the right amount of action to advance the story."

","So Disney hasn't killed Star Wars after all... Rogue One shows that there are still good script writers, there can be still a good movie made with honoring the old trilogy and still adding a new piece to the Star Wars universe. Attention to small details, clever references to the previous movies and overall an enjoyable movie. I only wish the same guys would make Star Wars VIII. I really hope :) I generally didn't like the main characters, haven't been overly satisfied with the acting, but everyone had a few good moments and overall the story worked. We can see that the movie has been through a ""sanity check"". No pointless flying around, everyone has clear motivation and still we can sense that this is a true Star Wars movie, much more than I-II or VII. I was very suspicious, read several reviews before I went to buy the movie ticket, but it was worth it. Go and watch! :)"

","8/10. This is the first stand alone Star Wars film to be released, and is placed between Episode 3 and Episode 4. We follow the rebels trying a bold plan to steal some blue prints. Directer Gareth Edwards does a fine job portraying the Star Wars universe, and really makes it feel a true Star Wars experience. The main character Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones is a likable lead straight off the bat, she does a good job putting you in the story, and makes it easy to want her to succeed. I really loved Donnie Yens part in this, he doesn't disappoint with some outstanding fight scenes, that we are used to seeing from him, after films like the IP Man trilogy. If you are a Star Wars fan you will not be disappointed in this stand alone film, I loved it, and am looking forward to more to come. I felt like it may have gone on a little long and spent too much time on scenes that were not necessary, which left a couple of lulls. But this didn't detract from the overall movie.

","I saw this movie the day after Carrie Fisher died, so I can't separate my feelings about Rogue One from my mixed grief and nostalgia. I was one of those kids who dressed up as Princess Leia, and of course, added a toy lightsaber, because obviously she was supposed to have one even if it wasn't in the movie. Leia was one of the very few characters I identified with as a child who matched my physical gender, although I have to admit I actually identified more with Luke. The last Star Wars movie showed me General Organa looking like a genuine older woman, and for the first time, in my whole life, I have looked at a major hero character in a science fiction show -- movie or TV -- and thought, that character looks like me. People like me exist in that universe. Because of that, I am writing a spoilery review because I cannot otherwise express how much I loved this. The very last scene in Rogue One unexpectedly showed me Princess Leia, looking exactly like she did the first time I saw her. I don't know if that was footage deleted from the original Star Wars like some of the stuff in the battle scenes (Gold Leader's lines for example) or whether it was a digital recreation like Tarkin. Whatever it was, it took my breath away. It was a fitting tribute to the late actress, and was stunningly more appropriate than the filmmakers could possibly have anticipated when they put it there. <br/><br/>If I hadn't been watching this through the lens of Fisher's death, I might have just seen it as a war movie. Putting the wars in Star Wars, this is basically The Dirty Dozen in space, and I like it. There is action, action, action, and no darn ewoks or jar jar or anything equivalent. There's even a sort of Jedi, although it's not clear if he's actually a real Jedi or just a devotee. I took one point off for having a slightly confusing beginning. At first I was unsure if the little girl was Rey or not. Turned out, not. <br/><br/>It didn't really detract from the story, but I wonder where the Bothans were? ""Many Bothans died to bring us this information"" is basically the entire reason for this movie, so it would have been cool if some of the fighters who died in the movie had been Bothans. Or I guess since they are just ignoring all the official Star Wars novels I've gotten from the bookstores over the years, maybe in the Disney Star Wars the Bothans aren't furry aliens. If Bothans were just a kind of human like Alderaanians then I guess this would work fine. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Fun movie with a huge bonus for Leia fans. The action and effects are worth seeing on the big screen. See it in the theater."
"Mr_Blond23","9","0","6","29 December 2016"," A New Hope for the Star Wars franchise!
","This is the Star Wars film that has provided new found hope to die hard fans of the original trilogy (not the lame special edition or 1-3) and the expanded universe that Disney hastily abandoned. It comes at Star Wars from a newer, grittier and tactful perspective, that doesn't pander to young children at the expense of the overall story and film.<br/><br/>The film has many strengths, the CGI was masterfully done, including the additions of Tarkin, Leia, and others. It is clear that considerable funds and effort was expended to ensure that the final product would be as close to the real deal of the original trilogy as is possible. Additionally, the cinematic shots in space and on planets are nothing short of beautiful.<br/><br/>All of the major characters are played excellently, and despite the fact that we will never see any of them again, they each made an important contribution. Jyn was a powerful female lead that the writers respected enough to not place into a sappy love story with Capt. Andor. Krennic was a powerful yet flawed blue collar imperial the likes of which we have not seen before.<br/><br/>The final hour in the movie, and the battle at Scarif was very well executed, and provided almost a video game like tactical and strategic feel that is familiar to fans of Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. This is to say nothing of the scene where Vader shows up and slaughters everyone in typical Dark Lord fashion which was completely awesome! <br/><br/>Of course there were down sides, though few and far between: <br/><br/>1. The imperials were made to be almost comically weak and inept, which makes you wonder how they rule the galaxy at all (Star Destroyers crashing into each other and troopers gunned down by the dozens like lemmings).<br/><br/>2. Darth Vader's pun (choking on ambition) was out of character and really took away from the otherwise somewhat serious and supposedly frightening encounter between the Dark Lord and Director Krennic.<br/><br/>3. The lack of the usual opening narrative/scroll was conspicuous and disappointing. Just because it is not an official episode doesn't mean that the intro could not have been included, after all most of the Star Wars shows, games, and even some novels managed to do it.<br/><br/>All in all an excellent Star Wars movie that offers a promising glimpse of hope to all those disappointed by JJ Abrams' pathetic attempt to replace the EU. The film offers fans a passing wet dream of what it could have been like if Lucasfilm and Disney had not soiled the bed and instead simply created film versions of EU classics like the Thrawn Trilogy, which was a much more persuasive and compelling post-ROTJ vision. Disney would do well to remember that it is the older more mature Star Wars fans that have the money in their wallets to buy the tickets to these movies, and treat them accordingly by giving us what we want... and this time they did just that!"

","After being very disappointed 4 times in a row, I went to this with very low expectations but BOY was I pleasantly surprised. This is not only a great Star Wars movie, it is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>Unlike the unoriginal and dumb mess that is Force Awakens, this movie is a completely new, more adult take on the Star Wars franchise. It touches on war, sacrifice, comradery, tyranny, spirituality and romance in a way that is both mature and Star Wars- like at the same time. It nods to the old trilogy and has that feeling of nostalgia despite staying new and original. It is really amazing how they managed to pull this off.<br/><br/>The CGI is one of the best, maybe THE best, I've ever seen in any movie. Tarkin and Leia are almost indistinguishable from real humans. Space battles and planets are extremely well-done.<br/><br/>Not anything too new and outstanding in terms of music but it is properly done and gives the correct Star Wars feel.<br/><br/>Humor is not silly or overdone. Just right, like in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie a must-see for pretty much anybody. For Star Wars fans, this is THE prequel we've been waiting for years and years. Rogue One joins the original trilogy as the 4th REAL Star Wars movie."

","My review of Star Wars: Rogue One: A Rogue One Star Wars Story (2016): (Star Wars) Rogue One (2016) Pretty good. Some quibbles. <br/><br/>Makes Windoo is recast but now he's not even a Jedi; they don't acknowledge it. He's just a black guy with a gun. Pretty weird. <br/><br/>The Dark Vader character from the third film is once again shoehorned in but still no classic characters (Kwy-Gonne, Ja Ja) <br/><br/>Excessive and hard to justify use of the n-word (I counted at least eight instances, all from Asian characters. Odd.) <br/><br/>A lot of very awkward dialogue, examples below: <br/><br/>Gin: ""So what are we, some kind of... rogue one?"" <br/><br/>Mon Mothra: ""Gentlemen and ladies and space aliens of the alliance, we find ourselves at war in the stars.""<br/><br/>Admiral Veronica: ""You mean, some kind of star wars?"" Admiral Wilno: ""The star wars will not end until we have a new hope - it's the only way we can stop these wars in the stars."" Gin: ""What is this, some kind of... star war?"" <br/><br/>Cincinattus: ""The rebellion will be crushed!"" Gin: ""TELL... MARTHA..."" Cincinattus: ""... WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME? WHY DID YOU SAY IT?"" <br/><br/>Dark Vadar: ""The rebellion will need some kind of a new hope to stop us when the empire strikes back! This will be the end of the return of the jedi with our attack of the clones - the revenge of the sith! I am a phantom menace!"" <br/><br/>In a pathetic bid to save money, they studio, instead of casting a tall man to inhabit the Dark Vader costume, cast three young children sitting on each others' shoulders. This leads to a lot of jarring cuts as Vador is about to clearly fall over, only to be suddenly standing up in the next shot, with totally different lighting and in some cases the wrong colour armour. <br/><br/>The time travel subplot was very unnecessary and clearly an attempt to ride the coattails of the popularity of Star Trek: First Contact (1996) <br/><br/>The incest scene was simultaneously uncomfortable and unrealistic, and I don't think droids work that way. <br/><br/>They once again recycle the plot of The Force Awakening by having the First Order (confusingly, here, called 'the umpire' make a new Starkiller Base, only this time it's called 'The Death Start.') <br/><br/>Star Destroyers once again do NOT (I can't believe they made this boob again) do NOT destroy any stars. <br/><br/>Picard is barely in it (blink and you'll miss it cameo) <br/><br/>Too many references aimed at sci-fi fans. 'Laser' guns? Really? Like that's realistic. Also dialogue such as, <br/><br/>Gin: ""If I take that mask off, will you die?"" Dark Vader: ""It would be extremely painful."" Gin: ""No, TARS, it's necessary."" Dark Vadir: ""What are we, some kind of suicide squad?""<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin was NOT needed to 'punch up' the remaining dialogue, and again, it seems forced: <br/><br/>Gin: ""The Empires are working on some kind of planet-killer."" Caruso: ""A planet-killer?"" Gin: ""A planet-killer."" Caruso: ""Walk with me."" Gin: ""They're working on some kind of planet-killer."" Caruso: ""A planet-killer."" Gin: ""A planet-killer."" Caruso: *turns to camera* ""Conservatives are misguided and foolish, and should be smugly mocked."" *slowly nods as music swells.* <br/><br/>The confusingly-named Thai Fighters are still just regular fighters. <br/><br/>Storm Troopers don't fight in storms (but do have those ridiculous, unrealistic 'laser guns') <br/><br/>Peter Cushing might as well be dead, he phones his performance in so much. <br/><br/>There's no sound in space. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie ends with a blatant sequel hook. Clearly, the next film will show our heroes blowing up this 'Death Start'. Main characters will probably be the heavily-teased Bail Organa, Red Leader, and Gold Leader. <br/><br/>All in all, a standard Hollywood cash-grab. Watch an original movie, like The Mummy (2017) or the first movie in the quadrilogy, The Phantom Menaces (1999)."

","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen this year, but that's not to say it is one of the best. However, I was still on the edge of my seat, especially towards the end. First off, the film looks gorgeous. The budget of the movie inflated over $200 million, but it's worth it. The battle scenes are particularly stunning, as the visuals virtually pop off the screen. The visual effects aren't the only reason the film dazzles, though, as director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Greig Fraser capture nearly perfect angles of the ongoing combat. The scenes involving Darth Vader (not a spoiler, as he is in the trailer) are breathtaking, and anything we could have asked for. But most of all, it is the third act of this movie that carries the load, as its action sequences are exhilarating to watch. However, this leads me into one of my problems with the movie, the pacing. While the first and second acts are good, they do not live up to the usual awe that the previous films in the franchise have brought us. There is hardly any depth for the main characters, aside from Jyn Erso. The performances are convincing enough, but the actual characters do not have enough background given for us to feel sympathetic. Even when they are in battle, we do not feel the emotional punch that Edwards and Co. likely expected us to, since we are not attached to them, Still, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" does live up to the hype...mostly. Depite its flaws, it is astonishing on a technical level, and the third act is some of the best we've ever gotten in this historic franchise."
"elodie-r","9","0","7","25 December 2016"," Sophisticated adult story - well done !
","I loved this movie because the story is political and sophisticated, at least compared to other sci-fi these days like Star Trek or Doctor Strange, or Marvel like stories which really seem to be for children, there is absolutely no comparison, this one rises high above those. This story has more complexity, at least we see that rebels have different opinions. We should fight, we should not, should we care about rebellion at all? The narrative is realistic, still with some Hollywood twists like ""oh my god, in fact he is not dead!"", but the general rendering is realistic and not naive. Great design on the robots. Also I love that every character has an important role to play, it's not just a hero that saves everybody because everybody is so weak. It was a big joy to see the old rebels costumes again with the orange glasses and all, it's a really good feeling. But there was no big innovations unfortunately. Then, the story really integrates well with the rest of the Star Wars stories, any Star Wars fan should not be disappointed, it is a real Star Wars story! Really well done! It explains what will happens next and makes so much sense, it makes me want to watch the next episode, now. I know, there are no Jedi, or force but honestly it is a big deal that they explain this side of the story on how they got the map, such an ingenious story. But I wish they explained more their motivation and why they want so badly to defeat the Empire.<br/><br/>The only thing that could be improved, is that despite the great design of the robots, the vessels and everything, we still see that the military director is a 3D character, we just see that he is not real, Leia was better because we just guess she is not real. Finally my only regret is that the heroine was not bold enough, she seemed to be carried from one point to the other and didn't show big initiatives, she didn't make any memorable actions of her own, she is kind of presented only as the daughter of.. yet she played her part very well, I wish she was developed more, it's sad we might not see her again, she's an interesting character."

She does not do anything to make you invest any emotion into the character and her performance will not make you feel like you care about the character.<br/><br/>As in the first three films - the supporting cast is what makes the movie. Han Solo and Chewbacca carried the first three films. In this film Alan Tudyk (K-230), Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang and Riz Ahmed are the characters that you find that you are rooting for and that you like.

","I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with Rogue One. Having seen all the Star Wars films at the theater when they were released theatrically(I saw the first film at the drive in with my parents when I was four), besides the original trilogy this is the only one I like. Rogue One is easily the darkest since The Empire Strikes Back. This has a fairly serious tone to it and a lot of the corny stuff prevalent in the prequels and last year's film is thankfully absent here. This feels the most like a Star Wars film for sure. Some criticisms I would have are some of the cgi with regards to certain characters in the film and like the last Star Wars film, the action scenes are a bit excessive. There really is no need to outdo the existing Star Wars films in that regard and I think the film would benefit from less emphasis on action and special f/x and more time on character development and plot. One thing that this film and The Force Awakens did get right was that the f/x for the most part look really good and is a combination of digital and practical f/x. I am not sure how well this will hold up in the years to come, but I currently enjoy it."

Overall it's an excellent movie that for me it's major flaw is the slow pace of the first half otherwise i would rate it a 9 out of ten. This is a proper Star Wars movie!"

","This won't be an in depth review. Just a normal star wars fan who grew up with the movies as a kid. Back Story=I didn't like 1-3 episodes and I really don't even consider them part of the universe at this point. I felt The Force Awakens lacked a lot of originality having basically the same plot as Episode 4 but still enjoyed TFA due to it was a continuation of what I grew up on. That being said, Rogue One was everything I wanted it to be. The writing was excellent, the characters were great and the acting was spot on. Everything about this movie was entertaining from the opening ""In a galaxy, far, far away"". They tied it masterfully to episode 4 leaving no speculations, gaps or miss ques. Rogue One now ranks closely behind ""Return of the Jedi"" as my all time favorite. Once it hits 4K/Blu-ray I can see myself watching it over and over and over. Its a must see!!!!"

","I fell asleep during the first 20 minutes or so of the movie, and I was not that tired. To think that I actually took leave from work to catch the movie as early as I possibly could ...<br/><br/>I rarely fall asleep during movies (maybe once out of 100 movies), and NEVER during a Star Wars movie (sacrilege of sacrileges!).<br/><br/>So I agree with the points that are repeated in the reviews that share my opinion.<br/><br/>Could there also be a gap between generations of viewers here, with the younger ones being more lenient and the older ones being more revolted about what they are doing to the Star Wars franchise?"
"hosh-483-650984","8","0","7","21 December 2016"," Now this is good use of the franchise
","After seeing SW7 I nearly walked out of the cinema when the Darth Vader wannabee hit the screen - what a joke. And then all the other clichÃ©s and old characters. It was a pitiful waste of the franchise.<br/><br/>Rogue One is essentially SW 3.9 and explains the lead up to SW4. The characters are fresh and unknown to us which is the way SW7 should have been. I suppose the ending is sort of inevitable but the events involved in getting there are not.<br/><br/>Story and script are solid, as is the acting, and the special effects and 3D are excellent. I sincerely hope that SW8 is a lot more like this movie and gets away from the old characters but it seems unlikely due to seeing Skywalker making a return right at the end of SW7.<br/><br/>All this franchise needs to survive is ""the force"" and futuristic tech - it needs to break away from the original characters or it will get stale very quickly. Rogue One is an excellent example of this and considering SW8 and beyond need be bound by little past and no future, they could be ground breaking movies instead of effective reruns."

"johnnyjan16","7","0","4","20 December 2016"," Good, but not great
","I think any Star Wars film has and always will have immediately high expectations. Rogue One is no different.<br/><br/>Visually, the film was spectacular. This is another notch up in the game of CGI. The actions scenes were beautiful to watch and the human CGI work was a real feat of special effects.<br/><br/>The way Darth Vader is used in this film too is clever. Not too much. A few scenes which just make you appreciate that character and what he represents. His last scene in particular was one of the more memorable in the film.<br/><br/>I like Felicity Jones as the lead. Believable, not too serious and she fits the character perfectly. Being honest, I wasn't really interested in many of the other characters, although they all played their part.<br/><br/>So what wasn't so good? The introduction. Far too quick. All the characters were introduced in minutes which just made things a little messy.<br/><br/>The movie then seemed to slow down for a lot of dialogue and trips to other planets. This went on a little too long in my opinion. It then built up to a great ending, but I needed bringing back into the story to get me really interested again.<br/><br/>My final gripe - the score of this film just didn't do it for me. Michael Giacchino is a great composer, but it would have been good to hear a little more 'rogue' in this if that makes sense. He could have been a little less traditional and strayed from John Williams just a bit more.<br/><br/>Good film? Yes. Incredible to watch, just not as entertaining as i'd had hoped."
"conndar","8","0","4","20 December 2016"," Enjoyable if a little straightforward.
","From start to finish this movie is fast paced and action packed. It moves along in flowing motion with little dallying or pointless character building. It will leave you wondering to where the time has gone by the time we get to that famous music at the end credits. Depsite fine performances all around, I feel the main evil enemy is lacking any great menace or threat. This is not due to underachievement on the part of the actor, but merely a part that is written without any great nastiness or evil. An unexpected familiar secondary menacing figure was a much welcome diversion, but a true depiction of cruelty was lacking, perhaps relying on the reputations sealed in movies past. With that in mind, the main 'mission' is pretty straightforward enough and a sub-plot is somewhat non-existent. Without going into detail, although the movie moves along nicely there is no great menace within or sense of hopelessness. Perhaps that is because we know the eventual outcome in 'A New Hope' or, perhaps more could have been done script wise, either way, I feel this movie is a little one dimensional and straight forward. However, the ride is enjoyable regardless of the number of dimensions traversed and is well worth the trip."
"badoli","7","0","4","20 December 2016"," Was okay for me.
","I didn't go in with huge expectations. I'm a Star Wars fan, but thanks to episode one, two and three i've cooled down to the franchise. Also the geek culture around it got a little too over the top for me.<br/><br/>As a movie it's a fun action spectacle. Maybe ""fun"" is a little too lighthearted, as the movie has a distinctively dark tone to it. This is the Dark Knight version of Star Wars, one scene literally taking place on black rocks, which makes clear how much the director tried to detach it from the sequels. He overshot the target for my taste.<br/><br/>The characters were ... okay? There is a snarky droid, which provides some good comical relieve. There is the blind monk, that seems weirdly insecure after one heroic battle with a whole bunch of storm troopers. He contrasts nicely with the gun-toting grim veteran. There is the girl, which the story revolves around, but her motivations beyond her father seem cloudy at best. There is the master. There is the rogue empire pilot. There is that guy with an English accent. I still don't know what his role was. The movie has problems focusing on characters, it gets quite hard to tell who is doing what for which reason. Even when the protagonists yell it out.<br/><br/>The actual plot gets lost in details, in the spectacular action sequences and in a substantial amount of quotes of the original movies. Some subtle, but most almost painfully on the nose. At several occasions they felt forced or full on artificial and should have been omitted. Why call it ""a star wars story"", when it features pretty much all what star wars has to offer? I'd have approved more if they had taken the chance to concentrate more in detail on a facet to enrich that universe. Instead it's an entertaining popcorn flick."
"ultrabrutalac","7","0","4","20 December 2016"," A beautiful, gritty missed opportunity
","To put things in perspective, i have grown up with Star Wars, watched the movies still in my early teens.<br/><br/>This movie brought me back to that time, and is in my opinion best of the ""new"" series of the movies, Prequel trilogy included. It bridges the gap between the Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and explains how the plans for Death Star ended in Rebel hands. However, it's not the execution that bothers me, it's the idea...<br/><br/>*** Warning, spoilers ***<br/><br/>This movie is by far the darkest of the franchise. All main protagonists are tainted by their past: Galen Erso signs a deal with the devil (Empire), Saw Gerera is considered too extreme even by Rebels, Cassian assassinates informer in cold blood. Yet they redeem themselves and die as heroes in the end. But what about the Jyn? She decides to clean up her father name, and consequently to redeem him by stealing Death Star plans and enabling Rebels to eventually exploit it's weakness, put there by her father.<br/><br/>They succeed in stealing the plans, yet the movie feels incomplete. There is no great confrontation in the end with the man that destroyed her family. Krennic is unceremoniously shot, and two main protagonists die after they transmit the plans. There are rumors about alternative endings, even shots showing Jyn with the data disk running across the Scarif beach amid explosions. This leaves bad taste in mouth, and a feeling that the film was cut to be more grittier, in GoT style: everyone dies in the end.<br/><br/>Would it not have been better to allow Jyn to escape, transmit the plans from the orbit and leave, having cleaned the father's name and just maybe, live to fight another day. Or maybe end up having a daughter... What has Bodhi Rook, a pilot and defector from Empire got for trying to follow his conscience: wiped mind and a death. I know that it is ungrateful to doubt the artistic experience and idea of the scenarist(s) and movie director, but this is Star Wars we are talking about.<br/><br/>To see a gritty story, all you have to do is to tune to news and watch what is happening in the world. Star Wars was meant to be a fairy tale in space, with princesses, knights and baddies. Although i understand the movie industry has moved, I still feel we lost an opportunity to reach to younger generations to carry the message. After all, which kid would want's to be a hero that dies in the end."

","I've always been a huge fan of Episode 6 and 3, thinking we can't do better than those (definitly not with Episode 7...) I now changed my mind. One thing I always liked about star wars, beside the whole Force / Lighsaber / Jedi mythology, was the political aspect of the franchise. While some might argue it's a simple Black and White vision, Rogue One offers the grey area we needed. Obviously, there are still good guys and bad guys, and you can't be wrong with who is who. At least, the good guys aren't that good, and the bad guys don't get all crazy breaking stuff ... (Emo Kylo).<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about it is the amount of surprises the film contains, while actually telling a story everyone knows. Same thing can't be said with Episode 3, very little was unexpected (maybe the young Jedi massacre... but apart from that..)<br/><br/>Finally, the fighting scene themselves, the plot, the characters, everything is simply really good. Not at a single point was I thinking 'meh... this is weird' like we all did when Kylo gets his helmet off.<br/><br/>Hats off for this first of a kind Star Wars movie, I just hope Episode 8 will get inspired by that.."

You would never expect something like this come out of Hollywood; and that's partially what makes it so great.<br/><br/>They put everything in a good balance; suspense, action, and emotion. The ending was also slightly unexpected, despite the fact that we already knew what was going to happen eventually.<br/><br/>I was nervous about the choice of director, also reading about various production problems (which of course could just be rumors). But in the end, it all came together, and I'm happy to say that I'm still a proud Star Wars fan.<br/><br/>I rate this 8/10, not perfect but almost as good as the original trilogy.

","Well, if compare this newly released prequel to the Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), the difference is day and night. I gave Episode VII just one star, and I gave this one 8. I think this one's CGI special effects is 100 times better, and it looked more like a genuine prequel episode that could be seamlessly linked with those authentic episodes. <br/><br/>""The Force Awakens"" by Disney was the worst, the weakest and absolutely un-watchable. I couldn't even stand it over 30 minutes, because that leading young black actor was just terrible, and worst of all, the CGI simply looked bad and cheap. <br/><br/>But not this one, even I still think that the young male leading actor in this film a miscast. He got no charisma, yet 100 times better than that actor in the 2015 one. I also consider like lot of viewers opinion, Episode VII - The Force Awakens, should not treated as an authentic ""Star Wars"" episode, but a failed copycatting production.<br/><br/>This one is a serious production, well directed and the whole enchilada just looked authentic."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","0","6","19 December 2016"," The Best Star Wars Movie Since 'The Empire Strikes Back'
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story follows Jyn Erso, the daughter of an Imperial engineer who sets out with a group of rebels to find the Death Star plans to destroy it. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this movie, specifically because of the concept. While I didn't think it was a story that absolutely needed to be told, I figured it'd be pretty interesting to see regardless. And boy oh boy, I haven't been this excited for Star Wars in quite some time. <br/><br/>The performances are all pretty good. Felicity Jones is great, Mads Mikkelsen pulls of a, while not amazing, still good performance. Most notably, however, would definitely have to be Ben Mendelsohn as the main villain, Krennic. I bought his character the whole way through, and he's probably one of the deepest, most interesting characters. His motivations are clear from the start, and you get the impression that he is really driven by this. As for the other characters, they aren't fantastic, but the movie doesn't give us any reason to feel otherwise really. They are quite literally thrust together with little actually holding them together. They all just happen to be at the right place at the right time, or wrong place at the wrong time, however you perceive it. <br/><br/>The story itself is mostly interesting and, while somewhat hard to follow at times, helps further build up the characters in ways you wouldn't expect from a Star Wars movie. Rogue One is actually much darker than the others, and I think that's part of why I liked this one more than many of the others. While the previous movies decide to stick to being mostly family-friendly, this one dared to step into the dark side of the Star Wars franchise, similar to 'The Empire Strikes Back', my favorite Star Wars movie. I think this really says something about the series, that it's simply more engaging when it decides to be darker and grittier. <br/><br/>The first two acts are, while good, don't compare at all to the third. It's a blast to watch, and made me especially excited for future Star Wars movies. If the creators can pull this off, then I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us. <br/><br/>I had a couple problems with the movie still. It does often enter the realm of predictability, and while it is mostly justified, it often proved to be a letdown regardless. There was one scene in particular towards the end where I hoped for something more than what I got, and it was because the movie decided to be generic. There's one other thing that stands out that I think most people have already predicted, but regardless I won't spoil that I didn't really like. It's something I've disliked about a lot of movies like this, where one thing happens and automatically it's easy to predict that it's going to keep happening and it does. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. As it stands, this is my second favorite Star Wars movie, and it's made me genuinely excited for the future of the franchise. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."

","They finally got a Star Wars prequel correct. This movie is so fun and entertaining. I am so thankful for this movie and think that it thrives in almost every way possible. I'll break the movie down into pros and cons and then go into detail. <br/><br/>Pros: fantastic droid, cool characters, all of Darth Vaders scenes, the ending, beautiful planets and cinematography, fun cameos, ties in so perfectly, CGI was amazing<br/><br/>Cons: use of CGI characters could have been used lot less, music not done by John WIlliams<br/><br/>Although I didn't agree with the use CGI characters, they were used well except for that last part of the movie which I think it would have been better if we hadn't seen that persons face but its whatever. The music was good but of course I am sad about not hearing John Williams but it makes sense that they didn't use original Star Wars music because it is a whole new take and kinda separate story line. That is really all of my complaints and they are so minor. My favorite part of the whole experience was how gorgeous it was. Each and every planet was amazingly designed and just fit the whole Star Wars vibe perfectly. I am really happy to see a different take on colors. We are use to seeing such dark colors in Star Wars but in this movie there is so much green and blue. It also has incredible visuals that I hope they continue to use throughout all the movies. Also the reason I think it is better than Force Awakens is because it is just so much more original. The movie is brilliant and ties in so well with the original trilogy. If you are a Star Wars fan you will completely be satisfied with Gareth Edwards work and will love it."
"eaktoudianakis","8","0","5","19 December 2016"," Just like the Google Pixel phone
","Having watched the movie twice already, I am trying to best expound my feelings on it to my friends inquiring on my thoughts (Me being an infamous Star Wars fanatic). <br/><br/>In the end, and as a spoiler-free review, I would like to combine my love for mobile phones and my love for star wars in saying: Rogue one is very similar to the Google Pixel phone. <br/><br/>Android fans have been frustrated with Google making nexus phones for years, the reason being Google had no say so in the hardware design of the product. With Pixel, for the first time ever, Google created a phone that they controlled both software and hardware aspects. They sailed into uncharted waters and, with that in mind, they have produced a good phone. It's the first of its kind, its merits outnumber its flaws and I am certain its second iteration will be even better. <br/><br/>Similarly with Rogue one, Star Wars fans have been asking for a non- Skywalker saga movie for decades. A movie without death stars, a movie without the usual White vs Black, Good vs Evil. And Rogue one delivers to the fullest. There have been re shoots, but I could hardly tell of such a fact. The story is dark, realistic, and the line between right and wrong is at best, and quite often, obfuscated. <br/><br/>It really opens up the possibilities for numerous spin offs, and most importantly it appeals to a more adult audience, proving that Star Wars can grow and expand outside the Skywalker saga boundaries. <br/><br/>It is the FIRST of its kind, hence flaws are to be expected. But like with the Google phone, I am sure the next iteration will be just as good if not even better :)<br/><br/>All in all, a solid 8 out of 10 from me :)"

I struggle to find fault in the performances delivered by this wonderful cast both human and computer generated.<br/><br/>No John Williams however and though I cringed at some of the fanfares within Giachinno's score, overall the new melodies and drum beats work well.<br/><br/>At times slightly slow paced but builds to a fantastic climax and with so many smart references and links to the best of Star Wars, fans will be swamped with nostalgia. <br/><br/>Star Wars is such a phenomenon that no movie will ever appeal to every fan but surely this goes a long way. I believe given time this movie will rank as one of the best in the franchise.

"kailomonkey","7","0","3","19 December 2016"," Better than the episodes
","I preferred this to the force awakens. It was more focused location- wise and it's a much better idea for me than the episodes in general outside of the first 3 which didn't seem focused in terms of events either.<br/><br/>It may have been full of holes, shallow cameos of the first film and enough big star wars things to remove their impact in Star Wars films for years to come... But it's still better than the complete tangents the episodes go off on.<br/><br/>SPOILERS I like that everyone dies, that's my kind of result, but at the same some there were some cool characters I would have liked to see again. I guess they're gonna have to make prequels of this prequel if I want to see them again. The only moment where I really felt the effect of what you could call fan service, was the darth vader bit near the end where he comes in kicking ass. Even then I was soon like, this is fun so fair enough, but it was very blatant in its insertion."
"jdavisjdavis","9","0","6","19 December 2016"," Very Entertaining, Very Star Wars
","I wholeheartedly enjoyed this movie. We get to see a well fleshed out story line on how the plans went from the bad guys to the good guys. We get plenty of Star Wars feel to it beginning to end. Emotionally there are scenes to make you laugh, cry, cheer, and hold your breath. Truly entertaining! Old fans and new will enjoy at all ages I have no doubt. Now for a few specifics (no spoilery details) without giving away anything really.<br/><br/>We get a dry humor droid that just about steals the show. If you read other reviews, K-2SO (is that a zero?) is probably in them, and he is just plain great.<br/><br/>Vader exists as a background character who is not to be trifled with. We get a ridiculous, ridiculous action scene with Vader... it is short but dear God it literally had my adrenaline flowing and heart pounding! I felt like a kid again seeing the old Vader scenes. I could give the movie a 10/10 just for that scene, but I'm older and will rate the entire movie fairly (why, I don't know!).<br/><br/>A very nice ensemble cast, but I'd like to mention the support guys here. I felt the main new bad guy, Krennic, really pulled off his part well and acted exactly as you'd expect... bouncing from sleazy sweet talking to raging anger. Krennic is a man driven by and seeking for more power. Whittaker is always great and doesn't disappoint. You get the feeling he's really torn up over what he's been through, and you feel he has seen and done a lot. Yet there is still his very soft human side at the core of his being. Finally let me quickly mention how much I enjoyed Jiang and Yen's characters. Those force worshippers (guardians?) are just cool dudes.<br/><br/>Now for the quick gripes: Two CGI scenes were less than perfect, but that is 90% of movies I see these days. Overall it was fine. I perhaps would have changed the ending, but I have other people who would feel the opposite so it depends on the viewer as you'd expect. That's about it! In conclusion, I recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan or sci-fi fan without a blink of the eye. For those who don't follow Star Wars at all, you will be fine and should see it; you don't need to know anything and you will still enjoy it a lot."

"Xillx","5","0","4","18 December 2016"," 4th Best after the Original Trilogy (doesn't mean it's good)
","Rogue One is a better movie than The Force Awakens, but not by much.<br/><br/>While The Force Awaken felt like a bad remake of A New Hope, it never felt like it belonged in the same universe, until perhaps the moment when Mark Hamil makes an appearance in a scene that couldn't be more underwhelming. It tried too much to please fans of the original trilogy, it took no risk and everything about it felt artificial and ""forced"".<br/><br/>Where The Force Awaken failed Rogue One succeed. It fits naturally with the original trilogy and build upon it.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect movie by any means. It follows the same blockbuster simplistic recipe that Hollywood can't seem to avoid since the 1990s. The story arc is as uni-dimensional as you can expect, but at least it's not completely stupid.<br/><br/>At this point Star Wars movies are as kitsch as something can possibly be. An overabundance of references to the original movies almost ruin the entire experience. We can only hope for more original and unique movies in the future in the same universe.<br/><br/>Once again potential romance is underdeveloped, but you can only do so much when the main goal is to squeeze as much action in there as possible. The action is however the movie strong point.<br/><br/>In all, it's a good but small step forward. In my opinion it's the best since the original trilogy, but it still lacks ""something"". Characters are underdeveloped if not unnecessary. Thankfully it also brings something that ""feels"" new and that we haven't seen since the original trilogy... Coherence (unbelievable, right?).<br/><br/>Concerning the music, sadly, the few new musical themes are not memorable and follow very conventional harmonic structures. A truly talented composer like Jerry Goldsmith would have done miracles with that visual material.<br/><br/>Visuals are as stunning as you can expect with a budget of that magnitude. Sometimes I wish that the director would take few seconds more to let you breath and observe. CGI actors are really a mistake; it will not age well. I would have preferred new actors with a bit of visual trickery.<br/><br/>Overall I'm still looking much more forward to the following movie by this director if the scenario is more daring.<br/><br/>I'm going to conclude this review by saying that I think it's time for something completely new. Movies shouldn't only be an industry concerned only by profit, they should try to be be art. We need more diverse and audacious science-fiction projects, even if it stays in the same universe.<br/><br/>Is Disney going to take more risk in the future, when it has made profit on their initial investment in the franchise? We can only ""hope"" so."

The constant scene shifting and actual naming of the planets on the screen almost insults your intelligence while coming across as a lazy effort by the writers.<br/><br/>When then movie jumps into the action it never stops. The entire film feels like a continuous battle scene. The CGI in this film is breathtaking. Let's get that out of the way. I really felt like I was in Florida watching Imperial Walkers come onto the beach and the size and scale of it all matched perfectly. The ""shield gate"" in orbit was an interesting concept too. If there is anyone to be criticized for this movie, it sure as heck isn't the CGI department. They also paid homage to Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in a manner befitting of their legacies. Bravo on that. In the earlier days of CGI such usage was painfully awful (See Han Solo and Jabba that Hut from A New Hope special edition). Also the splash of pilots from A New Hope joining the battle at Scarif is cute and nicely done.<br/><br/>The problem is at the end, you are left with no enduring emotional connection to anyone or anything. The only lengths the movie goes to to connect with you on an emotional level is the relationship between Jyn and her father Galen. You begin to feel something when Jyn watched a hologram of her father explaining why he stayed away and how he has sabotaged the Death Star, and later when Galen dies in Jyn's arms. With his death the only emotional ties to the characters dies with him, and there are no other ones in the film.<br/><br/>This is nothing like The Force Awakens where Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren and to a lesser extent Poe are all fleshed out thoroughly as characters. We learn what makes them tick, why they feel the way they do, their hopes and fears, their flaws (and if you appreciate good writing and characters, you love flaws), and the story of their lives that brought them to where they are. It is a satisfying experience to connect with them emotionally. Other than the very rapid buildup for Jyn Erso, no such connection is made by the writers for the Rogue One characters.<br/><br/>As for the actors and their performances, top notch in my opinion. Donnie Yen steals the show for me honestly. His character is extremely well played for what little background he has to work off. Alan Tudyk hits a grand slam as the comic relief K2SO droid. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna hit the mark for me as well. Darth Vader brings back the fears of everyone who was a kid in the 80s in just the right amount thanks to national treasure James Earl Jones. Ben Mendelsohn plays a great slime ball as a ruthless power hungry Imperial Officer and ironically is probably one of the better fleshed out characters in the whole movie. Each deserves to be commended for their performances.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is it just left you needing more of them! The cast are all so wonderful but are given almost nothing to do other than ""going through the motions"" of executing the Rebel attack plans at various locations throughout the film. So when the non-stop storm trooper death scene that is the penultimate battle takes place at the Imperial archives on Scarif, and one by one the entire cast is killed, there is no emotional payoff at the end of the movie. The theater should have been in tears when Cassian and Jyn die in each other's arms. If the writers had given us something to latch onto with at least Cassian and Jyn (reallocated time from the many battle scenes into developing a romance between them?), it would have been so much more satisfying. Or to at least have Jyn escape with the plans and deliver ""hope"" herself in person to Princess Leia.<br/><br/>But the fact the writers killed off an entire cast they never even really gave us a chance to fall in love with leaves you with the profound disappointment of not feeling upset that they died. Nor do you feel the welling pride inside you that they died for the noble cause. Nor are you given the chance to feel a sense of victory that at least one person (Jyn?) escapes with their lives. Hope is the central theme of the movie and the only payoff of it is the data disk handed to Princess Leia, who, for reasons beyond my ability to fathom, is on a ship in the middle of a war zone.<br/><br/>The film just plays too much to the ""epic battles"" crowd that is happy for the adrenaline rush of two hours in a theater watching people and ships and cities blow up with only 5 minutes devoted to explaining why you should love the good guy and hate the bad guy.<br/><br/>Rogue One has all the potential in the world. It is like a frustrating puzzle that you know assembles into something magnificent, but the writers left all the pieces scattered on the table so they could go play video games with star destroyers and X-wings. This is nothing like the original trilogy where the battles and fighting at the perfect accompaniment in just the right amount to the character driven stories of Luke, Leia, Han, Vader and all.<br/><br/>It is worth seeing at least once, but does not give you that ""I can't wait until my child is old enough for this so I can relive seeing it for the first time through their eyes"" feeling that episodes 4, 5, 6 and even 7 give you."
"Cameronius_113","7","0","6","18 December 2016"," Decent first instalment to the anthology series
","This film is the first in the series of Star Wars Anthology films which are basically side-stories which don't necessarily follow the plot of the main series (good vs evil). This movie does feel different to the main series but still keeps the Star Wars essence in there which was great as that was exactly what the movie was opting for and it was achieved well. The movie lives up to the title of 'Star Wars' quite literally unlike the other films; we see lots of galactic warfare not seen in any other Star Wars film before. The film is also shot with lots of hand-held-cam which gives a 'warzone'-type feel to it which I liked. Other sides of the galaxy that aren't focused on in the main series are shown in this movie, showing other sides of the Empire and how they operate outside of destroying Rebels. It also shows how life is for regular people who aren't getting caught up in the war mess which helps to capture the feel of this being one big universe with many things going on inside it other than the story of the Skywalkers. Felicity Jones was good as the lead character Jyn Erso; her character was explored well and was good to root for. There were some members of the supporting cast that stood out, the droid K-2SO with its charisma and the force-sensitive guy too. However the others, while nice to have around, didn't really receive much development and felt quite one-dimensional at times. I also found many characters to be under-used like Forest Whitaker's character for example who I think should've played a bigger part in the story and was necessary for a lot more of it I believe. This movie blew me away visually; this has got to be one of the best-looking movies I have seen in a long time. It is absolutely outstanding to look at and I would happily have any image from this film as a screensaver or wallpaper. The CGI is also mind-blowing; there are a few characters who appeared in the original who were recreated with CGI in this film but it honestly looks amazing. You'll likely forget that the Special Edition ever existed. The thing I probably loved the most about this film was the final act and ending and how it all tied together with the rest of the trilogy. I won't go into spoilers but I just have to say it was absolutely great and there was no better way to end the film. I was quite disappointed by the lack of screen time from Darth Vader. If he hadn't been shown in the trailers and used as marketing then I probably would've been less annoyed by his short appearance but he could've easily been used in more of the story. However, he felt truly like his character in the scenes he was in and only said things his character would say and not rubbish like ""NOOO!!!!"". Let's just forget that line was ever spoken. The references to other Star Wars films were great and fit in very well and I couldn't stop myself from smiling multiple times. It just goes to show that this material is in the hands of people who understand how much these films mean to many. Overall, this was a pretty decent movie with amazing visuals, a good lead character and also great references to other Star Wars films. My only issues were lack of character development for some of the supporting characters and that some of the characters were under-used in my opinion like Forest Whitaker's character and Darth Vader. This film has made me intrigued to see more of the anthology films and I hope they'll expand the universe more like this movie did. 7.7/10"
"Mackiatoe","7","0","3","18 December 2016"," A great addition to the Star Wars Universe, if a little forgettable
","I'm glad that I didn't get hyped up for this film, not because it wasn't a disappointment, but rather because it wasn't the strongest Star Wars film ever. In saying that, where it was good, it was very enjoyable, and certainly offers plenty for fans and average movie-goers alike.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with Rogue One is its messiness - too many characters too soon, a few too many plots and mixed morals. The classic 'good vs bad' basis is less prevalent here, which does offer some freshness, but its replacement isn't as good as it should be. The problem is that the Rebels vs Imperials story clashes with Jyn and her father's storyline and is further complicated by the internal disputes of the Empire and the Rebels. It has some direction, but the result is that the film is stinted by lack of flow; we jump between pockets of each story, and eventually it becomes too much to follow.<br/><br/>The other issue with the story (or stories in this case) is that we get so many characters in such a short amount of time that none get the proper introduction they deserve. I couldn't remember any of the names of the characters, save for the main ones and Original Trilogy ones. Few had very memorable backstories and character development was a little off, though Jyn, Cassian, Chirrut and Baze certainly had their fair share. Speaking of which, Chirrut and Baze were by far and away the best supporting characters, and I did at least feel something when they died at the end. The problem however is that I felt very little for the rest of them when they were killed. It at least wasn't predictable, just without heart.<br/><br/>Thankfully, however, most of the messiness is confined to the first half. Once Rogue One are assembled and away to Skarif, things get far more interesting. With everyone focused on one goal, more time can be spent on the excellent battle sequences that make up the majority of the memorable parts of Rogue One. They are very well coordinated and look absolutely beautiful, particularly with the rendering of the star ships at AT-ATs. <br/><br/>With clear influence here from previous Star Wars films and other war movies, the action is delectable and tense. Smooth shots following star fighters are balanced out with gritty, close-up ground combat sequences that flesh out the film well. Classic tropes such as in-cockpit shots, tense dialogues on starship bridges and old school dogfights were really great to see once more, and added a connection to other Star Wars films. We may not care about the characters as much as the film may want us too, but at least its visually impressive.<br/><br/>Other action sequences such as the fighting in Jedha and the attack on Edu were fun to watch, and the mix of melee combat and gun battles felt new and different, for Star Wars, at least. The clear lack of CGI in many of these sequences provided a welcome relief from what we've become used to from cinema in recent years.<br/><br/>Indeed, the way that Rogue One was filmed felt different, ditching the usual styles of the Lucas movies and Abrams' own style for something that felt more contemporary. In many ways, it was like seeing the Star Wars Universe in a new light.<br/><br/>Some discussion must be made to the inclusion of certain characters; Grand Moff Tarkin was a nice addition, but his CGI face felt out of place and did take you out a bit. Darth Vader's scenes were far better, especially in that ending sequence as he slashes down the Rebels while they try to get the plans onto the Tantive IV, certainly one of the best scenes of the film. The limited inclusion of Vader played to the films strength. Princess Leia's inclusion is something I'm still not quite decided on, though I'm glad she only came right in at the end. It certainly makes Rogue One a perfect prequel to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Yet in saying that, it's great that Rogue One was just a 'Star Wars Story' - you can take it or leave it. There's no infringement on the other films and if anything, it does very well as an expansion to the Star Wars universe. We get to see some new planets and some other aspects of the Empire, perfect for fans like myself who love universe its set in as much as the films themselves.<br/><br/>Rogue One is, at heart, exactly that, an expansion. It certainly has its flaws in its muddled stories and over-saturation of characters, but its strong action sequences, gorgeous visuals and different style help to improve that. And here's the thing, it doesn't need to be as good as the original trilogy or The Force Awakens, which it will inevitably be compared to. It stands alone in the Star Wars canon, yet offers something for those who watch it, and at the end of the day, is an enjoyable film. By no means memorable, but it certainly does a good job."

","ROGUE ONE- A STAR WAR STORY- i must say , there will be some spoilers , because i cant say how i feel about it with explaining somethings. First of all , i am not a big fan of STAR WAR movies(I like STAR TREK more). I think Empire Strike is a masterpiece , considering the time when it has been made. New Hope is very god too. But Return of Jedi is very average film. And the new trilogy was average too. FORCE AWAKEN which came last year was just a remake of NEW HOPE , don't know how it made 2 billion dollars worldwide. But surely ROGUE ONE is better then FORCE AWAKENS , but not on the level of NEW HOPE. The best thing about the film was that it doesn't try to be a STAR WAR film. Surely it is a part of the series but it never pick the FUN TONE of STAR WAR FILMS. In tone it come close to EMPIRE STRIKE BACK , but then again to achieve that greatness was really difficult. liked the tone that the makers have selected and the execution was good too, but their was not much of writing to support that gritty and rusty tone of the movie. Because you select to make movie more serious and not to inject unnecessary jokes you need better writing to support it , and keep it in motion and audience entertainer. But the story-line which the movie shows before the final battle was not that moving. We never connect to the characters , we don't care for their survival , and that's a big problem for a movie which has taken a path being serious. On that note , its doesn't lack jokes totally , there were few , and mostly of them come from a DROID name K 2SO , as dry humor which thankfully never contradict the seriousness of the movie. So what exactly i like about STAR WAR movies - SWORD FIGHT. And there was not a single sword fight in the movie. Because there were no JEDIES in the movie. Other action scenes were very good , but then again not exceptional , no outstanding planning , nor anything out of the box. Among the characters i liked DARTH VEDAR (obviously) most. He is actually one of the best villain of Hollywood , but we didn't get anything much of him . Just two scenes and one very small but great action sequence . This movie directly connects its story to the NEW HOPE , which means i don't think ROGUE ONE will get any sequel , so why not using DARTH VEDAR to his most. It was foolish . Apart from him Orson Krennic the actual villain of this part as DARTH VEDAR'S subordinate was nothing special. He just babbles and shout , he was not menacing or to get fear of. On the right side the BLIND WARRIOR Donnie Yen played was best. He also got one awesome fighting sequence , but again that's it , never used again correctly. About FELICITY JONES , i liked her very much in THEORY OF EVERYTHING , but here her character was not strong enough to inspire the rebellion group, also at first it felt like , she was just interesting in rescuing her father and not in the bigger cause. Nothing to talk about the other characters. The cinematography was very good , and the visuals are of great quality. But i miss the theme music of STAR WAR , the music director Michael Giacchino tried very much to copy the style of JOHN WILLIAMS(composer of all other star war movies) , which felt irritating sometimes , but yes he did a good job with some emotional scenes. This movie has been rewrite and re-shoot which makes you feel like the editing and the flow was smooth. There were many things just left for understanding, like there was one scene when a character uses an octopus to dig out some information from other character , but it was never shown that what information has been found. There was also the case of RIZ AHMED who was actually an imperial pilot , but somehow due to influence of a good character he turn himself into a good person to support the ALLIANCE. But it was never show how that good character influence this imperial pilot so much. My review may show that its not a good movie which is not true. Its a good movie , but that's it. Nothing more. It definitely fills the gap between REVENGE OF SETH and NEW HOPE , and i think that's enough for STAR TREK fans to watch it at big screen , but not for others. But its definitely a good movie to watch at home , and should not be missed by anyone who follows the series. 7.2/10 ANuP APu KuMaR"
"lasttimeisaw","7","0","6","18 December 2016"," ROGUE ONE is a solid attempt to ginger up the jaded but still massively lucrative mega-universe of STAR WARS
","This stand-alone space opera, within the franchise's time-line it closely predates STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE (1977), and in some measure complements the whopping lacunae between Episode III and IV, individually, ROGUE ONE pluckily sidesteps the force-bestowed Skywalker clan and Jedi warriors, recounts a heroic stealth mission carried out by a band of rogue rebels, and rounds off the story with a pang of pathos which will alter our perspective of Episode IV forever. <br/><br/>The plot zeroes in on Jyn Erso, played by a dauntless Felicity Jones, whose father Galen (Mikkelesen) is press-ganged into joining in the Empire as one of the core designers of the notorious Death Star. Jyn was separated from him when she was a little girl (where the franchise habitually kills off a mother figure, because Jane's mother Lyra, played by Valene Kane, inanely chooses to stick with her husband in lieu of her young child during the crunch, one cannot bow to her logic), now an adult, she is recruited by the Rebel Alliance on an expedition to look for Galen, accompanied by Cassian Andor (Luna) and his droid K-2SO (Tudyk), a great asset in the game. <br/><br/>Little does Jyn know, the Rebel Alliance has an ax to grind, Cassian is commanded to dispatch her father once for all, even after Jyn gets the message delivered by a defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook (Ahmed), that Galen deliberately leaves a loophole in his design so that the humongous Death Star could be demolished from within. A father-daughter belated reunion doesn't end in a happy ending thanks to the expedient action of the rebels, yet, Jyn holds no grudge, pleads a motion to obtain the information of the loophole from the data bank in planet Scarif, which fails to pass the democratic consensus. So Jyn and Cassian, brave themselves to a kamikaze plan to snatch the data, disguised as Imperial officers, and transported by a stolen Imperial shuttle, they are joined by Bodhi, a blind Jedi-wannabe Chirrut Imwe (Yen, vaunting martial arts cannot save the day, alas) and his companion, the heavily-loaded mercenary Baze Malbus (Wen), among others.<br/><br/>The rest is an ode to foot soldiers, we are certain they will get what they want in the end against a heavy casualty, but, we might not expect a total annihilation to wipe off the entire planet with our protagonists stranded helplessly to face the doom in a mode evocative of Lars van Trier's MELANCHOLIA (2011). That is where ROGUE ONE goes out on a limb to flout the so-called ""leading character aureole"" and hits the mark, which dwarfs other franchises where body counts in the hero's roll calls must be fastidiously calculated, this is the advantage of an one-off project, as dumbstruck as that, it does effectively elicit a pungent whiff of pathos which is wanting from Han Solo's exit in STAR WARS EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS (2015). <br/><br/>Directer Gareth Edwards and DP Greig Fraser have done a creditable job in concretizing the film's intergalactic visual scope, collating a vintage milieu replete with rough-and-tumble where our ragbag of rebels constantly comes across with an ultra-streamlined modernity under the govern of the Empire. In its money-shots, two paralleled combats (one on the ground field, the other is the trademark space confrontation) merge into one helluva spectacle fairly retains the name of its brand, and for the most part, its 3D effect is unexpectedly lucid and arresting. Although John William's score is too reverent to override, Michael Giacchino's score manages to live up with the tale's heroic overtone. <br/><br/>In the face of grave matters, scarcely a moment of romance can find a footing in the narrative, but a scintillating correlation between Jyn and Cassian has been tangibly established without hitting the sappy note thanks to a very contained effort from Jones and Luna. As for the highlight of the supporting group, apart from embracing diversity on a wider scale, everyone's talking point must be the graphic digital retouch to recreate several old characters in order to make a sound transition to the next chapter, notably Grand Moff Tarkin (which was played by the late Peter Cushing in Episode IV) and a young princess Leila, is it a sign to showcase that now the technology is able to bring previous characters back from oblivion to a new era? Or it could be a transgression of their indelible cinematic legacy? One might be dithering. <br/><br/>Tellingly, ROGUE ONE is a solid attempt to ginger up the jaded but still massively lucrative mega- universe of STAR WARS, and could be more apt to be coined as a genuine suicide squad for its no- holds-barred gumption and forcefulness."

This reviewer saw the original-original in theatres. I am not looking for bragging rights merely trying to establish some cred.<br/><br/>2. The original was awesome. However at the time I saw it more as a self-contained story. Millions of others however saw it as a cross between a video game and a saga without end.<br/><br/>3. In my view none of the following SW films came even close to the power of the original save for the Force Awakens and for that I credit those reviewers who deconstructed the 2015 film and found that the writing team had matched the action arcs to the original and in effect ""recreated"" the impact of the original.The cliff hanger ending however was cheesy.<br/><br/>4. This film is obviously designed to cater to the millions who, as above, see the franchise as endless and ongoing.<br/><br/>5. As a film, the current film does not come alive until the last 45 minutes. That is a bit late. Props for turning tiny Felicity Jones into an action figure and props for taking Asia's top action star and casting him in what might be the biggest role in his career.<br/><br/>6. Note the timestamp on this review. The last line of the film is about hope and today by coincidence Michelle Obama said that the 2016 US election had taken away hope from America. One wonders if, when this review is found in the IMDb database 100 years from now, America itself will actually be playing out the Star Wars saga in real time?"

Like an old WW2 adventure movie with more adult themes and far grittier than most Star Wards films (inc Empire?) so may not be to the taste of everyone. This installment certainly reinvigorates the universe and proves that there's a galaxy of stories waiting to be told outside of the Skywalker clan. Ignore the nitpicking and the trolls - This is solid good fun and just when you're thinking ""Hang on a minute!?!?!?!?"" the film answers you. Loads of fun Easter eggs and cameos for fans. PS.

","Okay, so the first spin off of the immortal Star Wars saga has finally hit theaters, but how does it compare to the rest? Well, it's miles ahead of those embarrassing prequels (no surprise), but Rogue One: A Star Wars Story just can't compete with the originals, or The Force Awakens. ​ As I'm sure you've heard, there's no opening crawl or John Williams score this time, just a silent view of space with a single planet. Everything else from here is an X-wing flight of an experience you'd expect from a Star Wars movie, including booming sound effects and AT-AT walkers that look as epic as ever. There's an appropriate mix of practical sets and good CGI to create all sorts of new settings, including a tropical planet and a claustrophobic prison. It's got all the checklist requirements to make a good Star Wars movie, but there's something missing.<br/><br/>Basically, without giving anything away, the Death Star is in its finishing stages of development, and war zones land on all areas of conspiracy against the weapon, the strife of war affects the lowest of the low in the galaxy. But we are introduced to the struggle on a rock and moss planet that houses a small family of farmers. The father is forcefully invited to join the Empire, along with his wife and daughter. He is soon taken away, and the little girl manages to escape, only to be transported place to place by an Imperial prison as an adult.<br/><br/>Now, she ends up with the Rebel Alliance so that she can be this movie's ""feminist protagonist"" in helping steal the plans to the Death Star, and also to see her father again. You know how it all goes from here.<br/><br/>The problem I had with this movie is not just in how we already know how it will end before it even begins, but in the excessive use of characters with so little humanity I cannot connect with a single one of them.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: you remember how in The Force Awakens we saw a detailed introduction to Rey that showed us what her day-to-day life on Jakku was like? Remember the clear backstory given to Finn and how that motivated his actions? Here, none of the new characters have any of that. Jyn's not motivated enough to fight for what she has lost, as we never know what her relationship with her father was ever like. Then she starts to cry over this inner pain, and let me tell you: Felicity Jones (Like Crazy, The Theory of Everything) is not skilled in making crocodile tears. Her story just moves by too quickly to balance a feel of hope with letting us feel for her.<br/><br/>Everyone else around her is just a plot device. While Forest Whitaker's (The Butler, The Last King of Scotland) new cyborg character has a sympathetic redemption story screaming to get out, the poor performance of the man behind the mask just doesn't land. Then there's the cameos of characters from the original trilogy. Remember how the appearances of older characters in The Force Awakens actually advanced the emotional story and improved your appreciation of the originals? This does none of that. Darth Vader does appear as epic as ever, but he just comes to explain the plot, and leaves, only to make one more brief appearance. There are a couple of others from the originals who appear, but none of them are very satisfying or necessary. Although there was one cameo that just blew my mind, making me go, ""Whoa! How did the visual effects crew make that possible?!""<br/><br/>But there is a god, strong saving grace though: one of the new characters proves to be strong with the force, despite it being a time when the force is thought of as an ancient religion. He's also blind, and an epic master of hand-to-hand combat. Let me tell you: he gets a moment to shine in his fight against a gaggle of Stormtroopers, and it's the most amazing thing ever.<br/><br/>So is Rogue One: A Star Wars Story the spin off to the saga we all hoped for? Not exactly. It's a satisfactory action flick if you're willing not to think too hard about it as high art. But if you are looking for the essential Star Wars experience that surpasses all of your expectations, you might end up disappointed."

","This review contains several spoilers, please read carefully.<br/><br/>Summary: All in all, it's a worthwhile war story for everyone not involved with the franchise, and a highly successful spin off for the fans. This is not a bad film, you should see it. The Force is with this one :)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>the finale, it's ridiculously good; cast is good, acting is OK; great atmosphere of a real war movie; alternative to legends, skywalkers and lightsabers is a success; visuals are fantastic by default; it's far from a giant flop, for the hype these movies get this is a success in itself.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>weak first half of the film; vast majority of new characters are empty, undeveloped; new planets, their number and visual style choice, their numerosity; the way they explained the ""Rogue One"" name, it's simply atrocious; dialogue is clunky at times; musical score is sadly underwhelming.<br/><br/>Grade: 7 / 10<br/><br/>Elaboration:<br/><br/>Being a Star Wars fanboy I had no choice but to go see the movie at midnight in the middle of the week. Happy to say that I was not disappointed and I sure didn't feel I wasted my sleep and money over this. If you are a neutral person, you'd probably give it a 6 or even a 5, but this one is far from being a disgrace that some people may call it. For us fans, just seeing our favorite Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia is reason enough to rate it a bit higher, surely you understand.<br/><br/>This brings us to the first hotly controversial subject: the use of computer-rendered deceased or aged actors. Yeah it looks a bit weird and may be off-putting, but I still think that this was required and needed for such a film. When your entire set of visuals is carefully modeled after the original 1977 film, it only makes sense to adjust the entire lot of all you've got to that visual style. And the visuals are great, to say the least. The film follows closely to what they had in Episode IV and each costume and starship is as exactly as you'd imagine it to be, or remember it to be from the first film. The only smudge on the visuals is the red-dish hue on Vader at times, he is best kept entirely black, with no colors involved. Other than that, all is fine with the picture, its somewhat bleak in the first half, but this seems to be a mood-setter, it gets better as the film goes on.<br/><br/>Speaking of Tarkin, I really got confused by the Krennic character. Of course, there was a novel released for this, describing the events that happened with the characters before the film, but even being a fan I didn't get a chance to read it yet and few people who will go to see the film will. I like one opinion where it should have been just the Tarkin as the chief bad guy - it makes total sense, too: he terorrizes the poor rebels in the prequel, survives, semi-victorious, and then the superheroes put him in his place in the original film. Unfortunately, Krennic is not the only character who can and will perplex you, the entire poster-cast could have been successfully cut in half and it would still be a good story. They all just seem superfluous to the straight-line script that has only one major plot driver: get the plans to the Death Star. As a result of all of them sharing the screen time, the characters feel shallow and underdeveloped, only Jyn gets nearly enough attention. With the baggage that the franchise has, Vader alone esily eclipses any other character even with the short screen time he gets. It felt like Mon Mothma was more valuable to the story than some of the main characters, come on, this is not good.<br/><br/>Though the characters are victims of a poor script, the actors themselves are good and deliver a good performance. Still, unfortunately, nothing spectacular to see here, even if you consider a great droid by Alan Tudyk, he's essentially a funnier, more mature C3PO. And speaking of mature 16+, the idea for the film is gorgeous and the atmosphere is executed really well. You really feel scared and disgusted at times, this is REAL WAR, where people die, betray and do all kinds of grisly stuff. Considering Star Wars films traditionally were kiddie space operas, and this is still a kiddy space opera, the style of this one is still a major breakthrough for the franchise: it's literally never been that dark, even with Han Solo getting murdered by his son. The only blemish on all of this is a very long and tedious first half of the film, my girlfriend literally fell asleep for a dozen of minutes because the first half is really poor, has a lot of un-needed characters and scenes could have been done differently. I really can't explain this, it's just bad and boring, this is a fault of the writers, to the point of: Saw Gerrera who? Just cut him out entirely and it will be better if you just mention him in dialogue, that's it. As noted above, the fanservice scenes are used heavily but they don't distract you from the story, much rather add to it. When we watched Episode IV and its opening crawl we all wanted to learn how did actually many agents die to bring Luke Skywalker these plans to the Death Star. When comparing a carbon-copy Episode 7 to Rogue One, the latter does it better. For technically a spin off, that is a huge success. It has its rightful and well-deserved place between the original film and the final official prequel, even though the script is flawed in some areas."
"dfle3","7","0","7","16 December 2016"," An adequate fan fiction story with a megabudget 70%
","Rogue One sits between ""A new hope"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" chronologically. If you're new to the entire Star Wars franchise, where should you begin your viewing? From my point of view, either with this film, Rogue One, or Star Wars: A new hope (episode IV). I came into this franchise at the beginning, with ""A new hope"" and as a young person I found it exhilarating. Having seen that movie multiple times since (nearing double figures without the ridiculous number of viewings that the hardcore fans are capable of...going into the dozens), I'm confident that ""A new hope"" would stack up well for modern viewers.<br/><br/>Apart from Episode III of the prequels, that trilogy was very underwhelming. Rogue One isn't as exhilarating as I remember ""A new hope"" being, but as an adult, I did find a couple of humorous moments in it which made me laugh...from memory the comedy in ""A new hope"" was pitched to a younger audience. That being said, I suggest starting with the original trilogy (episodes IV-VI) and if you're still keen, see Rogue One next.<br/><br/>What's the story in Rogue One? It comes across as a bit of fan fiction, as in it writes a backstory to things that have happened later chronologically in the world of this franchise, but earlier in the release history of the franchise itself. It could also be accused, perhaps, of justifying one element of ""A new hope"" which was always subject to some mockery by those who thought a bit too much about the logic of the story. This might be the first Star Wars movie to not open with that iconic scrolling text introducing the story we are about to see, accompanied by John Williams famous score.<br/><br/>Anyway, in Rogue One, an Imperial troop carrier lands on a planet. When we initially see that, it looked to me like it was one of those remote control toy spaceships...it just didn't look believable. Later on, you realise that it's meant to be very large and capable of carrying a troop of soldiers. That was really the only time in the film that the special effects were unconvincing. In Star Wars, the Empire (the Imperial side) is the dominant force in that galaxy and they believe themselves to be upholding order but they're obviously the ""bad guys"" as they are ruthless in fighting for total control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>The Imperial forces are looking for someone on that planet. In the movie we learn from the Rebels (the Alliance which is opposed to the Empire...regarded as ""terrorists"" by the Empire, no doubt) that the Empire has a weapon being built which is dubbed the ""planet killer"". The person on that planet which is being sought by the Empire is someone who can help them build that ultimate weapon.<br/><br/>Early on there's quite a bit of jumping around from one location in the galaxy to another as well as jumping from one time in the chronology to another. This made following what was going on difficult, although eventually one of those chronological jumps did me the favour of letting me know that the girl who I saw earlier on the planet was now the adult woman I was seeing on the screen. Perhaps that could have been made clearer earlier on. Also not clear...I was wondering the family on that planet were somehow related to the most recent Star Wars movie, ""The Force awakens"". Still not sure about that, but unlikely, in any case.<br/><br/>The rest of Rogue One concerns the attempts of the Rebel Alliance to thwart the Empire's plan to use their weapon with planet destroying capabilities. There's a lot of action, the vistas are impressive, with a painterly look to them and occasionally the 3D images look alright. The film is nowhere near as impressive on the 3D front as Avatar was, and that earlier film's use of 3D was most impressive in the little things that it did, the subtle things. In other words, I don't think that it's extremely important to see Rogue One in 3D.<br/><br/>There are some moments in the film which I suspect will be used in a video game, should a video game be brought out to tie-in with this film. i.e. you will be replaying those scenes from the film in the game and perhaps seeing cutscenes which match the film too.<br/><br/>Random observations:<br/><br/>* There are a lot of English voices in this film, as in the characters sound like they are from England. There's a French sounding voice too. Although I haven't seen the particular Japanese franchise, one of the characters in Rogue One brought to mind the Japanese character Zatoichi. I had to search online for that character's name...by typing in his attributes...you'll know him when you see him, I suspect.<br/><br/>* Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn has a significant role in this movie. I just mention this because recently another Australian actor, Peter Sumner, who was in ""A new hope"" died. There was an interesting article about Sumner, following his death, which dealt with his Star Wars history (see Sydney Morning Herald, 23/11/2016, ""Peter Sumner, Australia's link to the original Star Wars, dies at 74"", by Garry Maddox).<br/><br/>* There are some implausible moments in Rogue One, like when the woman who helps the Rebels brings out a weapon in front of her ""allies"" for the first time.<br/><br/>* You can finally hear John Williams' famous score...a little while into the closing credits.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a decent entry in the Star Wars canon, which doesn't reach great heights but doesn't embarrass the franchise like the first two prequels did. The droid K-2SO was entertaining and reminded me a bit of C3PO...and Marvin, from the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.<br/><br/>There are some familiar faces too and you do get to see them...eventually."

","Now I know this meant as a star wars story and not one of the episodes. But the feeling I got after watching this is it really fits in so well with the SW Universe as we know it.<br/><br/>I was hopeful upon entry that this would be good. But as it was not an episode my expectations were lowered. They needn't have been. This was a an epic release within the franchise and I want to go and see it again.<br/><br/>As many reviews have stated not all the characters were fully rounded, but then how are you going to be able to do that without making it a 4 hour film. I thought the main characters were all excellent. Jyn Erso was the lead and shows that Disney at least has redressed the Gender balance with both it's star wars releases having female leads.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away as I would suggest everyone goes and sees this film. What I will say is the use of GGI is amazing and for all star wars fans to look out for the X-Wing pilots. You may recognise a few ;)<br/><br/>We all know that rebels got the plans, but we did not know how they did it. This film answers a lot of questions and at the same time is an excellent film to boot.

"Fluke_Skywalker","7","0","6","16 December 2016"," A Force of a different color
","Plot; With the evil Galactic Empire now in possession of a super weapon--a planet destroying space station known as the Death Star--the vastly outmanned and outgunned Rebel Alliance must make a choice; flee or fight.<br/><br/>Welcome to the live action expanded universe. For years Star Wars fans have taken to the pages of comics and traditional novels to satiate their appetite for that galaxy far, far away. To follow along on the further adventures of their favorite characters and to see the things that were off in the corner or just out of frame in their beloved film saga. Rogue One is the latter, focusing on the nuts and bolts of the rebellion at large instead of The Force, destinies and all of that ""big"" stuff. Like many of those expanded universe novels, Rogue One doesn't always ""feel"" like Star Wars in the traditional sense. It has the aesthetic, it has the nomenclature, the sound. But it's a bit like spending years in the executive branch of a company and then suddenly going down and spending the day in the mail room. Same company, radically different functions (and there's an adjustment period here as a result). But I think you could argue that it's exactly what we need right now. A sorbet in between the ongoing saga of the Skywalker family and all of the mystical, operatic stuff that comes with it. But for it to have value beyond being a placeholder in between Episodes, or merely as a Disney cash grab, it has to add depth and value to the universe at large. In short, it has to make the Episodes better. Either by fleshing out characters as they'll attempt to do with the upcoming Han Solo film, or by filling in background details, which is where Rogue One comes in.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, Rogue One takes us--quite literally--to the doorstep of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (or simply Star Wars, as those of us who grew up with the original trilogy call(ed) it). You can all but see this movie handing off a baton before it irises out to the familiar strains of the end credits theme. It's the backstory of the opening crawl. The hows, the whos and the whys. It's a good place to start this ""anthology"" aspect of the saga, and if done right, it fulfills that key obligation of adding depth and value to the existing story. But does Rogue One do it right? Yes. Mostly.<br/><br/>First things first. This film looks amazing. Not just the special f/x, which are actually far superior to The Force Awakens in my opinion, but the sets, the locations, cinematography and the production design are first rate. Like Abrams' The Force Awakens, there's a clear and concerted effort here to inject as much ""reality"" as possible. And when CG is used--and it's used often--it blends seamlessly rather than jarringly clashing together (save for one instance that I'll touch on later). There's a real challenge here because you have 40 years of f/x advancement, yet you've still got to somehow make this fit up with A New Hope, and Rogue One does this exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Though familiar faces--some surprising--abound, the focus here is on a new, or at least different, cast of characters. It's an ensemble, though Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso is the lead. Hers is an arc not unlike Han Solo's in the broad strokes of it, though Jones' character is asked to cover a much, much wider emotional breadth, and Jones is up to the task. The rest of the team/cast fill in around her nicely, with everyone getting their moments and own mini-arcs. But they say a movie is only as strong as its villain, and here the primary baddie is Director Krennic. Played by the always good Ben Mendelsohn, he brings a new angle to the icy Imperial officer we're accustomed to.His is not the scene chewing, mustache twirling bad guy, but a fiercely determined social climber. The middle manager who feels the executives are standing on his shoulders. He makes a nice foil for Tarkin, who thanks to the wonders of modern technology, has a surprisingly large role in Rogue One. I wish I could say that it works, but though it looks photo-real at a standstill, this CGI Tarkin has an obvious sheen of technical fakery whenever he talks. There's a real uncanny valley aspect to it that's jarring and takes you out of the scene. That the voice actor does a poor job of replicating the late Peter Cushing's voice certainly doesn't help, but this is a situation where less definitely would've been more.<br/><br/>And then of course there's Vader. Teased in the trailer, his appearance here amounts to little more than a cameo. Two scenes in fact. But boy are they good scenes. I certainly would've have been against more Vader here, but I don't think you want to overuse that particular Ace, and ultimately I'm forced to agree with his limited use being more impactful than if he'd played a more substantial role.<br/><br/>In the end, Rogue One is an exceptionally well made, if flawed film. There are nits galore to pick, and the first two acts are occasionally clunky. It's really not until the third act that it begins to fire on all cylinders, and fire it does. Nearly everything about the last half hour or so works to near perfection, and as a result Rogue One hands off that all important baton at a full sprint.<br/><br/><ul><li>There are Easter eggs and fan service throughout, though I'm pleased to say that the latter is mostly kept in check.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Michael Giacchino's score ably mimics John Williams' ""busy music"", but it lacks even one memorable cue, and his/their refusal to use existing cues and themes will likely be a source of irritation for many.</li></ul>"
"Nixon_Carmichael","6","0","5","15 December 2016"," A ballsy flick, though a Jedi may seek not these things.
","Potential Spoilers. You've been warned, what more do you want from me? <br/><br/>Rogue One, yet another quasi-prequel (and/or sequel, depending on your POV) in the Star Wars universe. Oh, Disney. <br/><br/>There is a really GOOD movie in here, but it's quite apparent that after principle photography, the film was coldly and viciously ripped from the loving arms of poor director Gareth Edwards in the middle of the night and turned into something else, this much is obvious based on the strange editing, and the fact that most of the footage in the various trailers are absent from the film. <br/><br/>That said, I don't hate it. Where The Force Awakens was a side-door remake of Episode IV, featuring Lady Luke Skywalker, one might be forgiven if he said that Rogue One is a side-door remake of Empire, albeit featuring Lady Han Solo. <br/><br/>The film picks up about an hour before Episide IV and is an anthology film depicting the actual events of the heist of the Death Star schematics. This is 2016, so of course the visuals are great. This is not a thinking mans sci-fi movie, but it's gritty as hell at times and features a kick-a scene of Darth Vader in his prime unleashing a full blown s--conniption on a group of poor devils.<br/><br/>The obvious MVP is Alan Tudyk, and his work as K2S0, reprogrammed Imperial Droid. K2s0 is a darkly humorous whose candor falls somewhere between Dr. Bones and Marvin The Paranoid Android. This performance is truly special.<br/><br/>Overall, Rogue One is good movie on par with the better offerings in the series."
"aidanvoonav","7","0","6","15 December 2016"," Enjoyable as a Star Wars movie, but lacks as a movie
","Overall i enjoyed the movie as a whole and as a Star Wars fan (as i have already stated in the summary title). It has a lot of elements in the movie that a Star Wars movie should have. Adventure, suspense, teamwork, The Force working in ""mysterious"" ways and hope. I am extremely satisfied with Alan Tudyk's and Donnie Yen's characters, K-2S0 and Cirrut Imwe respectively. However, the other characters are lacking in depth and leaves more to be seen. Now for the negative parts. The first quarter of the movie was jump and slightly messy at times, where characters and scenes just jump from one set to the other with very little going on and very little character development. The two main characters also have very little drive and barely any explanation to why they do what they do. And the screen writing is slightly off. Some scenes just don't work and there are slight mistakes here and there. Overall, as i have already mentioned, it is extremely enjoyable but maybe it just didn't reach my expectations."
"bigmadams","8","0","4","15 December 2016"," More ""Wars"" than ""Star"", but it works!
","Rogue One: A Star Wars story spoiler-free review. Plot Synopsis: Set just before the events of Episode Four a New Hope, Rouge One tells the story of a small group of rebel fighters who give their lives to provide the Rebel Alliance with the Death Star design plans.<br/><br/>This film was as expected, completely different from all other Star Wars films. If I could be so boldit's a lot more ""War"" than it is ""Star."" However, in the grand scheme of things, I think it works.<br/><br/>The film is largely a character driven piece until the action packed final act. Mostly, the film centers around three main characters. Rebel fighter Jyn Erso and her father Galen Erso, played by Felicity Jones and Mads Mikkelson respectfully. As well as the film's main antagonist Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Played to menacing perfection by Australian Actor Ben Mendelsohn.<br/><br/>But the film also has a great number of intriguing supporting characters ranging from Forest Whittaker's aging Rebel Extremist Saw Gerrera to Donnie Yen's blind but possibly Force-sensitive warrior Chirrut Îmwe. And Alan Tudyk's re-programed imperial droid K-2SO (who provides some much needed comic relief in the film) was a wonderful character as much personality as C-3PO or R2-D2.<br/><br/>There are a number of striking aspects about the movie that you will find very memorable. The first being that the Rebel Alliance is portrayed as being not quite the noble and heroic uprising as we have always thought it to be. Individual members (like Diago Luna's Cassian Andor) are written to actually have few scruples and do some rather ugly things in the name of taking down the Empire. <br/><br/>The command of The Rebel Alliance is also portrayed as a shambles quite frankly! Disorganised and chaotic, with a command structure that leads to constant bickering amongst its leaders. The tone of the film is also honestly much much darker than you would expect from a Star Wars Film! There is very little of the original or prequel trilogies trademark campy ""space opera"" to be found.<br/><br/>But before you get turned off by that information, let me just say I think it actually works. I mean, think about it! A galaxy under the thumb of a tyrannical totalitarian dictatorship would be a very horrible place to be. Pain suffering and death would be commonplace. And I think it was long overdue that we got to see the effects Imperial rule has in the Star Wars Universe. <br/><br/>However, there is still a great deal of moments in Rogue One that will keep your standard Star Wars fan happy. For starters, several characters from Episode three or Episode Four make memorable reappearances. Many of whom are being played by the original actors reprising their roles. Others, however (like Grand Moff Tarkin) are being played by new actors with either makeup or CGI to make the character appear exactly like the original actors who first portrayed them. The effect is honestly a mixed bag with some characters looking almost exactly like they did in the original films they appeared in, while others look like lost cosplayers at comic con!<br/><br/>There are also one to two brief cameo's that will fill any Star Wars fan heart with joy! On top of all of that, there are dozens of hints and references to the original and prequel trilogies as well as the extended universe (why Disney bothered to declare it not canon even though they borrow so much from it I'll never know).<br/><br/>But if you were one of those people who were the most excited to see Darth Vader in Rogue One you may be a bit disappointed. The Former Anakin Skywalker has a total screen time of about three minutes by my count! But, it's a memorable three minutes. Besides, Darth Vader has never been a character that needed a significant amount of screen time to make an impact on an audience! <br/><br/>The final act of the film is what will get most people talking I believe. I don't want to give too much away, but it flawlessly and beautifully bridges the gap between Episode Three and Four. And the ending will make your heart melt if you are a true Star Wars fan.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an impressive gamble the filmmakers made with the Star Wars franchise. But I think it worked very well. However, I will say that I'm sure some fans will probably not be 100% won over by the Rogue One. But personally, I enjoyed it very much! I'm giving it eight out of ten stars."
"MarkFaustana","8","0","7","15 December 2016"," Poor characterizations, wooden performances and convenient resolutions but good addition to the saga nonetheless.
","I should state from the beginning; I don't think this is a bad movie, but it is disappointing, not in the sense that it did not meet expectations but the payoff(s) simply does disservice to the great story the movie promises. A rebel(-ish) scientist is forced to work on the Death Star, specifically designs a weakness so that the rebellion can stand a chance against it, but of course the alliance still needs the plans to the weapon to know where to look for that weak spot, so someone needs to steal it. This is a perfect setup which would have made a perfect movie, unfortunately we merely got an OK one. Instead of dissecting the movie step by step, I'll simply attempt to explain the weak points which prevented the movie reaching the greatness levels of original trilogy and the Force Awakens.<br/><br/>With that tragic of a backstory, Jyn Erso must have been a much more interesting character, usually good Felicity Jones gave a very wooden performance, I think the only emotion we saw from her was when she cried when she saw her father's holographic message, I get that they tried to convey the feeling of shock when her father died in her arms but Jones couldn't pull it off. Acting problems go for Cassian Andor as well; Diego Luna just didn't have the range for him to be an interesting character. When two leads fail to connect with the audience, their death at the end of the movie just cannot generate the impact it should.<br/><br/>Everyone's talking about how good this movie ties into the New Hope. Really? OK, they introduced six main characters in this movie, 6 rogues, obviously they won't be around for the New Hope so we know they will disappear one way or other. But do they all have to die? I'm not talking about a happy ending, but isn't giving the same conclusion for each of the rogue character is a bit lazy? But fine, that is a choice, they will all have to die. But do they have to die within 2 minutes of each other after completing a stupid task? The pilot died the minute he sent the transmission to the rebellion, by a stupid grenade thrown by a no-one stormtrooper. The blind swordsman walked to a stupid switch without a scratch while a dozen stormtroopers were firing at him, because he was using the Force but when he flipped the switch I presume the Force's attention was needed elsewhere, he was hit instantly and died at the arms of his friend who after being a non-believer the whole movie, decided to 'be one with the Force' and went on a suicide attack on stormtroopers. Yes, the movie ties into the New Hope where the New Hope is concerned but doesn't care how its wraps its own original characters, they all could have died along with Jyn and Cassian and that would have been a little cliché but more effective as deaths of those two doesn't bring enough emotional impact because of poor characterization and performances. But I'll give the movie K2SO's death, it was great, though that would have more impact if it wasn't jammed between other deaths.<br/><br/>There are also some details inserted into the story with the only purpose of pushing the runtime over 2 hour mark, getting the hard drive with the plans part is one of them but that was forgivable because it tied into K2SO's death but then the pilot ran towards a socket with a cable roll on his back, I don't even remember why that was for, and then the blind swordsman needed to flip that switch because reasons. And the antenna at the roof to transmit the plans...WHY? Because she needed to go to end of the ledge so she couldn't see Krennic coming behind her? Stuff like this has the potential to make the movie feel like a 'filler' cash cow and this story does not deserve that. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie presents us a great story with good pacing and some amazing fan service, but it has some significant weaknesses which are hard to ignore.<br/><br/>PS: One may think why I would give it 8 stars after such harsh criticism, as I said before, I enjoyed the movie and thought it deserved 6-7 stars but that Vader sequence at the end was one of the best (maybe the best) action sequences for Darth Vader, so that is a solid 2 stars there."

","Rogue One; like all the SW-premieres are always a fun event to experience. Fans and non-fans alike collectively get together once again for this space adventure. It's visually a big upgrade from the prequels, and it does to a certain point manage to embrace the original film's charisma. Fun, bright and enjoyable characters is a big trace -- and forget romance! This is a pure war film where companionship is everything. We follow 'Jyn Erso' and the main story is greatly focused on her, but a major letdown is the underdeveloped side-characters. They are all well presented and we get some inside to their personalities; but there's no major background nor development to characters like 'Cassian Andor'. Our main antagonist 'Orson Krennic' is very much the same. But there are some deeper layers to him, but sadly not enough to be considered a complex nor memorable villain. Because of this lack of greater depth to characters; the few emotional moments that does exist could have been even greater, because there are some great ones. The great one-liners from K-2SO is on the other hand very much appreciated, it's great that they really understand the importance of humor in the SW universe.<br/><br/>The story that takes place is full of action, as expected -- but more importantly; the characters are the major players here. A great character-filled first act, a more passive & calmer second act, to a stunning and perhaps too massive third act -- that's Rogue One. There're many characters and places involved in this story. All of this made some of the story uneven. It kept going, from places to places, characters to characters and so on; it became an experience that's a bit too far- stretched. It lost that ""wow-factor"". The second act takes a step back and didn't impress me on a personal level. It's okay but nothing really impressive got to me. But I am confident enough to say to all the big SW-fans out there that you will definitely love this film, and yes there are some really impressive action pieces -- but I never got many ""wow moments"". It drags on and lacks a greater long-term stamina when it comes to action. When looking at the CGI; it's a major technological achievement, except for two major CGI characters that look all other than alive. They are impressive to look at; much details, but the way they interact and talk is so fake. Add a non- Williams score that's underwhelming, well the flick got flaws. But other than that I really enjoyed it!<br/><br/>It's a good Star Wars movie. Not the best nor the worst. It got it's flaws concerning the uneven storytelling and undeveloped side-characters, and some flaws are more serious than other. It's a beautiful story that's partially gritty and it got a stunning visualization of Vader. A darker tone, a very satisfying finale and an ending that manages to wrap everything together! That's Rogue One. It's the pure definition of rebellion. <br/><br/>*psst don't enter this film expecting much Vader.<br/><br/>Personal rating: 82/100 Critical rating: 70/100"
