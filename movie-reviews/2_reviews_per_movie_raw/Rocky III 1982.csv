"slightlymad22","9","45","50","4 January 2007"," A Change of Direction For Rocky
","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to the second sequel to the Oscar winning ' Rocky', Rocky 3. <br/><br/>After the success of Rocky 2, Sly tanked at the box office (unfairly in this reviewers opinion, as both are solid entertainment) with Nighthawks and Escape To Victory. So Sly returned to Rocky once more <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Rocky (Stallone) is champion of the world, has 10 title defences under his belt, has untold fame and fortune and is given his own statue. When suddenly a new challenger arrives, the vicious Clubber Lang (Mr.T) who Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is keen for Rocky to avoid. <br/><br/>For a series as long running as the Rocky movies, it's only natural for there to be the occasional need for a breath of fresh air - a fresh perspective on a tried and tested formula. After the last movie relied heavily on the first movie, a fresh rethink was called for by creator/writer, director and star Stallone despite the previous film's box office success. <br/><br/>After meddling with scripts and the movies editing on his last two pictures Stallone is back in full creative control. And it's to the movies benefit. Stallone is at his best when playing Rocky--it is his vision and his creation--and despite what Hollywood wants us to think, he is not a bad director either.<br/><br/>From the supercharged ""Eye of the Tiger"" opening this film just does not let up. All of the cast are great, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant-But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Mr .T is perfect as Clubber Lang a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. I still say Mike Tyson stole Clubber Lnag's act!!The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors.<br/><br/>This movie is a must for anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!!"
"ivo-cobra8","10","42","47","3 November 2015"," Rise and fall from grace - undoubtedly tied best classic movie with IV!
","Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. It is my third favorite Rocky film. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.<br/><br/>Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. <br/><br/>Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said ""Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning."" That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! <br/><br/>Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! <br/><br/>I love this film it is my third best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky IV. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. <br/><br/>Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. <br/><br/>Rocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.<br/><br/>9.5/10 Grade: A"
"MR_Heraclius","8","39","44","13 February 2020"," Rocky
","'Rocky III' is a very good entry in the series, though the quality does drop off just a little bit. The plot in III is more predictable than I or II, with the overall pacing a little off too. The cast remain in strong form, as does Bill Conti's music."
"Aaron1375","8","18","19","7 March 2009"," Oddly enough, my favorite Rocky movie.
","This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies. The fights are different here too, as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films, but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting. In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling, Thunderlipps (Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie, then again it is not really a stretch). This match is rather entertaining and funny, but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt, the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr. T. Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter. Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor. Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born. The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight. Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies, it to me is still my favorite."
"eservina","10","32","37","27 April 2005"," Without a doubt the best film of the series...
","Rocky 3 is without a doubt the best film in the series. Rocky I and II are tremendous films that focus more on Rocky and Adrian's love for one another and their journey from unhappiness to complete fulfillment. Rocky IV while visually stunning, is verging on SCI-FI it is so unrealistic( I still can't get over 2000PSI!!) and Rocky V makes the whole journey seem almost worthless. But the third film in my opinion has the perfect blend. From the supercharged ""Eye of the Tiger"" opening to the classic Rocky v Apollo ending, this film just does not let up. All of the cast act their socks off here, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant- you can feel the genuine emotion Stallone has for Mickey's character and the chemistry between Meredith and Stallone is there up to the very last scene they had together. But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. Carl Weathers pulls of a huge feat in this film in that he fills Meredith's shoes so to speak- not an easy job when you consider just how important Mickey is to the Rocky films. WOW, all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Clubber Lang is a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors. And more importantly here we see Balboa at his absolute peak- technically and physically, he actually looks and fights like a man who is the BEST fighter in the world. Rocky evolves in this film into a boxer with speed, skill, intelligence and power. A triumph of a movie that I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!"
"RiffRaffMcKinley","8","25","29","11 November 2007"," Wow, Look Who's Still Got It!
","30 minutes shorter than its predecessors-- according to audience reactions I still disagree with, that's the same curse that held ""Superman IV"" in Hollywood Purgatory (or maybe lower).<br/><br/>Thank heavens ""Rocky III"" is still an enjoyable piece of work!<br/><br/>For Stallone's second shot in the director's chair, he pits his famous character against Clubber Lang, a testosterone-oozing Mr. T. The trouble is, has Rocky grown complacent in light of his massive celebrity?<br/><br/>While it does stick to something of a formula, R3 still comes out swinging, with more humor and better drama than the first two, but doesn't reach the cheer-inspiring fever pitch of the second.<br/><br/>A worthwhile entry."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","25","30","27 May 2006"," The Ups And Downs Of Rocky & Mr. T
","For pure entertainment, this might be the best of the five ""Rocky"" movies. I mean, where else can you see Rocky, his entourage, Mr.T. and Hulk Hogan all creating mayhem in the same movie? Hokey? Oh, man, yes indeed, but it probably has more ups and downs and memorable scenes than any in this series. Some examples:<br/><br/>DOWN - ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) fights an exhibition match with a wild overzealous wrestling giant called ""Thunderlips"" (Hulk Hogan) and almost gets killed. <br/><br/>UP - However, he rallies to beat the over-sized animal.<br/><br/>DOWN - In defending his boxing title, Rocky gets pummeled by a loudmouth boxer ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T.). <br/><br/>DOWN - His longtime manager ""Mickey"" (Burgess Meredith) collapses at the arena before the fight and then dies. <br/><br/>UP - Rocky's former rival ""Apollo Creed"" agrees to train our hero in a re-match against the obnoxious villain Lang.<br/><br/>DOWN - Down and depressed, Rocky is unable to train and be has lost his will to fight again. <br/><br/>UP - He finds his ""eye of the tiger"" spirit and trains with great inspiration, becoming even and quicker and faster afoot than Creed!<br/><br/>This goes on and on and on, climaxed by the fight which, of course, has another 30 of these ""ups and downs."" By the end, you're more worn out than Burgess Meredith. Mr. T, by the way, makes a great villain and the filmmakers added to the suspense using slow-motion action scenes and effective sound with all the punches, grunts and groans all add to the circus-like atmosphere. Nobody grunted like Mr. T!<br/><br/>It's corny, it's hokey, etc., but it somehow works and certainly gives the viewer what it delivers in the ring: non-stop entertainment."
"caspian1978","8","40","54","1 April 2001"," A great flick !
","Another film worthy of a Frank Stallone sound track, Rocky 3 has been one of the biggest box office turn outs in history. Not only did every Italian American run out to see this film when it was in the theaters but it made the song ""Eye of the Tiger"" a national hit. Rocky 3 was also a debut film for MR. T. An excellent performance as one of the best villains in movie history. This one is not only written by Sly....it is also directed by him as well. Check it out."
"ma-cortes","7","6","6","20 August 2017"," Charming and enjoyable sequel with the Italian Stallion taking on the brute Clubber Land , Mr. T
","Acceptable follow-up in which Balboa is willing to risk his life against a violent boxer , Clubber Lang . Officially a sequel is most a rehash but happens to be a nice third chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone . Interesting sequel that works every time and in which beloved Balboa is considering retirement , but he faces off a tough contender performed by Mister T (A Team) , being dethroned by the obnoxious , corpulent boxer , that's why Rocky sinks into a depression . Excessive confidence and complacency soon give rise to lose his heavyweight championship title . Two-bit fighter Rocky is now almost retired and has hit rock bottom , but he rises from ashes to fight a daring contender . About to be retired from boxing and back from riches to ring , Rocky takes on a new combat . Although he is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history also is panned as a down-and-out fighter . Then , ¨The Italian Stallion¨ , the one time champion , returns to take on the ultimate boxing combat , as he comes out from retirement for fame and self-respect to combat the strongest , youngest and faster contender . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family , his wife (Talia Shire), brother-in-law (Burt Young) and his veteran trainer (Burguess Meredith) . Shortly after , Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) and Duke (Tony Burton) decide to train Rocky for a rematch against the brave and invincible opponent Lang , so Rocky can attempt to win the championship back .<br/><br/>This agreeable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'. The movie works in usual manner , fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the film works . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness , dignity , feel-good style as well as the initial outing . Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writer-director-actor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by Bill Butler . The motion picture was lavishly financed by the producers of complete saga , Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along John G. Avildsen created the six Rocky saga.<br/><br/>In previous and subsequent entries the contenders were the followings : ¨Rocky I¨ and ¨II¨ was Carl Weathers ; ¨Rocky III¨ the fast-mouthed and cruel boxer Mister T ; ¨Rocky IV¨ against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren ; ¨Rocky V¨ in which Rocky , nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion , lives from records being ostracized , but our hero returns as a coach , as Rocky goes back despite his own cerebral damage through a rematch on the streets , as he fights Tommy 'Machine' Gunn/Tommy Morrison ; meanwhile , the champ must adjust to his family's new life on bankruptcy ; subsequently ¨Rocky Balboa¨ proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight . And , finally , ¨Creed¨ in which Rocky eventually agrees to mentor Adonis , son of the known boxing champion Apollo Creed . Rating : Good , being impossible to dislike , the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before , Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than successive Rockys ."
"Bored_Dragon","8","6","6","28 December 2016"," He made one more remake of ""Rocky"" and he nailed it again
","After ""Rocky II"", which is almost a remake of original ""Rocky"", ""Rocky III"" is pouring sand in the desert. If someone told me what is it about, I would be like - Really, Sylvester, how long do you think you can take people's money by simply rearranging the same movie in slightly different arrangements?! The answer is - Obviously longer than common sense allows. The movie was blockbuster, it launched the song ""Eye of the Tiger"" in unbelievable heights, and it achieved crazy success in every way. However crazy it may sound, rearranging of the Rocky story works and it works well. The story is good, acting and directing too, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the movie keeps attention from the first till the very last moment, and it really leaves a strong impression. I'm a little bit ashamed to like it, but I really do, very much.<br/><br/>8/10"
"MovieAddict2016","8","23","31","22 January 2004"," Surprisingly good addition to the ""Rocky"" series...
","""No, I don't hate Balboa. I pity the fool.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Mr. T</li></ul><br/><br/>Who would have ever thought that, after a sequel to a movie that needed none, the ""Rocky"" chronicles could remain so interesting? Yes, a lot of people make fun of these movies, but I've always thought that the ""Rocky"" sequels were a lot better than they could have been -- especially considering the fact that the first film is arguably one of the greatest ever made, and definitely not the type of film that should have merited four sequels. How many times can we see Rocky re-train and win a battle? It's always the same. Yet somehow ""Rocky III"" comes across as a fresh one-two punch. Extremely easy to watch and fun to get into, this is a retread of the first and second film. But, as I said, somehow everything seems fresh.<br/><br/>Arguably the final ""good"" film in the series (although I still consider the last two passable), this chapter sees the death of Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a fierce opponent (Mr. T) ready to take on Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), an angry Paulie (Burt Young), an eager-to-train Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and an insane 7-foot boxer (Hulk Hogan).<br/><br/>
After defeating Apollo Creed at the end of Part II, Rocky is challenged and defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Things continue to go wrong when his boxing trainer dies, and Rocky drifts into a state of self loathing and hatred. After the city of Philadelphia presents him with a statue of himself, he drives over to it with his motorcycle and throws his helmet at it.<br/><br/>Rocky blames himself for Mickey's death, and nearly turns down Apollo's offer to train Rocky so that he can enter the ring one more time and give a real beating to Clubber Lang. But alas, he decides to enter into the ring one last time, and so with the help of Apollo and his wife (Talia Shire), he trains harder and longer than he ever has before.<br/><br/>That is all there is, in short. In between we get corny dialogue like, ""You've gotta get back the Eye of the Tiger, man!"" while the song plays in the background as we see Rocky and Apollo running on the beach in short-shorts and lifting weights together and boxing and doing jump ropes. (These things may be interpreted as homosexual nowadays, by the way.)<br/><br/>
Having boxed a bit myself, the ""Rocky"" series always seems pretty close to reality. I've never been in a ring like ""real"" boxers, but I've done the same training with boxing bags and running and jump ropes and so on. It's hard work, just like it is in the movie. And this is the perfect film to give you the inspiration to work out. Strange, right? Don't ever, ever quote me on that last paragraph. In fact, just forget the entire thing.<br/><br/>The film, written and directed by Stallone, is surprisingly sweet and endearing. We still care for Rocky after three films -- and hey, as old as the training scenes may get, I still love them. This movie isn't as good as the first ""Rocky,"" or maybe even the second, but I still say that this series has a long way to go before it reaches the murky depths of ""Police Academy.""<br/><br/>And take some advice from Stallone: ""Boy, sometimes charity really hurts!"" Oh, wait, never mind. Wrong quote. How about this? ""Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are!"" Okay, it's not the next ""Citizen Kane."" But you'll be hard-pressed to find a more entertaining second sequel than this.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","5","5","2 October 2019"," Eye of the Tiger - another great classic 80's best sequel in the Rocky saga, my second personal favorite movie of all time
","Another classic the greatest sequel in the ""Rocky"" trilogy of the 80's. Rocky III come out the same year as ""First Blood"". It is a different third entry in the Rocky saga from the first two movies. It is in an Eye of the Tiger different style. After Sly completed Rocky II in 1979, Sly wrote a script for the third movie so that he completed the Rocky trilogy saga. Sylvester Stallone beautiful wrote a script, acted and directed. This was my third Rocky film of the five films I saw in the 90's. It is my number 2 favorite Rocky film of all time and I love this movie to death! Rocky III in my opinion is better than First Blood and it is my second personal favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>""Getting out while you can? Don't give this sucker no statue. Give him guts! I told you I wasn't going away. You got your shot, now give me mine.""<br/><br/>This time Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) will have to face the most dangerous opponent ever, wild Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Rocky is at top of his game, he is still a heavyweight champion, he earns his money with making commercials, he is famous and defends his title 10 times. His life wouldn't get any better until black boxer Clubber Lang comes along and chalenges Rocky to a fight. He accepts the match, but his maneger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) tell's him that his old times are over. Rocky dosen't listen to him goes in a ring and loses his fight in 2 rounds and his maneger dies. But Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) comes out of retirement to help Rocky to beat the new champion once more and rise from the grace.<br/><br/>Yes this is another best classic sequel in the Rocky franchise that I love to death! I watched this movie on VHS as a kid and I watch it over TV. I am huge fan of Rocky this was an a pair with Rocky IV. This movie has inspirational speach I would say this movie motiveted me more in life than the first movie. After Rocky loses his match against Clubber Lang his title and his maneger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) dies. Rock is dawn, but Apollo gives him hope and he motivated him: ""Look, man. When you beat me, I hurt all over. I didn't wanna know from nobody, not even my kids. Every fighter knows that hurt. We get sick inside trying to live with it, so don't back off now. Make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't."" You lost that fight for all the wrong reasons. You lost your edge. I know your manager dying had you all messed up inside. But the truth is you didn't look hungry. Now when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge. Now you gotta get it back, and the way to do it is to go back to the beginning. Maybe we could win it back together. Eye of the tiger, man.""<br/><br/>The best of this sccreenplay Sly wrote is ""Make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't."" That's right you make mistake you have to fix it or you will be sorry you didn't. That's what this movie is about ""Fall and Rise from the bottom.""<br/><br/>I love the training sequence, beautiful music score from Bill Conti. I love the opening logo of Rocky in opening sequence excellent. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber wasn't realistic boxers don't fight like that. That is why Rocky I and II succeed better. I love Rocky III to death it is my fourth favorite Rocky film. Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed did a great job acting his beloved character. Kudos to Carl when he helps Rocky and trains him to prepare against a fighter Rocky never fought before. I love the chemistry between Mick and Rocky they were a dream team. Burgess Meredith was excellent as Mickey. Mr. T was excellent as Clubber Lang, with all the candidates he got the part. When the movie was premiered Mr T whent watching this movie with his mom. Talia Shire as Adrian is a hot mama in this movie she is not shy anymore and she support Rocky in this movie while in Rocky II she did not support his decision. Hulk Hugan pro wrestler, actor, television personality also appears in this movie. It was his first movie Hogan playes Wrestler Thunderlips. Great choreography from Stallone even the boxing matches. You see Sly fighting more fighters than just one. I love the soundtrack Eye of the Tiger from Survivor the best movie of all time. I love the finale no one knows which hit first was it Rocky or Apollo.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say, but I love this movie to death I love it, it is my childhood movie. Rocky III is a great classic 80's best sequel, it is my second personal favorite Rocky movie of all time. I miss Sylvester Stallone and his movies, he use to make in the 80's and 90's. I really wish Sly best with his new upcoming movies, his health and his life."
"Kimyager10","8","5","5","3 December 2016"," It's a fun movie to watch.
","In this film, Rocky has many problems. The loss of his coach, the loss of his long-held title, makes him deeply shaken. These problems are expressed in the film very well. When we look at the players we see Sylvester Stallone in the role of Rocky, Talia Shire in the role of Adrian, Burt Young in the role of Paulie, Burgess Meredith in the role of Mickey, Carl Weathers in the role of Apollo, Mr.T in the role of Clubber Lang really did a very good job. Especially, Mr.T plays very well. It's a film that should be watched except for a few bugs to look at in general. The biggest mistake in the film is that in the first film of the Rocky series Mickey says 'I am 76 years old' but Micky seems to have died at the age of 76. It was a really big mistake. But overall it's a pretty good movie."
"dean2900","8","5","5","16 December 2006"," Favorite Rocky Film? YES Best:? NO
","Do NOT read this review if you have not seen Rocky III. This is more for people who are considering re watching it after many years.<br/><br/>I don't think many people will argue that the original Rocky was the best made movie of the series. Keep in mind I have not seen Rocky Balboa yet so I am basing my opinion on Rocky 1 - 5.<br/><br/>I don't even care much for Sly but his role in Rocky I was perfect for him as he was completely believable as the semi bum Italian boxer who was tougher tan nails in the ring.<br/><br/>Rocky II was the movie everyone wanted because they wanted to see Rocky not just survive but WIN the championship.<br/><br/>Rocky III has the most entertainment value to me because we already know the characters, we know the love story, we know Apollo Creed, Pauly, and Mickey.<br/><br/>Rocky gets soft fighting has beens for easy money and starts to get a big head.<br/><br/>Mr T making his first appearance on the big screen played the role of the young hungry fighter perfectly IMO. He was strong, vicious, fought dirty, and wanted the championship more than anything else on earth. Rocky had sense lost the desire.<br/><br/>Micky tell Rocky he wont be a part of this fight because ""This guy will knock you into tomorrow"" as only the great Burgess Meredith could say it.<br/><br/>Rocky prepares lightly for the first fight with the mighty Clubber Lang and Mickey dies during the first fight after a mêlée ensues before the fight between the Rocky and Clubber Lang Camps.<br/><br/>Rocky gets destroyed by Clubber.<br/><br/>Rocky is depressed, feels like he has lost his meaning in life, and sees no hope. Apollo Creed comes to the rescue with the famous ""Eye of the Tiger"" speech and the popular pop song is played during the movie in place of the ""working hard"" to make it more distinctly feel like an 80s movie as compared to its predecessors.<br/><br/>As I am sure you know, Rocky wears Clubber Lang down in the rematch and knocks him out in the third round.<br/><br/>The reason this is my favorite is the combination of the fact that I already liked the characters, Apollo's character is expanded on, and this movie is almost all action. It starts off with scenes from the Rocky II Apollo Creed rematch and then goes to scenes of him fighting lesser fighters. In between it switches to Clubber Lang knocking out fighters in a much more vicious manner and moving up the ranks. Rocky III even throws ins a charity match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan as an exhibition between a wrestler and a boxer. After Apollo and Adrian (Yo Adrian) gets Rocky of of his funk, it quickly goes through Rocky getting the eye of the tiger back and then quickly moves to the rematch with Clubber Lang. I don't think there was anyone who saw this movie who had any doubt he would lose the rematch.<br/><br/>The ensuing Rocky IV and V were very bad especially 5. I recommend Rocky III as great fun one night for another viewing on DVD of course.<br/><br/>At this point, the initial reviews for Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) are looking positive. I laughed when I heard it was made but I am know looking forward to hopefully the final chapter in the Rocky Saga."

","Watching Rocky 3 again  I was struck by how nice a bookend to the whole piece it would have been. I'm a huge fan of these movies  I believe they rise above the popcorn bracket they are placed in.<br/><br/>As much as i love the idea of 4 and 5 and 6 for that matter it gets a bit ridiculous to watch his IQ rise and fall through the series. Indeed by 2007 when the last is released we should expect to see a bubbling wreck a la the once mighty Ali  which might have been a nice character piece  but what we'll get maybe we'll get that one in a few years. <br/><br/>But back to Rocky 3. Mr T is menacing  Coach is frail and plucky and the Adrian/Paulie siblings continue to annoy rather than add to the story. Adrian now seems adept at motivational speaking and Paulie just plain gets on the nerves. The reason I say it would make a perfect end to the series is that a lot of things come full circle. Rocky and his one time enemy become friends  Mickey dies and Adrian blossoms fully. Rocky proves that he is not just a one time lucky bum made good by beating not just the new threat to the throne but his own fears. <br/><br/>Sure it's east to see it doesn't have the gravitas of the original but it has moments. And above all else Stallone created a character that people just love to get behind.<br/><br/>A worthy film to any DVD collection. Take it for what it is and not what others try to make of it. It's good solid entertainment and won't disappoint."

","Rocky III brings out a lot of raw emotion, in a heartfelt third sequel. This film also proves that some people have times where the motivation to want to do something is impossible to recapture, and that anyone who gets complacent about where he or she is in life will not achieve his or her full potential. However with some encouragement from family and friends, anything and everything is possible. Rocky seems to make me want to bring the best out in myself, when at times I feel like doing the exact opposite.<br/><br/>Having defeated heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, Rocky now holds the title and all of the comforts it brings. Gone is the self-doubting, small time boxer  the new Rocky even takes the time to compete in charity events most notably against the mountain of muscle, Hulk Hogan. His perfect world is rocked by a challenge from the obnoxious and taunting Chubber Lang. Rocky does not take the fight seriously  despite his boxing prowess, he lacks raw hunger of his opponent and is defeated. The loss is however is incomparable with the tragedy of the death of his longtime trainer, Mickey. Rocky is taken aback when Apollo Creed offers to train him and win back the heavyweight crown in the comeback of the century'. All Apollo wants in return is a favour', which he will not disclose until after the fight. With Creed's help Rocky again develops the eye of the tiger' and the scene is set for another powerful battle in the ring.<br/><br/>The cast of Rocky III was great once again. Taking on the roll of Rocky for a third time was Sylvester Stallone. I have watched the whole serious and his acting ability just gets better and better. His scenes along with Carl Weathers in this movie are really special. I am sure these two would be good friends in real life and I can see why they are. It was the final time we get to see the ever-green Burgess Meredith. His role as Rocky's trainer Mickey ended in this part of the Rocky saga, which for me was a little sad. He was the perfect person for the role of Mickey, as he made you feel as if he was a real boxing trainer. There was also another good role from the now Mrs. Balboa', of course I am talking about Talia Shire. She was such a good choice as Adrian. I am sure a famous actress would have spoiled that part of Rocky.<br/><br/>Yet the one surprising part of this cast is a new edition, that being the brutal Mr. T. He made his presence felt onscreen extremely well. I enjoyed how you felt he was so confident, yet he had the fist to back it up. I never got that heavily into The A-Team, but what I can remembering seeing of it was enjoyable. His role in that show was also very heavy, but he was one person you could look forward too seeing on TV. <br/><br/>The story of Rocky III was for an enjoyable one. To have our champ up against it, for me made this an interesting premise. Then to thrown in the death of trainer, a very angry opponent, who is sure that he can take out Balboa in two miserly rounds. Then to top it off we have the great rivals, becoming great friends and teaming up to defeat this very nasty opponent. Stallone is a great writer, with the Rocky franchise a joy to watch in my view.<br/><br/>Up in till now, I have not mentioned the powerful soundtracks that accompany these great movies. The main theme especially had a powerful impact on me, to the extent, that I wanted to try and achieve something that normally I would say is just too hard to do. The trumpets at the start are just great. Yet the third movie was based around the eye of the tiger'. This was in relation into Rocky get that hunger back to get back into the ring as a real fighter. The eye of the tiger is also a great song that was sung by the group, Survivor. As the movies are made in this series, the music just gets better and better. <br/><br/>So Rocky III makes my summation from the first film come true, that Rocky is truly about motivation. Yet it also shows that if you can rekindle the passion, then you can achieve more than you could ever wished for. With its powerful music, great acting and story, I am glad that by 1982 the world had seen 3 movies with the name Rocky' attached to them!<br/><br/>Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10"
"Leofwine_draca","8","4","4","3 November 2016"," A slicker beast than the first two, but it still makes for great entertainment
","Another excellent feel-good film in the ROCKY saga that had showed no signs of slowing down by this stage. In fact, I enjoyed it more than the first film and feel that it comes only just behind the second in terms of pure entertainment. Once again, the story takes a new angle, showing how Rocky's fame has changed his life and also put him out of touch with reality. During the course of the film he loses nearly everything, and is then forced to go on a journey of discovery to try and capture what he's lost. The fight at the climax has an inevitable outcome, but perhaps that's why I was looking forward to it so much.<br/><br/>The actors are wonderful again. Stallone directs himself with aplomb, focusing on another side of his hero this time around: for the first time ever, Rocky finds himself afraid, and must battle to dispel that fear. Talia Shire and Burt Young don't have much to do, but they provide the stable backbone that Rocky himself requires. Burgess Meredith is excellent once again as the sympathetic Mickey, and Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed undergoes a significant and appealing character shift that sees him switch sides from enemy to ally. Mr. T is so tough as the bad guy Clubber Lang that he's almost a caricature of himself, but that doesn't stop him being thoroughly entertaining, and he's matched by a hulking Hulk Hogan in a brief, crazed turn as an over the top wrestler.<br/><br/>The film is well made, has great music – the old favourites as well as new hit Eye of the Tiger – and the training sequences are as fun as ever. The boxing matches are slicker and more stylised than before, but no less enthralling, while Stallone's careful to keep the human drama as his first priority as always. As a result, this is another great film in the series."
"chris-hedderley","10","4","4","9 November 2010"," an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top
","Rocky is one of my all time favourite series of films and Rocky three, in my opinion is the best one ever. It gives the fans the chance to see that people can fall from grace, but can get themselves back on top and achieve there biggest goals. This is a message for all audiences i think. Its not about how hard you fall; we all saw Rocky hit the mat in round three. Its s about how determined your are to get back up. Rocky sets out to show true reality in many ways. The film shows us raw emotions through its characters and true love which helps Rocky get back on his feet. Its also proves that our enemies can become our true friends.<br/><br/>The best part of the film for me is the transition of Rocky. He goes from being on top of the world, with the heavyweight title around his waist, to getting beaten and being looked on as passed it and old, to once again proving he is the best and defeating the mighty Clubber Lang. For me Rocky gives me motivation. It teaches me that anything is possible, you just need to put your mind to it."

The fighting is of course highly unbelievable but that's fine in Rocky III because it adds to its comic value. The movie does have a couple of stale moments, but overall its well worth seeing, if only for the look on Sly's face when his coach dies! Sly isn't very convincing in his portrayal of a man in anguish... Eye of the Tiger is a top theme tune, but the training scenes between Apollo and Sly needn't have been so camp....

","The third Rocky film now this time goes back to becoming the ultimate sports picture of the movie franchise.After it touched on the theme as the greatest underdog movie in the first and the love story between Rocky and Adrian in the second,Rocky III touches the most about Rocky becoming a sports figure - his rise,fall and successful comeback as boxer.<br/><br/>Rocky III is the third installment in the Rocky film series.It is written and directed by Sylvester Stallone.He again stars as title character,Rocky Balboa together with Carl Weathers as former boxing rival Apollo Creed, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey, and Talia Shire as Rocky's wife, Adrian.It also stars Mr.T, who plays Rocky's opponent is James ""Clubber"" Lang,a younger and more aggressive boxer.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang,who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer,Mickey before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression,Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive ""eye of the tiger,"" the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed teaches him to regain his hunger and fighting spirit in the ring.In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. <br/><br/>Just as I have said,Rocky III is the ultimate sports picture of the Rocky movie franchise as it centers on his being an athlete.It definitely inspires viewers especially the young people to rise from defeat and downfalls as evidenced by Balboa in this picture.Aside from refreshing themes untouched in the first two,the movie also introduces a new single ""Eye of the Tiger,"" the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor.It became a huge hit single and has also been attached to boxing matches for so many years now just like the original Rocky theme,""Gonna Fly Now"".Aside from the themes and hit single,the performances of the cast were commendable as well.Overall,the movie provides great entertainment but it falls short from being a masterpiece like the the first movie.<br/><br/>Personally,I consider Rocky III the fourth-best in the franchise behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa and Rocky II in that order."
"mmallon4","10","5","6","17 August 2016"," Rocky III: An American Tradition
","After the recap of the fight from the previous movie, Rocky III opens with a montage which begins with fireworks and giant light up sign of Rocky as if to say ""Welcome to the 80's!""; a decade when everything was larger than life. The song of choice is Eye of Tiger, the montage is edited like an MTV music video and Rocky even appears on The Muppet Show; and all that merchandise, me want!<br/><br/>Rocky III is ridiculously entertaining while still managing to have thematic substance. Rocky is no longer struggling with fame. A man who couldn't film a simple commercial in Rocky II is now making all sorts of endorsements. He could barely drive a car in Rocky II, now he can now drive with ease. Rocky has also become a more intelligent man instead of the dum dum he was in first two movies. Not to mention does he looks different, very handsome I might add and in such physical shape. I think Stallone looks like Al Pacino here, especially when wearing a suit.<br/><br/>Rocky III brought the series in a different direction, distant from the first two movies. But despite Rocky's wealth and fame, Rocky III is not a movie which cheapens out. The primary theme of the movie is about Rocky's fame making him soft or as Mickey puts it, ""You got civilised"". Once Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters his seemingly perfect bubble of a life is burst; ""You wake up after a few years, thinking you're a winner, but you're not, you're really a loser"". This continues the series theme of being semi-autobiographical of Stallone's own life as the movie examines what fame and fortune can do to a person. Adrian's role is smaller is time round although her character still sees an evolution as the famous lifestyle has taken away her shyness and made her more outspoken and pretty hot too I might add. Just listen to the words of motivation she gives Rocky on the beach; a far cry from the Adrian in the first movie.<br/><br/>Even when Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters prior to his first fight with Clubber Lang, Rocky is training in the most superficial gym. It's full of photographers and visitors, musicians are playing and merchandise is being sold. Unsurprisingly he gets the worst beating of his life at the hands of Clubber Lang. The solution to Rocky getting his so-called ""eye of the tiger"" back; get away from the superficiality of his wealthy lifestyle and back to the nitty-gritty. As Apollo Creed puts it, ""Man, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger man, the edge! And the only way to get it back is to go back to the beginning; you know what I'm saying?"". I stick by these words as some of the wisest words I've heard uttered in a motion picture. Whenever you lose your mindset of determination whether physically or mentality, go back to where you first started in order to reclaim it. Rocky III humanises Apollo Creed with Rocky and Apollo becoming friends being a great spin on the story. I always think of his intense shouting of ""There is no tomorrow!"" whenever I need some motivation.<br/><br/>The hypnotic, uneasy music which plays when Rocky is training poorly under Apollo and stuck with the threat of living with failure reminds me of Bernard Herman's score to Vertigo in possibly the most uneasy scenes in the series. Likewise, the scene of Paulie in the arcade has to be the most surreal scene in the entire series in which he throws a bottle pinball machine in slow motion complete with odd sound effects; it's an image which doesn't leave your head.<br/><br/>Mr. T as Clubber Lang, oh man! What a beast! A true larger than life villain with outbursts of immensely entertaining lightning fast dialogue; he sure has a way with words with such a violent temper and high levels of anger. You do not want to be stuck in an elevator with this guy. Which raises the question; is Clubber responsible for the death of Mickey by pushing him to the side? Yet even close to death Mickey can still inspire with scenery-chewing words of motivation; his death being one of the series most emotional moments. The boxer vs. wrestler charity fight on the other hand between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) has nothing to do with the rest of the movie but dam is it entertaining. It's so over the top with such intense pain on display. The referee and police officers are thrown to the side, the audience is assaulted and even Paulie gets in on the action (I do love those bits of humour Paulie provides).<br/><br/>The final fight in Rocky III is the only in ring fight in the series which takes place in real time until Creed. Meanwhile, the final scene of the movie is such fun, with Rocky and Apollo playing off each other which along with the training montage gives off some homoerotic vibes along the way with sweaty, shirtless, muscular men in tank tops as well as men hugging and jumping in the sea.<br/><br/>Also, the film's trailer refers to Rocky III as an ""American tradition"". What's the tradition? Hollywood sequels?"

You get what you've already come to expect from Rocky movies- good action, Rocky's ongoing conflicts and also a little more insight into Apollo Creed who was always one of the most interesting characters in the series. <br/><br/>The only problem here is that Rocky III just screams ""80s movie"" louder than anything you've ever seen- with juiced up bodies, oily training montages and Eye of the Tiger kicking in all over the place.

"KillerLord","7","2","2","3 February 2007"," Come on, hit me harder! Ain't so bad! Ain't so Bad!
","Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 together were a nice coherent story. So when I heard of Rocky 3 I seriously did not know what precisely to expect. What would be the story line? What aspect of Rocky's life was to be explored now? <br/><br/>Rocky 3 portrays a possible problem a boxer might face after his career reaches the peak. As Micky puts it, the boxer gets ""civlized"". Rocky has achieved all fame and name and not to mention a lot of money. He has changed his lifestyle completely much to the disapproval and dismay of his wife and trainer cum friend Micky. His training becomes less intense and over-confidence takes over him after a streak of wins. He does remain the kind hearted and humble man that we have seen him as. This change in Rocky's life and perspective is a possible reference to Apollo's life as well. Apollo too was shown to be over-confident and over-relaxed in the first part of Rocky series.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we see emerging, another vicious, brutal boxer Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang clearly has one advantage on his side. His training is mean and vicious. And he is rising up...fast! So when Clubber Lang and Rocky are scheduled to meet in the ring we see the difference in the training styles of both boxers. One can clearly feel the tinge that Rocky is going to lose and he does. With Micky suffering a heart stroke, Rocky under-prepared and over-confident gets a beating from Lang and loses in the second round by KO. <br/><br/>With Micky dead and Rocky's confidence and pride totally shattered, Apollo now offers to help Rocky train once again for a rematch. Apollo however teaches Rocky to be faster and more agile. Now make a careful comparison between Stallone's fighting method as Rocky in the first two movies. He did not move fast but gave intense punches and almost had a street brawl. This is of course the reason why the decision goes in favor of Apollo in the first part for Apollo had been able to land way more punches and jabs on Rocky. And now see the way he fights in the third installment against Lang. He moves faster, has a very good footwork, excellent dodging capability and has more stamina. I have to appreciate Stallone for having trained hard to show this new ability of Rocky's. <br/><br/>The movie does get a little off the track when we see the fight between Hogan (as Thunderlips) and Rocky. The training scenes are very good but still there is something absent that was present in the first two movies. It is difficult to describe what exactly seems to be missing. The movie tries to tell that one should not let success get into their heads. It also shows an emerging friendship based on mutual admiration and respect between Apollo and Rocky.<br/><br/>And I believe that a write-up on Rocky 3 is incomplete without Rocky 3's soundtrack ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor. Was possibly a song with the best lyrics to suit a boxing movie. The soundtrack covers up a lot for the very slightly reduced luster of the Rocky saga.<br/><br/>In the end, I'll say it is a well done movie and not bad at all! It is a highly entertaining, warm and an encouraging movie."
"Robert_duder","7","2","2","9 January 2007"," An important but yet sub standard edition to the series
","Rocky III is probably one of the most well known, liked, rooted for, and important entries in the series. Important because it was Rocky's first move into main stream film leaving behind it's more critically acclaimed roots. In a way Rocky III began to start the film's procession in the same direction as Balboa's career. In Rocky III Rocky has become enamored with the life of fame and fortune. He puts aside his training to show himself off to the people, and ""trades his passion for glory"" as the famous theme song says. Rocky III featured not one but three fights and also featured big time wrestler Hulk Hogan and eighties icon Mr. T. as Rocky's adversaries. Now none of this is to say that Rocky III isn't good, I only mean to say that Rocky III falls from grace as far as the greatness of the original and it's sequel. However the third installment has some great moments that are integral to the series including the death of Rocky's mentor and trainer Mickey, in a very moving scene, and the friendship that grows between Rocky and former adversary Apollo Creed, who now trains Rocky. As a kid I always remembered Rocky III being my favorite but now seeing it years later it just doesn't have the depth and intelligence and intense story as some of the other ones.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone once again helms the project as director, writer and star. I just felt that in this film Stallone lost his touch with Balboa and the character doesn't have the same feel but perhaps that is the idea? Either way Stallone is still watchable as the ultimate underdog because for the first time we see him as the champion dealing with his celebrity status and raising his son and being a husband and friend. He still manages to touch the heart strings for his powerful scene following Mickey's death. Burgess Meredith returns as Mickey in a very good performance. Mickey is obviously dying but Rocky is almost too busy with his fame to notice. His death is life shattering for Rocky and Meredith is a sad loss to the series but his scenes are powerful. Talia Shire returns as Rocky's wife Adrian. Her performance is toned down significantly in this film which is part of where the charm goes. Rocky has always been a powerful love story and Adrian's toned down part makes a big difference. Burt Young also returns as the incomparable Paulie who still gets that laughs with his rough around the edges performance is still the same old Paulie. He hardly ever changes and for the character and Young that's a good thing. Carl Weathers returns as Apollo Creed but this time as trainer rather than opponent desperate to help Rocky regain his title after Mr. T. destroys him. Weathers is even better as a friend to Rocky because he loses none of Creed's charm and flamboyance becoming trainer. Mr. T. is well...he's Mr. T....I mean the guy doesn't change much and his performance as Clubber Lang certainly did become a film classic. His steely look and brute force and build makes him a worthy opponent but even still I never thought he had the same talent as Balboa despite beating him once. Hulk Hogan makes a humorous appearance as ""Thunderlips"" a pro-wrestler who agrees to take on Rocky for charity and gives a funny, and rather overblown performance.<br/><br/>No matter what I say about Rocky III you must see it. It's an absolute eighties classic and it's an essential part of the Rocky series which everyone must see hands down. It has it's pluses and a few minuses being a little commercially forced but it also had some very important moments to the entire series. It just didn't quite have the heart as some of the other installments but for one of a series of 6 that is allowed and it still meets my approval. 7.5/10"

","Rocky III isn't better than the previous two.  The gritty realism and characterization is no longer with us and what we are given is something that's more comic-strip like and predictable. However, although it isn't brilliant, Rocky III stands out in a unique way.  You can't help to be lured into fantasy when 'The Eye Of The Tiger' begins to play over the opening titles as we get a glimpse of Rocky at his best - beating an array of challengers in triumph.  Rocky is a true champion.  Then, we have Clubber Lang.  He falls short to Apollo Creed in terms of humaness and conviction but nevertheless is a suitable draw-up for the film's story.  The boxing champion of the world finds his world close to ruins after the all-mean Clubber causes his manager to have a heart attack and then beats him for his precious title.  Actually, it's a common case.  The bad beat the good to steal something which is good.  However, the good don't usually fight back due to fear or the fact that this isn't possible.  But you can place a smile on your face because we're in the movies, we're in a Rocky picture. Although the specific plot in Rocky III isn't realistic we can to relate it by this way.  Rocky III helps us to enjoy ourselves while gathered around the television and also in confronting our demons."

","If awards were given for entertaining surface and not artistic depth, then surely Mr.T would win many for his awesomely over-the-top performance here (""Don't turn your back on me, sucka!""). And his punches (especially in the first match) look like they have the force of one ton each. Stallone's script is thoroughly predictable and by-the-numbers, but his direction is energized and he keeps the film going at a relentless pace. In some ways, from Hulk Hogan in a redundant but fun sequence to the all-time-classic ""Eye Of The Tiger"", ""Rocky III"" is one of the quintessential 1980s films. And the slow-motion bouncing and hugging at the beach between Stallone and Weathers belongs in the annals of camp! **1/2 out of 4."

","The Rocky series stumbles a bit in this third movie. Sylvester Stallone once again writes and directs the film, in addition to starring. The plot has Rocky becoming rich, famous, and beloved as he defends the championship successfully in one bout after another. Then a hungry up-and-comer named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) publicly challenges Rocky, who accepts despite the reservations of his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith).<br/><br/>A good popcorn movie but the first of the series to feel like that's all it's striving to be. Mr. T is fun but hard to take seriously. Hulk Hogan has a comedy appearance as ""Thunder Lips,"" a wrestler Rocky has to fight in a charity event. This whole part is silly and kind of out of place with the rest of the movie. Nice to see most of the regulars back, including a smooth way of fitting Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed back into the story. Bill Conti's score is good but what most people remember from this one is Survivor's hit song ""Eye of the Tiger."" Not a bad movie in any way but a step down from part two."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","4","7","28 February 2015"," An OK sequel to the first two but lost a lot of its umfph
","For the character of Rocky Balboa, success always seemed miles away. Struggling to make it through on a daily basis on the urban streets was never an easy task. His sluggish yet innocent personality made him an obvious target to individuals who wanted to take advantage of him. For all that, everything would change when he went toe-to-toe (twice) with the latest heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed. Even after the first fight, Rocky had become nothing short of legend. As for the rematch, it was what solidified his image as the rising star that he was. Rocky (1976) and Rocky II (1979) are the two films that book-ended this story so nicely. Of course there would be a continuation that would be in the form of this feature but did it maintain the same level of quality? It's there, but not as much. It's still a well-made and captivating entry but it lacks the substance that made the first two so gratifying to see.<br/><br/>The film begins like it did with its first sequel by recapping the finale of its predecessor and showing how much of a beating Rocky could really take. After winning the title, Rocky then becomes engrossed in his fame by covering promo ads, photo shoots, celebrity show cameos and interviews. Despite this, Rocky ends up confronting a new opponent named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and discovers he may not be as prepared as he thought, so Apollo Creed returns to get Rocky in shape one last time. As for Stallone's direction on how he wanted Rocky to develop as a character, the idea was absolutely fine. When someone becomes famous and is offered riches beyond their imagination, who wouldn't indulge? The lesson behind it all is that you can't let your guard down, no matter how comfortable you feel. Nonetheless, Stallone's writing misfires a number of times in compensation for his directing.<br/><br/>The problems in the screenplay are that unlike its forerunners, there are a couple of scenes that do not add any meaning to the story at hand. Right at the start, Rocky has to confront his Brother-in-law Pauly (Burt Young) about his reckless behavior. Turns out that Pauly is jealous over Rocky's fame, yet the matter is resolved all within the same scene. Another is the charity match between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). There's nothing wrong with this match up; who wouldn't want to see it? But the fact that it did not move the plot a long in any way other than for the spectacle of Hogan Vs Stallone had no use. These kinds of instances are wasteful. Meanwhile, the audience could have had more sentimental scenes between Rocky and his family. That's not the case though. The audience barely views any family time between Rocky, his wife Adrian and young son.<br/><br/>Instead, fans see Pauly constantly complaining and Adrian saying almost nothing important until close to the final act. Along with developing Rocky and his family, his opponent Clubber Lang receives little treatment either. It's hard to say if Clubber Lang's personality is actually Mr. T being himself or not. It's also another thing when a character is determined by something, but Lang doesn't seem to have a reason. Lang has hatred so strong that there's got to be more of a motive than just Rocky ignoring his demands for a match. No one holds that much resentment for a reason like that. Lang really just appears to be fuming out of nowhere for very little reason. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Tony Burton as Creed's coach were really the only true redeeming character additions. Meredith is able to provide a touching scene with Rocky and seeing Creed and his former coach team up with Rocky is also a plus. This particular element helps humanize Creed and his followers and makes them even more likable as characters.<br/><br/>The other remaining components that do work like before were the music and match fights. The way the fights are choreographed still have life in them and keep the sequences moving at a brisk pace as if to emulate how fast the fists are flying. Credit also goes to Bill Butler, who also was director of photography for Rocky II (1979) and Jaws (1975). Also, because this film represents how far Rocky drifted from his original life (living style), numerous shots contain everything from floor to ceiling of glam and riches galore. It's definitely flashy and displays how much wealth Rocky acquired but it's all style over substance (as explained before). The music composed again by Bill Conti did another efficient job. This time when it came to contemporary music of the time, ""Eye of the Tiger"" is emphasized more than anything else. ""Gonna Fly Now"" is still in there but ""Eye of the Tiger"" was given more priority. The Rocky theme is still played throughout as well along with the softer moments that occur. It's still a decent movie but wasn't executed entirely right.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone had the right idea on how to continue Rocky's story but his screenplay misses the point by including scenes that go nowhere instead of developing all of its characters like the first two films. Mr. T as Clubber Lang was certainly the right choice for an antagonist but he too barely has much depth. The music and fight sequences all still please to a point with Carl Weathers returning but without all of its developed characters, the heart of the story doesn't feel as strong."

","What did you expect? Some serious drama? It's the goddamn 80s, and that means Rocky gets to fight a caricature character like Clubber. And throw in Hulk Hogan for good measure. All the drama and character exploration had been done in the first two films, and now all that was left was to bring us an 80s version of Rocky. For those who expected good drama, it came as a disappointment, but it sure gave us some great 80s fun. I welcome the tonal shift, and I think they delivered in terms of 80s action silliness."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","6 January 2015"," I pity the fool that hasn't saw Rocky 3 yet. It's a knock-out punch!
","Let's rock! It's time, once again to enter the square circle, and see what happen to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the underdog as he faced his greatest foe, yet in Clubber Lang (Mr. T). My predictions. Pain. Directed and written by Sylvester Stallone, the movie starts off from the events of 1979's Rocky II, as Rocky Balboa reigns as a World Heavyweight Champion prizefighter. He's on the verge of retiring undefeated when he's taunted by a contender, Clubber Lang. When, Rocky learn that his longtime trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has been lining up easy opponents all along, because Mickey believe the wealthy & comfortable lifestyle has made Rocky gone soft. Rocky must once again, find the eye of the tiger to defeat a man like Lang. If the first two movies were based off the Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner, then this film fight remind me of what would happen if Rocky Marciano step on the ring with a Mike Tyson type of a fighter. Since, Tyson was still an unknown boxer at the time. I believe Clubber Lang was based on a combo of Sonny Liston, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes. He's a one-dimensional bully with no back story or redeeming features. It made him a great antagonist. Still, I was really hoping for more from the character than being menacing. I glad, this film made Mr. T into a celebrity, but it hard to take him, seriously as a threat to Rocky when rewatching this film, due to the star going on to be a kids' action hero on TV's The A-Team and even his own Saturday-morning TV cartoon, after this. Mr. T became more and more of a joke as the 1980s went on. It's clear that the character of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) was influenced by outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali. You really do see it in Carl Weathers performance here who takes a more supporting role here by helping Rocky trained against Lang. Creed is humanized so well in this film. Supporting returning characters such as Adrian (Talia Shire) & Paulie (Burt Young) also make the film, worthwhile. Adrian is just as beautiful as she was in the first film. Is Paulie, a bit racist in the film? Yes, but it's pretty tame. I like to think, Paulie somewhere in the film, learn to respect black people, but I doubt it, but he's not the main focus on the film. His presence in the film is pretty minor. Sylvester Stallone is once again, great as the main role, Rocky Balboa. Even as view as the top man in his sport, he still the underdog when it comes to challenges. This movie shows what it is like to have everything rather than to start out with nothing like the previous movies. It show, how fame can lost a person, and for you to gather yourself up, you have to start from scratch. The movie has a lot of heart. Without spoiling it, you feel for Rocky, for the person, he lose in the film. You want to see him, bounce back from that lost. You really want him to go the distance even if Rocky is super rich, now. In my opinion, Rocky Balboa is the greatest character, Sylvester Stallone ever played. It doesn't matter, if he's rich, poor, or old, his 'go for it' motto for life is a great role model and Stallone acting shows that. This movie also have some of the best training montage to pump up. This will inspire anybody for anything. You really get what Rocky is going through. The music is once again, uplifting as hell. Not only do you got, the original Rocky theme song, 'Gonna Fly Now' by Bill Conti with lyrics by Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins. The Rocky series got 'Eye of the Tiger' by the band, Survivor. The film nearly got the song ""You're the Best"" performed by Joe Esposito. That song was later used for 1984's film, 'the Karate Kid'. It's seem like a nearly perfect film, but this film however, depending on who looks at it, might dislike it for the more cartoony action than realistic drama, approach. Rocky and Clubber Lang take a pounding in their fight scenes, but it look less like boxing and more like pro-wrestling. Rocky getting tossed around by a cameo from a wrestler, Hulk Hogan was interesting. Indeed, this movie helped bring pro wrestling into the mainstream, 3 years later when the film co-stars, Mr. T & Hulk Hogan would team up to fight Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff at Wrestlemania in 1985. That event was a success, and help bring new light to this film. Because of that wrestling event, Rocky IV was greenlight & release later that year. Would this movie have been a box-office hit if Rocky's opponents were better-drawn character instead of just a trash-talking cartoon like bullies? It's hard to tell. Its cheese factor is one of its biggest draws for me. Is the movie, a bit dated? Yes, the awful 1980s fashion trends are throughout the film, but it's a product of the times. Is the writing is sub per? No, I think Stallone deserve more credit for making Rocky into a likable boxer. He could be a little more, clever in some parts. Does the movie glorifies a brutal violent blood-sport? Yes, but for a movie about boxing, it's pretty tame. Not a lot of blood in this film. The camera work in the film are pretty damn good. The movie was beautiful shot, and the movie ends with one of the most iconic way, a film should end: with a Leroy Neiman painting. Overall: It was indeed a change of direction for the Rocky series, but without a doubt, it's one of the better films of the series. Plus, it gave us the Rocky statue in Philly. So- It has to be must-watch. It's an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top."
"Maziun","6","2","3","21 July 2013"," Good third movie
","I think Sylvester Stallone should end the story of Rocky here . It would be a fitting end for the most famous boxer in history of cinema. I like forth one , but as a entertainment movie . ""Rocky 5"" was a misstep and it's good that ""Rocky Balboa"" ended the franchise with style. Still , I think that three Rocky movies were more than enough. Oh well , I can't do anything about it.<br/><br/>""Rocky 3"" works really well as a third act of Balboa's story . It's not just another movie in the franchise . For me , it brings the story to full circle. In first movie we are introduced to Rocky, a boxer that has to fight both in the ring and in life for everything . He doesn't even dream of fame , yet he gets a chance from destiny to change his life . In second movie he changes . He wants fame and money . He loses himself . Thankfully he is able to realize that and comes back to his old self. ""Rocky 3 "" is a story about a man who lost his touch . He's the same likable , honest , good guy we met . Yet he's different. He lost his passion , his hunger , his magic (for lack of better word). He's burnt out . This is something many of us can relate to . We don't know what is the reason that our beloved director has stopped making good movies or why our favorite band can't record album as good as before . Nobody knows . It's hard to achieve success , but it's even harder to life with that success . To not fail . To not become a shadow of himself. ""R3"" is a story about how hard is to come back to the top . It's kind of a prophecy for Stallone who disappeared somewhere in the mid 90's and came back triumphant in 2006 with Rocky Balboa. It's also a story about defeating your own fear .<br/><br/>Mr.T who plays Clubber Lang represents a new generation of boxers – young , violent , aggressive , with no respect for anybody and anything. In a way he's a darker version of Balboa. T gives a good performance . He's different than Creed and memorable , so Stallone did good job with finding a worthy opponent for Balboa.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone , Burgess Meredith , Burt Young , Talia Shire and Carl Weathers bring back the good acting they shown us before. Watch out for Chino ""Fats"" Williams in small episode of drunk homeless man and for Hulk Hogan (sic !) as wrestler Thunderlips . <br/><br/>""Rocky 3"" works as a solid sport drama . I could live without the boxing match between Stallone and Hogan . It belongs more to ""Rocky 4"" and doesn't fit in to overall serious tone of the movie . <br/><br/>The fights are exciting and quite realistic, especially compared to ""Rocky 4"" (it's still a movie, so you need some suspension of disbelief) . The direction is solid . The training montage is inspirational and don't forget about great song ""Eye of the tiger"" by Survivor (it was nominated for Oscar).<br/><br/>I give it 7/10."

","The 3rd installment is better and also a lot more exciting than the previous one, here you at least get some brutality, albeit conventional one, instead of family drama; also, Talia Shire looks way better in this flick.<br/><br/>A statue is erected in Philadelphia's favorite son's honor. Balboa drinks the cup of the glory.<br/><br/>Balboa, now enjoying the benefits of the celebrity and of his fellow citizens' sincere gratitude, is challenged by Clubber Lang, a loner. Clubber, an iron-fisted giant, crushes Balboa in their first encounter.<br/><br/>Apollo Creed, insulted by the insensitive and paranoiac Lang, joins forces with Balboa and becomes his trainer, after Mickey's death.<br/><br/>Balboa and Lang offer textbook examples of how to behave and how not to; how to train, and how not to. While the overambitious Clubber Lang is a dedicated loner, and a jerk, Balboa's success comes also from a collective effort; the neighborhood joined him in the 2nd movie, his wife and Creed and others help him now. Balboa's victories aren't those of a grudging loner, but those of an open and friendly person.<br/><br/>To me, the 3rd flick is the jewel of the franchise. You get three matches (one with the wrestler, a couple with Clubber Lang). Otherwise, it remains a flick for kids, not something very raw or realist, not HOMEBOY material.<br/><br/>It remains of course unexplained how Balboa recovered his impaired sight."

","Rocky III is a sleek shiny plastic cover. but that's a Good thing. it serves to prove a point. And that point is from the time Rocky became the Champion. his life turned from being about the streets. And being about one of the people to being a celebrity . Rocky hasn't sold out. He was swept up by all the fame and all the changes fame makes, More money bigger house more people knowing who you are. It feeds the Ego. And Rocky has quietly slipped into this trap, But Rocky is still fighting. Defending the Championship against ten fighters. Rocky has become a icon. the public loves him. Then a shadow looms over the happiness like a thunder cloud at a family picnic. Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is a hungry fighter. A top ranked contender he demands a shot at the title. But in the meantime he destroys his way to the top. undefeated. and angry he confronts Rocky at a Civic unveiling of a statue honoring Rocky. angry Rocky accepts and Gives Clubber his shot. but Mickey mysteriously walks away. Leaving Rocky hurt and angry. Once they are home he confronts Mickey who tells him the truth. the beating that Apollo gave him should have killed him. Anymore fights of that type would have. So Mickey working behind the scenes found good strong fighters. fighters that would give Rocky a good fight but not devastate him like clubber. Rocky is crushed. Those ten title defenses he believes are fake set ups just to keep the Title Longer. Rocky begs Mickey to train him .Mickey agrees. Rocky trains poorly. clubber Trains Hard and on the day of the fight two things happen that'll impact Rocky forever. The first is during a brawl between both fighters on route to the ring. Mickey suffers a heart attack and dies. And Apollo Creed while being a guest of honor is treated like trash by Clubber. Clubber destroys Rocky, And the Championship becomes Clubber Lang's. Rocky is not only crushed but depressed and angry. Apollo offers him a solution. Let him train Rocky. Beat Lang regain the Title. To do that Rocky must go back to Apollo's roots and to Apollo's trainer Duke. while Apollo and Duke train the body. Adrian trains the mind and spirit. Rocky scared and angry Soon becomes once again Rocky the Warrior and during the rematch not only beats Clubber but destroys him. Rocky has come back. He has now learned the lessons he needed. Never forget where you come from never forget what drives you and never forget the people that love you and support you.<br/><br/>Rocky III some say is easily the best Rocky. And Every Rocky does have a point . the first Rocky had him as a club fighter a man no one paid attention to. and a man destined to be forgotten. until he was given a chance.A shot at the big time Rocky had a dream and it was simply to be standing at the end. dreams are worth fighting for. Rocky II was about not forgetting about what's the most important things in life are. while pursuing your dreams. Rocky III it's point is simple. Never forget who you are and never lose yourself in superficial things be honest to yourself at least.<br/><br/>Stallone once said that Rocky III was about how fame changed him. and how people had changed around him it was as Stallone said very surreal. Like Alice falling down the Rabbit hole into Wonderland .<br/><br/>And he captures that perfectly here. Creating a classic Rocky film that can easily take its place among the best. Someone Says Rocky and chances are you'll think of either the first Rocky but more likely you'll think of Rocky III and for good reason. It's unforgettable. and its a great time at the movies."

","The third installment of the Rocky franchise. This film focuses more on Rocky Balboa after he became the world champion in boxing but then falls into many struggles in his life.<br/><br/>For me, this is the most gritting, suspenseful and heart felt Rocky movie (not including the IV, V, VI and Creed). All because of the outstanding actors. The script was amazing. The storyline that is slightly clichéd but it was not obvious because many things are happening. I loved the character development especially, Creed's spotlight is on here.<br/><br/>I still loved this installment.<br/><br/>A must-watch film."
"luke-a-mcgowan","6","1","1","2 January 2016"," Solid film with a new challenge for the character
","In many ways, Rocky III gets back to what made the first film so great, whilst also straying further away from the classic formula. I'll just make an aside here to say that I don't understand why we need to replay the last scene of the preceding movie to open this movie. If I'm watching the third film of a franchise, I think its safe to say that I know how the previous ones went.<br/><br/>The opening montages for Rocky III show us a lot about what Rocky has become and teaches us so much about the stratospheric rise of James ""Clubber"" Lang. Rocky poses for commercials while Clubber thrashes himself in his rigorous training schedule. Even the film's first fight is a flashy showcase for charity, featuring great entertainment value in watching Hulk Hogan and Sylvester Stallone face off. Whilst its cheap fun for us, what it says about Rocky makes it worthwhile as well. In the lead up to Clubber's battle with Rocky, Burgess Meredith's revulsion is the focal point for the audience who are also disgusted by how showy Rocky has become. The Rocky franchise has always excelled in contrasting the two boxers and their training, and seeing Clubber's simple but determined workout contrasted with Rocky's light punches in between photo ops speaks volumes about what is to come.<br/><br/>Clubber Lang, played adequately by Mr. T, poses the exact challenge that Rocky as a character needed. When Clubber rages against Rocky's refusal to give him the shot that Rocky himself was given, it makes Clubber a deeper character than if he'd just been a brute with a haircut. Clubber wants to be the best, and its that which we remember even amongst his showy, bullying persona. He becomes a far less interesting character once he wins the title from Rocky as we see nothing about who he is or where he comes from like we did with the opponents in Rocky and Creed, but enough has been done that we're pumped for his defeat. <br/><br/>The most memorable moment in Rocky 3 is the death of Micky, and this was a bold, confident and absolutely essential moment for the character of Rocky to proceed. Losing his title and his manager in one miserable evening, Rocky is broken down and can begin to rebuild, setting the stage for a movie without it feeling like a lazy rehash. The decision to place Paulie in Rocky's corner while the fight is going in was a brilliant move by Stallone, as Paulie is completely incapable of talking Rocky down and keeping him focused. The death scene, with a grieving Rocky howling over Micky's body is powerful.<br/><br/>Apollo stepping in to train Rocky was a plot point I was very pleased to see and it had great potential at the start and paid off nicely, but the piece about Rocky's heart not being in it didn't feel right. It felt like it existed only to give Talia Shire something to do, because Adrian sits firmly in the background this time, a place she'll be for the rest of the franchise. Her concerns about Rocky's health completely evaporated - a fault of Rocky 2's inexplicable ending, rather than this film - her role mostly consists of reaction shots and tragically too- few sweet moments with Stallone. The speech she gives Rocky about getting his head in the game has some power to it, but it feels forced.<br/><br/>Rocky 3's iconic Eye of the Tiger is a delight to listen to but I feel that it could have been better used throughout the Clubber fight rather than at the opening. The recurring point about Rocky's hunger was one that was touched on nicely throughout the film, and playing it when he finally gets it back (even at the expense of the gorgeous Bill Conti score) would have felt more appropritae.<br/><br/>Overall, Rocky III is a solid film. It's got its flaws, but it's a new challenge for Rocky and a new direction for his character."
"vav-61764","6","1","1","1 December 2015"," Rocky III is Good But Its Essence is Missing
","Even though this is a boxing movie, what made its two predecessors stand out were the well constructed characters and a story that harmonized the fights with the dramatic moments. Rocky III leaves much to be desired in this aspect, even if some quite meaningful and emotional events happen. A story has some subplots but they are either wrapped-up quickly or poorly explored. The fights are very exciting, the technical aspects, such as shooting or choreography, are good, but they didn't put me on the edge of my seat. Adrian played by Talia Shire doesn't have such a strong presence as in the previous movies, her few scenes with Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, are enjoyable, specially one that she sees the need to make Rocky understand himself and recognize what he's feeling.<br/><br/>Clubber Lang performed by Mr. Tis not a great and mesmerizing antagonist, he transmits so much hatred that in the end it becomes excessive, it seems that he drank a whole bottle of coffee with a red bull pack, because I had the impression that he would explode anytime. Burt Young is Paulie, this character isn't emphatically developed, but his scenes bring a little of comic relief due to his sarcastic humor and complicated personality. Rocky and Mickey, Burgess Meredith, behind all their arguments, there's relation of love and care, like a father and son. An interesting and positive situation was the course taken in the relation between Rocky and Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers. The soundtrack is almost the same but has some good and remarkable inclusions. It's amazing that even though in the third film, the training scene follows the same molds from the previous but still is incredibly awesome."
"powermandan","10","1","1","23 January 2015"," The Rocky Movie With The Most To Offer.
","The Rocky series is an ongoing Cinderella story. The first one saw him as a poor nobody who got the chance of a lifetime, the second saw him training harder than ever to get the gold, this sees him as a famous athlete who struggles to regain his pride. This is a more unique Cinderella story, making it a great watch.<br/><br/>Rocky III has a different feel and tone than the first two. This takes place a few years after Rocky II with him riding high as the most popular boxer in the world. He has a huge house and a shiny life. The light is a better feel than the dark and dreary sense of the first two. Stallone also incorporates more cinematic elements into this. There's a charity fight between Rocky and pro wrestler, Thunder-Lips (played by a lesser-known Hulk Hogan) and it is hilarious. Hogan goes crazy and anarchy erupts. I die laughing at that. The antagonist is Mr. T in his first and best known film role. As Chicago fighter, Clubber Lang, he destroys every opponent in underneath two rounds. Stallone had a hard time finding the right actor to play Clubber Lang, but when he saw T on the show ""Games People Play,"" he was blown away and contacted him right away. T is so good, kick-ass, and over-the-top that you just can't help laughing. Not sure if Stallone intended it on being like that, but I'm glad it was. After Rocky faces ten handpicked opponents and wins, Lang challenges a soft and vain Rocky, much to mentor Mickey's (Meredith) disapproval. Lang destroys Rocky like his other opponents and he is left with no fans. That is until his old nemesis, Apollo Creed steps up and offers to train Rocky for a rematch since Mickey recently passed away. They go back to basics where Rocky must find himself again and regain the edge he lost. Creed is just as funny as Mickey. As you've guessed, Rocky wins his rematch, but in an unrealistic way. He as little blood and bruises than the first, despite taking more punches. Weird! But beating Mr. T is the the most unrealistic but. That's just not possible. But it goes to show what can happen when you persevere.<br/><br/>4/4"
"poe426","6","1","1","8 August 2014"," Rocco goes down hard...
","Suffering from what's come to be known as ""boxing dementia,"" our hero Rocco (like filmmaker Stallone himself) coasts along, milking his name for all it's worth. Everything's fine until a menacing challenger appears on the horizon- ""Mr. T,"" as Clubber Lang (an Ernie Shavers type of puncher; hence, the moniker ""Clubber""). Clubber threatens the franchise, ridiculing Rocco's mixed martial arts bout with the infamous Thunderlips (""Hulk"" Hogan). When he runs out of places to hide, Rocco gives in and takes his medicine. You can't take that many shots to the head and walk away unaffected; it's fantasy to think so. Just look at what happened to fighters like Jerry Quarry. (Many of the greatest fights ever fought can be found on YouTube, but almost NONE of them can be found on DVD. Maybe Stallone could help some of the real life fighters who fought the fights by starting a line of high-quality dvds showcasing them and donating some of the proceeds to their retirements.) I just recently revisited this one (hence, the updated comments) and I realized that it's not as bad as I'd originally remembered it being- it's WORSE. This is a comic book made for the Big Screen- and not in a good sense: it's chock full of the kind of know-nothing s--- one finds in television shows (ESPECIALLY those that purport to be ""boxing"" stories). Originally, I thought that Stallone had asked Carl Weathers (as Apollo Creed) to teach him to ""fight like a black man"" in the movie. I was mistaken. Wherever I heard that statement, it wasn't in ROCKY III- but it STILL stands as one of the dumbest things I've ever heard."
"SnoopyStyle","6","1","1","4 July 2014"," Cheesetastic Hulk Hogan AND Mr. T
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is enjoying great success as the defending world champion. His manager Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) has been picking fighters for him until he is challenged by the arrogant Clubber Lang (Mr. T) at the unveiling of his statue. Lang is exactly the one that Mickey has been avoiding. Rocky not only loses the fight but also Mickey and only Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) can help him recover from the loses.<br/><br/>First Rocky fights Hulk Hogan and then he fights Mr. T. It doesn't get more cheesetastic 80s than that. The story has all the iconic Rocky formula. He is put into an underdog position and he has an insurmountable hurdle to overcome. And Rocky has to have an opponent above all. Mr. T serves that purpose. The movie's big move has to be killing off Mickey and bringing back Apollo as now a good guy. It's a brilliant move. This is a mix of good 80s cheese and a broadly written sports movie."
"twk00","6","1","1","26 March 2012"," Not great but an acceptable 3rd film in the series.
","Rocky 3 is a film stuck in a time capsule. It is very much an 80's film. Look there's Mr. T! Hulk Hogan! Eye of the Tiger! It is a continuation of the story of Rocky's life as he lives the life of a champion with endorsements, riches, glory...but the hunger of his youth all but gone. This is a story about Rocky rediscovering his passion for boxing and it is reasonably entertaining. One thing is clear...this movie is nowhere near the level of the original film, but it holds a certain nostalgia for those of a certain age who grew up with the character. Written and directed by Stallone himself Rocky 3 could have been a decent end to a nice little trilogy. It's entertaining, and the acting is not bad with Burgess Meredith as Mickey coming off the best. Mr. T became a big star after his performance as antagonist Clubber Lang. The best thing you can say about this movie is it wasn't an embarrassment unlike some later entries in the series. I'm looking at you Rocky 4 and 5."

","Sylvester Stallone directs & stars in this 1982 drama sequel co-starring Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, Mr. T and Burgess Meredith. In this entry, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) has become heavyweight champ after the last film and gone commercial. After dealing with Paulie (Young) being drunk and jealous, Rocky agrees to fight aggressive boxer, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), though Mickey (Meredith) doesn't want him to. Mickey changes his mind and helps Rocky train, but Rocky doesn't focus. After Rocky loses and Mickey dies, former champ, Apollo Creed (Weathers) agrees to help Rocky get his edge back. Rocky soon overcomes his fear and is ready to rematch Clubber. Shire also returns as Rocky's wife, Adrian and legendary wrestler, Hulk Hogan also appears as fighter, Thunderlips.

"IsaiMegan","6","1","1","21 September 2009"," Rocky + Mr. T = Typical Rocky Sequel, good and bad. Enjoy!
","Rocky III may be the Rocky Sequel that time forgot, but it's not that far off from other Rocky sequels in terms of quality and emotion. Rocky movies usually have a moral overtone, and this one is no different. Rocky get's complacent and loses his championship as a result. He also has to deal with loss in the characteristic Rocky formula when Micky dies. In the end, as usual, he trains hard and comes back to overcome his opponent. Throw in a few appearances by Hulk Hogan and Mr. T and you have yourself an 80s movie. It's hard to know how to feel about this movie. Then again it's hard to know how to feel about Rocky in general. On the one hand, the fight scenes are totally unrealistic. But Stallone pulls you in with his emotional and pityful character. The acting is never bad. But the writing is meant to be more soap opera than serious drama. If you were to see this movie on it's own, it's pretty cheesy. But in the context of Rocky films in general, it's actually not that bad. Mr. T actually gives one of the best performances of this movie. He is very believable as the bitter and cruel Clubber Lang (try to ignore the ridiculous names of characters like these). Tony Burton doesn't get as much face time as ""Duke"" in this picture, but in my humble opinion he is the best actor out of the entire cast. As for Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, and Talia Shire, they all give their consistent decent performances. Stallone really makes you feel for him, truly mastering the ""gentle giant"" character. It is heart wrenching watching him get his face beat in, even if the fighting is totally unrealistic. Overall, this is a typical Rocky movie. Nothing compares to the raw emotion of the original Rocky, but if you like the series and you have a few hours to kill, this is an entertaining movie."

Mr. T. was a marketing choice that served for it's purpose. Heck, he was very over the top on his scenes.<br/><br/>The dialogs are cheesy overall but it's a Rocky movie!

However, it doesn't have the heart of the 1st two, although there are always tears when Mickey dies, ensuring that the emotion which made the original a classic, remains. As entertaining as ever, but we just get the feeling we have seen it before.

"sddavis63","7","1","1","27 December 2001"," A Civilized Rocky Meets Mr. T
","A lot of people didn't care very much for this movie, but personally I rather liked it. It isn't without its weaknesses, but I thought overall that it was better than Rocky II, and certainly worth watching, if one likes the ""Rocky"" series.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone plays a much more civilized Rocky Balboa in this picture. Rocky has been champion for three years and has had ten title defences - unfortunately, as we discover from Manager Mickey (again played well by Burgess Meredith), against ""hand-picked opponents."" ""Good fighters,"" Mickey insists, but fighters he knew Rocky could beat. ""My job was to keep you winning, and to keep you healthy,"" he explained to Rocky by way of justification. But a new, hard, lean and mean fighter (""Clubber Lang,"" played perfectly by Mr.T) has appeared as the top contender, and Mickey wants nothing to do with him. Rocky has become soft, and not up to the challenge. He lives in a big mansion, fights wrestlers (""Thunderlips,"" played by Hulk Hogan, in what I thought was a very amusing performance) for charity, and even speaks in a more cultured voice. But Rocky accepts the challenge from Clubber, and the movie goes from there.<br/><br/>Clubber Lang is a very different opponent for Rocky than Apollo Creed ever was. I just couldn't dislike Creed. I rooted for Rocky, of course, in those fights, but Creed was not unlikable. He was a showman, and even when a nastier side of him appeared in ""Rocky II,"" it was understandable. I felt sympathy for him. But Clubber is just thoroughly mean and unlikable. An opponent like Clubber was probably necessary to make this movie worthwhile. Carl Weathers was decent as Apollo Creed, who now accepts the responsibility for getting Rocky ready for Clubber. Aside from that, though, the performances were a bit lacking. Not because of bad acting, but because the movie was very short (just over an hour and a half) and a lot of it was taken up with training shots. Talia Shire was for me an exception to this, though. I thought her performance as Adrian was very good, especially a powerful scene on the beach when she convinces Rocky that he has to do this just for himself, and not for anyone else.<br/><br/>There were weaknesses here. The dialogue (never particularly a strong suit in the ""Rocky"" franchise) left much to be desired, and a piece of atrocious over-acting by Sylvester Stallone at Mickey's death scene left me laughing rather than crying, but I liked this movie. And, as always, the fight scenes were magnificent.<br/><br/>7/10."

","This movie was responsible for launching Hulk Hogan, Mr. T, and Survivor's respective careers (although the latter two's fame was short lived). Probably the most influential of all of the Rocky movies as far as pop culture goes... there were so many classic lines (""My prediction?  Pain.""), and anyone on the street could at least hum a few bars of ""Eye of the Tiger"""

"zkonedog","6","3","6","11 March 2017"," Rocky Goes Hollywood...And Loses Himself
","After conquering Apollo Creed and winning the title in the previous film, in this installment Rocky Balboa must face his toughest opponent yet...himself.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Rocky III"" continues the inspiring story of pugilist Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). After defending his title numerous times against hand-picked opponents, Rocky seems to have lost that ""eye of the tiger"" he had in the two Creed fights. At the same time, #1 contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T) is hungry for a shot at the strap (training vigorously while Rocky films commercials). This causes dissension in the Balboa ranks, with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and wife Adrian (Talia Shire) trying to protect Rocky for different reasons.<br/><br/>The redeeming portion of this screenplay is the continued character growth of Rocky. For whatever reason (as Sly Stallone had proved himself completely incompetent as a director up to that point), Sly just ""gets"" Rocky and knows how to smartly advance the character.<br/><br/>The problem is that whereas the first two Rocky films use the fight scenes to cap off the drama, this time the drama is few and far between due to the bloated ring time. Nearly half the movie is spent ""in the ring"", and considering the fakey fight scenes, that is not a good thing. Likely because Rocky II was roundly criticized for being too slow to develop, this time the action is fast and furious, though not to the benefit of the overall experience.<br/><br/>Another thing that hurts this series is the terrible casting decisions that is Mr. T. He turns in easily the worst performance of the entire six-film series, and this includes a movie starring Dolph Lundgren. He has no sense of choreography in the boxing scenes, and only issues a series of grunts in the acting department.<br/><br/>Thus, while ""Rocky III"" does enough things right to be watchable, it also does enough tings wrong for me to consider it the worst of the entire franchise."

I recognize the original as amazing, and the first five were on sale. Well, they have her support him, because that's what they default her to. Paulie's(Young, still gritty) racism comes to the forefront, as Creed(Weathers, less showy) and Duke(Burton, determined) become unlikely allies.<br/><br/>It was a matter of time before they'd cast at least one actual fighter, not an actor and/or former football player.

At the time of writing this, I've only watched up to this point in the franchise. This didn't change my mind on what I thought watching the second installment: there never shoulda been more than one movie here. And apparently I still have the worst ahead of me. Part of the point of 1 was that he couldn't possibly keep doing this, it was his last chance! The problem with a series in this genre is that we know it has to have a climactic showdown. Action flicks, thrillers, dramas... it doesn't have to be public, planned, the consequences can be purely personal. Meanwhile, here... one way or another, it needs to be set up and have emotional, not only physical, stakes. We know where it's going, and are seeing the signs. Anything that happens that isn't related to that, we know it won't prevent that from happening. You can also only go so far, intending to top what came before, without getting unrealistic: ""that wouldn't be allowed, it's against the rules"". And this does get into that territory.

Still today, it's a rock classic and this song editing is used by everyone now ! Next, as a director, i found Sly has great inspirations with striking angles, close-up, news editing, all things that we see everyday now but back then were original. As an author, we can say whatever but Rocky has a special place in our heart as the movies are true to deep values : efforts, getting up after a blow, friendship, marital life, education, citizenship Here, Rocky is still bound to Philly, he spends some nice time with his son, he has to deal even more with celebrities and fame, and for sure, the punching winner is also a crying man ! But we got also minorities friendship and one more time, there is not a lot movies with that question !

","rocky is really cute and i like that he wants to go the distance he and adrian are so perfect together they make such a great couple. i really luved the part where when rocky was fighting for charity against thunder lips hulk hulgan when he said yo adrian catch me because thunderlips was throwing him out of the ring i thought it was funny the way he said it not because he was getting hurt. I really enjoyed the part where apollo creed (weathers) helps rocky during this dramatic time after losing mickey.he trains rocky with every thing he knows and can teach rocky.he also takes rocky to where he apollo used to train and also he meets up with apollos trainer and manger and he helps him to defeat clubber lang who is actually mr. t in real life. i think the third movie of rocky is one of the best movies of all time and is really inspirational to many young people like showing them how to protect themselves and also the motivation to complete something you don't quite think you can do but deep inside yourself you truly can become what your dreams are made of."

","I've always felt the first two movies were necessary in Rocky's story of going from an underdog nobody to a well respected world champion and that the next 4 sequels were quite the opposite - unnecessary.

","Rocky III is a sports drama movie directed by Sylvester Stallone and stars Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith and Mr. T. The movie is third in the Rocky franchise and second directed by Sylvester.<br/><br/>As we all know the movie again is entirely based on boxing and the script is predictable but the execution is touching and motivating.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone once again made his mark with strong acting and good direction. The screenplay gets slow in between but as soon as the movie reaches it's climax the pace again picks up. Talia Shire is a talented actor and done a good job. Burgess Meredith and Burt Young were also impressive but a special mention for Carl Weathers for his acting.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable but will not disappoint you. Background music is good.

But as intelligent as it is on its depiction of how the mighty can fall in modern sports, the movie doesn't really have anywhere to go except by becoming and cutesy bromance than ends with...well, I'm not going to spoil it but if you can't guess how this resolves then...well I'm not sure what to say.<br/><br/>Thee are plenty of incidental fun along the way: a fight with Hulk Hogan, ""I pity the fool"", Eye of the Tiger, Rocky's hubris in various way...it's not a high prestige movie but if you're into what it's selling, it's a fun one."

","Round three of the Rocky story continues to dispense with reality, Philly's famous fighter slowly becoming a parody of his former self. At the start of the movie, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is still Heavyweight Champion, having successfully defended his title against numerous contenders, but after Mickey (Burgess Meredith) reveals that the fights have been against 'soft' opponents hand-picked to keep Rocky on top, the boxer begins to doubt himself. When Rocky finally comes up against a genuinely dangerous opponent, bruiser Clubber Lang (Mr.T), he loses his title and develops a psychological block. However, with the help of one-time rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who would like nothing better than to see the arrogant Lang defeated, and with the support of his loyal wife Adrian (Talia Shire), the Italian Stallion regains the 'eye of the tiger' and rises up to the challenge of his rival. Dun... dun dun dun... dun dun dunnnnnnn....<br/><br/>It's very silly at times and rarely feels like anything other than a formulaic Hollywood sequel, but knock me down and count to ten if I didn't have a good time. An early charity fight against Hulk Hogan (as wrestler Thunderlips) sets the tone: this is more 'comic-book' than the previous movies, the violence shrugged off by those involved (and boy, does Rocky get pummelled big time!). In Rocky's rematch against Clubber, virtually every punch hits its target and is accompanied by a bone-crunching wallop sound effect, yet both men carry on despite a clobbering that would put mere mortals like you and I in the ground, making it about as realistic as an episode of the Mr. T animated series that followed shortly after. The iconic theme song by Survivor is the icing on the cake: this is great popcorn entertainment no matter how unbelievable it all gets."

"T-ZER0","10","0","0","28 May 2019"," In my opinion, the best Rocky film.
","Rocky III is the one film that injected new life into the franchise with a great new story, amazing music and an entertaining cast.<br/><br/>Most people think that Rocky IV is the best, and while that one did have its moments. This one to me will always be superior. This movie introduced Mr. T as Clubber Lang, my favorite Rocky villain. To me he was more of a threat than Drago. He was loud, intimidating and could knock Rocky down instantly. Which is why I found it amazing that Apollo Creed himself helped Rocky train to take him down. I thought it was very creative on Sylvester Stallone's part to add that on the script. It really influenced the ""Eye of the Tiger"" part of the story.<br/><br/>What I noticed about this movie that most people didn't see, was that (SPOILERS FOR ROCKY IV!!) while Drago killed Apollo in the fourth film, Clubber was mostly responsible for Mickey's heart attack, which is why I think he is just as scary as Drago. One more thing about Clubber, he didn't use drugs like Drago and was still strong.<br/><br/>I really liked how this film made Rocky and Apollo friends, because it showed how Rocky always had respect for him and that Apollo was never a villain like everyone thought he was in the first two films. This movie deserves a ten!!"

","In this third installment of the saga, Sly is still directing and puts all his heart and soul into it as always. He explores how celebrity impacts a man's life; its euphoric and destructive effects on the personality. Three important matches mark this episode: The first is an exhibition match against wrestler ""Thunderlips"", embodied by the famous professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Then follows a mortifying defeat against Clubber Lang, interpreted magnificently by the dark and impressive Mr. T, while Mickey is leaving us. Finally, a reconquest of the world title after mourning Mickey and regaining ""the eye of the tiger""! Thanks to Apollo, who becomes his coach, and to his faithful wife Adrian, who shows a strong character here, when she was very shy at the beginning, and encourages Rocky to fight not only in the ring but above all in life! To hell and back: Rocky III is an effective, breathtaking, and motivating story, so much so that it is used as a reference tool in the physical and mental preparation of many people, who have to face a harsh trial in their life. Emmanuèle Bernheim wrote a beautiful book about this topic, simply entitled ""Stallone"". It narrates the tough obstacle course of a person to whom life throws a lot of hits. Thanks to the inspiration of Sly in general, and Rocky III in particular, the character is able to take the hits, go the distance and win in the end. Personally, I have also used this film for all my exams and most important challenges and setbacks in my life since 1988.
Physically, Stallone inflicted a drastic diet on himself again to lose 20 to 40 pounds through the absorption of ten egg whites and a toast per day. And then regain the same weight, in muscle mass only, during the shooting via the consumption of cereals, fish, high doses of honey coffee and intense physical training. Abnegation, inspiration, writing, preparation, directing and incarnation of Rocky Balboa; Sylvester Stallone is an author and one of the great figures of the contemporary American cinema! Congratulations Rocky and Adrian, we love you: You push us, too, to never give up, always give the best of ourselves and roll with the punches."

","Rocky III, aka, Mr. T party. I love the Rocky series and I truly believe that Sylvester Stallone gets overlooked as an actor because of some of the cheesy (b) movies he did as an actor, but in this series, he really gets the opportunity to show his acting chops. This one definitely doesn't have the same vigor or gusto as the previous two, but his foe is definitely more formidable. They made more of the emphasis on fighting in this one, which I do think almost tarnishes the story arc built so well from the previous films. This movies shining moment though is when Rocky and Adrian are standing on the beach and Rocky breaks down to Adrian that he's afraid. Truly a powerful moment in an otherwise overly macho movie.

","This was the only part of the Rocky series I hadn't seen. I take that back. I just checked. I haven't seen Rocky Balboa. Anyway, this was a real treat. I didn't think he could make yet another movie about boxing and still make it compelling--but he did. I think because I never took Mr. T seriously even as a kid I thought that part three was going to be a step back and part four was his rebound. Now having seen part three I'm truly impressed.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this was the funniest of them so far but not in a farcical way. The comedy actually fit in with the movie. In this episode Rocky is nearing retirement but still in fighting shape. His newest foe, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), is a hungry, vicious, animal and he behaves like it at all times. Rocky is going to have to be innovative to defeat him and that's where Apollo Creed steps in.<br/><br/>Even though there were more laughs in this movie it was sobering too. Rocky had to do some introspection and almost redefine himself. The dialogue throughout was good and very revealing about each character. This was another quality Rocky."

","Rocky III is an awesome film which has excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Mr. T as Clubber lang and Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips. This film is much better than Rocky IV because it doesn't lack things which Rocky IV does. Rocky III is a very brutal film with awesome action. Rockys opponent the very brutal and ferocious Clubber Lang(played by Mr. T) has a lot of hate for Rocky and thinks too much of himself and thinks that he's the only champion boxer and that Rocky is a wimp. When asked by people who Interview Clubber Lang what's he going to do to Rocky, Clubber Lang says things such as ''Destroy him'', ''Kill Him'' and loads of other things showing his hate for Rocky. He also is a very loud, arrogant, aggressive and rude boxer and is very disrespectful when around other people threatening them and also telling them to ''Shut Up''. Clubber Langs fighting in this film is much more better than Ivan Dragos from Rocky IV. Clubber Langs punches are fast, brutal and very powerful and he is a killer in the ring when fighting. Also in this film Mr. T is awesome as Clubber Lang a great adversary for Rocky and the power and the physical and verbal anger and hatred his character displays in the ring towards Rocky is full of intensity and is just awesome. You didn't get this from Ivan Drago in Rocky IV and Clubber really knows how to express his thoughts, opinions and feelings towards Rocky excellently. Rocky III is a very intense film and that's what I absolutely love about this film compared to Rocky IV. Rocky IV is a bit intense but not as intense as Rocky III. The first Rocky film is the best but Rocky III is a film which beats a lot of the other Rocky films and is much more better than them. Films such as Rocky II, Rocky IV, Rocky V etc are no way as good or better than Rocky III. Rocky III is filled with awesome and powerful action and lots of more great things. When getting the correct training from Apollo Creed after getting knocked out by the dangerous Clubber Lang, Apollo wants Rocky to have the faith in himself as boxer and gives Rocky the proper training before Rocky goes in for a rematch against Clubber Lang. Again in the rematch you see Clubber Langs fast, brutal and very powerful punches which are awesome, but when Rocky tells Clubber to knock him out and blocks the punches that Rocky gets, the film gets even better and then Rocky starts doing some very powerful punches on Clubber Lang and eventually knocking out Clubber and winning the match. Rocky III is really a film that I think is absolutely awesome and I definitely will watch it again. This film is definitely what I would say as being the 2nd best Rocky film in the Rocky film series and deserves higher than 6.8/10. I give this film 9.7/10."

","I've always loved this installment in the Rocky series. It was actually the first one that I saw when I was a kid and at the time thought it was the best one. However, in retrospect it was really more about money, commercialism and excess in the 80's. I would say Vince Mcmahon of the WWE has Stallone to thank, because of the great exposure he brought to Hulk Hogan, Mr. T for that matter, and professional wrestling. The pacing of the movie is faster and more intense than the first two movies, however Rocky sort of became what you didn't like. He's got loads of money, and he not the down and out paluka that he used to be, although at one point of the movie he is. It's definitely not the worst of the series but slightly lacks the heart of the first two movies, partially because of the death of Burgess Meredith's character Mickey. Still an exciting sequel"

","Rocky III (1982) is an American sports drama film starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, and Mr. T. The film was written by and directed by Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>The film starts with the classic ""ROCKY III"" side-scrolling intro , this time with The Ring Heavyweight Championship Title Belt in the background instead of a black background that was used in ROCKY (1976) and ROCKY II (1979). The film has a flashback of what happened from the previous installment, ROCKY II. <br/><br/>We see the rematch between Rocky Balboa (The Challenger) and World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed. Both of the men after 14 rounds of intense fighting collapse to the ground. If Creed makes it back up, he retains the title. If Rocky makes it up, he is the new Heavyweight Champion of the World. If neither make it up, it is a draw and Creed automatically retains the title. Rocky makes it up while Apollo collapses. Rocky shocks the world and is crowned the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. He throws the title over his shoulder and gives Mickey a hug in the final scene. <br/><br/>After the flashback/intro, we are introduced to the beginning of ROCKY III. After winning the World Heavyweight Championship from Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) enjoys the rich life. He has had 10 title defenses and has won each and every won of them. He is currently on top of the world. 
He and his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire) are living very prosperous and have nothing to worry about. Rocky has now made millions of dollars and millions of fans across the world. Rocky goes to a press conference where he is awarded a statue of himself placed at the top of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Adrian and Rocky's trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) are with him as well. This is where Rocky announces his retirement. That is, until the #1 Ranked Heavyweight Contender - James ""Clubber"" Lang (Mr. T.) challenges him to a Championship bout. Rocky accepts the offer. Mickey is hesitant at first but Rocky convinces him to train him. Rocky, filled with the fans and money, becomes over confident with this fight. Mickey, however, wants him and Rocky to go back to the old gym and make Rocky train hard. Rocky declines. Eventually, the fight takes place. Mickey has a heart attack and is in critical condition. Rocky hesitates to go out and fight because of Mickey's health. He asks Adrian what to do. Mickey yells at him and tells him to go out and fight using a passionate tone. Rocky, taking Mickey's advice, goes out and fights Clubber. Rocky, undetermined and under confident from Mickey's heart problem, gets KO'd by Clubber Lang in the 2nd Round and loses the title. CLUBBER LANG is the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. After the fight, Rocky rushes to Mickey's side and talks to him. Mickey expresses his admiration and respect for Rocky before slowly fading away. Mickey dies on the spot. <br/><br/>Shortly after Mickey's death, Rocky and Adrian have a funeral for Mickey. The funeral is very short and very private. After the funeral, Rocky drives on his motorcycle through Philadelphia. He visits the ""ROCKY"" statue mentioned earlier in the film and he throws his helmet at the statue out of anger as to what has happened. He goes and visits ""Mighty Mick's Boxing"" Gym, which was were Rocky trained with Mickey before he died. He reminisces his past days. Former World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) talks to Rocky and offers to train him for a rematch with Clubber Lang. Rocky accepts. Rocky, Adrian, Apollo, and Paulie (Rocky's friend; Adrian's brother) (Burt Young) go to California. Apollo trains Rocky there at Tough Gym where Apollo started training as a boxer. Rocky starts training like a bum afraid of the fight and having little confidence in himself. Apollo and Adrian encourage him to fight with full 100% heart, but for himself. Not over Mickey's death, not for the money or fans, and not for the title. Rocky then puts 100% into his training. We are shown a training montage with Creed training Rocky and Creed running with Rocky across the beach. <br/><br/>The rematch takes place at Madison Square Garden. Apollo wants Rocky to wear his ""American"" (Red, White, and Blue) trunks that Creed wore in the original fight with Rocky Balboa from the original ROCKY (1976). Rocky agrees and Apollo mentions a favor that Rocky owes him after the fight is over. <br/><br/>Rocky and Clubber head into the ring with their crew at ringside. The fight begins. Rocky and Clubber go head to head. Rocky then uses his stamina and lets the champ beat him up really hard. Rocky waits until Clubber is tired and then goes in with the punches. Rocky KO'S Clubber Lang in the 3rd Round. Rocky exhausted from the match, joins with Adrian, Paulie, and Creed. Rocky Balboa is for a second time crowned the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. <br/><br/>Rocky joins Creed in the gym for a fight behind closed doors with no press or media. Just a fair fight. Rocky and Apollo go in with punches and the film ends with Rocky and Creed fighting. It is unknown who wins the fight. End Credits. <br/><br/>""Rocky III"" was made on a budget of $17,000,000. The film grossed $270,000,000, making it the 2nd most successful film financially in the entire series.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone returned to direct ROCKY III (1982), after previously directing ROCKY II (1979). He directed the film due to John G. Avildsen (the director of the original ROCKY) rejecting. John G. Avildsen rejected to direct the film because he deeply wanted Stallone to direct the film after the massive success of ROCKY II.<br/><br/>The movie's hit song, Survivor - ""Eye of the Tiger"" topped the charts and was nominated an Academy Award for Best Original Song. This song is still referenced and used to this day. <br/><br/>ROCKY III (1982) is a very interesting sequel as it is much different from its predecessors. While not as good as ROCKY and ROCKY II, ROCKY III is still a classic and one of the best in the ROCKY franchise. Highly recommended. <br/><br/>9/10."

"PhoKingNick","5","0","0","13 December 2016"," Big old dumb fun boxing movie that doesn't come close to the original, but it doesn't really need to.
","Easily the most shallow of the first three. The length of this film does hurt it a bit in that sense, seeing that it's 30 minutes shorter than the first two. A lot of the drama in this one lacks any emotional weight, so I just take this one as some light entertainment for an hour and a half. The main antagonist is very one dimensional, but he is entertaining to watch, even if he is a giant cartoon. Unfortunately, it feels as though this movie just kind of exists when it doesn't need to, but there's still a bit of fun to be had with it. The matches are entertaining, but again, there's hardly any emotional weight behind them, so they are much less thrilling than the final match at the end of the first film. All in all, if you enjoy the other Rocky movies and what to be mildly entertained for a solid hour and a half and not really care about any good drama, then by all means pop this baby in."

","It doesn't have the depth and heart that the first one did. But it's still a alright sequel in the franchise, not great but it's a alright watch. So Rocky is back, the boxer with the heart of gold is back again. He may not be the brightest boxer, but he has heart and he has the eye of the tiger. So it's basically a movie with a boxer with a heart of gold, but lacks much emotional depth and heart compared to the first one. But than again it's really difficult to top the first ""Rocky"" film. The film is about Rocky's passion in the boxing game, his relationship with Rocky's coach Mickey (who is sort of a plot device in this). And his relationship with Apollo Creed, who becomes his new coach. That teaches Rocky to become a more confident, hungry, flexible and rhythmic fighter. To go against one of the most iconic Rocky opponent in the franchise Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is such a stereotypical opposing boxer who seems to be a utter jerk just for the sake of being a jerk. It also has a returning character that probably no one wanted, Paulie. If Rocky Balboa is a man of heart and integrity, Paulie is the opposite. Overall this is a good fast-paced installment in the ""Rocky"" franchise that is worth a watch. It does seem sort of commercial at times, with Hulk Hogan making a cameo appearance.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","After defeating ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers) in another epic bout, ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) now turns his attention to defending his world heavyweight title by defeating 10 different challengers over the course of 3 years. However, there is one challenger his manager ""Micky Goldmill"" (Burgess Meredith) has not scheduled and his name is ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T) who has advanced through the rankings and has now become the #1 challenger. Yet even though Rocky wants to postpone his retirement and fight Clubber Lang, Mickey still wants nothing to do with it because he has seen just how powerful Clubber Lang is and doesn't think fighting him is in Rocky's best interest. But Rocky persists and Mickey reluctantly agrees. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--even though it may not be the best in the series--it is my favorite of the bunch. Admittedly, it's not as deep as ""Rocky"" or even possibly ""Rocky II"". But it has more action and excitement. Likewise, despite the fact that Mr. T was nominated for a ""Razzie Award"" for his performance, I thought he performed rather well given his particular role. Additionally, I thought Carl Weathers did a fine job as well. In any case, while it may not have been up to the same standard as ""Rocky"", I thought it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

After the success of R-2, he redid his body, his look, and his self confidence. He wrote and directed R-3.

The premise of the film sees rocky in the high life after winning the title until he is faced with a new young hungry challenger. Sylvester Stallone is back as rocky in this film and wrote and directed this film. He is great in this film, it shows a different side of rocky in this film and he does a great job. The supporting cast is also great, adrians character is good because of how her relationship with rocky develops and it works in this film. Carl weathers is back as apollo creed and this is the best portrayal of the character yet as his relationship with rocky being much better in this film and humanizing. Micky is back and even though he isn't in the film a huge deal he does a great job. This film introduced Mr t as clubber lang and he was a really good villain in this film. The story of the film is decent and the redemption story really works in this film. However, this is a shorter film and it doesn't hit the emotional level that you want it too. The script is alright with some good humour but SD I said the drama sometimes doesn't hit as strongly as you want it too. The style is alright with some decent boxing scenes but it doesn't hit the levels of the previous films. Overall this is a good third film that if your a fan of boxing movies you should see."

","In the summer of 1982 I recall the attack of the sequels for any or all franchises. This was one of the reasons that may have been tough promoting another ""Rocky"" movie-but alas another mega hit was made. I always respected the original Oscar winner for being original and a very personal story I felt to it's star. But for the life of me I never felt it's power until it's final shot. There was already a long awaited rematch that everyone was always curious about if you asked the average ""Rocky"" fan and they delivered in ""Rocky II."" So to come back and try to convince fans that ""The Italian Stallion"" had some more magic would be hard trick. The opening scenes start where the 2nd film ended him triumphant in his re-match with Apollo. From there we're given a montage of his success in boxing since he beat Apollo. We're also simultaneously introduced to his new adversary played by that's right Mr.T. Why does all of this work? As much as glossy TV ad take over of Hollywood into movies there's been cool things and they're have been unforgivable things. This movie implements those things into the story using visual and music perfectly. If you don't start singing along to that cheesy classic Survivor theme song then this movie is not for you."

","In ""Rocky III"", we're so far from the atmosphere of the previous films that the result could have been disastrous if it wasn't (again) for the characters and their genuine appeal. They're all here, Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo, the fantastic five embarked for the last time together for one of the most defining film of the flamboyant 80's, the third opus of the ""Rocky"" series.<br/><br/>On the surface, Stallone really took the distance from the first two films, featuring a Rocky Balboa at the pinnacle of his boxing career, the undefeated Heavy Weight Champion of the World. The Italian Stallion's success even mirrors Sly's iconic status in the 80's: the movie begins with a clever montage featuring Sly himself after the first ""Rocky"" launched his career, it's a whole different mood, forget the austere Philadelphian streets and say hello to the 80's with its lot of action, glitter and cringe-worthy over-the-top moments (gay ballade on the beach, the infamous boxing/wrestling gala fight etc.) and of course, the hit-song that plays as a fitting subtitle: ""Eye of the Tiger"". Say anything about Stallone and his ""Rocky"" series, but no one can deny that the guy named Sly knew how to create an impact.<br/><br/>The first booming notes of ""Eye the Tiger"" resonate as a hymn for passion, hunger for fight, and thirst for victory, the 70's are over when the world needed an underdog hero going the distance, no place for the small players, it's all about winning and fighting and defeating, while Stallone created another cinematic icon that defined the 80's through John Rambo. ""Rocky III"" had to stand out for some values that are less appealing now, and this is why the first opus is still the one that stood the test of time. Still, the catchy Oscar-nominated 'Tiger' song injects some pep in our veins and makes ""Rocky III"" the solid conclusion of a great trilogy. And that's why we notice the flaws of ""Rocky IV"" more than in ""Rocky III"", it didn't have ""The Eye of the Tiger"", much more than a song, a concept as powerful and defining as Dirty Harry's 'Make my day' quote in the Reagan era.<br/><br/>Now, should I really enumerate the flaws of ""Rocky III""? As for ""Part II"", does it really matter? I guess yes since a review asks for a minimum of objectivity, I have to mention that again, the movie sins by a predictable script whose structure parallels the second film's plot, who would have bet on Rocky after watching the first training montage? Anyway, it went like this, first act : Rocky is good, second act : he's down, third act: he's back, with all the cheers and applauds Â… and despite all the obviousness, it works. The ""Rocky"" sequels illustrate the idea that the greatness of a film can rely on its 'wowing' conclusion. On that basis, ""Rocky III"" is a winner, not a Heavy Weight champion like ""Rocky"" but still, a film that works, and unlike ""Rocky II"", it doesn't work less thanks to Rocky Balboa, than to all the other supporting characters around him. For once, Rocky is central to the plot but not to the appreciation of the film. You can tell that Mr. T, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and even Talia Shire steal the show.<br/><br/>The most memorable aspect of the film is the antagonism and how a good replacement Clubber Lang is to Apollo Creed. Mr. T is like a mean-spirited but more determined version of Apollo, and despite what he said, I'm sure he just didn't pity but probably hated the fool he thought Balboa was. There's an interesting contrast set between Lang and Rocky. Lang is closer to Rocky's roots while Rocky became too smart, well-dressed and self-confident, it might discomfort some viewers in his first scene with Paulie but I guess it helps to build the new personality of Rocky, something that will be echoed in a poignant discussion with Mickey, who informs Rocky that he got civilized, in other words, he doesn't have the muscle anymore to fight killers like Lang. Psychoanalytically speaking, Clubber is what Rocky lacks. Logically, Rocky loses his match against Clubber and when it couldn't have been any worse, he loses even more.<br/><br/>The movie takes an emotional way, which is what the ""Rocky"" series have done best and after the tear-jerking farewell to Mickey, the grumpiest and most lovable sports coach, Rocky face a serious existential crisis. This is where Apollo makes his entrance, and closes the story's arc of his relationship with Rocky. As I said in my review of the first film, ""Rocky"" has always been about relationships and interactions, this is what makes the movies work, despite their flaws. And in the third opus, it's an extraordinary idea to allow the defeated Apollo to take a share from Rocky's victory, reminding us that Apollo's last defeat was a very close call and the Rock still have something to learn, to take his pride back. But it ain't easy fighting his own demons and this is when the shy good wife Adrian let Rocky open his heart, admit his own fears and set his mind up to challenge Clubber Lang again. The eye of the tiger is a burning flame that got ignited in the heart.<br/><br/>So it's easy to criticize ""Rocky III"" and mock the evolution of the characters, but the movie is still a good cinematic achievement, more entertaining and heart-warming than your average sports films, it works because the first two films built a gallery of unforgettable characters, we learned to know, to appreciate and to love, as if unconsciously, we never wanted the series to end"

","To start of with a very balanced opinion: I'm deeply in love with this entry. Not only do we get TWO boxing matches between Rocky and Mr.T, he even engages in some boxing/wrestling cross-over against Hulk Hogan at some point. Pretty much everything that was cool in the 80s and then just vanished is incorporated here. It's like the storyboard to this movie was entirely made up from kid's drawings, that's how crowd-pleasing it is. The action is a lot better than in the second, but this third one also stands out when it comes to the characters. You care a lot more about them this time, which makes the sentimental scenes so much more touching. Did I mention this is also the debut of the whole ""eye of the tiger""-thing?

","The Rocky saga is undoubtedly my favorite movie franchise. Having watched the complete saga maybe four times now, I certainly know the appeal of each movie individually and their strong points. Now in a series of (mostly) great cinema, it's hard to play favorites. But it is my honest opinion that ROCKY III is the best of the Rocky saga.<br/><br/>Compared to the first two films, our favorite southpaw emerges in this movie a new man. In fact, almost everything about this movie seems matured compared to the previous ones. Rocky himself is famous and successful, his features have hardened, and he looks more like a grown man. He and Adrian now reside comfortably in their opulent mansion with their son, and we see that Rocky has really made it this time. It seems no one can take the belt from him. Even the picture and soundtrack has become more fine-tuned than in the previous ones.<br/><br/>The most striking of these changes is the underlying depth to ROCKY III. To be vague, a black force cuts into the happiness Rocky obtained and a heavy turn of events turns his world upside down. It is in this installment that we see Rockys inner demons full force as he confronts his feelings of fear and inadequacy, making this the darkest Rocky flick by far. Some characters never change (good ol' Paulie...) but others develop into stronger and more stimulating characters. Adrian, no longer a bystander, is the only one who can understand Rockys' strife and in helping him analyze his feelings, she becomes his partner instead of his sidekick during a very well-written scene that I feel is Adrians best moment (and a great scene altogether). Apollo is back this time as well, but not to antagonize Rock but rather to help him train; a complete 360 for Carl Weathers' part. He's apparently come to peace with some things and isn't the same egocentric prima donna he was before.<br/><br/>Like in the first one, Rocky has to prove it to himself again. Only this time, the stakes are much higher; not only is his success or self-worth on the line, but the very composure of our most lovable character is worn down as he tumbles into the abyss of his own mental inhibitions. This time ROCKY encourages us to peer into our heads as well as our hearts. Just as we experience self doubt as we get older, Rocky does himself; WHY am I happy? What do I have that's actually MINE? Am I competent? Am I man enough? <br/><br/>Undoubtedly the deepest of the series, ROCKY III exploits all of the strongest traits of the saga and uses them to coin interesting changes. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all top-notch, and besides seeing man-thighs flopping around a couple times I have not one complaint about this movie. Guaranteed the only Rocky movie to make your hair stand on edge, this is the quintessential installment if you ask me."

This movie takes place three years after the second movie after Rocky has beaten the world heavyweight champion Apollo creed. life couldn't be better for Rocky balboa(Sylvester stallone). He now has a mansion with his wife Adrian balboa(Talia shire), He's got everything, cars, money, he's doing commercials and he's beaten 10 opponents since he became champion.<br/><br/>He still hangs out with his best friend Paulie (Burt young) and Rocky even does charity bouts like fighting against the world wrestling champion Thunderlips (Hulk hogan). But Rocky is unaware that a new fighter by the name of Clubber lang (mr. t), has been watching Rocky in his fights and scouting him and Clubber lang is pulverizing his opponents to get to the top. Only Mickey (Burgess meredith) recognizes Clubber's strength and tries to keep Rocky away from him. Mickey is only giving him fights with people who are steup to lose.<br/><br/>At a statue unveiling Rocky decides to retire but Clubber lang comes out of the shadows and challenges him to a fight and Rocky thinks he is just another fighter but Mickey tells him the truth and he thinks Rocky wouldn't stand a chance against him. But rocky convinces mickey to train him but Rocky starts training like a showman,(having the press watch him train, renting out a fancy gym where people sing while he trains).<br/><br/>Just before the fight is about to begin Rocky and Clubber almost go at it backstage but then Mickey starts having heart problems. Mickey tells rocky to just go and he does and Clubber lang whips him pretty good and knocks rocky out in the second round. Just after that Mickey dies and Rocky goes into a deep depression and almost hangs up his gloves, that is until an old foe of his Apollo creed(Carl weathers) comes to his aid and decides to train Rocky for a rematch agains the ferocious Clubber lang. But rocky is feeling guilty about micks death and he blames himself and only Adrian can bring rocky to stop blaming himself and and realize that micks death was not his fault and that mickey was only protecting him when he put him against the setup fighters. Now rocky starts training like his old self and Apollo teaches hima new way of fighting where rocky can stick and move and block. Now it's the rematch against clubber lang and Rocky will prove that even if he loses he will have lost with no excuses and no fear as Adrian said to him earlier.<br/><br/>I love this movie of the series and I think it had a good message that if you lose something and you learn from it, you never really lost it to begin with. And it takes a hell of a man to recapture something you once loved. All of the actors are tremendous in this movie. Sylvester stallone proved once again that he can act and Talie shire was wonderful as usual. Burt young was great as the loving jealous brother in law. I think it was cool and exciting to see Carl weathers' character Apollo creed to swallow his pride and become rocky's friend and trainer. And of course Mr.t was great as the ferocious, mean and nasty clubber lang and he gave a new meaning to the word tough. I think this role should have won him a supporting actor nominee."

","You can't fault the Rocky films for being so similar to each other. They had a tried and true successful formula with a likable protagonist in a setting where the underdog had to overcome long odds to come out a winner. It's no different here, and Stallone manages to get it all done in under two hours. The fresh aspect offered in this film involve the Hulk Hogan appearance as a pro wrestling heel, and the presence of Mr.T in the flick that would propel him to 'Pity the Fool' stardom. I would have liked to see Burgess Meredith carry on as Mickey, but death in movies isn't always what it seems. You've got ""Rocky V"" to attest to that.<br/><br/>So this is the Rocky film in which Stallone is really ripped due to a personal training regimen, and perhaps owing somewhat to that 'Eye of the Tiger' theme song that we hear repeatedly. It's overly done in my estimation, but it worked for this entry in the series. I know that by this time a lot of folks were panning the series and Stallone personally, but there must be something to it as the Rocky films are a ubiquitous presence today on a variety of cable channels. My favorite would still be the original ""Rocky"", but in sequels, the franchise has enough to offer for viewers if taken one at a time, each with it's own message of hope and inspiration."

On the day he is rewarded with a statue erected in his honor and announces his retirement, he is challenged by a vicious newcomer, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who quickly gives our hero a run for his money which in turn has him training with an unlikely new ally: Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>No doubt, the film is lacking some of the substance of the previous films, but three films into a franchise, it's only natural. Thankfully, ""Rocky III"" is entertaining enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome. From the colorful characters portrayed by both Mr. T and Hulk Hogan (who would each go on to become icons of the 80's in their own right) to the continuing saga of our main character and his newfound camaraderie with his previous enemy, there's enough juice in the film's tank to keep it running until the end.

","Rocky 3 started a shift in the Rocky series. Instead of dealing with Rocky as an underdog trying to work his way up and establish himself, Rocky 3 has Rocky on top of the world.<br/><br/>Rocky starts defending his title and knocks off ten different challengers. A new young vicious boxer, Clubber Lang, challenges Rocky. Mickey tells Rocky not to fight him because of the fact that Lang is a ""wrecking machine"" and that all of the people Rocky had beaten previously were nothing like him. Rocky fights him anyways, however tragedy hits prior to the fight and Rocky loses to Lang badly. Apollo Creed then decides to help Rocky train and regain the look he had when he had fought him.<br/><br/>Rocky 3 is different in tone than the previous Rocky Films. Rocky himself acts much differently. As Mickey says Rocky becomes ""civilized"" and is not acting the role of the underdog who had to work hard to get what he wants. He is a millionaire heavyweight champion of the world, not a guy living in the slums of Philly who gets a chance to go against the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky seems to be much more civilized and willing to converse in this film than he was in the other two. I can honestly say that I liked the Rocky from Rocky 1 and 2 better but it is interesting to see this change in character.<br/><br/>Rocky 3 is an action packed film. Rocky gets in an exciting fight with Hulk Hogan at the beginning of the film for charity. Also Rocky fights against Clubber Lang TWICE in the ring. Rocky 3 has by far the most action of any of the Rocky Films.<br/><br/>A few complaints. Number one I do not like the way that they killed off Mickey. I am not disappointed with the fact that Mickey dies, sometimes good characters die. I just do not like the way that he died. He gets pushed down by Lang and suffers heart failure. They could have killed him off in a different way that worked better.<br/><br/>Another thing I did not get is how Rocky has the media circus surround him when he is training for his first fight against Lang. It is a complete circus and so unlike Rocky. Maybe this scene just was included to show how Rocky had changed and show how he is losing his edge but I still think it was out of place.<br/><br/>Now for things I did like. I like the shift in character for Apollo Creed and how he helped Rocky to train. This is a perfect example of a bad guy becoming a good guy for the better, there are other times where this does not work. When Apollo decided to help Rocky out it completely surprised me and made me like Apollo better.<br/><br/>This song has different music as well. Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" is the main song of the film and really goes well with the theme of the film, Rocky getting back ""The Eye of the Tiger"". Overall this is one of the best songs in a movie ever, it just goes good with the film. When Rocky trains with Creed at the end they do play ""Gonna Fly Now"" but once again it is not the same version as used in the first Rocky film.<br/><br/>So this is the most action packed of the Rocky Series, has a great shift in character for Apollo, and has a great theme song. It is not without its flaws but it is a lot of fun so it is worth seeing for that reason alone."

After taking out several challengers, Rocky goes one on one with Clubber, after a hard fought battle, Rocky is defeated. Rocky decides to retire, but Adrian (Talia Shire), Paulie (Burt Young), and Apollo are willing to get Rocky back in shape to take on Clubber once more.<br/><br/>Featuring a cameo appearance by the Immortal Hulk Hogan, Rocky III holds it own against it's two predecessors and proves to be another good sequel.<br/><br/>I give it a 5 out of 5."

","The film Rocky 3 was definitely, in my opinion, the best Rocky film of all time. Some people might argue with this by saying that Rocky 1 was the best as it showed the rise of Rocky in boxing and the romantic side from when he fell in love with Adrian, others might prefer Rocky 2 for when Rockys son was born, doing his TV commercial advertisement and when he became the Heavy weight champion of the world, while others might prefer Rocky 4 after the coming of boxer Ivan Drago, the sadness of Apollo Creed dying and when Rocky travelled to Russia. <br/><br/>Although most of the Rocky films were spectacular, I have to say that Rocky 3 compared to the other Rocky films had so much more to offer compared to the other Rocky films as it was action packed and ongoing excitement all the way through the film. It had Rockys boss Micky dying, Mr.T and Hulk Hogan(and Wrestle-mania),the building of Rockys statue, it had Rocky losing everything and then getting it all back again and the brilliant one line quotes (ie. When the newscaster said to Clubber lang ""Whats your prediction for tomorrow nights fight""... Clubber Lang replies ""Prediction""...Newscaster replies ""Yes Prediction""... Clubber Lang replies... PAIN!! and from when Clubber Lang says to Rockys wife ""If you bring your pretty little self on down to my apartment tonight, I will show you a real man etc...) and not to mention the fact that this film had three fights while every other Rocky film had a maximum of two fights. Also for Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone)to fight in the ring two hard man icons such as Mr. T and Hulk Hogan is quite a spectacular challenge for one Rocky film to offer as no other Rocky film has ever matched up to it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the Rocky films, then watch Rocky 3, followed by the first two Rocky films for I gaurantee you that if you like boxing films, you will definitely like Rocky 3."

","After Rocky beat Apollo in Rocky Part 2, 5 years has past, Rocky is a very popular person. He is still champ and Clubber Lang becomes the number 1 contender. Then Rocky fights Clubber and Rocky gets the crap beat out of him. Rocky is going to get a rematch but oh no, Mickey is dead now, because Clubber pushed Mickey right before the fight. Now who will train him now? Will Rocky win the rematch? watch to find out. Rocky III is not as good as Part 1 and Part 2 but it is still good. So I recommend it. If you liked Rocky Part 1 and 2 you should like this. Is it predictable? yeah, maybe a little. But hey, it is a Rocky movie. Not a Shakespeare play. Not the best of the series but hey, it is not the worst. It has a good rematch. The ending is good. And it is fun. so my overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars. Watch it if you have not seen it.

The symbolism and meaning that old all the plaudits are in the first film, but this one is still my next favourite. <br/><br/>This film has Rocky as a successful heavyweight champ whose world comes crashing down when he finds out that his subsequent title defences weren't what he thought they were. Faced with a viscous challenger Rocky has to come to terms with facing his own fear of losing everything he's worked hard to build and remember exactly what it was that made him everyone's favourite underdog.<br/><br/>True it is not in the league of dramatic brilliance of the first film and it is corny as hell, but that takes nothing away from one simple truth and that is that this film is fun. From the moment of the opening montage or Rocky's successful title defences through to the end painting of Apollo and Rock in the ring it's a rip-roaring enjoyable punch fest and the truth is that there's nothing wrong with that. I, like a lot of people thought little of this film due to Rocky 4 and 5, but what I would say is treat this as it should be treated, as the third part of the first Rocky Trilogy.<br/><br/>Fantastic!"

The introduction of Survivor's musical Van Gogh ""Eye of the Tiger"" and Rocky's opponent Clubber Lang, played by none other than Mr. T.

Lang is this loudmouth boxer who mainly focuses on improving his hooks and making them to the strongest degree. He's a powerful opponent and has a different way of intimidating than Apollo Creed does.<br/><br/>Apollo returns again and is his usual self, but this time he is on Rock's side.<br/><br/>The final fight between Rocky and Lang is awesome and very well done, even though the sound effects are over exaggerated.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch!"

Rocky agree's but at the fight, not only does he loose the match and his belt but he witnesses the death of his manager Mickey. Now with the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky challenges Lang for a rematch for the belt, can he win it all again? Sly returns in this second sequel to the smash boxing hit Rocky. This film is not as good as the first two but it proves to be a really entertaining film with the lust of winning and gaining back the eye of the tiger. Mr. T gives a great performance as the killing machine Clubber Lang. Sadly, Burgess Meredith must act as his character Micky passes away in this chapter. But this is a good subplot for when Apollo Creed steps up and helps Rocky train for his fight with Clubber, making the two good friends. This film though, it's worn down from the past two with Rocky now a big star. Though not perfect, this film gives great performances. One may I say is the big brawl between Rocky and Hulk Hogans Thunderlips for charity and it's great! So if you like the first two movies, you'll appreciate Rocky III.

The early scenes show Rocky enjoying his life as world champ, especially in a great wrestler vs boxer match for charity. Rocky's opponent is none other than the great Hulk Hogan. We are then introduced to Clubber Lang, a brutal brawler that promises to be Rockys ""Greatest Challenge"". Rockys ailing manager, Mickey, tells Rocky that retirement is his best option, since he no longer has the hunger that he did when he first had the title. Rocky ignores Micks  pleads, and goes down to Lang with Mickey suffering a heart attack in the locker room. With his title in the hands of a young champion and his beloved trainer gone, it looks like Rockys career might be over...but wait....its Apollo Creed...to save the day!!! With Creed by his side Rocky is injected with a great amount of fighting spirit and develops skills that he never thought possible. Now with the ""eye of the tiger"" regained, Rocky and Apollo are ready to win back the title. Rocky III has a good story, great fight pieces, and good performances."

This movie is also a 90 minute endorsement for Gold's Gym, cause these guys are in the best shape of their lives, holy rippling muscles batman! In fact, Stallone is in such good shape at the beginning it's hard to believe that he's gone ""soft"", since he's probably 50 pounds leaner than he was in the original Rocky and is cut like a 2x4. I would have preferred a DeNiro type of transformation (a la Taxi Drive) where you actually see him become a human action figure before your eyes.<br/><br/>And, of course the fight scenes are rediculous and completely unrealistic (like most boxing films) but they're fun as hell to watch, the editing is superb (amazing pacing).

In Rocky III, he is literally brilliant.  I'm not certain of this but I think he quotes Shakespeare in this movie.  Also, what happened to Apollo Creed.  He beats up on Rocky for 14.99 rounds and then decides to retire after losing the belt.  Doesn't he deserve a rematch? And what exactly is Paulie doing here?  He serves no purpose in these movies, why must they insist on bringing him back for every movie.  I wish he had died instead of Mickey.  However, this movie is certainly superior to both Rocky IV (which is basically a bunch of homoerotic montages sandwiched between 10 minutes of actual plot development) and Rocky V (a disgrace, pure and simple).  Stallone could have stopped after 3, but he wanted $$$.  Who can blame him, I guess?  It should be noted that Stallone made $25 million for Rocky V.  The movie grossed $40 million.  Not bad, Sly."

","It is taking me longer than I expected to march through the Rocky corpus. That is because — I think — it is so unrewarding. <br/><br/>What we are supposed to get, as Stallone has said now for decades, is Stallone. He has persevered and won. He has been thrown off by success. He has returned. And then the desires: he desires recognition, height and admiring love. What we want in return is for him to grow, for us to be rewarded for investing in his life. Simply put, we will sit through this autobiographical drek if the man were interesting — or at least normal but revealed in an interesting way.<br/><br/>Well, I am finding him a bore, and these movies lifeless. The story is the same in each; the same buttons, the same faces even. Of the four I have seen, this one has two unique things.<br/><br/>There is a fight scene at the beginning with Hunk Hogan. It does not fit into the story template and likely is there as a space and energy filler. It is not referenced in the rest of the story, nor does it illuminate any element of it. Its just stuck in. It is extraordinarily well done though. The climax of these Rocky films is the boxing at the end. The original film had some energy because it was the first time we saw a steadicam. And the boxing was unusual and a but thrilling because it seemed real and brutal. <br/><br/>But we tired. By the time of this film, Scorcese had done ""Raging Bull"" which is a sort of touchstone for cinematic immediacy in the ring. DePalma was still 15 years away from ""Snake Eyes,"" which handles the rest of the world. What to do?<br/><br/>Well, Stallone has certain limits physically. Boxing has certain limits as well which unfortunately do not help Stallone. It is as repetitive as golf or tennis, but the overall event sometimes has a carnally carnivorous ebb and flow. But we know how it will end.<br/><br/>This inserted fight has the same Rocky, the same ring, the same mumbling. The same crew and their photographic philosophy. But it isn't boxing. It has energy — amazement, what seems like real pain. The man may be dumb and play dumb. But he has an awareness of the physics of spectators. And that's impressive. I wonder what he did with Rambo?<br/><br/>Oh. The other thing is a pretty delicate scripting about race. Boxing often is about hate, racial hate. You see two thugs up there pounding each other; if one is black and the other white, the respective communities emboss tribal associations on their players. The previous Rockys exploited this, apparently without thinking about it. This one does some pretty fancy footwork on the race stuff. A lot of attention went into splitting the black faces into the same symmetries we saw in the ring. Apollo Creed is redeemed. Paulie, the guy who we already know is our measure of ""getting things wrong"" is shown to be a racist, and we casually brush that off as simply being wrong.<br/><br/>Bad movie. Really bad.

This way his revenge on the enemy will ultimately be that much more sweet. It's an old hat trick, passed down the Hollywood line, and Stallone doesn't even bother reinventing it, he just plows right ahead as if he were doing something new. Maybe he feels he's demonstrating a new form of manipulation, but it's hard to laugh it off when supporting players Talia Shire and Burt Young are used so pettily and cheaply (one big scene each). Stallone's Rocky Balboa matches jabs with Mr. T. as ""Clubber Lang"", who doesn't so much box as he does pound. This entry in the ""Rocky"" saga goes so far as to make Lang a killer.

","After all these years, I finally had the opportunity to watch my least favorite of the Rocky series, Rocky III, again. With the new installment, Rocky Balboa, having just reinvigorated my enjoyment in the saga, I couldn't wait to see a true tragedy with this one. I'll say that it did not end up that way entirely. I actually had a real good time watching it. Upon completion, I turned to my friends and said, ""that wasn't as bad as I remembered."" They replied by saying, ""yeah, but I'm sure we didn't laugh that much the first time we saw it either."" So, I am not going to declaring this a masterpiece by any means. Truthfully, the score I gave it from the memory of years back will stay the same. Maybe I would have increased it if the film's goal was to be a comedy, but since it tried to be a drama, it did ultimately fail.<br/><br/>I give full credit to Sylvester Stallone. He wrote the original and ended up starring in it on more accident than anything else. He took that classic and turned it into a franchise beloved by many. This entry just has too much of its era on displaythe 80's are in full force. I understand what he tried, showing how success and the Me-lifestyle of the decade turned a champ into a chump. Some really great stuff happens too: Mickey saying that he had been protecting him and keeping him out of contenders' grasps, Apollo Creed coming to his defense as a promoter, and Adrian stepping up and telling her husband how it is, despite her wanting him to retire. The bad just outweighs the good way too much. Between the circus in the hotel training facility, Hulk Hogan's embarrassing cameo, Mr, T's street version of Muhammad Ali trash-talk, Burt Young's ridiculous remarks at every turn, and Sly's new wardrobe, I shook my head in shame the whole time. The real travesty, though, is that Mickey had to go out in such an inferior product.<br/><br/>Along with all the unintentional laughter, the re-training of Balboa at the hands of Creed and DukeCarl Weathers and Tony Burton carry the filmis fantastic stuff. The montages are cheesy and each scene drips melodrama, but the thought is what counts. Making a slugger become faster and graceful is an interesting spin and makes perfect sense. Maybe Sly just needed a script doctor to hone his good ideas into a more enjoyable whole. As is, though, while the underlying themes and progression of the series is worthwhile, the fluff just drags it all down into the gutter."

Though he tries to again make us believe he's a longshot, Stallone just can't pull it off this time because we know better. And it's not so much that the formula has changed, though it has. The first two films were not really boxing films at all, but human dramas we could all relate to whether we'd ever seen a punching bag or not. ROCKY III makes the mistake of being a boxing movie, largely pushing aside the human elements that made this character an icon.<br/><br/>Well, actually, those factors probably do have something to do with it. As do the disappointing opening and closing matches. In the first, Rocky squares off against loud-mouthed wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in a charity bout. It ranks as the most embarrassing and bizarre occurrence of any ROCKY film as the Hulkster tosses Rock around and goes berserk. In the second, Rocky tries a new strategy of getting his opponent all worked up before delivering the finishing blows. The wonderful suspense of his first big fights are absent. Instead of standing up and cheering, we merely nod at the emergence of the obvious.<br/><br/>Not that ROCKY III is an awful film. When critiqued on its own, forgetting thrills of the past, it certainly has worthwhile qualities. Stallone is good and honest as the hero, and Mr. T (in his film debut) is a treat as the over-the-top yet serious Clubber Lang. Rocky's use of his former rival, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), as his post-Mickey trainer is interesting, though of course the chemistry just isn't the same. And once again, the training sequences are inspiring."

","This movie is a big improvement over the disappointing part 2 of the series. In my opinion the movie is even on par with the original.<br/><br/>This movie quite possibly is the most entertaining one of the bunch.

You will just never grow tired of those spectacular filmed boxing matches!<br/><br/>The story itself is actually also quite solid. I just love how they made Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) fit in this movie again.

","As artificial as film boxing can be, it peaked here. Yes, the IV fight with Dolph Lundgren (Ivan Drago ) is as incredible as these RIII fights. No, the strength of the Rocky sequels is not the boxing, it's in the struggle with personal life, and the before-and-after fight scenes, that Stallone lifts up his Rocky Balboa with some good acting sometimes. But he obviously thought that the audience wanted an always coming back-machine, who securely would punch out an 8 feet alien monster if he just gets ""mad enough"", in Paulie's words.<br/><br/>No, I think the balance in this movie is brought by Carl Weathers, who's Apollo Creed gets nice to his former antagonist, and wants the newcomer Clubber Lang (well played by Laurence Tureaud/Mr. T) to smell the floor, and therefore puts his skills into slugger Rocky, and gets a rough piece of rock into a sharp diamond, but of course not without some motivation trouble on the way....<br/><br/>Well, back in -82 this was surely a smash hit at the cinemas, but the Rocky series was sadly turned into too much way-out fiction. The fights of the two first movies are nice, the one in Rocky II has some very good choreography and directing, and the same last man standing sense that of the first. <br/><br/>But after a bad episode V in 1990, Stallone waited 16 years and gave us some little more realism in the Rocky Balboa of 2006. Thank you for that, Sly."

","The third instalment in the Rocky series, the story of Rocky III is set 4 years after the events of the previous chapter and follows Rocky Balboa who, after many successful title defences & his ever increasing fame, is strongly considering retirement but falls into depression after losing the title to a rookie boxer and turns to a former enemy to get himself back in the ring.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky III is a mediocre sequel that takes the series into a different direction and features a more campy tone that soon becomes very annoying. The screenplay isn't good at all for the plot wastes time on sequences that don't even play any relevant role in the final outcome, not much is added to reprising characters while the new ones are instantly forgettable.<br/><br/>There isn't much to talk about its technical aspects for none of the elements have anything new to offer and while its reduced runtime is a welcome change, the final fight this film was building itself to ends up sooner than expected and on that scale, it's disappointing. As far as performances go, everyone fails to make their mark while Mr. T leaves no stone unturned to make his character one of the lamest ever to step into the ring.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Rocky III might be fun for those who had a good time with Rocky II but it marks a departure from what the first film was all about. There are a couple of interesting moments in the picture but most of it is forgettable. Stallone's input both in front & behind the camera continues its downfall, the dialogues are pretty much garbage, the finale fails to live up to its hype, and although Bill Conti's score feels repetitive, it's the only element that fares as per expectations. I pity the fool who green-lighted it."

","Stallone is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. Rocky has been holding the title as the heavyweight champion until he is defeated by a brutal challenger, and now must regain his fighting spirit through a big rematch, trained by an unlikely ally: his old nemesis Apollo Creed. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. This is probably the worst of the sequels. By this film the series became even more unwatchable and somehow even more redundant. This is one of those movies that the star isn't only in for the paycheck. I give it a rating of 7/10."

Adrian's speech had me in tears, and Talia Shire has finally, in the serious, ceased being this annoying little mousy wallflower as she had been in the Rocky series prior to this moment.<br/><br/>Stallone's and Mr T's physiques were incredible.

","Rocky battles his most powerful adversary yet-the ferocious Clubber Lang-in this hard hitting actioner which comes out swinging with adventure, humour and emotionally charged drama.

As Rocky Balboa fights his way into the hearts of millions, life couldn't be better. He scores ten consecutive wins, lands lucrative endorsement contracts, and becomes famous throughout the world. But when Clubber Lang K.O.s Rocky in an humiliating defeat, it becomes apparent that the ""Italian Stallion"" has lost his edge.

In the background there's the hard hitting training and determined 230 pounds of fighting fury Clubber Lang, Mister T, mowing his way through the heavyweight ranks, like Iron Mike Tyson did before he got his title match, nipping like an out of control pit bull terrier at Rocky's feet.<br/><br/>It's at an unavailing ceremony of the Rocky Balboa statue in downtown Philadelphia that Lang finally got his chance to meet face to face with Rocky not only taunting him about how scared he is of him and not willing to give him a shot at the heavyweight title. The mad and intimidating Lange really lets Rocky have it by even going so far as insulting his manhood by claiming that he, unlike Rocky, could satisfied his wife Yo Adrian, Talia Shire, both in and out of bed more then he ever could!<br/><br/>With Rocky at first planing to retire from boxing he puts his retirement on hold to give the big bad as well as big mouth Lang a title shot against the better judgment off his manager Mickey. And as history or the film proved it turned out to be a major disaster for Rocky Balboa. He gets clobbered by Lang in two round leaving him both defeated as well as punch drunk. It was also not long after the match with Lang that his friend and manager Mickey who was knocked cold by a crazed and uncontrollable Lang before the fight with Rocky suddenly passed away!<br/><br/>Now down in the dumps and the laughing stock of all the entire sports world especially after his wild and bizarre charity match with professional wrestler the 7 foot tall 350 pounds Thunderlips, Hulk Hogan, who's billed as ""Every Womens Dream"" Rocky goes into a deep depression. In him feeling that his entire boxing career that he was so proud of was nothing but a joke. It's non other then his former bitter opponent Apollo Creed who comes to Rocky's rescue when nobody else even his wife Yo Adrian and struggling to stay sober friend and brother in law Paulie, Burt Young, could. With Apollo taking Rocky under his wings and putting him through a vigorous and ghetto like, in a Watts L.A boxing gym, training regiment he got Rocky in the best shape of his life to take on Lang in a re-match where he wasn't taken seriously at all by Lang or the boxing and sport world.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** probably the best and shortest,three rounds, fight sequence up to then far better the the previous two Rocky movies with the title fight taken place at New York's Madison Square Garden has Rocky charge out of his corner at the opening bell and box instead of slug it out, like he did in their first match, with Clubber Lang easily taking, on all cards , the first round. In the second round Lang got over his confusion and started to punch his way through Rocky's defenses with Lang's devastating punches getting to Rocky flooring him a number of times. <br/><br/>It's then when it looked like curtains for Rocky that he went on the defensive letting Lang do all the swinging until by the middle of the third round his devastating punches, that can poke holes through a brick wall, were nothing more but harmless cream puffs. It was Lang not Rocky who ended up defeating himself by punching himself out so badly that by the time Rocky opened up on him with his left hooks and straight rights that he was left punchy and rubbed armed as well as flat on his back and on the mat for a ten count. With Lang so exhausted and punched out even a light tap from Rocky's old lady Yo Adrian would have done the job as well.<br/><br/>P.S Now with his title back Rocky has one favor to do for his friend Apollo who gave him back that hungry mean and lean ""Eye of the Tiger"" attitude that he needed to defeat Lang. And in an empty gym's boxing ring, probably the famous Gleason's Gym in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, the two square off in their unannounced rubber match to see who's the best. And as Rocky & Apollo are about to let loose with straight rights and left hooks the screen freezes leaving it up to us in the audience to imagine just what the ultimate and final results of that bout would be!"

","Rocky III starts of tremendously with a marvellous montage of where Rocky II left with his rematch fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as Rocky (Stallone) has become the heavyweight champion of the world. The montage shows Rocky with his career growing over five years as we see him defending his title ten times undefeated. Cut to his new life. He and his wife Adrian and along with there son have moved to an even bigger house with Rocky suddenly maturing (wearing suits). He is enjoying the high-life. He decides to retire but new boxer climbing through the ranks Clubber Lang (Mr.T) challenges Rocky to defend his title, he agrees after Clubber taunts him, but he loses his title as his coach Mickey dies of a heart attack (Buregess Meredith). Rocky feels he has a lost apart of himself but with help from an unexpected friend Creed trains Rocky to reclaim his title from Lang.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining third movie in the series and is about twenty minutes shorter. The tone of the third has changed from the first two. Rocky III now just concentrates on more the boxing and as a result Talia Shire as Adrian (whilst her acting is still good and she looks better than ever) her role is severely reduced where she now just appears in most scenes without talking. Though on the beach she gives her husband a passionate speech. Also Rocky Junior dosen't get much screen time, so you don't feel a bond between the family and as a result you lose the most of the touching and heartwarming moments that were apparent in the first two and that is where I felt Rocky III went wrong. Also the story isn't much different and it's started to feel slightly repetitive with the script feeling old-school now.<br/><br/>However Stallone delivers a great performance again and so does Burgess Meredith in his unfortunately last appearance as Micky with a heartbreaking moment when he passes away. Mr. T as Clubber Lang makes a fearsome challenge with a delightful evil performance by him. One thing I did like was that Carl Weathers as Creed (who plays his part well) has a bigger role in this one. You see him and Rocky start to bond as they become friends and that was nice to see. The end fight was well done and entertaining but it wasn't as exciting or inspirational as the first two. However Rocky III is an impressive instalment for a third movie and hopefully the fourth in the series can do just as well or better."

","While any of the Rocky films will never be great thought provokers what they do provide are films that are extremely enjoyable to watch. The build up to the final fight, the music, the training sequences they are all great fun to watch and as a viewer you do get drawn into the movies Rocky 3 does not really provide anything new but it builds well upon the existing formula of Rocky films. <br/><br/>One thing that I would like to mention is the one thing about all Rocky films is that Stallone does draw from his own personal experiences when doing this film. If we examine Rocky 3 we can see that it is about a person who's fame has gone to his head, he is no longer in touch with reality and if Stallone was honest this is reflection of himself at the time as well. This is extremely well documented within the film and surely sends out a clear message to the trappings of becoming famous.<br/><br/>There are some great moments in the films e.g when Rocky says to Adrian 'Nothing is real if you don't believe in it any more'. How true is this statement and all the people who can convince you to believe in yourself it's your wife, the scene truly can hit home to a lot of people"

At that young as an 8 yrs old , i understood the myth and the ideology of this film. That was the 1st time i saw sly Stallone, and in its 1st appearance he made his place in my heart. When he become too much indulged in the business of money making and fame ,he ignored the advice of his mentor mickey and the fact that he is losing his attitude of being a true fighter, than he is met by clubber lang , a new but vicious , arrogant and aggressive contender and he knocks rocky out easily in second round just like without a fight , also then mickey is gone forever. Rocky is so devastated and broken down he even now despises his own self. So much frustrated at this time that he cant put it out of his mind what happened and what is left for him to live than now he is offered a selfless and generous assistance by an unlikely ally. His old nemesis Apollo creed. Now being Apollo on his side all rocky has to do to put himself all together and again live for the glory and prestige he lost in the ring with that championship, Coz that the the only way he can live with his own self, by following the phenomena Apollo creed introduced to him as the eye of the tiger. This was the best movie as far boosting your morale and spirit in the whole rocky series. Mr T as clubber lang was an excellent discovery by Sylvester Stallone, as here he also proved his directional skills , also as he discovered Dolph lundgren for rocky 4. Another good thing was a wrestling match with than champion wrestler Hulk hogan by Rocky balboa.

","This film belongs to Carl Weathers. His character ""Apollo Creed"" is not only the best character, but the most important. There are two stories here: one about a champion who has been fighting semi-good boxers to remain on top, and then losing to a real fighter (""Clubber Lang""). Then there is the story of the fallen champ who teaches the newly fallen champ how to be a ""real fighter"". This is the story that shines, and ties everything together, and makes this the second best Rocky film in the series. Burt Young's ""Paulie"" is hilarious too, especially the way he reacts to the living conditions in downtown L.A. when Apollo brings Rocky to train there. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be ""pumped up"" and/or motivated. Okay, it's corny here and there, but it's Rocky, not Shakespeare... Thank God!"

But Rocky III is far from a great movie, the straight-forward production and final finish makes the movie grand for watching boxing-action, but nothing more - Mr. T's ticked off Clubber Lang is nothing more than irritating and the family drama of Rocky reaches a certain point were it's simply not interesting.

","I don't know why many people bash this movie.  It's my favorite in the series.  It shows that anyone who gets complacent about where he or she is in life will not achieve his or her full potential.  Rocky defeats a number of challengers after defeating Apollo Creed and is challenged by a hungry heavyweight contender named Clubber Lang.  Rocky gets lazy with his training and gets clobbered.  The twist that I really like is his old nemesis, Apollo Creed, wants to train Rocky for personal reasons.  Rocky's lack of spirit shows in the beginning of the training.  He then is motivated by a speech from his wife and gets his hunger back.  I just like the fact that it shows if you're not hungry, you will not achieve your goals.  Take my comments for what they're worth, just my opinion."

","Stallone goes the rounds as both writer and director in this the third installment of the Rocky series, and a winner is produced. Rocky III is often described as Sylvester Stallone vs. Mr. T. Much more can be found and learned from Rocky III the film for one contains emotion, love, sadness, dedication, and friendship but most of all the once again discovery of ""The Eye Of The Tiger"". You have it Rocky (Stallone) the heavyweight champion of the world makes ten straight title defenses with no problem, but complacency plagues Rocky who shows his odd manner by taking a circus act charity wrestling match against Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). The lack of training hurts Rocky and he suffers a crushing KO at the hands of punishing challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T) nearly at the same moment Mickey (Burgess Meredith) suffers a KO to his life in a physical sense only later to die with Rocky crying over him in the dressing room. Death actually occurs in two separate means with the death of Mick it's in a literal sense really happening and with the knockout title loss that Rocky (Stallone) suffered in a sense a figurative death occurred though not in an exact sense, but a title loss felt like death to Rocky (Stallone). I could see the graphic match technique was used to compare the loss and death scene, that's exactly what graphic match does it ties the story together with issues representing both a literal and figurative meaning. After the defeat Stallone once again meets up with former opponent and friend and think god Rocky has a friend Appollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who trains to help him once again discover ""The Eye Of The Tiger"". Wife Adrian (Talia Shire) supports Rocky to bury the past and to not once again become complacent, and to not bear the burden of Mick's death because guilt will only destroy, by once again believing in yourself and soul searching ""The Eye Of The Tiger"" can be found.

"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","4 April 2012"," Stallone keeps things chugging along in this sequel, a film building on what was good about its prior entries whilst allowing for fresh avenues.
","Something rather amusing happens around about the midway point in 1982's Rocky III, a moment wherein it snaps out of a proverbial daze and realises it is, in fact, betraying its 1976 original's core politic. Ah yes, the original: that film about the underdog being able to pull through and achieve precisely what it is they want even though all seems lost and one is on a road to nowhere. The moment I'm referring to in Rocky III is, of course, when it realises it needs its eponymous and ever-present lead, Rocky Balboa, to go back to not being the the favourite for a huge fight with a hulking African American individual of supreme ability – thus, it plunges them back down the pecking order and into a situation wherein they must strive and train to get (back) to the top. It is a curious thing to see a sports movie as generic as this one begin with its protagonist at the top of his game and seemingly indomitable, but credit to director Sylvester Stallone and the team for worming their way around some tight rapids and down into a stream of engaging formulae that does not grate.<br/><br/>When it begins, it begins with Balboa on the top of the world as the champ. Balboa has trumped all, often flooring them in the process, in a flurry of mean boxing ring set punch-'em-ups inducing a rise in ranking about as meteoric as how opposing boxers have tumbled. Rocky has his name and face up in lights: it is on the television and all over merchandise stretching to that of pinball machines. He is a superstar: he is Rocky Balboa, and yet at once he is Sylvestor Stallone – both men have been catapulted to stardom after 1976's initial outing and both are living this high life of close knit bonds; idolisation and fame. When we observe what appears to be Balboa guesting on The Muppets Show, and having a gentle box with a punching bag, it is in actual fact footage of Stallone on an actual television broadcast made possible through his acting and writing of the original film, while the use of fleeting moments from the aforementioned film winning plaudits at the Academy Awards is symptomatic of these blurred lines between audience's own awareness of Stallone's own off screen exploits and Balboa's fictitious achievements.<br/><br/>Two of these matches have been, no less, that of fellow boxing champion Apollo Creed, whose own story in the second film was as interesting as Rocky's was in the first film and whose ego in the first synced up with how fantastic Rocky thought he was in the second. The portrayals sort of even themselves out, I guess, and in III, they're actually on pretty good terms with room for something more in the form of a mentoring relationship. A man has an eye on Balboa during these moments of fame and he is Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a man who stares on discouragingly from the sides at Rocky being lauded come the end of another victory as all others in the auditorium cheer. Lang makes for a meaner, cruder and more imbalanced substitute for Creed; a tough talking African American who has a habit of winning and sees himself as invincible. For the most part, Lang is the underdog but he is unpleasant and spits these tirades of self congratulatory euphemisms on top of derogatory remarks aimed at our lead – at least when Rocky came to hear or speak of Creed in 1976's first film, it was a little more along the lines of common courtesy and respect. Indeed, when Lang sees fit to go so far as to systematically insult the man's wife and masculinity, the film has placed us firmly within the camp of this time gunning for the incumbent champ over the sprightly newcomer, something which goes against the franchise-to-this-point's politic and something which is actually muscled into being inverted following an initial bout.<br/><br/>As was with Rocky II, one feels you'd have to be in a fairly bad mood to come away not having enjoyed it. No doubt there are arguments that it is overly derivative, while there cannot be much denying that it is a tad simplistic at times. A charity match with a wrestler, two sports-persons top of their respective contact sporting worlds, eats up time and is a bit of a boorish sequence designed to induce cheap conflicting thrills, although it does point out how vulnerable Rocky is when up against a monster of a man whose desire and drive to triumph appears unnatural given the circumstances. And yes, there is that seemingly obligatory framework to do with Balboa and his personal life clashing with his professional one - his actual walking away from the field in the form of retirement an event which is lost and forgotten by the time everything else has been said and done such is the scope for brutish spectacle and emotional wringers, but it all pulls together.<br/><br/>There is room for one of the more predominant characters to be killed off, in what is an affecting scene, whereas the subplot of two rivals from instalments gone by working together is a refreshing touch. There is a raw energy to the film, it keeps itself afloat by going over similar paths up upping antes: Lang is the level up as an opponent from Creed; Rocky has more to loose now in the form of a young son able to be conscientious of the risks his father takes; Balboa seeks training from a man who has been to the same heights he has and most come to learn that the only way from the top is back down again, in spite for prior perceptions of one's ability and status. As Stallone very gradually cranks up the affinity we have towards these characters, one cannot help but look forward to the following entries."

"Fluke_Skywalker","6","1","4","24 August 2016"," Wins by decision
","Plot; After the death of his manager and the loss of his title, boxer Rocky Balboa finds an unlikely ally in his quest to regain the belt in former foe Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Over the years, it's been easy to laugh off the ever growing and increasingly implausible Rocky series. But then Stallone makes Rocky Balboa, not exactly a classic, but a return to basics filled with genuine pathos that brings the character and his saga satisfyingly full circle. This is followed a full decade later by Creed, an almost beat for beat remake of the original Rocky that sees Stallone play the mentor and give what may be the finest performance of his career. It's a fascinating franchise that acts both as a mirror of the times in which they were made and of the soul of its star. Stallone is, for all intents and purposes, Rocky Balboa. The original film essentially ports Stallone's own Hollywood struggles into the ring. The sequel shows how Rocky, and by extension Stallone, dealt with the swift and meteoric rise to fame. This third film too mirrors Stallone's life, as Rocky struggles with maintaining his edge after achieving his dreams. It also is a reflection of its era, replacing the gritty look and tone of its 70s-based predecessors with a slicker, faster approach befitting the dawn of the 80s.<br/><br/>As a sequel, Rocky III works reasonably well, taking the next logical step in a story that very well might have been better served stopping after one film. If the basic framework is the same (challenge, train, fight, win), the character motivations are different enough for it to be interesting. Stallone realizes the story, while serviceable, is somewhat thin, and therefore trims about a half hour from the runtime compared to its predecessors. If there's no meat on its bones, there's also precious little fat. Stallone's Rocky feels very different than the one we meet in the original. He's smarter, more sophisticated. A product of his success? Maybe, but it's a jarring evolution until you get used to it. Adrian is now more or less Rocky's lucky rabbit's foot, reduced to cheerleader, which is a shame, but also an organic part of the series' evolution. The real stars here are Carl Weathers as Apollo, now stepping in as Rocky's trainer, and Mr. T as the villain, Clubber Lang. Weathers feels very much like the Apollo we know, but we get to scratch a bit beneath the surface. He's a charming, energetic breath of fresh air when he arrives in the film's second half. Unlike Apollo in the first two films, Clubber Lang is a true villain cut from a very one dimensional mold. Despite this, Mr. T manages to make for a compelling and daunting baddie and lifts the entire film.<br/><br/>Rocky III isn't a particularly good film, but thanks in no small part to the good will we feel for the titular character because of the previous two films, it does hold together just enough dramatically to allow its slicker, 80s-tinged elements, to deliver a moderate crowd pleaser."

","""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote and directed the movie), the Professional Boxing World Heavyweight Champion, is living the life he sought. He lives in a huge house with his family, has been on the cover of various magazines and has numerous endorsement deals. However, unknown to him, he has gotten soft inside the ring to the point where his manager, ""Mickey"" (Burgess Meredith) booked him in bouts with inferior fighters. Even getting in the ring with the cocky professional wrestling star, ""Thunderlips"" (Hulk Hogan in his acting debut).<br/><br/>He lost his edge, and ""Mickey"" knew it. However, the champ wouldn't believe it. He even went against ""Mickey's"" orders, and accepted the challenge of ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T in one of his most famous roles), a tough, bad attitude boxer who rapidly reached the Number One Contendership by himself with no trainer helping him out.<br/><br/>""Mickey"" warned ""Balboa"" not to accept ""Lang's challenge, but the mohawked fighter verbally went after the champ's wife (Talia Shire) at a public appearance. He immediately accepted the challenge. However, ""Mickey"" was proved right, and ""Balboa"" lost the title to ""Lang."" And, to make things worse, ""Mickey"" suffers a heart attack backstage during a confrontation between ""Balboa"" and ""Lang"", and dies in the dressing room as ""Lang"" easily defeats the champion for the title.<br/><br/>Now, ""Balboa"" has to regain what he once had. And he gets help from an old rival (Carl Weathers). A rival who once saw the ""Eye of the Tiger"" when he fought ""The Italian Stallion"" himself for the title.<br/><br/>This is one slow moving movie, especially about half-way through the film. I saw myself looking at websites around that time more than watching the film on On Demand. It does pick up leading up to the rematch between the two boxing rivals around the time ""Apollo Creed"" shows up.<br/><br/>The acting is near perfect all around. You knew almost immediately when ""Balboa"" admits that he lost his edge, by Stallone's performance in the scene, that the death of ""Mickey"" affected him deeply. Certain cast members were performing characters who were more important in the previous two movies. I felt that they were there because they somewhat advanced the storyline, or were just there because they have been part of the series since the first movie in the franchise.<br/><br/>I liked the chemistry between Stallone and Weathers in this film. In previous films, they were rivals, and now they are on the same side. They acted like two professionals in one of the toughest sports on the planet, one now acting more like a teacher more than a rival who was still annoyed at once losing the title to his now-student. Weathers really shined in this role, making the audience forget how arrogant he was six years before in the first movie.<br/><br/>Another breakout performance was that of Mr. T. Surprisingly, as ""Balboa"" is getting back his edge, ""Lang"" is almost forgotten. The film focuses more on ""Balboa"" training for the rematch more than ""Lang"" living the life of the defending champion. You almost completely forget he was in the movie until he comes back into the story for the rematch. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some references to ""Lang"" as ""Balboa"" is in training. This was the role that gave Mr. T his tough guy image. He was the bad guy you wanted to see destroyed.<br/><br/>This film is predictable. You know who will win at the end. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some plot twists that would have made the end a little less predictable.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film is the soundtrack. I can only remember two songs in the film -- the ""Rocky Theme"" piece that is so recognizable now you know immediately where it came from, and ""Eye of the Tiger"" by the one-hit-wonder (this song) Survivor.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film is, at times, it is hard to understand Stallone's speaking. At times, I had to rely on what others in the scene were saying in response to understand what was going on.<br/><br/>Unless you already own the other movies, I say get this film on VHS/DVD to complete the series. I also think that this would be a pretty good third choice to rent."

","The Rocky franchise died with the first. There can be no others, as a matter of continuity. ""There ain't gonna be no rematch."" Remember that? And, yet, there was.

But, whatever.<br/><br/>If there was going to be a second addition, this should have been it. With Clubber holding the title and Rocky determined to take it. That would have been fine, but, no...Sly wanted riches. I can relate.<br/><br/>Now, if you can forgive all that, there is fun to be had. It comes by way of Clubber Lang, the most awesome character of all Rocky's opponents. MR T plays this role very well; his best performance of that era.

The film is pretty good to watch, the fight sequences are okay but pretty unrealistic compared to Raging Bull (but as I've said above, realisim was never the key).<br/><br/>There are good parts to the film, one being the under-written Mr T playing the venomus and tough opponent Clubber Lang. Its obvious Mr T had fun playing the role he always meant to play - every word he says spits the embodiment of hate and frustration - he is exactly like Rocky except his pride and underexpectation of his foes are his faliure.<br/><br/>Otherwise this film is relatively good and an enjoyable watch. 5/10."

","Years after defeating Apollo Creed, Rocky has successfully defended his title 10 times and is living well off commercials, endorsements and his charitable public image.  However just off Rocky's radar, a hungry young fighter, Clubber Lang,  is winning fight after fight by knock out.  Sickened after a charity fight where Rocky takes on a wrestler in a comedy display, Lang challenges Rocky to a fight.  Rocky loses his title during the bout and suffers a personal loss.  With the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky seeks to get his hungry desire back and retake his title from Lang.<br/><br/>Stallone shows that he can write soap opera easily and quite intelligently. Here the Rocky story is put on it's head and we see him growing old and successful.  He is not as urgent and hungry for victory as he once was. This twist makes this more enjoyable than the second film as we get to see what happens to successes when they forget where they came from.  In many ways this reflects what must have been going on in Stallone's head as his movie career progressed.  It may not be a perfect comparison but it is more interesting than another copy.<br/><br/>The soapy mush of the first two is toned down a bit here and replaced by the struggle to re-find the fire that made Rocky so strong.  This way we get to know Rocky better and this journey is more interesting when he has to go back to go forward.  At times the story is silly and the fight scenes aren't as good as the previous tow films, although the final fight still carries an emotional, if unrealistic, punch.<br/><br/>Stallone is good, as he seems to bring a lot of himself to the role this time  his experiences have changed as have Rocky's, he uses that.  Shire's character has changed well and Young's character is more interesting than before.  Mr T is good, at first he is sympathetic because he is the contender, however to make Rocky more popular he has to be really arrogant towards the end.  Hulk Hogan makes a silly cameo that goes on to long and Burgess Meredith just seems to be getting more grouchy and wrinkled by the second.<br/><br/>Overall this is good  better than the second.  The interest is renewed by the switch in Rocky from underdog to rich success pursued by young contenders.  The mushy emotion is toned down and the good elements from the first two films are talked up.  Solid."

Rocky's beaten naturally because his cheque book isn't quite strong enough to cushion Lang's punches and even worse, Lang has roughed up trainer Mickey and caused him to have a fatal heart attack. Such setbacks would dampen the spirits of lesser men and sure enough Balboa slips into a depression and something of an existential crisis. Thankgoodness then for old adversary, turned friend Apollo Creed who tells Rocky to pick himself up, read up on Tigers and take himself to the beach for a bit of homo-erotic horseplay, then on to the ring to teach the new champ a damn good lesson...<br/><br/>Rocky III may be a comment on the promise of the American ideal corrupted by its vast wealth and unrestrained capitalism. Then again that could be nonsense. In Rocky you've got the embodiment of the American dream gone soft and no longer possessing the spirit that was the source of his power and influence. He's reduced to commercial endorsements and expensive suites and even more embarrassingly, Wrestling Exibition fights. He's lost his heart and his self-respect, y'know the kind you only have when you're poor and he needs to get it back because at this point there's still an hour of the film left. The third film is a bit of a weird one because though perfectly watchable its got moments of supreme silliness. All of a sudden Rocky can't get anywhere near a ring without oiling himself up. Creed seems obsessed with the tie-in track and mentions it every five minutes and we learn that the only way to get your respect back is to do imitations of wild animals and jump about in the sand with the spray of the ocean suggestively foaming all over you. We're left with this rather strange situation in which the film is softened by the same commerical pressures that Rocky himself proved susceptible too. It's Rocky now as franchise - product and as a result there's none of the dramatic pretencions of early movies. It's strictly formula which is fine but it might leave you wondering where the series could go after this. Well Russia of course!"

Keeping with the Rocky formula, Rocky III opens with the end of Rocky II, where Rocky wins the fight against Apollo Creed and claims the heavyweight champion title. We then jump forward three years with the help of your typical Rocky montage where Rocky becomes a huge celebrity and the absolute pride of Philladelphia. However, when a new young challenger comes along, Rocky has no choice but to face him. This challenger? None other than Clubber Lange, played by the infamous Mr. T in his film debut. In the fight Rocky takes a brutal beat down from Clubber, and afterwards looks to former rival, Apollo Creed to train him in order to restore his confidence.<br/><br/>I have to admit, for me, watching a Rocky film is a lot of fun. It's empowering, inspiring, and always seems to be a great experience. But, as much as I enjoy a good Rocky flick I can't deny that Rocky III is a pretty half hearted attempt. It feels shoddily thrown together in an attempt to churn out another run of the mill story. The film's flow seems too sped up and doesn't go deep at all. It has some good heartfelt moments, but overall just feels very phoned in. The Rocky films seem to get progressively more predictable and less original. Rocky III offers up nothing new, and it's where the series redundancy really starts to show. I won't say that the previous two films suffer from the third, but Rocky III is definitely very forgettable.<br/><br/>Of course, the film isn't without a few good things. You can expect to see some of your favorite things about Rocky films in Rocky III. You'll be treated to some great montages, even though this film has a total of three I believe, and for a 100 minute runtime this is sort of overdoing it. We also get to see the characters of Rocky, Adrian, and Apollo grow and mature to continue to be ever fascinating characters. Kudos go to Sylvester Stallone to keeping his characters fresh, it's just a shame he couldn't do the same with the storyline. Also, as with the previous two Rocky films, you can expect a rousing climax in Rocky III. It's inspiring and empowering to watch Rocky fight at the end of the film, and it almost makes you forget how mediocre the rest of the film is.<br/><br/>All in all, don't expect much from Rocky III. It's the weakest of the first three films by a long shot, but if you enjoyed the first two then I would say give this one a shot if you haven't satisfied your Rocky fever quite yet. It's not a disaster, but Rocky III is pretty underwhelming."
"MGPT80","6","0","1","13 April 2020"," A little less conversation, a little more action
","Having been underwhelmed by the first Rocky movie and disappointed by the sequel, I was not expecting much from this latest incarnation. However, it's actually quite good and probably my favourite of the series. It doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessors, it's much shorter and there's a lot more action. The fighting scenes are also better; more strategic, more engrossing and more realistic (although Rocky would still die multiple times if this was real).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the inclusion of Mr T and Hulk Hogan. Both are quite cabaret in this film and it really helps lighten everything up. Stallone's acting is as bad as ever but he looks amazing in this movie. Admittedly he looks more like a bodybuilder than a boxer but it's still an incredible sight. Talia Shire isn't as prominent in this film as the others but she is still comfortably the best actor on show. I was kind of glad to see the end of Meredith Burgess however, as his character was becoming increasingly banal and cliched.<br/><br/>This is a much more light-hearted offering than the first two movies, and while this may irk hardcore Rocky fans, I found it to be a big positive."

","Once again Sylvester Stallone took directing , writing and casting on his shoulders and managed to deliver an amazing sequel! One of the most famous soundtracks that motivated many generations accompanied with the best training from the 80's and the funniest and toughest fights ,gave us an amazing entertainment. Mr T and Hulk Hogan is far , the best pick for Rocky's opponents that really stood up against him! The whole concept contender against the champion is smart and the script was evolved nicely around it , by bringing Apollo back to the script!"

","I don't watch ""Rocky III"" that often. I don't watch that much because it's not that good. It's actually pretty bad. The biggest problem with the movie is how Sylvester Stallone looks. He has perfect disco hair and way too many muscles. Sly's face looks like it has zero percent body fat and it's very distracting. He doesn't look like Rocky anymore. Another problem is Mr T's character. Clubber Land is a one dimensional cartoon character. Mr T went on to have a good run because he became quite an appealing personality. He gets to show none of that in ""Rocky III"". He just a screaming, insulting (PG style, of course) robot. Another disappointment is the Paulie character. He has a great opening scene and then he turns into comic relief. On the plus side, Sly delivers a pretty good performance and Carl Weathers (also with way too many muscles) is also quite good. Overall, ""Rocky III"" is pretty forgettable. Dishonorable mention: an annoying Talia Shire."
"CubsandCulture","6","0","2","17 March 2019"," Rocky at its most basic...
","This film really doesn't have much subtext. Whereas the first film is about defending the American dream, and the second film was about male anxiety over changing gender roles this one is about what it is to tell a Rocky story. The charity fight with Hulk Hogan is a clever bit of screenwriting that functions as a meta-commentary. I mean Lang is just a heel after all. But the story is far too stripped down and focused on the fights.<br/><br/>Of note Adrian is given basically nothing to do with in this film. There really isn't any marriage struggle in this film; even Rocky's conflict of being afraid is too fight focused. That is really too bad. Add in that the most emotional sequence-Mickey's fate-is used to fuel Rocky's underdog status and the film utterly lacks the emotional strength of the better Rocky films.<br/><br/>Lang is a poor substitute for Apollo and without the self-awareness of the wrestling match the character wouldn't work. Mr. T is just awful, even by his standards, in this film. He almost sinks the film. But Mr. T is very good at the stunt work. These are some of the most brutal fights in the series.<br/><br/>The best part of the film, and why it is still entertaining, is Apollo. Turning Creed into a frenemy was good move and it set up the Creed films (eventually) quite nicely. Weathers gives a great personable performance here and he saves the film.<br/><br/>This film is really transitional. It doesn't have the blue collar feel of the 1st two films. It doesn't quite have the operatic feel of the 4th Rocky, or Rocky Balboa. An entertaining film but the material feels tired and spent."

","Rocky 3 seems to have forgotten that the good-humored humanity of Rocky is what makes these movies soar. It also looks bad. Real bad. Not sure that's Stallone's fault; two has its own issues, but it doesn't look like the throwaway this one does. In all, it's a corny and predictable collection of training montages trying to disguise itself as a movie. And before you say, ""But Matt, that's just what Rocky movies are!"". No, they aren't. 3, 4, and 5 are, but the rest are smart and emotional character studies."

","Pretty cheesy movie. If true heavy weight fighters hit each other that often with right and left hooks they would be dead. With the medical staff at a fight, Mick can't get a doctor while having a heart attack? Then there's the self centered (what about me?) Paulie. He's now an entitled elitist and racist. (Arriving in a predominately black gym) Paulie: ""I gotta get out of here. I've got a reputation."" and ""I don't like these people."" and (While Rocky is training) ""He can't train to the jungle junk music."" But it's the same old story.

"grantss","4","0","3","12 April 2015"," Even more of the same - formulaic
","Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.<br/><br/>Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.<br/><br/>Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.<br/><br/>Rocky III pretty much just follows the same formula. Change the guy Rocky has to fight, rinse and repeat. Only difference here is that we have two fights - one in mid-movie, one at the end.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a serialized account of Rocky's life, but this doesn't really add anything original to the series."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","1","5 October 2014"," Cartoonish
","'Rocky II' I liked not because Rocky got a chance to win but because it spent most of it's time featuring Rocky trying to go back to his normal life but being goaded back into the ring. Rockys IV and V were execrable which leaves me with Rocky III (do you think I've said Rocky enough?). 'Rocky III' isn't an entirely necessary movie but it is an entertaining one. It's a comic book fable, a hapless movie that gives the viewer what they want.<br/><br/>The movie finds Rock at the height of his career with a big house, an infant son and a statue in Philadelphia (it's still there in real life). This is fine but it doesn't make for great drama. Bringing this challenge to Rocky is a muscle-clad loudmouth who accuses him of years of ducking a worthy opponent – himself of course. Mickey agrees, admitting that most of Rocky's opponents have been handpicked.<br/><br/>Not thinking much of it Rock takes the challenge and proceeds on a half-assed attempt at training for the fight (the gym where he use to train is now more an amusement park). Not only does he lose the fight but also his self-respect and Mickey to a heart attack. Stallone's mournful howls in that scene reminded me of a wounded buffalo that I once saw on National Geographic.<br/><br/>What follows is a long stretch in which we get Rocky's depression, a visit from Apollo Creed now on Rock's side, a rematch, a trip to L.A., a training montage and two more speeches about bravery and self respect than is necessary. Then the fight in which we don't have to guess who comes out victorious.<br/><br/>All of this is in the service of a story that, as I said, doesn't give this series a boost but is entertaining junk food. Stallone tells a good story once again even if Rocky doesn't have all the quirks we remember. As for it's entry in the series, it being the middle film of a decending series it sits somewhere in the middle and so does my rating."
"jboothmillard","5","0","1","26 March 2011"," Rocky III
","Directed by its star Sylvester Stallone, the first film may be the one that was the most successful, winning Oscars and all, but this one gave us two things, a memorable TV star and a hit song. Basically it continues where the previous film left off, where Rocky Balboa (Stallone) defeated Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by knockout, falling over and winning getting up, by one second, and he is still enjoying his success. Three years have passed, he has had ten fights holding onto his world champion title, and he is now rich with everything he could ever want. After a charity boxing match against World Wrestling Champion fighter Thunderlips (Hollywood Hulk Hogan) and a commemorative statue in his honour and that of his home town, Rocky announces his retirement. Right at that moment however out of the crowd comes the man who has been watching him with intent to fight him and become the new world champion, up and coming boxing brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T), and with too much pride he accepts. At first trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) is strict that he should not fight him, because he is a ""killer"", and he confesses the ten fights he got him were easy compared to Clubber, but he does agree eventually to give him more fighting tips. It comes to the match, but before it even starts Rocky and Clubber have backstage bust-up, resulting in Mickey having a heart attack, initially Rocky says he will forfeit, but his trainer urges him to go on. In the end, Rocky was too worried about Mickey to fight as well as he normally would, therefore he is defeated in two rounds and Clubber becomes the new World Champion, and Rocky is upset when he returns to Mickey who dies in front of him. He becomes depressed with the grief and thinking that he is finished, and he has no confidence to have a re-match, but then his former opponent Apollo Creed comes along. He encourages Rocky to go for a re-match, which Clubber Lang accepts, and he starts training him, he should try to forget any rivalry he has with the thug and concentrate more on regaining his title, he needs the ""eye of the tiger"". In the end, Rocky and Clubber return to the ring to have another fight, with wife Adrian (Talia Shire) and Apollo watching in the crowd and by the ring with hope, and against all odds Rocky does win the fight with a fantastic knockout punch, once again becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World. Also starring Burt Young as Paulie, Ian Fried as Rocky Jr. and Al Silvani as Al. Stallone still gives a really likable, Weathers steps up in the ranks becoming his mentor, Shire has her moments, as does Penguin actor Meredith before his character dies, and Mr. T is a great opponent with an attitude, a great attribute that got him the part of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team. I don't think the critics are very fair about this third film in the series, the fight sequences are still gripping, the montage sequence or two with the great music is still enjoyable, and of course the Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated song ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor, that went to number one, is a great song, a good boxing drama. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, ""Yo, Adrian."" was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Worth watching!"

","This Rocky film was the real start of the decline of the series. Although a watchable film and Mr.T does make it a lot of fun it still lacks the power and performances of the first 2 movies. Mr. T as clubber Lang plays a vicious boxer who is almost a sadist in the boxing ring and he temps Rocky out of retirement to fight him. There are of course the corny Rocky moments we have become use to with the soundtrack rock music playing with Rocky training in the old gym. Anyway, Rocky does come back and fights Clubber Lang and takes a punch that under normal conditions would kill a human being. But hey Rocky is used to getting hit a lot as he always allows himself to. In any case Rocky is approached by Apollo Creed and is told he lacks the eye of the tiger and offers to train him....Yawn. Should I go on. Well, Rocky fights Clubber Lang again and of course wins and has his cheesy speech at the end with wife and kid crying."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","3","26 November 2008"," Why so serious?
","Like Part 2, Rocky 3 starts off where the last movie left off, but things are totally different now. Rocky has the feel of a real person with a real, three dimensional life by now, but he's come a long way from the Rocky we knew in the first two movies. Most notably, he's RICH now. He has a genuine career going in full swing in boxing by now, and the first part of the movie is a montage of event fights, all of which he wins soundly and comfortably. He is a tremendous champion with 10 successful title defense fights and a whole list of corporate sponsors. Not surprisingly, he begins to feel overconfident and a little lazy.<br/><br/>There is some ham-handed foreshadowing as we see clips of a concerned Mr. T in the audience at Rocky's fights, and it's not long before Clubber Lang (Mr. T) begins publicly insulting Rocky, challenging him to a fight and taunting him at press conferences. I'm curious about where Lang's anger comes from. He is clearly furious with Rocky, but we know nothing about him. We don't know anything about his past as a fighter other than what is passed on through dialogue, and the unsolved mystery surrounding his uncontrollable rage is probably the movie's only genuine fault.<br/><br/>The important thing that we are told is that Lang is not a boxer, like Rocky, but a wrestler, so it's a completely different, ah, ball game this time. <br/><br/>There is an interesting fight that Rocky has midway through the movie with a hulking giant (Hulk Hogan) curiously named ""Thunderlips,"" in an illustration of what had become of his career. He had reached such a level of success that his fights became little more than performances put on to generate ticket sales, but Rocky's humanitarianism shows through, as he sometimes donates all proceeds, as in the case of the fight with Thunderlips, to various charities.<br/><br/>But as always, Rocky maintains his laid back demeanor, letting the insults and taunts roll off his back, which is one of the qualities that has really allowed him to win so many hearts. But at an outdoor press conference, Lang taunts Rocky's wife, and he gets genuinely angry for the first time in the first three movies, other than the sudden tantrum he had in the first film when Mickey first asked to be his manager. <br/><br/>After this, everything starts to fall apart. It turns out that his championship is not what he thought it was, and he is put into a position where he has to defend his wife's honor as well as his own, and to do that he has to fight a fighter that no one, including himself, really believes he can beat. True to his form, Mickey tells him, ""This guy'll kill you to death inside of three rounds!""<br/><br/>And there is no mistake to be made about that. Lang is absolutely a KILLER. This guy has no interest in getting a knockout, he doesn't even seem that interested in being recognized as the real champion, he just wants to hurt Rocky. <br/><br/>Essentially Lang's role in the movie is to knock Rocky out of the rut of complacency that he has gotten into. Thunderlips was billed as nearly 7 feet tall and 390 pounds, which I think it roughly twice Rocky's size, and is clearly a wrestler and not a fighter, and yet Rocky was able to win a fight with him, so it's no surprise that he assumed the fight with Lang would be about the same.<br/><br/>When they finally fight, Lang walks all over him, and Rocky realizes that he has gotten soft. Apollo Creed, by the way, is now a sportscaster, and becomes Rocky's trainer when they learn how tough Lang really is. <br/><br/>The movie loses track a little when Apollo starts training Rocky like he's never been in a gym before, like he's a complete amateur. Yeah, he hasn't been losing much lately, but does that mean he hasn't set foot inside a gym in all those years? Doubtful, but nevertheless, it's great to see Rocky whipping himself back into shape and once again becoming that hardened hero that we have come to love. Although I have to admit, I loved the swimming scene. Rocky swims like my grandmother!<br/><br/>There is one moment of almost unforgivable cheese when Rocky and Mickey have a heart to heart on the beach at sunset in which, for example, Rocky claims that he's really afraid for the first time in his life. Isn't that a direct quote from the first movie? <br/><br/>There is notably more anger in part three than either of the previous movies, and while a second sequel runs a high likelihood of being the one that marks the first really noticeable turn downwards in the quality of the series (hear that, Terminator?), this one is no less watchable than the first two and, amazingly, neither is part 4. Well done!<br/><br/>By the way, it's interesting that, at one point, a sportscaster notes just before a major fight, ""The odds of Rocky making a comeback at 34 are long indeed!"" Yeah, how about at 60?"

","Now I have seen all five of the first five in the series.<br/><br/>We were fooled this time. It sounded like ""Gonna Fly Now"" would be played at the beginning, but it was just a song that sounded like that one. The new, almost equally worthy theme started up after that, with scenes from the life of Rocky Balboa (even ""The Muppet Show""!) as well as highlights of the career of Clubber Lang. Survivor's theme was used for some training scenes later and, with a tiger growling, for the closing credits. Purists who wanted ""Gonna Fly Now"" get to hear it during some quite exciting training scenes, and played by a marching band early in the movie as Rocky's statue is unveiled.<br/><br/>Was it as good as the others? Certainly none of the sequels matched the original, but this film held its own. For the first time, Rocky is faced with the prospect of actually having to retire. Clubber Lang is the fiercest, cruelest opponent yet. And, of course, with Mickey opposed to Rocky fighting this monster (and for another reason I'd rather not mention), Apollo Creed does the training this time, and Carl Weathers gives the movie's standout performance. In fact, this may have been the best of the movies for those who like him.<br/><br/>The usual formula applies: need it be mentioned that Rocky can't win the first time? Or can he? Maybe Lang wants revenge. Can Rocky win the second time? Maybe.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether to call Mr. T a good actor. But he is definitely scary and menacing, always taunting, always acting like he can't be defeated. He just doesn't show a lot of range. And Muhammad Ali he's not--Ali had a kind side. One has to wonder if Lang ever had anyone care about him.<br/><br/>Stallone gives a good performance here. He has to show doubt about whether he can continue. He certainly shows determination, and in some scenes where he should show fear, he doesn't. That is probably a good thing.<br/><br/>Burgess Meredith is almost as good here as in the others, but he isn't in the movie much. Talia Shire has her share of good scenes too.<br/><br/>Hulk Hogan is almost as menacing as T in the charity event, and one wonders how Rocky got out of that alive. Hogan's no actor, but his performance should satisfy fans of ""rasslin"". For those concerned that scene is too violent, Rocky's son does ask if Daddy is having fun. That should resolve any concerns.<br/><br/>As for later, I guess it's up to parents if they want to watch two guys beating the you-know-what out of each other.

It begins with, to the song ""Eye Of The Tiger"", a montage showing us Rocky successfully defending his title and at the same time, letting fame go to his head. He is, soon enough, brought down from his cloud by number one contender Clubber Lang, well played by Mr.T in his first movie role. Soon tragedy befalls Rocky, inside the ring and outside, and the only man who can help him is his old nemesis Apollo Creed. Once again, almost everyone from the previous one is back, with a humorous cameo from Hulk Hogan, but this time around they don't seem as into it and sort of run through the motions. And once again, Sylvester Stallone writes and directs, with weaker results in both areas. Also, some of the directing suggests that Sly was watching too many psychological thrillers at the time this movie was made."

","In this Rocky movie,Rocky is now the Heavyweight boxing champion of the world and is very popular all over the globe. Rocky now appears in commercials,magazines,guest on TV shows and interviews. But Rocky doesn't know a hungry contender is willing to show the world that Rocky's not the best fighter. Mickey (Rocky's manager-trainer-mentor) has watched this rising contender knocked out opponents within a drop of a hat. Mickey sees that this man means business,and at a ceremony he challenged Rocky. Rocky didn't have the hunger he use to have in his earlier days (Rocky 1&2) and did not took his opponent seriously. This is similar to when Apollo was champion and fought Rocky for the first time. In this movie Mickey dies due to heart complications during the mayhem between Rocky and the new challenger Clubber Lang (as known to the world as Mr.T). Clubber was a street-wise brawler from Chicago and pounds on his opponents unmercifully. Now Rocky being unfocused and haven't trained properly eventually lost to Clubber Lang. But Rocky join forces with his old nemesis Apollo Creed to put Clubber away. The training scenes are the most rememberable part of the movie and how they bond so well together. Though I realize in this movie the only reason Apollo wanted to help Rocky was because Clubber disrespected Apollo before Rocky's first fight with Clubber. Being that he saw Rocky wanted to get back at Clubber Apollo wanted to involve himself with Rocky's training. Apollo was a hustler he talk to Rocky about not having the hungry while fighting Clubber Lang that he had when he fought him. He also made Rocky wear his boxing shorts he wore in the first movie,I guess it was to make him feel as if he was in the ring to fight Clubber. In the second round Clubber got the best of Rocky and Apollo yelled at Rocky as if he was losing the fight himself. That why Apollo said to him ""you owe me a big favor"",and that favor was to see if he and Rocky still had the ""eye of the tiger""."

","In ROCKY III, the Italian Stallion loses the championship title to the ruthless Clubber Lang, Mickey dies and Apollo tries to get the former champ back on his feet for a rematch against the new champ.  Stallone is good here, the training sequences steal the show (as always), and Mr. T's role as Clubber is not bad, but the story becomes predictable by halfway.  As usual, sequels aren't as good as the original, but this one has its moments and is still very much a winner.<br/><br/>3 out of 5"

","The third in the Rocky series was said to be good in this way and that, but I didn't see a lot of good things except for the fighting. This is the one that really told us that the Rocky series was going downhill if the continuous sequals didn't stop. Rocky happily holds his world heavyweight title, after defeating Apollo Creed it seems that Rocky is becoming a bit too civilised to be taking his fights carefully. He is intiminated by a loud mouthed heavy hitter named Clubber Lang (played very well by Mr. T) and fights him for the title. Mickey has a heart attack (one of the worst decisions in the whole series) and Rocky thrown off enough in the fight to lose his title. After, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) tries to coach Rocky and encourage him to get 'the eye of the tiger' back in his punches so he can get his Heavy weight championship back on his waist. Although the summary sounds interesting, the movie does not carry the right ingrediants well enough and what could have been great turns into something made to grab our money. Hulk Hogan makes an unnecessary cameo as Thunder Lips, a challenger for Rocky in an exhibition for charity. Not great, but if you want to see the series, or if you're in the mood for pretty good fighting, see this movie."
"Agent10","7","0","2","8 June 2002"," Mr. T at his best!
","Like all cheesy multi-sequel series, the third movie always had to be some gimmick. How about tossing in Hulk Hogan and Mr. T as villains. This seemed like one big gimmick, like they made this film to simply satisfy the masses. While it was decent in many respects, it really leads one to wonder why a person would ruin a good thing with overkill."
"baumer","9","0","1","16 August 1999"," one of the most entertaining films ever made
","The Rocky films are excellent.  And as much as I like the drama of the first two I have to admit that I love the sheer exhiliration of part 3 and 4.  I love this film.<br/><br/>Mr. T. is a bad-ass villain.  When you move on from the original story and take away all that Apollo Creed was to Rocky, you have to present the audience with more danger than  the other films had.  And early on you learn to hate Clubber Lang simply for the fact that he wants to take away what Rocky has.  If you can create hatred for a character even though he is not a bad man, that is good writing.  Clubber Lang is the embodiment of hate even though what he represents is will, determination, an insatiable desire for fame and greatness and to win the heavyweight boxing title.  How do you hate a character like that?  Well for one, you make him grunt and spit his words out like venom.  You make him snarl and use words like ""sucka"" and phrases like "" pity the foo"".  And you have to give Mr. T. credit for portraying the role as well as he did.<br/><br/>Rocky III is as high on the entertainment scale as you can go and the only film that supercedes it in terms of wanting the underdog to win at all costs, is Rocky IV.  This is a great film!"

","Rocky III is a good movie. It's more entertaining than part II, but there's something about part II that makes me like it a hair better than part III, but part III is very entertaining. Second only to Rocky IV for the most entertaining in the series. I give Rocky III *** out of ****"

","In Rocky II after his amazing fight against the heavyweight champion of the world club fighter Rocky Balboa is suddenly thrust into the spotlight for his fifteen minutes of fame.  Agents sign him to endorse various products yet he is quickly fired when it becomes apparent that he can barely read. Now in this third installment at the beginning of the film he can be seen doing one successful TV commercial after another.  Well how did he suddenly become so smart or at least smart enough to be able to film the TV advertisements that he couldn't do only a short while earlier?  I guess all the extra punches in the head during his second Apollo Creed fight and his subsequent title defenses must have helped.  Two more films followed this one but none even came close to the first, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1976.  Mr. T plays a sort of Mike Tyson character who wants Rocky's crown but will he get it and if he does then what?"
"Special-K88","Null","0","2","14 March 2002"," familiar story that entertains
","Bold, pumped-up sequel finds Stallone having just shocked the world by becoming the new heavyweight champion. He quickly earns fame and fortune as the champion but also gets a big head, loses the edge that drove him to victory in the first place, and eventually drops the title in a humiliating defeat to the trash talking and robust challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T). In order to redeem himself and reclaim the ""eye of the tiger,"" Rocky acquires the services of former rival and recently retired ex-champion Apollo Creed to train him for a do-or-die rematch. We've seen it before, but it works thanks to a gritty and energetic story that packs a much harder punch than the previous predecessor. Stallone is in good form and the finale is over-the-top. ***"

","When Rocky-movies arrived to the bigscreen always after few years waiting, those films script's stiffness didn't see so as clearly as watching  a Rocky movie every week from a video.

","Rocky 3 is plain predictable, you know what's going to happen and it does. Mr T wasn't directed properly, his character showed promise but there was no script for him. Hogan was okay.<br/><br/>There is about 10 minutes of worthwhile watching, and most of that features Mickey, Rocky's trainer.<br/><br/>Rocky 3 should've been about the downfall of the character.

Enough is enough seems to be the message of the plot for the aging Rocky Balboa, but should really be said of this tired movie formula.<br/><br/>
Flashier and more stylish outing - big on brawn and tackiness -  has Balboa getting some of his own medicine. Challenged by an up-and-coming boxer and subsequently beaten. <br/><br/>Will he win the re-match? Does Balboa wear stars-and-stripes shorts?<br/><br/>All that is memorable is the theme song (Eye Of The Tiger by Survivor) and yet another go-around by Burgess Meredith as mentor and coach, Mickey."
