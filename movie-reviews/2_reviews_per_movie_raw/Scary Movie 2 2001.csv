"insomniac_rod","8","37","47","18 January 2007"," Hilarious! very crude and edgy.
","This is the raunchiest of the Scary Movies. If you thought the original was ""too much"", well, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended people. <br/><br/>I had a great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I really liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It was about time that the ""Scary Movie"" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example, when Reagan says ""f*** me"" and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says ""she won't even let me touch her!"" and the priest responds ""yeah sometimes that happens, you have to give candy to the children"" (or something like that); obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the movie also has ""classical"" but always effective teen humor . For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180º; and the always effective vomiting cycle. <br/><br/>After the Exorcist spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex ghost. <br/><br/>""Scary Movie 2"" does not ""cross"" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD; do not watch the t.v. version because it's very cut (specially on dialogs).<br/><br/>This is in my opinion the best of the ""Scary Movies""."
"Dragoneyed363","8","59","80","6 June 2008"," I thought it was a great sequel that lived up to the first quite well
","Why do a lot of people who really enjoyed the first movie hate this installment? I can understand why some critics would, or people that just thought the first was okay, however, I enjoyed both the previous film before this and this film itself, thinking this film is really funny and enjoyable. It was great fun and total entertainment to watch, and I have watched it quite a few times.<br/><br/>The comedy might have been a little too over-the-top and repitive at times, as it seemed like this one tried really hard to please the audience when the first one just went with the flow, but that is really how a lot of comedies are like, even more so now than then, so I do not see how this one is any different. Anna Faris pulls off Cindy Campbell's character wonderfully, again, and nobody could have done it better than her. All the other familiar characters, as well as the new ones, are excellently portrayed and likable, in a sense, and the movie has a high replay value, for me at least. This movie was not a disappoint to me either, because I thought it lived up to Scary Movie perfectly.<br/><br/>There were a lot of funny parts in this film, such as the opening song, the Charlie's Angels spoof scene, the scene were buddy gives back Cindy's book, and the Cindy singing in the car scene. If you have seen the film, you know what I am talking about and hopefully enjoyed those scenes as well. If you hated this film, please try to watch it again, and you'll see just how good it really was, hopefully."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","83","119","5 August 2001"," Oh, come on! Let go! Trust me, it's not that bad!
","OK, not Oscar material and this was pretty badly made. But again like most brainless comedies, I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with ""Scary Movie 2"". I mean people are being so harsh on this film, I understand, I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter, I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.<br/><br/>We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie: Anna Farris, a surprising return of Regina Hall, and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist(hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry, I just had a great time. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.<br/><br/>The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes, it was gross, but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever, but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes, yes, and very crude one's, this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, you'll enjoy this one too! <br/><br/>7/10"
"loserking","10","31","42","5 July 2001"," A Weak Storyline Filled With Constant Hilarity
","Since the first Scary Movie completely ripped off Scream, at some points scene for scene, the film had a very developed, rich storyline which was filled with tons of hilarious gags.<br/><br/>Half of that works in the sequel.  The storyline is weak, mainly copying the plot of the lackluster ""The Haunting"" which leads the main characters to spend a weekend in a haunted house.  This is a great idea, but the story is not developed enough and after watching the film, I couldn't even remember why the characters ended up in the house in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet, the film's cast and writers give constant hilarious moments to add to the weak storyline and make a great film. Anna Farris returns as Cindy Campbell and is just as hilarious as she was in the first film.  Other returning members are Shawn Wayans as Shorty, Regina Hall as Brenda, and Marlon Wayans as Ray.<br/><br/>There are several other new cast members, such as Tori Spelling, who does a tolorable job as a fellow college student, Alex.  Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious.  This is a great movie to see, because it's short and just something to laugh about, so fork over the nine bucks and laugh your ass off."

","Although not quite as funny as the original, I still enjoyed Scary Movie 2 very much. While some bits are downright idiotic, some are genuinely hilarious, and will have you rolling in the aisles. If you're not a fan of Scary Movie, you won't like this one either, however. But, if you enjoyed the first, come back to see this one too."
"Chiidatbe","10","18","24","28 November 2008"," Sequel returns with great original characters and brilliant new ones
","To start with, I love the way this film was worked around a storyline where the original Scary Movie seemed rather random. Ferris, Hall and Marlon Wayans all once again completely steal the film, but new additions Cross and Elliott also have some amazing writing and scenes.<br/><br/>The highlights for me were the opening scene with the spoof of The Exorcist, Cindy vs. Cat, the talking parrot and any scene involving Chris Elliott. I also thought the Charlie's Angels spoof towards the end of the film was also brilliant, particularly when a cow was being sucked around the tornado.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie to watch if you want some good amusing immature fun with over the top acting and great gags."
"blackaugust79","9","13","17","21 May 2009"," The definition of mixed bag comedy
","I'll admit that I written off Scary Movie 2 when I first seen it as a sporadically funny sequel to Scary Movie(which I love). After seeing it again it's a lot better than I gave it credit for and is better than what comes after it.<br/><br/>Scary Movie 2 pokes fun at haunted house movies, The Exorcist and even Charlie's Angels. The movie has its fair share of laughs in the beginning of the movie but sometimes the gross out gags are way over the top. To explain why I think this movie is a mixed bag, I'll contrast the funny parts from the unfunny parts.<br/><br/>Funny Scene#1: The beginning with the spoof on the Exorcist was pretty funny stuff.<br/><br/>Unfunny scene#1: The scene with James Woods on the toilet is flat out disgusting. Bleeech! James Woods already gives me the creeps so the last thing I need to see is him on the john.<br/><br/>Funny Scene:# 2: Marlon's character teaching Anna Faris's character how to be hip and she mistakenly beats up on some unsuspecting girl.<br/><br/>Unfunny Scene# 2: Chris Elliot's abnormal hand digging into a pie as well as a turkey. Nuff said! Funny Scene# 3: Tori Spelling's character becomes clingy to a ghost after a night of sex.<br/><br/>Unfunny Scene# 3: Shawn Wayan's character impaling the evil clown from Poltergeist with his third leg. Need I say more? Funny Scene: # 4: The spoof on the Nike commercial.<br/><br/>Unfunny Scene: #4: The wisecracking parrot pooping.<br/><br/>I could go on forever.<br/><br/>Scary Movie 2 is a lot better than most people give it credit for but it could have been a lot better than it predecessor. What kills it is the excessive gross out gags are focused on more than the movie that its supposed to poke fun at. All in all it was a good spoof not a great spoof. Its definitely better than Scary Movie 3 and 4."

"patrick_bateman_90029","8","30","47","4 July 2001"," Even funnier than Scary Movie! (some spoilers)
","I just got back from ""Scary Movie 2"" just about an hour ago and I'm still laughing from thinking about it.<br/><br/>The cameos by James Woods, Veronica Cartwright, and Natasha Lyonne are funny enough just to pay for admission. But that's before the film starts to get funnier as the Wayans spoof ""The Haunting,"" ""Hannibal,"" ""Save the Last Dance,"" and ""Charlie's Angels."" The only (semi) downside to the movie was that the sex jokes in this were racier than the ones in the original film, especially the spoof of ""Titanic"" that ends very messily.<br/><br/>But besides that, ""Scary Movie 2"" may probably be the most fun you will probably have at the movies this summer."
"remember_the_daze","Null","27","46","15 October 2002"," Clever and Witty but Mixed Emotions.
","I have various mixed emotions about this sequel to the hit SCARY MOVIE. It wasn't as good but it delivered many laughs and slap-on-knees. I was a little surprised at this one on how they could spoof any movie right after the other. If you really liked the first one, you could be disappointed or satisfied with this one. I was satisfied. 7/10<br/><br/>My MPAA rating: R for strong crude sexual content and humor, drug use and language."

"Tom Schulz","Null","18","38","17 July 2001"," Bottom of the Barrel
","I might have to do some checking up on this, but I'm pretty sure that seven writers is a record high for a non-anthology film. And just what is this cinematic treat scripted with so many pens? It's probably really good, right? I mean, with seven writers, it would have to be extremely goodor very, very bad. Unfortunately, it is the latter, and the movie is `Scary Movie 2.' This sequel of the funny teen-horror spoof `Scary Movie' has none of the subtleties, parodies, or even big laughs the original film did. Instead, it digresses to overtly sexual and gross-out humor which doesn't even work on a gut level. I feel sorry for every person associated with this project.<br/><br/>The story line is actually a little more involved for `Scary Movie 2,' as if you needed a plot to set up the horrendous `laugh scenes,' which are fewer and far between this time. Classic camp actor Tim Curry is Professor Oldman, a college teacher who recruits a group of students to spend the night in a haunted house so he can conduct some sort of experiment (though we never really understand what that experiment is all about). Of course, this group contains most of the kids from the first `Scary Movie,' including innocent Cindy (Anna Faris), loud-mouthed Brenda (Regina Hall), marijuana-obsessed Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and sexually questionable Ray (Shawn Wayans). New this time is straight-arrow Clark (Christopher Masterson).  The house is inhabited by the twisted butler Hanson (Chris Elliot) and even a ghost (`Night Court's' Richard Moll). The kids slowly discover the mysteries and secrets of the house, and make every bodily function, sexually oriented, inappropriate joke along the way.<br/><br/>There are those who complain about this style of humor in general, and therefor will not see this movie. However, sometimes it works, such as in the original `Scary Movie,' `American Pie,' and even at the far end of the scale, `There's Something About Mary.' There, the gross out is permissible because there are characters we mildly care about, or there are other types of humor going on as well. <br/><br/>However, `Scary Movie 2' is the prime example of where gross out humor can go wrong. Instead of playing up some of the humorous character stereotypes, or mixing in some creative horror movie parodies with the gross-out humor, `Scary Movie 2' relies solely on it. It seems to me that many scenes in the film were robbed of their comic potential so our seven scriptwriters could fit more vomit, feces, and other unmentionable bodily concoctions into the film.<br/><br/>There are a few laughs that harked back to `Scary Movie,' and those scenes always feature one of the two Wayans brother's characters. Even though they had five other folks working with them, its clear that this is their project. Maybe those other five scriptwriters fought back and added in the gross-out stuff.<br/><br/>As for performances, the same can be said. Both Wayans seem to have more comedic experience than their fellow teen-age counterparts. Faris is better than she was in the first `Scary Movie,' but nowhere near as funny. Plus, she still looks and sounds just a little too odd for me. Curry hasn't had a good role since the mid 80's, and its sad that this is the caliber of film he works in. There are other famous cameos including James Woods as a priest and former Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter as his assistant, but one must wonder what they are doing slumming around in this film. After watching Woods in his worst performance to date, it frightened me to realize that Marlon Brando was originally cast in the role. There would be no saving his career had he gone through with this. <br/><br/>If you have any desire to be thoroughly disgusted, or like your humor from the bottom of the barrel (and I mean bottom!) then check out `Scary Movie 2.' Otherwise, go on living your life with the knowledge than unlike myself, you managed to escape this waste of a sequel."

"JadeEagle224","2","12","28","19 January 2003"," Such a let-down from the first one! (Spoilers)
","I *loved* the original Scary Movie.  I'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor.  It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor.  The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel.  I think the Wayans' are a family of comical geniuses.  Alas, even geniuses make mistakes.<br/><br/>The movie begins with promise.  I liked ""The Exorcist"" parody, especially the ""come on out, ma"" gag.  Now, that's Wayans-quality material.  But, other than that, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him.  Meanwhile, he's saying, ""It was just a booty call!!""  That was kinda funny.  2) The ""Save the Last Dance"" parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves.  But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone.  For example, in Scary Movie I, several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay.  This was hilarious.  But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny.  This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far.  This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately.  <br/><br/>As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10."
"moviemaniac008","7","8","17","14 June 2008"," Doesn't beat the first, but still has a lot of potential.
","Scary Movie 2 is way badder than the first. Scary Movie 1 had laughs every single minute of the movie, but the second one is less funny. The interpretation was still very good, and Keenan Ivory Williams is still able to direct his movie, but let's just say it's not as funny and as organized as the first Scary Movie. Yeah, you get a laugh every once a while, but still, that's not enough to make this movie one of my favourites. It's watchable, but still, as I said many times, Scary Movie 1 is way much better. The Wayans brothers are still pretty good, but I've seen a lot better (and funnier) results from them than from Scary Movie 2."
"Coventry","3","9","20","16 January 2005"," A very poor and lackluster effort.
","The unexpected success of ""Scary Movie"" demanded an immediate sequel and all the Wayans' brothers could come up with was this uninspired, irritating story that (attempts to) spoof Haunted House horror films such as the ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""the Haunting"". Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out. Apart from a bearable intro, in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism, ""Scary Movie 2"" is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes, exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror. The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced (like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell, cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot. Tim Curry, once the star of cult-classics, lowers himself to playing the horny college professor. This film is vulgar, tasteless and very offensiveyet, I couldn't care less about that! It's not funny and that's pretty bad for a supposedly hilarious parody/comedy. Avoid in case you've got some brain capacity left!"

"JokerSwan","1","7","15","29 April 2006"," Could it get any worse than this?
","I liked the first Scary Movie. Yes, it had silly and gross jokes at times and the parodies weren't as sharp as they could have been. But it WAS funny and it had parodies. This sequel started out about the same, but soon the parodies were dropped to make way for the Wayans brothers' running gags, the same as in the first movie. These are: <br/><br/>1. Gays. Gay guys are all nymphomaniacs, so watch out straight guys! Don't befriend a gay guy, he's sure to fall in love with you and/or molest you. And the doll rape scene? Not funny, just gross. <br/><br/>2. Handicapped people. In the first movie there was Dewey, the mentally retarded guy, whose only redeeming moment was when he turned out to be the killer who had only been faking retarded the whole time. In this movie there's Dwight, a wheelchair-bound guy who's obsessed with never asking for help. I don't think I get the joke there. We're also introduced to Hanson (played disgustingly by Chris Elliott), who has a withered hand and - well, that's it. He's gross! I mean, a withered hand, no need for a personality or anything. Just like Goldmember on Austin Powers, he's just gross for the sake of gross, and therefore not funny.<br/><br/>3. Bodily fluids. We got to see them all in this one, and when there's a pee scene, a fart scene and a vomit scene within the first minutes, you're in trouble. The sperm explosion joke from the first movie was repeated. These are surely funny moments to some viewers, but to others like me it's just cringeworthy and disturbing.<br/><br/>4. Sex. This can't be avoided in a teen comedy, but it was supposed to be a parody of scary movies and not all about sex. I agree with the poster who said the Wayans brothers should just make a porn movie. They seem obsessed with sex.<br/><br/>5. Drugs. Shorty's back and still not doing anything but smoking pot. It gets really tired after a while. I did laugh when the plant rolls a joint with him inside, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all.<br/><br/>The only part that works is the Exorcist spoof in the beginning, but even that is ruined with crap, pee and vomit jokes. Notably, this part is the only one without the main characters present. As for the roles, Anna Faris does her best, but her role is pretty much being a stupid pretty girl. Kathleen Robertson gets to play the sex bomb and Tori Spelling is the ""athletic"" girl who has sex with the ghost, and who dies pretty soon. Both are pretty underutilized and aren't even present in most scenes. The new addition, besides Hanson and Dwight, is a parrot saying dirty/rude things, which is pretty predictable and boring.<br/><br/>All in all, a very disappointing sequel. Not worth watching. 1/10."
"stev7708","1","7","15","29 July 2002"," One of the worst sequels I've EVER seen!
","1/2* out of **** <br/><br/>   What on earth happened? I don't think I have ever in my entire life seen a film so funny and original have such a TERRIBLE sequel. The things they spoofed weren't really well done, some of the gags weren't even spoofs but rather replicas of what the film was TRYING to spoof, some gags were reused, horribly, and frankly, the comedy tried too hard.<br/><br/>   I have a feeling the only reason people are saying this one was funnier than the first (which I've heard a lot of) is because of one of the following:<br/><br/>1: They are saying what they think their friends will say, and their friends are saying what they think THEIR friends will say, merely for popularity reasons, however untrue. <br/><br/>2: They are overly optimistic. I personally know very few people who didn't enjoy the first film, so the fact that the sequel was garbage just can't be!<br/><br/>
3: They saw the film on the worst day of their life, which had subsequently demolished their taste and humor to horrific lows,thus ANY comedic movie, good or bad, funny or unfunny, was just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>4: They were really, REALLY toasted when they saw this movie, thus EVERYTHING, including the projector rays penetrating through the dust of the theatre, was funny. <br/><br/>   Admittedly I am somewhat grading this film compared to the first installment, which isn't really fair, but I doubt even without that bit of criteria that this movie would have been enjoyable. Besides, that's the price you pay when you make a sequel, especially when you promised that there wasn't going to BE a sequel! (see tagline of ""Scary Movie (2000)"" The first film was VERY good, I can't stress that enough, frankly I haven't laughed that hard in a movie theatre since. With the sequel, I giggled a few times, but that hardly makes it a genuinely funny movie. Am I being overly harsh? Nope. I myself was in the midst of an average, take it or leave it day, am only slyly optimistic, care not what my friends think about my tastes, and had not taken part in any mind altering benders that day, and hence saw the movie for what it was:  A WASTE OF TIME."

","How would you define 'film'? If you define it as something that's filmed and put together, I suppose that you could claim that this falls under that definition, but if you define it as something that has structure, continuity and meaning, then this isn't a film. It's just a bunch of gags and scenes(badly) cut together. Every single character that you hated in the first, and was glad to see die, has returned, including a few new cliché characters to hate. The film is entirely carried by stereotypes, and tries continually to make you laugh at stuff that anyone with just a tiny amount of moral wouldn't laugh at if his or her life depended on it. Stuff like homosexuality, the physically and/or mentally disabled, junkies, etc. The list goes on, but I really don't feel like typing it all here. The gags and jokes are powerfully unfunny. I think I smirked once during the film, and that's it. The humor obviously tries to offend, and it certainly succeeds; they just forgot to make it funny, in the process of thinking up stuff that will make plenty of people find the film disgusting(what's wrong with the Wayans', anyway?). The humor consists entirely of tired clichés, worn-out stereotypes, gross-out comedy, and bad spoof sequences. Throughout the entire run-time(which is less than 90 minutes, what's wrong Wayans', did you run out of material?), there was only one single gag that was mildly amusing; a spoof of the Nike commercial that was on TV back in '01, which of course doesn't seem funny now, when they're not sending that commercial. Pretty much all of the movie spoofs in the film don't work, they mostly seem forced, and very weak. I guess you could basically sum up my opinion of this ""film"" by quoting the very words my father said when he saw the first few minutes of the first Scary Movie; ""All that sex and violence... what's the point? Really, it's not even funny, it's just offensive and disgusting."" I don't really recommend this to anybody, except, of course, if there actually exists anyone who are *that* big fans of the Wayans brothers, that they actually could sit through this badly edited and terribly unfunny mess. 1/10"

If you aren't twelve years old, you may not agree. It's just harsh and sophomoric. This formula wears out it's welcome in the first ten minutes. Each new bit is lousy and unfunny, and runs on and on without eliciting even a giggle: Chris Elliott with a withered hand, a foul-mouthed parrot, a Nike basketball spoof, a fist-fighting cat. What does any of this have to do with scary movies? It's so chronically off-track that you begin to wonder what the hell it is they're ""satirizing.""<br/><br/>This is not how the first movie operated. Whoever directed this has no sense of humor, excess or pacing.<br/><br/>No one will ever go broke making ever-more stupid movies for baked twenty-year-olds. This is a horrible movie made by the retarded, for the oxygen deprived."

"Old Joe","Null","8","20","29 December 2004"," This is not a movie, this is an uninspiring, disgraceful, pointless crappy spiel of wasted film. Trust me, there are better ways to spend your time then watching this garbage.
","I have to say that writing about Scary Movie 2 is a painful experience, but not as painful as actually watching the ridiculous film that we are given by Keenan Ivory Wayan and his crew. To put this movie in perspective, it was supposed to make me laugh, right? I did not laugh once, which shows where it fails for me.<br/><br/>So I am not going to deeply analyse this film, just tell you that it is not funny, has virtually no moments of greatness, the performances are pretty poor from all involved (including the Wayan brothers, Anne Faris, Malcolm in the middle star James DeBello, Tori Spelling, in a career destroying role, James Wood and Natasha Lyonne). While the direction of the film lacks any sense and is just one contrived mess in my view.<br/><br/>To learn that acting legend Marlon Brando was going to accept a role on this film almost made me faint from shock. Thankfully the great man was not well enough to do so, because if he had have been a part of this terrible conglomeration, I believe it could have cost him more than his health. Scary movie (2000), the very original movie spoof, was a surprise in the cinemas, taking off some of the great horror movies of our time much better and was more to my liking. Yet with that film, I could only enjoy it once as it ran thin on me after that. This is the sort of comedy where you are either going to love it or hate it. I hate it with an absolute vengeance.<br/><br/>So my rating? CMRS gives 'Scary Movie 2': 0 <br/><br/>Reason? <br/><br/>Sorry there is nothing here to really get your hopes up about this film. After turning this film off four times in disgust, the best part about this movie was seeing the closing credits, knowing that it was finally over and I was out my misery.<br/><br/>P.S. Now seeing that there is a 'Scary Movie 3' out, I just sit, cringing in silence, hoping that this is the end to these bad movies. If I had one request as a movie-watcher, it would be that I could have those 100 minutes of my life back. I am disappointed that will not be happening. A friend warned me that this would happen. Why, oh why did I not listen to him? I am such an idiot!"

","More mindless dross and movie entertainment that I wouldn't dream of spending money on, this quick sequel is very similar to the straightforward template from the first movie: a bunch of hopeless and clichéd characters go through movie cliché after movie cliché, whilst dozens of film references flash past all the while and a parade of ultra-gross humour attempts to make the viewer lose his or her lunch. Despite all of its attempts to be shocking – and the film laughs at race as well as the disabled – it's actually rather dull, despite frenzied mugging from the cast and a range of inventive special effects.<br/><br/>The humour here is more mean-spirited than before and even more gross, although many such jokes are simply copied from the original. Movie references include IT, CHARLIE'S ANGELS, THE MATRIX, POLTERGEIST, HANNIBAL, and many more, and are impossible to keep track of. There is plenty of stop motion in the movie which is pretty good for me, considering I enjoy such special effects. Because there are so many jokes (a couple a minute, at least), I did end up laughing at some of them, but most are pathetic. The major cast players are okay, with the exception of Anna Faris, who is dreadful here as before, but the likes of James Woods and Tim Curry have fun with their hamming, making this a slightly more enjoyable experience than the original. Not that this is saying much; this is still a mindless, moronic comedy for the teen crowd."

"bob the moo","Null","4","8","19 April 2006"," Unfunny, crude, puerile and obvious nonsense that will please dumb teens but nobody else
","As part of an experiment into the existence of an afterlife, Professor Oldham brings a collection of teenage massacre survivors to an old house on a hill where a year earlier there was supposedly a violent exorcism. The group get together at the house and sit for a meal  but the work of housekeeper Hanson puts them off a bit and sees them all go off for an early night. During the night the presence of a supernatural presence is evident and is gradually getting more violent. With Oldham's assistant pleading with him to end the experiment early, the others start to twig that their lives might just be in danger.<br/><br/>Some how or other this series has now reached four parts and, although I'll acknowledge that part 3 was an improvement on the first film, the second one is just as crude and stupid as the first. Sadly this really put me off and I honestly felt like giving up having watched a poo joke followed by loads of fake vomit in the first, very obvious, five minutes. Sadly this is followed by loads of very obvious spoofs very loosely held together in the ""haunted house"" plot but mostly it is loads of penis and sperm jokes that were not funny and were actually pretty unpleasant to watch  not something I wanted from a supposed comedy. It gets no better and I can't remember laughing once, it relies far too much on gross-out stuff that I just found puerile and painful  but I suppose that if you like that sort of then this will do the joke  I don't and this didn't.<br/><br/>The cast match the material by being sick and childish. For many of them I can understand why they are happy to work at this level but I can only assume that James Woods got a massive wodge of cash in exchange for demeaning himself in the opening scene. Faris is weak and the Wayans brothers are uninspiring and obvious. Hall and Robertson are both sexy but this is all they are used for. Elliott is gross and not funny while Curry turns in a very simple lecherous performance. Nobody is able to lift the material and everyone just swims (literally) in all the bodily fluid gags.<br/><br/>Overall a dreary and crude film that I didn't find funny once. Maybe I'm getting older but I didn't even find it offensive  just puerile. The cast can't do anything to make it better and generally the whole thing falls down thanks to the low aims of the Wayans brothers as writers and director; they are happy with the lowest common denominator and they aim right for it."

This sequel, however, is absolute tosh. The production values are unbelievably atrocious and not in a funny or camp way. Everything looks as though it was strapped together with duct-tape. The jokes are not funny in the slightest. The spoofs are unjustified and every single gag is just plain gross, opting for the lowest common denominator every time. Toilet humour is the name of the game and toilet humour is practically all you are going to get. I actually felt sorry for the actors in this film as I can not imagine how degrading and career destroying it must have been to appear on such unbridled trash.

"imlanglois","1","4","8","12 August 2002"," Ridiculously and painfully bad... they should have kept their promise.
","A quick warning.  Some things I say here might be construed as spoilers. So if you're really worried about me giving away some joke or plot point of Scary<br/><br/>Movie 2, beware my spoilers and read no further.  But personally, I don't think anything could spoil this movie any more than it has spoiled itself.<br/><br/>Part of the advertising campaign for Scary Movie was that there would be no<br/><br/>sequel.  I wish with every fiber of my critical mind that the Wayans had been true to their word.<br/><br/>Scary Movie was quite funny.  Somehow, they managed to successfully parody<br/><br/>a self-parodying genre.  This, I think, is mostly because the creative team wasn't afraid to push limits of tastefulness (-lessness), and there was a certain<br/><br/>innocence to their humour.  A crass innocence, lacking in the sophistication of a Zucker/Abrahams production like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, but a simplicity of style in the way the jokes were told.  While neither film has a grasp on comic pacing, the jokes of the first film still landed.  And I laughed.<br/><br/>Scary Movie 2, however, is a complete and total failure on all levels. Riding the success of the first, the Wayans pump up the bodily-fluid jokes, none of which are amusing.  Some, in fact, are direct replicas of the jokes in the first. They also seem to believe that it is funny when someone says ""motherf***er"" for no<br/><br/>reason, in an inappropriate instance.  And it can be funny.  When used<br/><br/>sparingly, the shock value of that kind of gag breaks the tension of a scene, and with a proper set up, will illicit laughter.  It is not funny, however, when that is the punch line of literally every other exchange of dialogue (variations include<br/><br/>characters saying: ""f*** this,"" and ""shut the f*** up,"" among others).<br/><br/>
This relates directly to one of the fundamental flaws of the film, which is that there is never any tension, or solid foundation of a joke, ever established. A great joke starts out like a string pulled tighter and tighter until one of two things happens: either it breaks from its own tension or it is cut.  Mike Myers is the master of pulling the string until it snaps of its own accord; as in the Austin Powers movies, he holds off on a punch line, or drags one out, for so long that it eventually becomes funny (consider his villains laughing diabolically for two whole minutes in the first film).  Either that, or the setup, with no superfluous distractions, is clean, taut, and then cut at the appropriate moment.  In Scary Movie 2, the Wayans try and fit so many stupid things into one scene or one<br/><br/>joke, that, as a result, the setup is never clean, and the punch line never lands. Rarely, in fact, is there a punch line.  Also, we see characters repeatedly cutting the tension by commenting on their surroundings (self-reference is dangerous<br/><br/>in comedy... it fails as often as it works).  At one moment, a character can deliver an absurd line with no one noticing it, and then in the next, a character might comment on a similar line by saying ""that's a stupid thing to say."" Consider two situations: in the first, the audience sees some food tampered with, or tainted in a disgusting manner, which is then consumed by a character in the film. In the second, the character sees the food tainted, is obviously and vocally disgusted, and simply does not eat.  The first can be (though not always) funny because<br/><br/>the reaction is elicited on the part of the AUDIENCE.  The AUDIENCE should<br/><br/>feel disgusted, or should laugh at the situation, not the characters.  We know something the characters do not.  This creates the tension and the release for us.  Scary Movie 2 repeatedly opts for the second type of joke.  There is no<br/><br/>tension, no mystery, and absolutely no funny.  Likewise, half the time, the<br/><br/>characters are scared and the other half they recognize that their world is one of parody and comedy.  Characters in a parody must accept and address their<br/><br/>predicament with life or death seriousness, or it kills the comedy. Consider Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun films.  To Frank Drebin, everything was<br/><br/>serious.  It was how seriously he treated absurd situations that made it funny.<br/><br/>There is also very little effective parody, if any.  Movies are not parodied here. They are merely referenced.  Just because I recognize variances on scenes<br/><br/>from the Exorcist, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, etc. doesn't mean<br/><br/>they're funny.  The source material is not mocked, commented on, or made light of in any capacity at all.  They are merely replicated with swearing and sex- jokes tacked on.<br/><br/>Finally, the film can't settle on a tone.  In one scene (in fact, in many scenes), a character is sprayed or covered in some disgusting substance, only to be clean and rid of it in the next.  Fine.  Perfect.  That's the way these movies work.  But in another scene, ridiculous occurrences (such as getting in a fistfight with a<br/><br/>possessed cat who handles a broken bottle) are treated with a seriousness and meaning by the characters involved.  One character supposedly has carnal<br/><br/>interactions with a ghost/monster, and the issue is dropped.  Another does the same thing, and it becomes a plot point. Either this is a movie that exists as a coherent story or exists as essentially a series of sketches with punch lines, but it can't be both.  Actually, that's not true.  Films made by brilliant comedians can do both, because they understand the nuances of their craft.  The Scary Movies are not made by craftsmen.  They are made by fart-joke purveyors.  The first film embraced that.<br/><br/>The second film is a little too ambitious, an 82-minute marathon of poor setups and no laughs, all the while wishing it could be a real movie that tells a story. What scares me the most is that Scary Movie 2 is part of a trilogy.  May the<br/><br/>movie gods save us all.  Rating (1/10)"

He walks into the room with The Exorcist girl, she spins her head around and he takes one look and says ""F**k this!"" And walks out, I actually laughed at that part. The rest of the humor is just horribly crude and rarely funny. The movie is just one big spoof on many different movies done very poorly. Both of these traits can be very good if done correctly, crude humor is funny in the hands of the Farrelly brothers. Spoofs are funny in the hands of David Zucker. But unfortunatly neither is funny in the hands of the Wayans brothers.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie to anyone except for the most immensely immature and perverted.

I was once involved in a minor car accident. It was much more fun than Scary Movie II. Please don't watch this. This plot is non-existent, not really a problem for a well scripted entertaining comedy, but this isn't one. From beginning to thankless end this monstrosity does not contain a single even mildly amusing moment. I laughed more in Brief Encounter. The acting is so bad it hurts, the script was written by diabetic gibbons with Tourettes and the general tone of this crime against humanity is so painfully patronising i was forced to jump up and down on my DVD until it was rendered conclusively unwatchable, avoiding any possible future chance that i might one day trip on a children's toy and accidentally drop the DVD into the player again, forcing me, God forbid, to sit before some of its cringeingly, achingly dull content again. Do anything to avoid ever seeing this abhorration. Take any necessary steps. Murder? Worth it. The only aspect of this movie that has any merit whatsoever is the title, which is fittingly apt.

","After an opening Exorcist parody (a film that already received a feature-length comic parody; Repossessed), this immediate sequel sinks right back down to the sheer stupidity of the first one. Lured to a secluded mansion for a sleep study, college students Shorty, Cindy, Ray and Brenda (from the first film), plus some others, find themselves trapped inside with evil spirits. It's all an excuse for unimaginative, low brow ""comedy"" involving semen, vomit, crap and other bodily functions, sex organs, inflated tits, rape, homosexuals, drug addiction and the handicapped. There are (pretty lame) references to The Amityville Horror, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Poltergeist and The Entity and some surprising ones to Poe's House of Usher and The Black Cat, plus non-horror gags (Rocky, Charlie's Angels, Dude, Where's My Car? etc.) to pad out the running time. Jokes are made about the Clinton/Lewinski scandal, the missing Florida ballots and Firestone tires (things that will instantly date it), plus a marijuana monster and the fighting cat bit is pretty cute. This has a few more laughs than the first film thanks almost entirely to Chris Elliott's inspired comic lunacy as a weird, perverted caretaker with a deformed hand. It took seven people to script this thing. Marlon Brando supposedly turned down 2 million dollars to cameo as a priest and was replaced by James Woods. There's no point to any of this, but as the end rap theme reminds us, ""Must be the money."""

This of course to spoof the horror-movie ""The Haunted"", which fails miserably. What i don't understand is HOW they could fail to spoof ""The Haunting"" which is a movie that offers ample opportunities for spoofing. But somehow they succeed. And basically all other attempts to make fun of movies, TV-commercials, music-videos etc. fail just as much.<br/><br/>But this movie does have ONE redeeming feature. And that is that the only scene in the movie even remotely funny is right in the beginning, even before the credits! Because the spoof of ""The Exorcist"" featuring James Woods at least offers a small laugh.

You will spend the next few hours in shock thinking about that time you will never get back that was wasted on watching this. How can something be so utterly terrible?<br/><br/>Have I put fear into you yet?<br/><br/>The opening 'exorcist' scene is remotely amusing. But from then... nothing. Just a mishmash of the same 'gags' about a wheelchair ridden character, a 'baby' hand and the EXACT same gags as the first movie. It will jar you with its stop start, stop start nature. The uneasy feeling you've done your money will set in by the 10-minute mark.<br/><br/>I've seen funerals that were funnier. What is the most worrying thought is that at some point, the creators must have just decided that they didn't care. The same as the actors and everyone else. They had a box full of smelly excrement and a wall. They chucked a couple of pieces and hoped they stuck and made it into a movie.<br/><br/>It gets to the point where, as yet another scene shudders to an unfunny jarring halt, for no reason whatsoever shortie is suddenly sitting with his brain exposed. You are crying in sympathy with the creators at how desperate they were to get one tiny incy-wincy laugh, pretty please?... You just sit back and with what little hope you have left you just softly whisper: why? why? why?<br/><br/>What was the movie about again? What tiny bit of plot is holding these various scenes together? Is this actually a movie or some unrelated unfunny scenes with the same actors. Why doesn't any one care?

","After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes.  Though i guess not. If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch.  With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again.  Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level.  Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it.  Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene.  Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around.  It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs.  It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either."
"pmoney13","2","2","3","6 July 2001"," Just not funny
","This sorry sequel to the original spoof might have been okay if it had not had the problem of being unfunny. The first movie was okay, mixing gross-out gags and parody of the Scream movies, but this movie is simply a stinker. The jokes are obvious, and can be seen a mile away. The dialogue isn't funny (arguably the worst thing in the film is a foul-mouthed parrot that repeats expletives at everybody within earshot). The movie spoofs are bad (why anyone would want to send up garbage like the Haunting and Charlie's Angels is beyond me). When the jokes were being doled out at a surprisingly clunky pace, I found myself staring blankly at the screen instead of laughing.<br/><br/>
The gross out gags in the film are not funny, just nauseating, and most can be sniffed out very quickly (unlike the bathroom scene in the original, which was a shocker to everybody). Gross out gags can definitely be very funny, as in There's Something About Mary or American Pie. But here the writers (for lack of a better term) want us to laugh at someone sitting on a toilet just because its gross. It doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>
The fact that this film makes the original look like a comedy classic just about sums it up. When I saw the original, I was surprised to hear audience members laughing at even the worst jokes. In Scary Movie 2, though, the audience didn't go for it. I heard lots of courtesy laughs and nervous laughter, like some felt they had to laugh because the film was billed as a comedy. Aside from one dinner scene featuring Chris Elliot there are no scenes that inspire raucous laughter, like a good comedy should. If you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere. This film should be avoided at all costs."

Anna Faris feels more confindent with her role this time. The scene where Tori Spelling's character is seduced by a ghost is hilarious and the Nike freestyle sequence is one of the most memorable of the franchise. Furthermore, the movie succeeds in spoofing Charlie's Angels and Save The Last Dance movies.<br/><br/>CONS:The film focuses too much on gross out humor and actually reinforces the bad moments of its predecessor. Chris Elliot's character isn't funny and the gags with his hand are unimaginative (what's is funny with the dinner scene?). The plan of Tim Curry's character leads nowhere and his sexual innuendos aren't dated so well. Moreover, David Cross as a wheelchair-bounded guy is bland and the jokes about his inability are horrendous (for example the scene with the stairs).

","Since the 1970s end, dirt-exploitation became in fashion through Hollywood's mainstream comedies, with a lot of producers enjoying manipulating the lowest human desires, with heavier and filthier load as time goes by. Till I came to a point where I believed that they deal with animals, not humans anymore. Naturally, (Scary Movie 2) isn't far from that point; it's nearly it!<br/><br/>In 2000, the Wayans brother's (Scary Movie) was a hit. For good parody out of the 1990s horror / teen movies?, for the dirty comedy? For both? Anyway, in the sequel, their target was making a parody of many horror movies, TV shows, and TV ads, while immersing all of that in an ocean of filth!<br/><br/>Filth, in this movie's makes' conscience, is comic. In my conscience, it isn't. It's only filth; purely, powerfully and torrentially made this time too. They sure thought ""Hey, if 50 filthy joke made millions, so how about 500!"". Not obligatorily a good move, but the producers must have LOVED it, giving the Wayans a mighty freehand to be as filthy as they could, to bring double the money that the original brought!<br/><br/>But profitable or not, the movie is ultra awful. Watching it is like swimming in a dreadful sewer. And completing it assures nothing but the masochist side in every human. The real comic moments are rare coincidences; it's like running into sane persons in a nut house. Here, filth comes with many shapes. Chris Elliott's character does the biggest job of it. I bet, the Wayans peed themselves out of laughing while making this, and we just were left to smell the conclusion.. of their peeing!<br/><br/>Action movies are all about many action sequences. Toilet humor movies are all about (Scary movie 2). However, this movie is cheaper than porn, because it could have been more but ended up being a nightclub designed as a real, so busy and so dirty public toilet. I won't say comedy was never more loathsome; it's loathsomeness was never more loathsome.

Well, a 1000 Razzies from my side then, and one Razzie for the Razzie foundation itself due to its shameful overlooking!<br/><br/>(Scary Movie 2) reached a zenith concerning the dirt-exploitation. Being that extremely overfull produces 2 kinds of audiences; a die hard lovers, and a die hard haters. I'm with the second. My only consolation is that it has fewer farts than (Nutty Professor II: The Klumps - 2000)!<br/><br/>Finally a note: 2001 witnessed a wave of comedies with various nastiness, like (Scary Movie 2), (American Pie 2), (Freddy Got Fingered), (Not Another Teen Movie), (Say It Isn't So), and (Shallow Hal), being not what 2001 is distinguished by, rather ashamed of! Though, after 10 years, I have to thank God. Because having in 2011 only (The Hangover 2), and (Bridesmaids), refers to how this sort of comedies has reduced through the years.

","Scary Movie 2 was described by the Producers as being full of Death Defying Action. Oh really! Well I'll say this. The only ""Death Defying Action"" which you'll experience during watching Scary Movie 2 is managing not to die of boredom! As many people have already said on the comments page here, I was a big fan of the first Scary Movie. It was very funny. Unfortunetly, this sequel is neither funny, nor interesting. It has no real plot and although it starts brightly, it quickly runs out of steam. Personally, if I were a main actor in this movie, I think I would lose a lot of credibility. Of course, Scary Movie 2 is not supposed to be taken seriously, which is why it doesn't appeal to many people. To get the jokes, u have to have seen quite a few horror movies to 'get' the jokes. Jokes? Hmmmm. Indeed, I spent 2 hours laughing so much at Scary Movie 2's hilarious gags and zany knockabout comedy that I: a) Split my sides laughing and am now carrying 25 stitches in my midriff b) Dislocated my jaw during the riotous masterpiece that was the ""clown under the bed routine"" c) Was suffering from oxygen starvation due to protracted laughing.

The deformity and disabled jokes although funny were getting out of hand by the end of the first half and the tired old sequences copying famous films have mostly been spoofed before.

They didn't care. The introduction parody of the Exorcist approaches the level of comedy of the original and shows how funny James Woods can be but after that it goes downhill real fast. Which leads me to wonder if they started out with as much enthusiasm as the first, but got lazy and decided just to slap something together. And why not, it seems slapped together from left over ideas they probably wrote over one weekend and contains zero of the care of attacking all the little details of horror movies.

","I rarely walk out of a movie before it ends.  I feel that I owe something to the cast and crew to sit through the results of their hard work.  But I left Scary Movie 2 after the first hour.  Simply put, there was no reason to stay until the end.  I had guessed every scene up to the point that I left, so I just imagined a dull, uninspiring ending and got popcorn instead.  The movie was lazy, not scary and not funny.  Essentially, Scary Movie 2 exists to capitalize on it's predecessor's name and make a lot of money off of teenagers (and me).  I enjoyed the original Scary Movie.  While I admit that it was lowbrow movie fun, it was hilarious.  The performances were funny. The writing was clever and satirical.  It was worth my money.  I feel that the makers of Scary Movie 2 owe me money now.  To think that I actually gave up an hour of my life for this worthless chatter angers me.  I will, however, say this about one of the actors . . . Chris Elliot (previously in Cabin Boy, There's Something About Mary, and the Doritos commercial) is hilarious as the disgusting misfit butler Hanson.  If this movie is ever on HBO, try to watch Chris' scenes.  He really is a comic talent.

","This original film was 88 minutes of the grossest, nastiest toilet humor with enough on-screen gags to warrant an NC-17 rating.  And yet, it was an enjoyable film for the same reason that South Park: Bigger Loner, and Uncut is an enjoyable film- they are both so shockingly vulgar and shamelessly stupid that they become something greater than toilet humor.  However, the thing about shocking people is you can't shock them with the same things twice.  The creators of South Park knew enough not to make a sequel.  After just seeing Scary Movie 2, I wish the Wayans's Brothers would take a cue from them.<br/><br/>The movie does not make any attempt to be original; it does not make any attempt to shock us; in fact, we wonder if any effort as put into this at all.  I can clearly see the writers, pressed for time and ideas, piecing together a script out of the worst moments of Scary Movie 2.<br/><br/>The original spoofed the tired and worn slasher film formula- particularly Scream.  This one spoofs the equally tired ad worn formula of haunted houses.  There are some smart pokes at Mission Impossible 2 and Charley's Angels; Chris Elliot and James Woods have funny cameos as a caretaker and an exorcist, respectively; and the film's most brilliant gag: a foul-mouthed parrot are the few examples of Scary Movie 2's originality.  Most of the film repeats the same jokes from the original, or includes new ones that make the audience groan when they should laugh.<br/><br/>The jokes are painfully unfunny and dangerously overplayed.  And the movie as a familiar feeling- like we've seen the exact same movie before.  Without its shock value, this is mere toilet humor<br/><br/>*1/2 out of ****"

A few of the actors were good, especially the girl who got knifed to death in the movie theatre in the first one, but somebody in Hollywood needs to tell the Wayans clan that not EVERY member of their family has the talent to be in a film.  Painfully obvious. Speaking of acting, Tori Spelling was in this one.  Normally I give her more credit than the average moviegoing critic, but she was terrible.  She has an outrageous scene that could've been the film's funniest, if she'd displayed any of the comic timing she had in ""Trick"".  Also, the director didn't allow her much, so it's not entirely her fault.  I don't normally show compassion for one of Hollywood's privelidged children, but if there was ever an actress who had to PROVE herself worthy, Tori's the one.  Keep trying, Tori. I support you. To sum up this movie, potty humor (bowel movements, body abnormalities, maturbation, vomit, kinky sex), not to mention jibes at gays and human deformities (I know someone with a deformed hand, IT'S NOT AMUSING, JUST CRUEL!) does not a funny movie make.

So, if the movie is bad, in the middle, ASK FOR YOUR MONEY BACK.  Many theaters will actually refund the money, or at least exchange your ticket for another movie.<br/><br/>I have done this twice.  The Mod Squad was so boring I asked for my money back.  They agreed and gave it to me!  Another film I can't even recall was so bad, I asked to exchange my ticket for a film that was just about to start.  I didn't just theater hop, because then the wrong movie gets credit. I asked them to void my ticket and give me a new one for the new movie. They did it, gladly.<br/><br/>Why would they do this you ask?  How much a theater pays to show the movie is determined AFTER the movie has been showing for a few weeks.  Sounds strange, I know, but theaters pay the bigger bucks only when they earn the bigger bucks.  If you ask for a refund, this gives them ammo against the studios, and the studios listen!<br/><br/>But if you just complain here, well, the studios don't really care.  Word of mouth is not expected on these movies.  It's a big first weekend, a mediocre second weekend, one good foreign weekend, and then to video.  The only affect you can have is NOT GIVING THEM THE GOOD OPENING.<br/><br/>Only you can prevent Scary Movie 3, because, they are already in pre-production, and if this movie makes any money at all, SM3 will be out in a year.

","* out of (****)<br/><br/>It was inevitable. A sequel to a financial succession that jump-started the spoof genre back in 2000. However, with disappointing box office revenues and harsh criticism, it goes to show many people did not like ""Scary Movie 2"". I am not one of those people. I HATED it. The opening for ""Scary Movie 2"" starts with a bang and is just very loud and eccentric, but with reasonable intentions. From there, it gradually goes downhill and by the third act, you just want to be done with this movie. The fact that the IMDb average score is 4.8, Rotten Tomatoes has it a dead 15%, and Metacritic has it at a 29% should really tell you something.<br/><br/>First off, the performers are just tried and annoying to say the least. In the original, they were fun, zany characters that just had something that clicked with the audience. Not in here. Furthermore, the story just goes nowhere. Going from scary movies to a random basketball showdown to a Charlie's Angels fight, it's all just sloppy and feels like the filmmakers just throw a bunch of random bologna and saw what could stick. The verdict is none. Hey, at least the first had a plot, albeit a shallow one, that you could easily follow and it would actually be a story.<br/><br/>To top it off, when your comedy falls dead flat on its face when it comes to jokes, then you know you did something wrong. The jokes are gross, in-your-face, and top each other in terms of raunchiness, but they are tired, dead, and truly redundant. I'll use a quote from critic Michael Phillips. You won't hear crickets in the audience. You'll hear dead crickets.<br/><br/>And lastly, this movie is just boring. While the original was not a good movie, it at least held my interest. This was just such a drag. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Scary Movie 2"" just doesn't miss the mark, it misses the target completely. They can throw all the gross-out gags and random penises at the screen, but I could care less. I need a fresh, hot script and some good performers to make the movie. If you fail on those accounts, your movie fails. What was once fresh and hip, is now just old, tired, and begs the question, ""why?"". I think the filmmakers got the title right this time. This movie is scary, because it isn't funny and just terrible to watch."
"Sandcooler","3","3","6","16 February 2011"," Way too rushed
","Given that ""Scary Movie"" was a huge hit, I can understand the studio wanted to strike while the iron was hot. This sequel came out less than a year after the original, they really wanted to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten the first one yet. Sadly, the time pressure is very apparent. This whole movie just seems very unfinished, lots of scenes look like blueprints of something that could potentially be funny. Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance, those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah, Shorty still smokes weed, the gay guy is still gay, Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics, the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line. At 83 minutes, this movie is really quite short, but it's still packed with needless filler material and jokes that just appear to be rejected material from the first one. Very disappointing flick."

","The first scary movie was just passable and third was OK but this POS is inexcusable. Disgusting and dirty humor probably intended to shock but ends up causing nausea rather than anything else.

This movie is not funny in any way and the less than disgusting jokes are incredibly stupid. Don't waste your time.

"Mr_PCM","2","3","6","15 April 2005"," not scary, not funny, not even so bad its funny - but worse!
","most of the reviews I've written so far have been glowing or at least grudgingly good with a few criticisms. This is the first I've written where I can find no redeeming qualities about it. So why 2 stars? Well, it is only 79 minutes long, and Anna Faris is reasonably pretty. Thats about it though, and really the only reason it didn't get lower is because i simply don't like giving 1 out of 10 simply because of the work that goes into making any film - but this film comes closer than almost any other I've seen.<br/><br/>Whereas the first Scary Movie, whilst not exactly brilliant, was a relatively original spoof of Scream and I know what you did last summer, with some genuinely funny moments, Scary Movie 2 has none of these. Furthermore, the first film stuck to poking fun at horror films, whereas this abomination of a sequel frequently meandered off aimlessly into other films, most notably a Charlie's Angels sequence. With the exception of the Wayans Brothers and Faris, the majority of the 'names' from the first film are absent - not that their presence could have salvaged this road accident of a film. What on earth were Tim Curry and James Woods thinking? The jokes are purile and immature, and their crude nature make the humour from the first film look like an Oscar Wilde play. Surely there are only so many times projectile vomiting and bodily functions can be amusing? and surely they are before the age of 15? (incidentally, this film is an 18, but it surely cannot have been aimed at over-18s).<br/><br/>The film starts only reasonably bad with a spoof of the exorcist, and, whilst never approaching the comedy of the first (that in itself not a great challenge to meet), it is watchable. Its all downhill from there though. As spoofs go, Spaceballs it ain't. By the end you are simply crying out for whatever serial killer they are spoofing at present to slash up them or, failing that, you. The tag-line read more laughs, more screams, less clothes - inaccurate on all three counts.<br/><br/>I've never given a film such a slating before, so this is a novel experience for me, and oddly a rather calming one too. The only scare to come out of this film is the prospect of a third film, and even a rumoured fourth in the franchise in the works. A truly terrifying prospect indeed."
"Silverzero","Null","3","6","3 May 2003"," Feeble, vulgar and tasteless humour, watch at the expense of your dignity.
","Sequels don't come much worse than this atrocity. Scary Movie 2 is a spoof of the haunted house genre, which parodies other movies such as Titanic and Charlie's Angels to minimal effect. While its predecessor was creative and often laugh-out-loud funny, this sequel just goes way too far.<br/><br/>The feeble jokes are for the most part, just plain disgusting. The new characters in the film are undeveloped, unwelcome and have no charisma. In particular, blow dryer Tori Spelling. Another thing, most of the characters who they killer off in the first one return here with no apparent explanation. They even decided to bring in James Woods and `Alien's Veronica Cartwright for a dreadful and rather pointless sketch on `The Exorcist' at the start of the movie. With more scriptwriters than jokes, I absolutely detested this film's risible attempt at humour.<br/><br/>But then again, if a money shot of sperm, a man being smoked by weed, a deranged hand, an invisible genitalia, a big black penis in some poor clown's mouth, a girl p*ssing herself and a vomit marathon are your idea of humour, then watch this film. Otherwise, avoid, avoid, avoid. 2.6 out of 10."
"mentalcritic","Null","3","6","14 September 2002"," Hollywood sinks to a new low...
","First they give Jim Carrey something other than a mop job, then they let the Farrelly Brothers make a film that isn't a documentary about the use of pooper scoopers, then they give the Wayans Brothers a budget to work with. Will the people in charge of the green light at Hollywood ever learn?<br/><br/>It's ironic, really, that people from In Living Colour actually have careers some ten to twelve years after the show was cancelled. I don't know what Jim Carrey did on that show to convince anyone that he should get money for anything other than being severely brain damaged, but after Scary Movie 2, he seems like the lesser of two evils. Which is also ironic considering that the original Scary Movie was actually quite funny in places. Maybe this is a call for more editors and script doctors to be employed in Hollywood?<br/><br/>I won't get into critiquing all of the points in this film that others have already bashed to death. It's just a waste of time. What I will do is go over a few things that I found ridiculously wrong with the film. First of all, basing the majority of a film around a similar setting or premise to The Haunting is only going to get you in trouble. The actual film was an unmitigated disaster, even when Owen Wilson got his head chopped off, so trying to satirise it in any way, shape, or form is a bad idea - it satirised itself very effectively.<br/><br/>Secondly, when you're choosing source materials or directors to satirise, it is generally a good idea not to pick someone who is obviously at least twice as intelligent as you are (although that could mean billions of people for the Wayans brothers). I am, of corse, referring to the utterly pathetic and childish attempts to satirise Hollow Man. Whereas the original made a good, satirical swipe at the empty morality of the New Testament, as well as provided a good story about a generally decent guy gone power-mad, the satire here was obviously conceived and executed with no idea whatsoever as to what the film was about. This is hardly surprising since, in a Christian-dominated society such as America, hardly anyone is going to properly understand what Hollow Man was about, but trying to match wits with one of Western Europe and Hollywood's most ingenious political satirists with a string of fart/body fluid/stoner gags is like trying to take on the entire American armed forces with a .22 - it just ain't going to work.<br/><br/>Lastly, while the America-centric humour of a lot of the gags in Scary Movie was countered by the possibility of seeing the original commercials or films, the former being shown on a ""greatest commercials"" show (""Whazzup!"" is actually an ad for Budweiser beer for all those people from the antipodes who don't watch ""greatest commercials"" shows), it falls flat in Scary Movie 2. The attempt to satirise the Nike ad was cut down in flames here by the fact that NOBODY had seen the commercial in this country. The fact that the satire was about as funny as a basketball match didn't help very much, either. Even though I like to think I am more cultured than most of my peers, I am also stumped on what the hell that gag involving Shorty's ""brain"" was about.<br/><br/>So to sum up, Scary Movie 2 is an unfunny film written by a bunch of juvenile dipsticks, much like the original, but this time nobody thought to edit the script and bring some semblance of humour into the film. ""What the hell,"" thought the studio execs. ""We'll just print this crap up and show it on the screen - the kids will love it."" Well, sorry, Dimension, but adolescents are generally far more intelligent than films like this one give them credit for, and most adults like myself outgrew this sort of drivel so long ago that we can hardly remember when it happened."
"django-1","3","3","6","15 July 2002"," OK but disappointing sequel
","The first SCARY MOVIE was a guilty pleasure that had a lot of laughs and was so over-the-top that it was also full of surprises. This sequel didn't really introduce anything new, and the first film was so extreme in the gross-out arena that they couldn't have gone any further in this one without getting an NC-17 rating. The clever moments here were few and far between, and it seems as though it is merely a cynical attempt to cash in on a successful franchise. If you liked the first one and it's a rainy night with nothing to do, you might get a laugh out of this, but rent it, certainly don't buy it, and please don't support a SCARY MOVIE 3 if they make one."

(*no spoilers*)<br/><br/>So these kids are put in a haunted house for a class.  Okay.  After that, the plot goes no where.  It is never explained WHY they are there--the beginning is simply followed by random puns and gross humor.  The jokes were good for a quick laugh, but they weren't much when you thought about it later.  And I found myself revisiting the same jokes that were used in the first Scary Movie far too frequently.  The fact that the cast is nearly the same didn't help.<br/><br/>I'll give them one thing--the opening sequence was pretty funny.  There were new actors involved (James Woods, Natasha Lyonne, etc.), and some great spoofs on the Exorcist.  But when it came right down to it, the movie lacked a good plot, decent actors (Tori Spelling?  come on), and most of all, a healthy amount of humor for what was advertised.  I'm glad I knew the guy at the ticket counter and got in for free--my $8.50 will go to better use."
"robwill","3","3","6","4 July 2001"," Well, don't expect too much of sequels.
","The most glaring problem with Scary Movie 2 is that it attempts to satire material so awful as not to warrant discussion, let alone mockery. However, the cinematography in the Exorcist scenes is quite good, and there are several hilarious moments.  Close attention to the story line isn't the most important thing for this type of film, but this time it's completely ignored so often as to make the film incoherent.  Another major problem is that they try to reference every commercial and recent mediocre film they can think of.  Be more selective, guys, as in the first one.<br/><br/>The first movie was much funnier than this one, but there are a few moments here.  However, many of the jokes are disgusting without the context to make them humorous, and others are just plain bizarre.  Perhaps the most appropriate thing to do is to appropriate Roger Ebert's response to Freddy Got Fingered.  The film may someday be seen as a masterpiece of surrealism. Nonetheless, it is not a very funny movie."

"heismanhype","3","3","6","4 July 2001"," What a waste
","I just got back from viewing what is arguably one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Don't get me wrong--I was a huge fan of the original installment. The parodies of pop culture movies and its ""we don't take ourselves seriously"" atmosphere were a welcome change and struck with great results. The sequel, although it admirably attempts to separate itself from the first one, would've been better off sticking with the old formula. First off, the new characters were incredibly mundane and unentertaining. Tori Spelling's role as a ditz was terrible. Getting it on with a ghost was absolutely pathetic. Some of the bathroom humor which is something I normally don't mind, was used to such extremes that the first 5 minutes of the movie ruined any chance of it getting off the ground. The rest feels so rushed, and it seems that no thought was put into the script. The writers tried to create some new material rather than making fun of current movies(I won't spoil the ""story"" for ya), but everything sounded insanely immature and insulting. Throwing ideas in a hat and randomly picking one was the name of the game here and it got ugly. Speaking of parodies, the few redeeming parts, such as the Nike basketball commercial rip-off and the scenes with the parrot were sufficient to prevent this film from making an all-time worst movie list, but that's hardly a compliment. Curiosity is going to get the best of many, but I'm giving it my highest recommendation to avoid at all costs."

"wroache","3","3","6","9 July 2001"," Disappointing Follow Up to a Good Movie
","I was very disappointed by this movie.  I thought that ""Scary Movie"" although not a great movie was very good and funny.  ""Scary Movie 2"" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.<br/><br/>The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.<br/><br/>Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all.  But bad comedy is still bad comedy.<br/><br/>Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes.  Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.<br/><br/>Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again.  For example, the talking bird.  Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying.  The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.<br/><br/>Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie.  For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in ""Scary Movie"" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her.  But this time around it was out of place and not funny.<br/><br/>The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around.  The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.<br/><br/>Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.<br/><br/>But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film.  The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor.  That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes."

","I actually enjoyed the first Scary Movie, I gave it 7 out of 10. But Scary Movie 2 is absolutely horrible. I don't mind gross out humor if it's funny, but here, it's not, it's just plain stupid. I do have some respect for the Wayans Brothers (and the endless list of other writers involved) for at least trying to parody different movies this time around, instead of sticking to the same ones as the first (although a few of the same jokes do show up again here). Unfortunately, they just couldn't pull it off. The teen slasher movies from the original were easier to parody, I think, because they're just really horrible to begin with and very easy to make fun of. People would have laughed no matter what. It seems like they were expecting the same thing with the second movie. However, most of the movies they choose to parody are a little more on the serious side, and therefore, are more difficult to make fun of. Not that it couldn't be done, but the writers would have to put more work into it. They didn't. All but a few of the jokes fall flat, and are more likely to inspire blank stares, not laughter. There are a few really funny jokes, but not nearly as many as the original Scary Movie, and not nearly enough to fill an entire movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/10"
"TexMetal4JC","Null","3","6","1 August 2001"," Badly good.
","Summing up Scary Movie 2 really depends on what you thought of Scary Movie. If you liked the original gross-out horror spoof, you'll probably like this one. If you thought that the first was horribly disgusting and gross and needlessly graphic, then don't go see the sequel. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Overall, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies (do we dare try to list all the movies? The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, 13 Ghosts, a Nike commercial, The Weakest Link, Poltergeist, Hollow Man, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, What Lies Beneath, Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, Save the Last Dance, is that all? Probably not.) Heck, Scary Movie even parodied itself! Well, at least I sure hope the complete excess of genital humor was self-parody. At least we weren't ""treated"" to the sight of REAL male genitalia in this one.<br/><br/>But anyway, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies into less of a plot (is that possible?) than the original. True, the gags aren't as funny, generally. But the movie does indeed contain some classic satirical moments: The Exorcist opening is classic. The Hollow Man cooler parody scene is also excellent. Also nice is the way the Wayans unexpectedly throw in parodies out of nowhere. Sometimes this works (Save the Last Dance), sometimes it doesn't (Nike). But that's the whole point of a parody movie. Completely random satires of a movie or movies from the genre in question.<br/><br/>
But what exactly was the movie/genre in question? In the first we had an idea that it was Scream. Heck, we KNEW it was Scream. But this one seemed to just be a haunted house movie filled with every sort of parody possible - part Poltergeist, part Hollow Man, part ???. So the movie suffers as a result.<br/><br/>Oh the laughs are great, and if you don't mind the juvenile humor, they're even better. But hey, it's not as good as the original, which really was a classic parody movie, even if it was disgusting at points.<br/><br/>

This time around, the cast is in a haunted house spoof, that consists of so many unfunny jokes, that you throw your arms up in the air saying ""what were they thinking?"". The humor in this movie is extremely desperate and contrived; even going as far as to spoof movies that aren't even horror movies. As my local newspaper said, Chris Elliot ""milked out every scene as much as he could without garnering a single laugh"". The only funny part of the movie was the Exorcist spoof (especially the party scene with Andy Richter playing the piano). After that, your waiting for the movie to be funny, until the halfway point when you just give up. For the remainder, your subjected to an annoying parrot that gets old really fast, Chris Elliots deformed hand, Anna Farris's very Jan Brady like disposition, recycled ejaculation jokes, and other very redundant examples of toilet humor.

","One good thing about Scary Movie 2 is that it doesn't make you bored all the way unlike its prequel, which even though was better, but was dragging towards the end. The problem with this movie is that there are very little gags, and many of them are not that funny at all. Some of them are just stupid and not laughable. It had some good gags too like the Charlie's Angel's spoof and a few others. But many of them were just repeated from the first part. A few scenes, like the basketball scene, were good to listen but didn't really make any sense. I can't comment that much about the acting here as all had to act stupidly. Though I feel that the lady who wears lesser clothes and is one of the friends, has no acting capability as she wasn't funny either. One thing was good.

"davemmr","Null","0","0","4 July 2001"," Thrown together sequel
","Everyone knows that sequels never live up to the predecessors.  There are many exceptions to this rule, but Scary Movie 2 is not one of them.  It seems that Keenan Ivory Wayans, once the brains behind clever parodies and satires, and his brothers just slapped together a bunch a jokes and tied it up with a weak plot just to cash in on the success of the original.<br/><br/>The jokes this time around mostly fall flat on their face simply because a) they last too long (i.e - Chris Elliot's deformed hand in the food) or b) it's been done before in the previous movie.  Oh, and I don't know what the Wayans were thinking when they thought that sticking in pop culture catch phrases would garnish laughs (specifically the parrot mimicking a certain British gameshow host -- you know the line, the guy who fancies himself a comedian at work by the water cooler always says it in everyday conversation thinking it's a side splitter).<br/><br/>The original Scary Movie got a lot of it's fuel from shocking its audience (with jokes you'd think would've gotten them an NC-17) or by going against the conventions (i.e. - the killer is never caught and the main character gets run over in the end).   The only thing shocking that can be said of Scary Movie 2 is that it doesn't even come close to the risks taken by the first movie.<br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin came from the movies clumsy plot.  It seems that they jerked around for a good hour or so until the professor's assistant tells everyone how to rid the polterguist pretty easily and BOOM!, conflict resolved quicker than you thought there was one.   It makes you wonder why the Wayans never explained how come they couldn't have just done this sooner instead of having everyone run around like idiots (or, for that matter, why they didn't explain how all the characters who were supposedly killed off in the first movie were all fine and dandy for the sequel).<br/><br/>
You could probably do worst than Scary Movie 2, but you can definitely do a whole lot better.  You're not missing much here if you haven't seen it yet."

","Scary Movie 2 is completely different than the first film. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but am willing to admit that the first one did have some funny jokes or sight gags. My biggest problem with the first one, overall was the lack of any real plot and the jokes that fell flat, which could have very well made up for the choppy plot. The second film has a _lot_ of flat jokes, although I will admit some of them were pretty funny, the crudeness has come down to an modified on steroids version of ""Home Alone"" - some of the films they make fun of aren't really too clear and stray too far from the orginals to really be parodies of them- The Mummy parody was unclear with a skeleton chasing them around? And the Sabrina The Teenage Witch parody was also unclear, with the cat fight and the ""Rocky"" ending? It was like a giant saturday night live episode- some funny, some not. But people will love this movie anyway, I saw it in a theatre filled with people laughing so loud, I may have to see the movie again, if for the sole purpose to really hear all of the jokes, or what the hell is going on. Just an added note- the script was pretty awful, but most of the perfomances were really pretty good, like Chris Elliots - even if the script seemed like it was written by a bunch of guys sitting down with a case of beer and Attention Deficit Disorder."
"jmutoND","Null","0","0","5 July 2001"," Rushed filmmaking drops the ball....
","Scary Movie 2 was made in less than a year.  The filmmakers, when they realized that they had a hit on their hands with Scary Movie, started on the sequel.  Obviously under studio pressure to deliver a summer movie, they finished with no time to spare. Editing was finished just under two weeks ago, getting the film to theatres on time.  One year from script to cineplex; sadly the rush to finish shows.  What could have been a cinematic masterpiece of bad taste, instead is a marginally funny, yet sloppy piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - the movie has its moments.  Not wanting to give too much away, James Woods as a priest, a spoof of the Nike basketball dribbling commercial and an appearance from the infamous ""mangina"" are segments that had me rolling in the aisles.  However, the movie was not consistently funny, and with a thin storyline, 10 minutes without a laugh can feel like an eternity.<br/><br/>The story in Scary Movie 2 is not as coherent as it was in the original. Many times it's not clear what the movie is trying to spoof, and the audience often ends up with seemingly unmotivated wackiness.<br/><br/>The movie is short (less than 85 minutes by my estimates) and the pacing suffers.  Instead of following the time tested ""set 'em up and knock 'em down"" formula of comedy, the set-up often seems to be ignored or cut out. As a result, the pacing suffers; when the jokes come too quickly, all in sequence, they become harder to digest and lose their shock value.  In addition, the shameless rehashing of several jokes from the first film lends a cheapened feel to the production.<br/><br/>The budget for this movie was twice that of the original.  Give this fact, the production value is inexplicably shoddy.  I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane in terms of technical skill, but the editing and special effects were so poorly done that it was distracting.  Several action scenes that could have been comedic goldmines were filled with jump cuts and other editing errors that made the scenes incoherent.  And we barely get a glimpse of the main ghost (Richard Moll! It's Bull from Night Court!) as if the filmmakers were embarrassed at how bad he looked.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you loved the first one like I did, you'll probably like the second one.  You'll be a little disappointed, but admittedly, it would have been hard to top Scary Movie, which I still think is one of the best spoofs I have ever seen."

","And not in a ridiculously funny kind of way, either.  The pressure to put out a sequel to a movie that is only a year old definitely took it's toll on this film.  As you may have guessed the gross out humor was piled on pretty darn heavy and many times it just looked idiotic. There really is no plot or story to speak of, the movie just runs from parody to parody (some good, some painful to watch.)<br/><br/>There were, thankfully, some good parts to this movie.  Kathleen Robertson, first of all, is just gorgeous.  Christopher Masterson ""blew up"" (see the freezer scene, you'll understand) in the role of Buddy in my opinion.  Some of the parodies were good, (""The Exorcist"", ""Charlie's Angels"") but not quite on par with other spoof movies like ""Hot Shots"" or, another Keenan Ivory Wayans project, ""Don't Be A Menace.""  Marlon Wayans was good at times as Shorty, but overdid it in spots.<br/><br/>There were terrible parts also.  Anna Faris, for as good as she looks, can never get that same goofy look of her face the whole movie.  It really gets under your skin. Chris Elliot and the part he played, Hanson, were an abomination.  Shawn Wayans...oh, nevermind. Although no plot was intended, the choppiness and confusion that the storyline brings is ""nails-on-a-chalkboard"" annoying. The list goes on, but I'll spare you.<br/><br/>So all together, I wouldn't waste my time to see this movie. And when Scary Movie 3 comes out, I think I'll roll right on past the theater.

""Hollow Man, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal"" just to name a few. Charlies Angels, one of the best weelchair chases ever and 75 mins of very rude jokes spice it up a little.

","AGAIN, THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS - but since the movie has like no plot or surprises, all it spoils are some jokes<br/><br/>I loved Scary Movie. The second installment, well... I´m not so thrilled about. Sure, it had good jokes, but this time, it had a lot of jokes which either were completely unfunny (all those jokes about the handymans hand were SO not funny IMO).<br/><br/>When the movie shines and makes you laugh, it WORKS. For example, you know the scene in the trailer ""I hope she doesn´t find out..."" ""Who?"" ""Your wife"". That scene itself is really unfunny, I wonder why they bothered to put it in the trailer, but a joke about one minute after this which builds on that scene had me howling with laughter.<br/><br/>And finally - maybe I just didn´t catch it, but with the whole movie having a cast of characters just like Rocky Horror Picture Show (they´ve got a couple, a guy in a wheelchair, some other not-so-important characters, a handyman AND Tim Curry in an old creepy mansion), I was really disappointed that there wasn´t a mock-up of it. If there was one, I didn´t notice it.<br/><br/>So, I can´t really recommend this movie. If you liked the first one, go ahead and watch it - you probably won´t be as thrilled as you were with the first one, but you´re pretty much sure to get some good laughs out of it.<br/><br/>Oh, finally - if you liked the first Scary Movie but didn´t like this one, you might want to check out ""Shriek (if you know what I did...)"", an (unfortunately) straight-to-video release. It´s a movie I personally liked even more than the first Scary Movie, maybe because it was really low on gross-out jokes.

","Scary Movie 2 is like the majority of sequels: alright movies, but pale in comparison to the original. There are several things wrong with this movie. First, its way too short, less than 1 hour and a quarter. Also, there are less jokes than the original. Second, some of the jokes are very badly worked (most notably, the rip off of the Nike basketball ad: all that build-up and a bad joke at the end. Third, even if it is a spoof and not a horror movie, there really should be a larger death toll. Finally, the plot really lets it down. Weren't Ray and Brenda killed in the first movie? Just who are Theo and that one played by Tori Spelling? They're not introduced to the audience, they just walk up to Cindy and start talking to her a few scenes into the film. I know a spoof doesnt really need a great plot, but when IMDBs two line summary would do for a full, in-depth review of the movie's plot, you start to worry.

"SPYMAN2001","Null","0","0","6 August 2001"," Tired re-hash of the first movie
","The first movie, ""Scary Movie"" was a guilty pleasure.  Unfortunately, the second movie, ""Scary Movie 2"" was an unrelenting disappointment.  Whereas in the first installment, I was laughing at almost every joke, gag, and example of gross-out humour; in the second installment, it quickly became tired and worn.<br/><br/>The Wayans Family franchise is talented, with brothers: Keenan Ivory, Shawn, Marlon, Damon and sister, Kim.  However, their involvement with this latest comedic offering proves that one can indeed go to the well once too often.<br/><br/>
The scriptwriting attempts to parody all the most popular movies from the ""Exorcist"" to ""Charlie's Angels"".  The question begs to be asked, ""How original is it to make fun of ""The Matrix""?""  The straightforward answer is ""not very"" when it is done repeatedly.<br/><br/>Keenan Ivory Wayans had the responsibility to bring his interpretation of the script to the screen.  Many times, the director of a film can save it from a mediocre script.  This time the effort fell miserably short.  The timing between scenes lagged and film seemed excruciatingly long.  The movie did not flow properly and appeared disjointed.  It can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle that is assembled in no particular order.<br/><br/>There is a consolation, the Director of Photography, Steven Bernstein, is a respected cinematographer in the film industry, with a best-selling book titled, ""Film Production"".  At least, the scenes were established correctly and the details were accurate for the shooting of the film.<br/><br/>
Finally, the ensemble comedic cast is a fine collection of talent.  It included the likes of a reptilian-like Tim Curry to an even more slimy James Woods, with his $1,000,000 cameo appearance fee.  Sadly, try as hard as they may, the laughs were forced from the audience.  The gross-outs scenes received the most guffaws from my fellow audience members, but the chuckles were soon followed by groans of disgust.  The reason was that the jokes were milked for too much mileage on the laugh-o-meter.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie's promoters did an excellent job in marketing the sequel to the first film.  The timing is impeccable, ""Scary Movie 2"" quickly followed onto the heels of its predecessor, ""Scary Movie"".  The second movie has quietly grossed over $60 million domestically in the U.S. , this compares favourably to its initial production budget of $45 million.  With overseas boxoffice and video sales, it will either break even or make a small tidy profit for its producers.<br/><br/>All other issues aside, if you as the moviegoer want to see more re-cycled content of the same in ""Scary Movie 2"" as in the first, ""Scary Movie"", go. Conversely, if you were satisfied with the first ""Scary Movie"" don't bother to go see the sequel.  Save your 8 bucks and go see another movie."

One basic rule of a parody is that the audience should have at least a hint as to what is being mocked.

Using a movie as lame as The Haunting as the basis of this parody is difficult to start with because almost nobody saw that awful movie (or cares to remember it) - plus the last one had many more horror parodies than this one.  Too many scenes fall short of the necessary comedic power the first one had.  The whole thing with Chris Elliot and the wheelchair guy was lame, and the dinner scene was a complete flop (and pretty stomach churning too).  Nice to see Night Court's Bull Shannon back at work, though. RECOMMENDATION: If you can sneak into the theater for the first 10 minutes of the movie (the Exorcist scene w/ James Woods, Andy Richter, Natasha Lyonne & others) do that (you'll nearly wet yourself), then run away as quickly as possible from the rest of the movie.

","When I first heard there was going to be a sequel to Scary Movie I was excited. The first one was hilarious. I like the Wayans brothers, and I think they are pretty damn funny. Theres just one problem: When the Wayans are good...they're really good, but when they're bad...they really suck...HARD. A good example of that is when Shawn and Marlon hosted the MTV Video Music Awards..they stunk it up. Scary Movie 2 starts out ok. The parody of ""The Exorcist"" is done well, but it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The big problem with this movie is that the unfunny scenes drag on WAY too long. Marlon's character is really annoying and not funny at all. That cursing parrot is extremely stupid and gets old very quick. The scenes don't flow together well either. It looks like they wrote the script in 3 days. I did laugh pretty hard at some parts, but most of the scenes were painful to watch and I felt bad for them. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but they made it impossible. What happend here Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan? Didn't you take the time to watch this thing before you put it out there? The casting was also a huge mistake. Chris Elliot is a funny guy (sometimes), but he sucks in this film. Don't even get me started on Tori Spelling, I'd rather watch my dog lick himself then watch her. Another big problem is that none of the characters die! Thats what made the first one so good...the parts where they got killed were hilarious. This was a huge disappointment. What is going on with comedies these days? The past couple years have delivered some of the biggest let-downs ever. Such as ""Little Nicky"", ""Joe Dirt"", ""Freddy Got Fingered"", and now ""Scary Movie 2"".

I have to say I was scratching my head a few times as to WHY exactly some scenes were even in the film. The opening sequence was hilarious and Natasha Lyonne has a talent for deadpan comedy. I remember seeing the first one in a packed theater and everyone was rolling out with laughter including me. This time maybe I cracked a smile here and there and then a lil chuckle. But that was about it. Also it wanders off to much into spoofing other genre of movies when we know it's supposed to be spoofing Horror type of films and should stick to that one. Personally I think since the first one was molded after ""Scream"", then this one should have been molded after ""Scream 2"". But that's just my opinion.

The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film.  Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie's Angels, which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.<br/><br/>Today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s' Poltergeist, et. al.<br/><br/>Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable.<br/><br/>One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel).

I think even ""scarier"" than the movie was the audience in the theater in which I saw the ""film"" (it incl. MANY children as young as 8 and 11... no doubt brought there by the misleading TV ads).

Artistically, there is no humor here at all--only the sort of nauseating and repulsive visuals (a jock with his penis pinched inside his tights asking whether it looks better ""in"" or ""out"")... visuals which people who are unexpectedly subjected to them usually try to cope with either by nervous coughing or with a right-down hysterical over-reaction (the adults in the audience ""laughed"" a lot louder than the ""jokes"" merited it, while the children sat in absolute stone-cold silence throughout... very probably forming the same sort of state of mind child molesters aim for when they expose them to hard porn in order to corrupt them into the perverted notion that these sickening forms of behavior are perfectly acceptable). The children in that theater knew what the adults apparently didn't want to acknowledge: Namely, that this was NOT a funny film, just a series of sexually deviant and morally bankrupt visual-verbal degradations specifically designed to shock even those persons who once imagined there were few things left that could shock them.

This is drivel of the lowest order and is completely devoid of redeeming values of any kind.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is a place for a film like this, even among educated people. For example, if you are a professional film critic, or even an average movie-goer who writes reviews for the IMDb (a group of people with whom I proudly associate), then a movie like Scary Movie 2 is worth watching just because it is so much fun to shoot it down afterwards in a review. There's something morbidly satisfying about watching a dumbass movie like this and then tearing it up in a review, even if you already know that not too many people will bother to read it. I can't even begin to satisfactorily convey to you the absolute idiocy of this film, I can only say that there is a total absence of any kind of talent or thought behind it, and it results as nothing more than an hour and a half of blabbering nonsense.<br/><br/>Did you ever wonder how many perfectly good careers are ended, some even before they've really began, by hideous movies like this? Tori Spelling's flailing and altogether unenviable career is officially over, Tim Curry is too good an actor to be completely destroyed by movie like this, but this was clearly his version of Travolta starring Battlefield Earth. There can be no doubt about Anna Faris's talent as an actress, and she's beautiful, too, but she'll never be able to overcome the awful reputation that she has established for herself in the Scary Movies. Marlon and Shawn Wayans are the lucky ones here, because neither had anything to lose when they took on these crapfests. This kind of movie is a metaphorical handgun with which various actors can voluntarily commit career suicide. For shame.<br/><br/>And one more thing, if any of the people behind the Scary Movies are reading this, I'd like to ask a huge favor for the greater good of mankind - ""FOR GOD'S SAKE, NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
"ashspicefilms","10","2","5","11 July 2001"," Brainless and funny spoof
","There are a lot of reviews bashing this movie but I think if you go into the theatre with an open mind for a new movie (this sequel has a slightly different feel from the original)and don't take it too seriously (these kind of movies require no real brain use) you will crack up at some of the funniest and most extreme sight gags to grace the screen in a while. I find the opening 'exorcist' spoof to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen, more so than the rest of the movie or it's prequel. James woods does a great job (this is his least serious role I've seen him in, I'll always remember him as Max Renn) but his and Andy Richter's characters are only in the opening sequence. The most memorable characters from the original return, although most of them died in the first one, but in this movie they are more than the simple straight copy from another character in a scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer movie. In this movie the characters, being in a completely different spoof, have more of an identity. With this sequel being pretty much as gross and extreme as the original (I was just glad ms. man didn't return) it's still not for little kids, although I'm sure tons of little kids will end up seeing it anyway. The acting gives me a lot of respect for the actors and actresses, because just not every actor in a big budget Hollywood movie is willing to do such self-demeaning gross-out humor (like the Cindy character). The Wayans were lucky to find such great and willing actors/actresses because performing a lot of their jokes (in what millions of people will see) is not easy to do, and for that I give them respect. I laughed very very much when I saw this movie. One thing that may hold back a viewer's laughs: you need to have seen a LOT of movies to get most of the jokes, most importantly: The Haunting (1999), Poltergeist, Hollow Man, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Hannibal. Oh man, I thought this movie was hillarious.  Best gag: The exorcist's reaction to seeing the little girl's head spin around. It is a simple and fast joke, yet it was hillarious."
"jboothmillard","2","4","14","21 June 2005"," Scary Movie 2
","I did used to like the Scary Movie films in a rather immature way, now only the first film is the one I can say good things about, because as they go on the sequels get worse and worse, and the spin off films from the same makers, e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck are abysmal, this was the second film in the near pointless continuing horror films, television and popularised celebrity news spoof series. This film predominantly parodies the haunted house movies, specifically the remake of The Haunting and Poltergeist, as well as spoofing or referencing The Exorcist (the opening), The Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House; Save the Last Dance, Dude, Where's My Car?, Paulie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Wild Wild West, the Nike basketball advert, Child's Play, Stephen King's It, What Lies Beneath, Thir13en Ghosts, Ghostbusters, The Weakest Link (quoted), Hollow Man, Titanic (quoted), Days of Thunder, Mission: Impossible II, Dirty Harry (quoted), Hannibal, Charlie's Angels; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Twister, Final Destination, The A-Team, Alien, Alien: Resurrection, Big Trouble in Little China, Carrie, Cats & Dogs, The Changeling, The Convent, Gladiator, Gone in 60 Seconds, Jumanji, A Knight's Tale, The Mummy, A Nightmare on Elm Street, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Pet Semetary, Poltergeist II: The Other Side, Red Heat, Rocky IV, Scream, The Shining, Snatch, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and The Usual Suspects. Basically the film opens at Hell House where a Mother (Veronica Cartwright) is concerned for her sick daughter Megan (American Pie's Natasha Lyonne), so Father Harris (Andy Richter) and Father McFeely (James Woods, apparently the part was to be played by Marlon Brando) have been called in to perform an exorcism, which sees the possessed girl's head twist all the way round and masses of vomit going on each other. A year later, charming but perverted teacher Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paraplegic assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross) have invited a group of clueless college students to spend a few days inside a large mansion, Hell House of course, in the hope of witnessing paranormal activity, the students include previous film ""survivors"" Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), Brenda's stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda's gay boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), as well as idiotic Buddy (Christopher Masterson), deluded Alex Monday (Tori Spelling) and sexy Theo (Kathleen Robertson). The house has a foulmouthed parrot in a cage there to mock and antagonise the guests, and there is also disgusting caretaker Hanson (Chris Elliott) with his badly malformed hand, but soon enough one by one the guests start to realise that the various spirits that inhabit the house, their voices echoing in the corridors, causing inanimate things to come to life and possessing. After various events, like finding out about the main ghost of the house Hugh Kane (Richard Moll), Alex wanting to have sex with the various demons, Cindy fighting with possessed black cat Mr. Kittles, Ray wrestling with a possessed toy clown doll, Shorty being frightened by a growing and living marijuana plant, and the Professor being killed, the remaining guests are ready to defend themselves against the evil forces. In the end, after a fight with the possessed Hanson and the ghost of Hugh Kane being destroyed by the device the house curse is lifted, and the group go their separate ways, and two months later Cindy and Buddy are a couple, and he suddenly disappears when she sees Hanson at a hot dog stand, he antagonises her until he is hit by a car, being driven by Shorty who is receiving oral from the female demon with a bag on her head. Also starring Cordelia Reinhard as Father Harris' Mother, James DeBello as Tommy and Lester 'Beetlejuice' Green as Shorty's Brain. The film is sadly no longer reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, the character stupidity and most of their personalities are unbearably irritating, the ridiculousness is unfunny, the gross and disgusting material is unpleasant, Cindy is far too clumsy and accident prone to be amusing, Shorty is still relatively amusing but becomes annoying at times, Ray is okay being obviously gay but oversteps the mark in moments, Curry and Woods in their moments are alright, stars Cross and Masterson are not very likable, and Elliott and Spelling are the worst. You may recognise the films being parodied, and The Exorcist parody is a not bad start, but the repetitive and predictable jokes do not work, the story is pointless, it feels trashy and is a waste of time, and sadly this feel was to continue for one or two of the following sequels, a rubbish and rather unfunny horror comedy spoof film. Pretty poor!"
"dockerykelli","9","1","2","6 July 2019"," A GREAT SEQUEL TO THIS FILM FRANCHISE!!!
","Scary Movie 2 is absolutely hilarious throughout the entire film. Love story blossoming, the silly antics that took place in the first one continued throughout this movie as well. A GREAT CAST along with the storyline! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE ABOVE 18!!!! A+++ Film."
"BandSAboutMovies","4","1","2","4 March 2019"," Even more Scary Movie...
","Thomas Shablesky suggested this film for this all request Horror Comedy Week. I've known him since he was a little kid, literally. His brother and I were best friends, often watching Phantasm 2 over and over again, as well as Blood Sucking Freaks. I'm sure we warped his brain a little. He's directed a few films of his own since then (and grown up around 20 or so years)!<br/><br/>Despite being killed off in the original, everyone from the first Scary Movie came back for this one. It's the last one in the series for Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and director Keenen Ivory Wayans. The Wayans would eventually go on to produce A Haunted House.<br/><br/>Kennan Ivory Wayans watched over a hundred movies just to get ready for this movie. It starts with a parody of The Exorcist that originally had Marlon Brando in it, who completed one day of filming before he left due to being sick. He got to keep a million just for that day. He was replaced by James Woods, who made $1 million dollars for just four days of work. You know who almost did that part? Charlton Heston and even former President Bill Clinton.<br/><br/>This sequence has Megan Voorhees (Natasha Lyonne!) becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane (Richard Moll, who has to be in every 80's horror movie). She even pees on the floor for an extended period, which is funny in the 2000's where it was scary in the 1970's. Woods is joined by Andy Richter as a second priest and they end up shooting Megan.<br/><br/>Everyone from the first movie is joined by Tori Spelling as a new character as they take a class in the paranormal from Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paraplegic assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross). According to Tori Spelling, she had a lead role, but after refusing to do a topless scene, Dimension Studios cut her out of more than half the movie. This seems kind of like BS, as this film doesn't have any other nudity, but when the Weinsteins are involved, who can say.<br/><br/>They end up going to Hell House (it's actually Wayne Manor from the Batman TV show) to do research, the home of Hanson the caretaker (Chris Elliot!). At this point, the movie descends into sight gags and gross-out humor, as you'd expect. There's a cat fistfight, sex with ghosts, Howard Stern star Beetlejuice inside someone's skull, a wheelchair fight and more. Your mileage will vary here as to whether you find this humorous or not. If you've seen The Haunting, you know most of this movie."
"Sleepin_Dragon","8","1","2","2 February 2018"," Crude and wonderfully funny.
","This is equally as funny as the first, for those that criticise it for being dull or over the top, it's a spoof parodying horror films, it's not meant to be taken seriously in the slightest.<br/><br/>The opening scenes, the parody of The Exorcist is one of the funniest things, I can no longer watch The Exorcist without picturing James Woods. There are so many funny moments I can pick out, Hanson's hand and the dinner, Ray and the Clown, but I can't help rewinding Cindy's scene with the cat, that's just too funny.<br/><br/>I think this, like the first was such a great movie, but then they had so much material at the time to work with, so much to parody. Films recently seem so unoriginal, they continue to rehash old material, that's why I couldn't see this type of film working right now, perhaps that's why the fifth instalment was so poor.<br/><br/>Not one for everyone, as it does manage to offend everyone, if you can take it for how it's meant, it's hilarious."
"absolutetravist","2","1","2","6 July 2016"," The joke is that it's not scary, the sad part is it's just barely a movie.
","Much like Scream 2, the original was a huge success (if only financial) and everyone knew the inevitable sequel had to be bigger, bolder, and even better. In both cases they failed though Scream 2 is a decent follow-up and Scary Movie 2 is not decent. At all, really.<br/><br/>Parody and satire are two forms of comedy that overlap well. Parody to be making fun of a particular film while satire targets an institution or ideal. The first Scream satirized the horror genre and the audience's awareness of formulaic conventions of cinema. Scream 2 to a lesser extent satirized the necessity of sequels while Scream 3 became a parody of itself. Scary Movie 2 attempts neither and, as Scary Movie 1 did with Scream, popularized the trend of referential humour. Do you remember this scene from that movie? Well here it is but dumber, no real punchline or set-up, just try and find the laughter yourself.<br/><br/>The film is slower, looser, and plain meanders through what coherent plot there is. Whereas the adopted structure of Scream gave a natural flowing pace, the new targeted genre of the Old Dark House is so poorly accomplished. The two biggest strengths of films such as The Haunting and the House on Haunted Hill being suspense and atmosphere. Unless a complete absence of those two counts for parody then the writers are left with resorting to arbitrary current pop culture nods from Charlie's Angels to Nike commercials with little to no connective tissue between scenes.<br/><br/>That Nike reference becomes a perfect summary of the Movie franchise from here onward. The riff of The Changeling into the basketball commercial is an almost clever subversion and yet they expect audiences to laugh continuously through every single character performing dribbling and passing until you forget what movie you're even watching. Monotony leads to false expectations of a punchline but there is none bar a character getting hit in the nuts before just moving on with the next scene.<br/><br/>I give the original Scary Movie some credit. It is lazy in just taking Scream's formula almost scene for scene but at least moves with a steady pace and some sense of purpose. These sequels are the equivalent of a YouTube playlist of fan-made parodies of completely unrelated films."
"OllieSuave-007","2","1","2","5 July 2015"," More crude humor.
","This sequel spoofs a number of movies including Charlie's Angels, Poltergeist, and Hannibal, with The Exorcist being the central theme of the movie. Here, some college teens are invited to spend a night in Hell House by Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) as part of a school project. However, Oldman's really wants the ghost of the house's former master resurrected.<br/><br/>There are a lot of gross sexual humor is this film, as well as over-the-chart shameless stuff. While I got a couple of chuckles out of the movie, the plot was rushed through and there is nothing supposedly scary or exciting about the story. If you want a good scary film comedy spoof, watch Scary Movie 3, which is much more entertaining and serves much better as a parody of scary movies.<br/><br/>Grade D---"

","Scary Movie 2 (2001)<br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>The original movie wasn't the greatest but at least it did manage a few laughs. This cash-in sequel has a few laughs as well but the majority of the jokes are just downright lame and certainly never funny. This is a pretty bad movie that has the people from the first, led by Cindy (Anna Faris), now in college and having their professor (Tim Curry) take them to Hell House where a year earlier a young woman was possessed by a demon. The opening sequence is a take off on THE EXORCIST with James Woods playing the priest. For the most part this entire sequence is bad but what few laughs there are come from Woods but I'm curious why he'd agree to appear in something like this. Either way, it's clear by the number of writers that this was going to be uneven but it was obviously also rushed to cash-in on the success of the first film. The first one was lazy for pretty much just remaking SCREAM scene-for-scene but this one here is just lazy because there's no imagination to it. Faris comes across rather bored this time out, the Wayans brothers aren't really bringing many laughs as like in the first film they are mainly here for gay or pot jokes. Curry is forgettable in his role. The only saving grace comes from Chris Elliott playing a deformed cook. SCARY MOVIE 2 lasts just 82-minutes but it feels twice as long and you know you're in trouble when a the smartest jokes seem to have been written by children."

Most of the humour in this movie was ridiculous, like every 5 minutes someone farted or something stupid like that. I still thought that some of the parts of this movie were funny but not all.

","""Scary Movie 2"" may well be one of the crudest, raunchiest and most vulgar comedies ever aimed at an essentially mainstream audience. This sequel to the original box office smash has a great deal of energy but little else to recommend it. The first film, though hardly a model of tasteful restraint, at least managed to be clever and witty from time to time. This version is a farrago of dirty jokes revolving around disgusting bodily functions and perverse sexuality - neither of which I have a particular problem with, but the least we could demand from such an assault is that the jokes themselves be funny. Unfortunately, most of the humor is executed in such a strained, over-the-top style that all the effort is visible right up there on the screen - the death knell for any truly effective comedy. At its narrative core, the film is a parody of all those ""Haunting""-type movies in which some carefully selected people are gathered together in a haunted house by a sinister doctor intent on conducting some diabolical experiment. Along the way, the filmmakers poke fun at ""What Lies Beneath,"" ""Invisible Man,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Poltergeist,"" ""Charlie's Angels"" and an assortment of other well-known flicks. <br/><br/>The fact that ""Scary Movie 2"" is aimed at a young teen audience should certainly give the parents of America pause. Although this film probably doesn't visualize anything most of these youngsters haven't articulated amongst themselves already, discriminating parents should at least be aware of the graphic nature of most of the material (if they have to pare this down for network television any time soon, there will be five minutes left of the movie). <br/><br/>Almost inevitably - as is the case with most of these scattershot-type comedies - ""Scary Movie 2"" manages to elicit a few genuine laughs with its antics - just not enough to make the film really worth recommending."

It had maybe and I'm being generous here, 2-3 more laughs scattered throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For instance, there is a talking parrot who uses more curse words than I do, but in a VERY extremely non-funny way.

Anyway, now I decided to watch Scary Movie 2 and I really regret it. I just wasted two and a half euros and 79 minutes on one of the worst ""comedies"" I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The trailer of the movie looks promising enough, but the film itself is unbelievably horrible. It´s obvious that the movie was done very quickly because the studio wanted to capitalize on the first movie´s success. Unfortunately there´s nothing good to say about the result. Few chuckles here and there aren´t enough and this movie´s gets so low every other second that it´s just disgusting. The makers also seem to think that bad and dirty language guarantees laughs. It just isn´t so. The scariest thing about this whole disaster is that people actually put money into this! I don´t even feel sorry for the cast members, their careers deserve to die if they seriously thought that this movie was worth doing. And James Woods...<br/><br/>What the hell has happened to good comedies? All these rude teen comedies seem to rule the business and all the good ones are overlooked. I just can´t believe it that there are people out there who liked this movie. Most likely those folks have never seen any real comedies like Airplane! or the Naked Gun which I will watch very shortly in order to forget Scary Movie 2.<br/><br/>My advice is... AVOID SCARY MOVIE 2 AT ALL COSTS! It´s horrible, terrible, disgusting, unfunny, boring, shocking and easily one of the worst so-called comedies of all-time. I just hope the third part will be able to top the second part as it has one of the Zucker brothers at the helm and Pat Proft as one of the writers. Beating Part 2 won´t be hard, though. You simply cannot get any lower than this.<br/><br/>>"

","SCARY MOVIE 2 is a film that is not as great as its predecessor, but what sequel ever is? The humor is not as funny as the original and the writers tried way too hard this time around, using cliched jokes and milking the cow until it screams. The opening spoof sequence of THE EXORCIST is timeless. I would pay just to see that. James Woods truly makes you laugh in that part.<br/><br/>The film itself is even implausible because the cast consists of many of the same characters from the original who we all know met an untimely demise at the hands of the ghostface killer. This time around, they have added Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Elliot and Christopher Kennedy Masterson into the mix and you have a blend of ""sometimes funny, most of the time not"" type movie. Sexual humor galore and nothing to account for it, let us hope that the third entry will bring back some of the well-needed, original humor that we were all hoping for when we went and saw this crap. SCARY MOVIE 2 gets 3/5.<br/><br/>Let me also take this opportunity to quote Jamie Kennedy from SCREAM 2: ""Sequels suck!"""
"Jayster-5","3","1","2","5 July 2001"," Not terrible, just not very funny.
","Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE scary movies, and bad horror is an artform all it's own. Watching a bad horror film can be rewarding, but Scary Movie 2 is not a horror film, it's a comedy, and bad comedy is not an artform. There aren't too many websites dedicated to unfunny comedies, as there are for bad/silly/cheesy/campy horror flicks. I did not hate SM2, it was a fine date movie, but as with the prequel the ""satire"" breaks down into an endless stream of toilet jokes. Toilet jokes can be funny, as they occasionally are here, but to rely almost solely on them in a film that presents itself as a SATIRE is wrong. I have the same gripes with SM2 as I did with the first one. Not enough genuinly smart jokes. Most are just gross-out style. With so much to parody in the realm of horror it's sad to see the comedy ball dropped so often. An over reliance on swearing and bodily fluids really detract from the actual satire. At least this one went away from the ""Scream"" style movies that it rheemed in the SM1. This one is more like The Haunting, with a little Excorcist and What Lies Beneath thrown in. I have to say this much, Cindy had me hypnotised, she's so beautifull I just wanted the movie to focus solely on her and never leave. Chris Elliot is also quite funny as the grotesque and gimpy caretaker, he steals most of his scenes. The clown under the bed scared my girlfriend, so it scores points for that. Tim Curry is fat; Tori Spelling is ugly; Cindy is hypnotic; the chick with the leather pants and visable thong should do Playboy; Chris Elliot rules; Drug/Penis jokes get old fast; that's what Andy Richter's been doing? James Woods has no shame. TWO and 1/2 STARS out of four."
"kurdt","1","1","2","5 July 2001"," as bad as the movies it spoofs
","For some reason, I felt jipped.  It seemed very bland and most of the good jokes were just repeats from the first installment.  Something was missing. Too much Chris Elliot, too, who is normally hilarious.  Plus, this film just reminds you of all the bad horror films that have come out in the past couple of years.    I would suggest watching Scary Movie I over this film any day."
"gallifreyent","1","1","2","22 February 2002"," What's scary is that this film was even made.
","What a disappointing waste of talent!  As a long-time fan of the Wayans family, I looked forward to the sharp wit and excellent sense of parody on which the family's name was made.  With K.I. Wayans at the helm, this should have been a sure thing.  Unfortunately, it was instead a waste of time and money to sit through this sad, humorless film.  I did not think it possible to drag so many talented people so far down.  Relying on gross-out and sexual ""jokes,"" this film insulted the viewer with non-sequiturs, build ups for which there was no punch line, and scenes that run pointlessly on.  The film had only one truly funny moment, a scene which had little to do with the rest of the story and involved a ""potted"" plant.  ""Scary Movie"" was sharp and funny.  The sequel is just pitiful."

","The first Scary Movie was hilarious and I decided to wait and see the sequel on video because I heard it was bad. Good call. Although the first Scary Movie was disgusting and funny, Scary Movie 2 doesn't deliver as much big laughs as the first one. Another point, is that the sequel isn't as sick as the first and that's a nice quality. The spoof on old movies doesn't work all the time, but the Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission: Impossible II do. The returning cast is good (especially Cindy and Brenda), but not Ray (who's sexual identity is still questioned), and I wish a few other people would have returned. Some of the new cast isn't great, all the main adults aren't well done, but the new teens Theo, Alex and Buddy are great. Overall, there are A FEW funny moments and chuckles in this movie, but the original is better."
"fjhuerta-2","5","1","2","29 September 2001"," I laughed. I cried. And I agreed, the movie stinks!
","Let me first issue an apology:<br/><br/>It's impossible not to watch this film with a couple of simple minded friends, in a full theatre, and not choke on your popcorn with laughter. If you are, say, between 18 and 35, like stupid comedies, are in that special mood, and don't care much about your self image, boy, this is the film for you. <br/><br/>I was looking to laugh, and I got a movie in which I couldn't stop laughing. So that means the movie works, right?<br/><br/>Well. It's like a chiclet. At first it tastes great, but chew on it hard, and the taste is gone. First of all (the apology has ended, BTW), I am SURE I saw a censored version of the movie, since there was a huge gap between the professors' death and the kids trying to get out of the haunted house. Second (and I cannot stress it enough), how come the directors are so keen in showing us the drug addict as the cool guy? I mean, kids are going to watch this movie one way or the other (rental, anyone?) and I can only imagine what they'll think when they see that the dopey guy even gets the girl at the end. Do we really need a drug-glorifying culture nowadays? Sheesh... I have known friends who regularly use drugs, and they ended up isolated and alienated. Nothing at all what is shown on the films.<br/><br/>The story, as it is to be expected, stinks. No continuity, jumps from scene to scene, lots of jokes that simply don't work (the whole skeleton thing is stupid), and way too many counterculture references. Which will only help to date the thing. Which will make future viewing difficult or impossible. Which makes this movie appeal to future generation lessen a lot.<br/><br/>Which might not be a bad thing, after all."

","OK, unlike many others who have shamed the original Scary Movie like those would curse the plague, I enjoyed my one viewing of it.  It was a packed theater and everyone in it had a good time, though I don't feel the need to ever see it again.  However, this is horrible.  <br/><br/>	I don't ask much from spoofs.  I even liked Wrongfully Accused even though it was more than apparent no one was really putting their full effort into it.  However, when a spoof is not funny, it fails horribly.  What's to go back on?  Plot?  No.  Character development?  No.  Uh, acting?  Nope. <br/><br/>
	This movie is simply not funny.  Nothing in this movie is funny.  Chris Elliot's character is not funny, not one of the spoofs on any movie is funny, and added to that, I didn't even get that it was a spoof on M:I 2 until the scene was almost over!  The Wayans said they researched through tons of movies to make this one.  All it proves is that they've wasted their time watching movies rather than actually MAKING one!"

","Gross-out has died. After a minor regurgitation (pardon the pun) led by American Pie and Scary Movie, it's now gone out of fashion again. This sequel proves that. Most of the cast from the original return, but don't do much with their roles, and the same old gags are recycled. A retarded butler molests a roast turkey, Ray, a gay character, humps a clown under a bed and Anna Faris gets covered in jizzum again. Nice! The plot is poor, the performances annoying and the jokes only mildly funny at best. James Woods is great though. For his 10 minutes of the film. And when the opening skit is the highlight, you know something's wrong. I hope a third isn't released."
"baumer","2","1","2","7 July 2001"," The complete anti-thesis of what the first was all about
","Scary Movie was a brilliant, hilarious, and intelligent satire of scary movies.  It poked fun at Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Nightmare On Elm Street and so on, and it did it with compassion and care.  The writers really did their homework and thus we were presented with a film that not only was entertaining and funny, but it was smart and witty.  You could infinitely count the number of movie references in the film and and some of them were so subtle that it took you a moment or two to realize that they were making fun of whatever movie it was making fun of.  This cheap ersatz of a film, this charlatan, this sheep in wolves clothing is not only a terrible film, it does a terrible injustice to all that the first one stood for.  It angers me when films like this are made as irresponsibly as this one was because it suckered me into the theater based on memories of last year.  I actually put The Wayans and Kevin Williamson ( creator of the Scream franchise ) in the same category after Scary Movie.  Now, my perception of the Wayans is that they are all one hit wonders.<br/><br/>Scary Movie 2 has one big problem, and that is they decided to make fun of movies that weren't as iconoclastic as the ones they made fun of in the first one.  When you are satirizing films like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, you alienate perhaps your core audience that didn't really like those movies all that much in the first place.  There were some clever references to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist at the beginning and those were the best jabs in the whole film, but what about the rest of this debacle?  Why do I want to watch The Haunting and Hollow Man all over again when I didn't enjoy it in the first place?  There are many horror fans out there and this film is not commensurate with the abilities that the Wayans showed in the first one.  There are only so many times you can get by with fart, puke, pee, poo and sex jokes before you enervate your audience.  I was enervated after the first fifteen minutes.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  But it never did.  For every reference I could pick out and comprehend, there were long, painful stretches of film when I just didn't understand what they were trying to say or do.  What was the point of Chris Elliot's character?  Was he an amalgamation of every creepy character that has ever appeared in a haunted house film?  Was he a pastiche of butlers or chambermaids from haunted house Hammer films?  What was he?  I have seen a lot of horror films in my day but never have I been privy to a more repulsive and useless character than him.  He just wasn't needed, and if he was, then how about giving him more to go on than just a small and deformed appendage?  <br/><br/>To give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial. I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes.  But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere. There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger.  It is horribly done in here and there is no payoff.<br/><br/>Back in the 10th century, the charlatan and the mounteback, two unsavory types, used to sell bogus panaceas, cure-alls, at bargain prices.  They called this their ""nostrum"", meaning literally, ""our remedy.""  Well my nostrum for this foul-stenched excuse for a film is for the Wayans to put a little more effort into the writing and maybe cut down from seven writers to two.  This way ideas don't mesh and egos don't get bruised.  As it stands this is one of the worst films I have seen this year and seeing how good the first one was, they should be ashamed of this deplorable, egregious, vapid and totally unnecessary film that they have given to us.  And that is a shame.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 10- The 1.5 being for the clever beginning and the Nike/Changeling send off.  The rest of the movie receives a 0.  Instead of making fun of films that are here today and forgotten tomorrow, why not take on the greats like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Cujo, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  There is plenty of great material out there, so why go after films that people disliked?  It doesn't make much sense."

Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Buddy (Chris Masterson), Brenda (Regina Hall) & Shorty Meeks (co-writer Marlon Wayans), Ray Wilkins (co-writer Shawn Wayans), Theo (Kathleen Robertson) & Alex Monday (Tori Spelling) are all told by professor Oldman that they have been selected to stay at Hell House for a weekend to study various sleep disorders for a school project. Once there they discover the freakish servant Hanson (Chris Elliott) who quickly becomes the least of their worries are they encounter the evil ghost of the previous owner Hugh Kane (Richard Moll) & a whole host of other spooky goings on...<br/><br/>Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans Scary Movie 2 was the first sequel to the horror spoof Scary Movie (2000), the series is now up to Scary Movie 4 (2006), & I personally thought it was better than the original & quite simply I found it totally hilarious. The script by Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Alyson Fouse, Greg Grabianski, Dave Polsky, Michael Anthony Snowden & Craig Wayans spoofs just about every well known horror film there is from The Legend of Hell House (1973), The Exorcist (1973), Poltergeist (1982), The Shining (1980), Hollow Man (2000) to Hannibal (2001) & it spoofs all other sorts of film from various genres like Charlies Angels (2000), Harry Potter, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rocky (1976) & Dirty Harry (1971) to name but a few. I must admit I had a great time trying to spot them all & I'm sure any film buff would, although I doubt many film buffs would agree with the way Scary Movie 2 treats these classic films. There are also some swipes at a few topical issues that were prevalent back then like the Bill Clinton 'affair'. At only 85 odd minutes long Scary Movie 2 moves along like a rocket with a constant stream of bad taste & gross out gags that I just found really funny, I haven't laughed so much during a film for ages, I don't really know what that says about me & frankly I don't care either.<br/><br/>Director Wayans keeps the humour coming thick & fast, he seems to want cater for the lowest common denominator with a succession of gross bad taste gags from toilet humour, poo, fart, puke, spunk, sex, masturbation, drugs, paedophile priests, racism, sexism, gay jokes, a ghost helping himself to a blow-job in a pretty female students mouth, plenty of foul language including a funny Budgie & even the disabled aren't safe as Scary Movie 2 is one of the most politically incorrect films I've ever seen. There are plenty of jokes in Scary Movie 2 that I would imagine many would find offencive which is fine I suppose but I will openly say right now that I found the disabled jokes funny, the racist humour amusing & all the bad taste gags hilarious & frankly I have no problem saying that although I would imagine many would. It doesn't make me a racist or look down on those with disability, I think the whole world's gone political correctness mad anyway.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of $45,000,000 Scary Movie 2 very well made with great special effects & loving recreation of various classic scenes from films. The acting was good & everyone played their parts really well whether they were serious or campy & that Anna Faris is really rather hot.<br/><br/>I loved Scary Movie 2, I found it hilarious, it's as simple & straight forward as that. In a world that's gone mad with political correctness Scary Movie 2 isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything & seems to have no boundaries, I really can't remember laughing so much during a film, I really can't. If your prudish or easily offended then avoid Scary Movie 2 like the plague but if you like crude juvenile gross out humour then it's an absolute must see!"

","You know I said the original was the worst in the trilogy? Yeah...I take that back. I didn't remember this sequel being that terrible, but boy was I wrong. Whilst the first flick focused on parodying the slasher sub-genre, the second instalment targeted classic supernatural horror films. A group of college students must stay in a manor for an assignment, where a ghostly presence starts to haunt them. A mixture of 'Poltergeist', 'House on Haunted Hill' and 'The Haunting', yet somehow the plot seems less cohesive than its predecessor. Reminiscent of random sketches stitched together in an attempt to create a story. Starting with 'The Exorcist' which holds no importance whatsoever, and concluding with an action sequence from 'Charlie's Angels' (although actually my favourite scene). It makes no sense. Heck, I myself could invite some friends over and imitate some horror films for you and mash them together using Windows Movie Maker calling it a ""film"". The vulgarity is increased to maximum potential, including a myriad of fart, poo and vomit jokes. The dinner preparation scene highlights the sickening tone of this sequel, and unfortunately that type of humour has expired. It's not funny in the slightest, it gained no laughs from me. Regina Hall as Brenda is just euphoric. ""Cindy, it's a skeleton! It's just bones!"" to which she really is the only good aspect to this. Tim Curry is in this, no idea why. Although, I have calculated a formula to solve the ""Curry Conundrum"". 'Charlie's Angels' is parodied which features Curry in a towel who is in 'It' as a clown which is not spoofed in this, therefore mathematically proving that Curry was in it for the money. Yes! It makes perfect sense now. No other way to justify his involvement in this piece of rubbish that bathes in the runny poo that it adores using in the countless unfunny jokes presented to us. Fortunately, the next sequel is a big guilty pleasure for me..."

","Scary Movie 2 (2001): Dir: Keenan Ivory Wayans / Cast: Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Tim Curry, Regina Hall: After spoofing The Exorcist and The Amittyville Horror in the opening, this sequel then plummets in despair. This time it targets The Haunting and The House On Haunted Hill with Tim Curry summoning a group of students to Hell House. There is no story to be found as it gets lost in its own vile. Keenan Ivory Wayans achieved the satire delivery in the first film but he directs this sequel rather half-heartedly. Anna Faris returns as Cindy who gets into a boxing fight with a cat in a reference to Raging Bull. Marlon Wayans is wrapped and smoked by a marijuana plant. This may very well be the best visual joke in the film but it is carried on too long. Shawn Wayans surprises a clown demon under the bed in a reference to Poltergeist. Curry is wasted as a professor who serves no real purpose. Perhaps it is his appeal from The Rocky Horror Picture Show that aided in his casting but this film hardly allows him to catch lightning in a bottle. Regina Hall returns and dies again, which makes little sense but then again, why look for logic here. Scary Movie used vulgar humour but it worked because it exposes horror film clichés. This time Wayans is given a larger budget and creates a spectacle in shame that should be wrapped like a joint and lit on fire. Score: 1 / 10"

","There's a lengthy introductory skit -- as in ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" -- that's a rip off of ""The Exorcist."" It's pretty funny, with bit parts for James Woods and Veronica Cartwright. The priest is playing the piano at the party when ""Regan"" appears in the doorway, declaims ""You suck,"" and pees all over the floor. She pees and pees, while the guests look uncomfortable. Finally, Mom rushes to Regans side and explains, ""She's been sick."" Then she slams Regans face down into the puddle of urine and begins to beat the back of her head.<br/><br/>That was pretty funny because until that point you didn't know which direction the movie was headed in. But the introductory section ends in showers of vomit involving the two priests and Regan. Except for its residual shock value, it's about as funny as a pie fight.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie, after the credits, is mainly a take off of ""The Haunting,"" a fine film in its original form, directed by Robert Wise, and no more than a special effects extravaganza in the remake. Let's see. There is a lascivious poltergeist who is evidently a male and who chases a young girl across the ceiling after forcing her to have oral sex with an invisible penis. Which teen-age horror movie is that from? The ones with Freddy Kruger? I get them mixed up.<br/><br/>Some of the bits are more revolting than funny -- a butler with a hideously deformed hand who manages to stick the grotesque thing into every dish he serves at dinner. A scene with James Woods on the crapper.<br/><br/>Most of the gags are physical and except for the supposedly outrageous use of curses and swear words it might have been a silent movie. Not that it avoids ALL possible verbal wit. James Woods is the Max Von Sydow character from ""The Exorcist"" and when he first enters the house, he asks how Regan is. Veronica Cartwright, as the mother, breaks into sobs and says, ""Father -- she won't even let me touch her."" Woods nods knowingly and replies, ""Yes, sometimes you have to give them candy."" It's nothing you wouldn't hear on a late-night talk show, but a little more of that would have been nice.<br/><br/>I've concentrated on the first half hour or so because I didn't watch the entire film. The level of comedy or, more important, the KIND of jokes, became predictable and a little stale. Although you could never be sure. One scene is ripped off from ""Raging Bull."" I'm not sure the younger audience would get that one, but I'm even more certain that there were many allusions that I missed too.<br/><br/>It was outrageous, yes, and some of the jokes were better than others, but I had no trouble shutting it off. It's the kind of thing best left to the kids."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","1","3","16 July 2007"," Funny, But the Weakest in the Series
","While this movie was hysterically funny, the fact remains that it was the weakest in the entire series. Brenda has all of the best scenes, and some of Anna Farris's comedic genius shines through, but a series of unfunny sequences and several other bland moments make the movie seem rushed. It does have its moments though, and the deleted scenes and alternate endings are some of the best that the series has to offer. If only there was more to offer in terms of a really storyline, this would be much better. Still, it remains better than most parody films, many of which fall extremely flat. The original ending may be unsatisfying, and many of the characters are clichéd and open-ended. Nobody has a real personality, and it seems to be spoofing one movie after another. Which brings us to the only real major problem: there is too much going on. The movie gets consumed in all of the material it is trying to spoof, and becomes sucked up in the stupidity of it all. Still, the acting is superb and many scenes really shine through. The rare scenes that have actual character development are actually written quite well, and pretty much anything involving the 'handyman' was excellent. Tim Curry's presence was truly a gift. Overall, the movie is worth several watches and it is a very good spoof film, but it is not without its share of flaws."

Scary Movie 1 is greatly overshadowed by this wooly mammoth, and Scary Movie 3 is funny but much different and in no way really related. With extra room and creativeness, it's a worthy movie.

Many say it's the best of the three, but my favorite movie of all time is Scary Movie 3. Now, in a fine sequel, this is(as I stated in my one line summary) dumb but funny, crude but sytlish. Most of the jokes are at least worthy of a smile. It spoofs Exorcist and some other random movies at different parts.(The Charlies Angel's part is hilarious!) Nearly all of the jokes have some bit of crude dialect in it, but they nevertheless make you laugh. <br/><br/>R- strong crude/sexual humor, graphic language, drug content, and some comic violence."
"willywants","Null","1","3","28 February 2004"," Hysterical sequel. (spoilers)
","PLOT:Megan Voorhees (Natasha Lyonne), is possessed and two priests, Father McFeely (James Woods) and Father Harris (Andy Richter), must drive the demon out, but the exorcism doesn't go as planned. A year later, survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: 7/10- Director Keenen Ivory Wayans directs this film competently with lots of slow-motion shots and Matrix-like camera angles.<br/><br/>WRITING: 8/10- Call the jokes crude, but I loved them. No, ""Scary movie 2"" has no intelligent, thought-provoking or meaningful dialogue but I thought that it was funny, original (Love the Amityville joke) and witty. While the third may have been funnier, this is still great fun and the jokes improved greatly over the original.<br/><br/>ACTING: 9/10- All the characters are memorable and funny, and the actors fit their parts perfectly. Great cast, too.<br/><br/>GORE: 2/10- Mostly cartoon violence. A man gets his skull cut off, but his heads empty, a chalandeer falls on a girl, a man's hair catches on fire, people get punched and kicked, etc. Nothing graphic or frightening happens.<br/><br/>MONSTERS: WE get a few. A Possessed demon girl (Excorsist-derived), a killer plant monster, and there is also some semi-visible ghosts. We also get a skeleton creature. This is one of the fakest monsters I've ever seen, but it serves it's purpose by getting it's head put on it's pubic bone and it's limbs put in different sockets.<br/><br/>SPECIAL F/X: 3/10- The effects are intermitent in quality. The creature effects, especially the skeleton and the plant creature, were accomplished via cable puppets and it's obvious--the cables and puppeteers are visible in many shots. Some of the other effects, however, are pretty good, including computer generated ghosts and flying furniture.<br/><br/>SOUNDTRACK: 7/10- The film boasts a pretty good soundtrack. I dug the song during the end credits.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: ""Scary movie 2"" is a great sequel. It spoofs everything from the haunting to poltergiest and it's all great fun. My rating for ""Scary movie 2""--8/10."

The spoof of the Nike basketball commercial is a nice shot, while most of the other gags are for the trivia seeker, like myself, who watches a movie of this kind to see how they can parody a serious horror movie.

"Waltdog","10","1","3","7 July 2001"," Hilarious
","Scary Movie 2 is hilarious.  There's one thing that I can't seem to understand, if someone didn't like Scary Movie then why would they go see Scary Movie 2.  They couldn't have thought that Marlon and Shawn Wayans were going to change the writing style they used on a movie that grossed well over 200 million dollars.  Anyway, the movie was funny.  I must say that I did like the first better, but I still thought this one was hilarious. Marlon Wayans is my favorite actor and I am a huge fan of the entire Wayans family.  Although I don't believe that any type of comedy is better than another, if I were to follow these beliefs then I would have to conclude that Keenan, Marlon, and Shawn are just very versatile.  Keenan Ivory Wayans wrote and produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a spoof of blaxploitation films. This movie received rave reviews and didn't have ""toilet humor"" as many people like to call it.  Marlon and Shawn wrote and produced Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, which critically was not as successful as Keenan's spoof, but was a huge hit with fans and had very little ""toilet humor.""  Last summer the brothers Wayans wrote Scary Movie and mastered gross-out humor in the spoof.  They did it again this summer.  Perhaps many of the jokes in Scary Movie 2 are taken from scenes or even movies that many people might not remember, but the movie is still hilarious.  Straight up, if you didn't like the first one, don't go see the sequel expecting something totally different.  If you liked the first one and didn't enjoy the second, I supposed I can understand.  I give it a 10 because it did its job which was to make me laugh.  One final note, to anyone who says Marlon Wayans isn't talented, go out and rent Requiem for a Dream."
"Chris_Docker","4","1","3","26 September 2001"," Nice opening credits - shame about the rest

From there on we get a series of sketches based on various horror films, but none of them up to the same standard - in most cases much poorer in entertainment value than the original. The plot is so flimsy I had forgotten it by the time I left the cinema - sorry!"

"mattymatt4ever","7","1","3","13 July 2001"," Funny stuff, but PLEEEEASSSE get your minds out of the gutter!!!!
","I'm not going to totally badmouth ""Scary Movie 2,"" because I admittedly laughed a lot.  Of course, most of those laughs came in the first half.  I felt the second half was hit-or-miss.  My issue is ever since ""There's Something About Mary"" was released, we've been bombarded by these gross-out comedies!  Every time another comedy is released, it tries to outdo the previous one in grossness.  The writers and directors assume they're pioneers, because they just disgusted audiences to the fullest.  Well, what they don't realize is what made ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""American Pie"" work was their sense of wit and structure.  There was a certain sense of intelligence behind the grossness.  Now, filmmakers just assume you can have a young man shoot a wad of...manly juice...in a female's face and that's going to get a laugh.  That's mostly because these comedies appeal mainly to young people.  And young people, in general (not including me, of course), will laugh at ANYTHING scatological!  It's unfortunate, but true! I admit, I've enjoyed tasteless comedies like this, the first ""Scary Movie"" and ""Road Trip,"" but I've never seen a tasteless comedy that I can actually regard as great.  Some of my favorite comedies of all time are films by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks.  Those are comedy writers/directors who know how to get laughs without even uttering the word ""penis.""  Now, though I did enjoy the aforementioned comedies, there comes a point where enough is enough.  Sure, the young ones are eating this stuff up with a spoon and they'll probably tell ya ""Hey, get off our backs!  Go watch a historical documentary, if you can't handle it!""  Normally, I would say something identical to that, but there always comes a point where it's just too much. And ""Scary Movie 2"" displays every indication that we have.  At least, release some ADULT comedies.  In case the filmmakers forgot, there ARE IN FACT grown-ups/mature human beings who go to the movies.  But how often do we see adult comedies?  Almost never!  I guess they feel that's not where the profit is, so screw it!<br/><br/>On a positive note, I think there are a few sequences in this sequel that were very well done.  The James Woods/bowel movement scene is purely tasteless, but let's face it.  There's a certain thrill in watching a serious actor humiliate himself like that, so this is your only chance to encounter Jimmy Woods taking an on-screen dump.  I liked the parody of the Nike/b-ball commercial, in which everybody bounces the basketball to a certain rhythm.  In this case, even the guy in the wheelchair joins in. The Wayans were pretty sharp in writing the satirical moments.  Some other good ones are a ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" parody and one of ""Charlie's Angels."" Don't ya love it when they crack on movies that you absolutely loathe?  Another scene I have to note is the Wayans' take on ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in which Tori Spelling gives a b**w job to a ghost.  That's an example of humor (as I mentioned earlier) with a degree of wit and structure.  It's a very original idea (I can be wrong, email me if you can name another movie where a woman gives h**d to a ghost) and I felt it was used wisely.<br/><br/>
One actress they should've deleted from the cast all the way from the get-go is Anna Faris.  Though the film's comic timing, in general, is nothing priceless I felt she was totally off-key and her gags come off less as funny and more as...bad acting.  She's a beautiful actress, indeed, but looks ain't everything babe!  Chris Elliot is another one of those comedians who has good comic potential, but can come off as extremely obnoxious in a badly written role.  This is an example of the latter.  He plays an annoying butler with a deformed hand (was that supposed to be funny?).  He made me groan a lot (especially in the dinner sequence), but I got no laughs. Shawn and Marlon--what were you thinking???<br/><br/>The crude humor begins to fade out in the second half, to the point where you just say ""Enough already!""  There's hardly a single joke that doesn't wander into scatological territory.  We are also forced to sit through a recycled gag from the original, in a parody of ""Hollow Man.""  Though many in the audience laughed at the outcome of that scene, I saw it coming (no pun intended).  Most of the humor is pretty cheap, predictable and forced, so there are few gags that I can regard as priceless.  I still have to say, the funniest sequence is the opening in which we're treated to an interesting rendition of ""Shake That A**.""  The scene contains my main man Andy Richter (as you can probably tell, I was and still am a huge ""Conan O'Brien"" fan).<br/><br/>If you're seeking a bundle of dirty laughs, I can't object to purchasing a ticket for ""SM2.""  As I said, my main dispute is the lack of variety among comedies today.  I urge you comedy writers:  Get your mind OUT OF THE GUTTER!!!  JUST FOR ONE DAMN SECOND!!!  Try it, it works.  You can still be funny!<br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"

Like many parody films, this one assembles its inspiration from a wide range of films.  As I started watching it, I almost started to write down the films they were lifting scenes from.  Fortunately, I stopped myself and went back to laughing.  Still, it's interesting to watch scenes progress that switch from one flick to another.  For example, the ""trapped in the freezer"" scene from HOLLOW MAN switches to the ""do I drown or freeze to death"" scene from TITANIC.<br/><br/>Other flicks I caught references to--<br/><br/>THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE  (Richard Matheson's homage to THE HAUNTING)<br/><br/>THE EXORCIST  (most of the opening sequence)<br/><br/>THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (the flies in the bathroom)<br/><br/>Stephen King's IT  (the clown doll)<br/><br/>A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (the invisible seduction)<br/><br/>THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (the remake; the maze of basement corridors)<br/><br/>HANNIBAL  (the second dinner scene) <br/><br/>CHARLIES ANGELS<br/><br/>CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON<br/><br/>HOLLOW MAN (I think they LITERALLY swiped the infrared goggles from that flick)<br/><br/>SCREAM (talking to Dad on the phone at the end of the flick)"

""Scary movie 2"" however believes that in order to top it's predecessor, it's humor has to be even more obvious and even more disgusting while also satirizing as many movies as possible at the same time, resulting in a parody who's jokes range from amusing to painfully unfunny."

","This is not as fun or as good as the first film, but while it is a very uneven film I do not think it is the worst of the series. That's the fourth. The film's weakness are mostly to do with the story and the pace. The story is very weak and thin a vast majority of the time, and the film feels rushed sometimes. While most of the references/spoofs are fun, some don't work, especially the forced and messy Titanic one. And there is some uneven performances, Marlon Wayans, David Cross and especially Chris Elliot come off best, but Anna Faris while better than she was in the first overdoes it and while Tim Curry was a welcome presence he doesn't have anything worthwhile to work with. However, the film thankfully doesn't look sloppy or straight to video quality and the music was quite good as well. Of course the film is silly and mindless, but most of it is very funny, the dinner scene with the running joke about the hand, the talking parrot and the Charlie's Angels spoof work especially well, and a lot of the script if bizarre and silly is hilarious. The highlight though is the Excorcist-beginning, with a very amusing cameo from James Woods. That scene alone made me think it would be a good movie, but while the rest of the film wasn't quite as good, it is entertaining enough and not as bad as some say. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","This movie is a spoof of haunted house movies. I think it is the best in the series. But however, there are a lot of great deleted scenes which should be keptin the movie. Such as: ""Alex Breaks Up"" Cindy runs into alex, and she tells this hilarious story about her boyfriend. ""Kids in the hallway"" Cindy and Ray run into each other for the first time since Ray and Bobby had tried to kill her in Scary movie 1. ""The House comes alive"" Probably the funniest one, in which Brenda becomes ""posessed"" ""Stuck in the tub"" The ghost scares Cindy, and Dwight and buddy put her in the tub, and then runs the water, what she does to save herself is very funny. ""Do you remember that time?"" After the chandelier crushes Alex, Theo comes to help her, and Alex tells these stories of what they used to do and how they were really close friends, when they've only known each other since they came to Hell House. ""Saying Grace"" Alex decides to bless the food, and what she says is funny. I can see why this one was deleted though.

","I haven't seen 4 yet but this is the worst so far - still has some really funny moments, but the gags vary in quality, and a lot of the scenes don't seem to have had a lot of thought put into them. Anna Faris is outstanding - how can one person simultaneously look so gorgeous, and make me laugh so much?! Her mad cow impression is brilliantly, hysterically funny, and her pussy fight another highlight.<br/><br/>The scenes at the beginning are amongst the best, but unfortunately that quality isn't maintained throughout. Natasha Lyonne is a real talent and the film would've benefited from seeing a lot more of her. Chris Elliott is a capable actor but his performance here really didn't work for me. Regina Hall has done sterling work alongside Faris in all the Scaries.<br/><br/>A bit of a mixed bag. Crude, gross, poorly executed, or plain unfunny carry-on style gags, mixed with moments of sheer genius. This is one that surely wouldn't have worked without Anna, but with her it just about makes the grade."

Weird people - including a creepy owner and a sick chef - turn them off and they soon find themselves being pursued by evil.<br/><br/>If the plot sounds lame, that's because it is. The cast is at a loss for words; the Wayans Brothers recycle loads of gags from the first film and manage to make them worse.

","While ""Scary Movie"" was a parody on all those teenage slasher/horror movies that we got in the nineties, like for instance ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Scary Movie 2"" is a parody on famous horror movies like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"". Knowing this in advance, I certainly had a few expectations about this movie. Not that I thought this would be an intelligent movie, because when you are about to see a comedy with the Wayans brothers, you know what you can expect: a lot of vulgar and pre-teen humor. Still, that doesn't mean that they can't be good fun from time to time and seeing a parody on about every famous movie is a nice pass-time, like the first ""Scary Movie"" already proved a year earlier.<br/><br/>In ""Scary Movie 2"" four teens are tricked by their professor and his paralyzed assistant into visiting the haunted Hell House for a school project about sleep disorders. In this house a bad exorcism took place and the ghost still lives there. Chaos starts as soon as they arrive. They meet the creepy caretaker of the house, have to face the evil spirit and will have to solve some dark secrets, no matter how disgusting they are...<br/><br/>I admit that I liked ""Scary Movie"" and normally I'm also a fan of other spoof movies like for instance ""Hot Shots"" or ""The Naked Gun"", but this movie certainly didn't do it for me. This wasn't just vulgar, it just wasn't very good. The beginning with the exorcism was quite funny and the movie certainly had its better moments, but the overall quality of the story and the acting were so low that it really started to annoy me. Take for instance the fact that all the characters from the first movie are back, even when they died in that one. That can only mean that the story and the sense of reality (although that is perhaps not the exact word for this kind of movies, but you know what I mean), weren't of any importance. The only thing that mattered was the extra profit this movie would be worth. They didn't even have the time to come up with something new or original, making this movie feel like it was written in a couple of weeks time with a crate of whiskey and 10 joints per man...<br/><br/>The jokes and gags that the Wayans brothers and their enormous team of writers, producers,... came up with were clearly inspired on the first movie. Never change a winning team they say, but sometimes the audience wants to see an underdog win. They don't want to see the same thing over and over again, they want something new and that's where this movie failed completely. I give it a 6/10, because not everything was awful, but it could have been a lot better."

","If you loved 'Scary Movie' you will probably only like 'Scary Movie 2'. If you hated the first film, you will hate this one even more. One stupid sex related joke after another makes a film that is so much a matter of taste it is sort of impossible to review. The film spoofs films such as 'The Haunting', 'The Exorcist', 'Hollow Man', 'Hannibal', even 'Titanic' and a sports commercial (a pretty funny sequence). Some of them work, most of them don't, although I am ashamed to say that I was smiling pretty much.<br/><br/>So if you are normally able to enjoy films like 'Hot Shots!', 'The Naked Gun' and the original 'Scary Movie' you must be able to like this one. Prepare for a little more sex and language though."

","It's the classic early 2000s parody formula. All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy(which in this movie is amm), and everything else you would expect from a parody.<br/><br/>It's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days and remember ""handsome"" and all the other iconic situations and characters of the movie which aren't many.<br/><br/>The story is as cliché as you would expect from a parody movie.
Cliché story, music, effects, and the amazing 2000s vibe works kinda well.<br/><br/>Overall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and a portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like not the greatest parody at all and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 5 out of 10.

"Rickting","2","0","1","31 March 2016"," Scary in its awfulness
","The thing is, Scary Movie wasn't that bad. Seriously, it was actually a half-decent spoof. This? Not so much. A spoof of haunted house movies, this starts out well with a funny Exorcist parody before descending into juvenile spoof fare that actually defies belief. How did someone come up with all these terrible jokes and see them as funny? Still, to come up with so many awful gags and stuff them into an 80 minute film must take a lot of skill, so for that the many writers should be given some sort of credit I suppose. Otherwise, this film deserves no credit at all. Ironically, the parts where it works are during the more action-based set pieces which can be quite fun. It has a reasonable cast as well, with the returning leads (Even though their characters died in the first one) giving serviceable performances. Tim Curry and David Cross are both good as well. The reason why this spoof doesn't work is because the jokes are so lame, juvenile, over-the-top and coarse that you'll find yourself nostalgically thinking of many horror films this kind of spoof parodies, since most of them are funnier than this. The truth is, it'd be a good spoof for young children since they might find this kind of humour funny. Sadly, since it's also very adult and at times pretty offensive, which clashes jarringly with the juvenile nature of the movie, the people that will go to see this are mostly just going to be annoyed. Overall, this just isn't a good movie. At first, you can sort of enjoy it due to its silly, unrestrained atmosphere but eventually it just becomes highly annoying. There are decent jokes at times, but they pop up too rarely to salvage this train wreck of a comedy.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Possibly the best of the entire ""Scary Movie"" franchise, in my opinion of course. And the reason for this is that the laughs are more bountiful and sincere throughout the course of this movie, and the spoofs are more thoroughly executed.<br/><br/>But a big portion of the credit should also go to the fabulous cast, both returning cast members but also new ones on the cast list. Because people were really doing good jobs with their given roles and characters throughout the course of ""Scary Movie 2"".<br/><br/>True to the spirit of the first movie, and the rest of the movies essentially, this is a hilarious spoof movie which has no restraints and respects no boundaries. As such, then there are many really funny scenes throughout the movie, and if you enjoy a good spoof movie that pokes fun at a lot of other movies, then ""Scary Movie 2"" is definitely well worth watching.<br/><br/>Compared to the first ""Scary Movie"" installment, then this 2001 sequel offers more of a storyline, better spoofs, better effects and and all-round better cast. All in all, a more enjoyable movie experience. And I guess I enjoy this sequel more because the spoofs are based on some more impressive horror movies, compared to what was seen in the first ""Scary Movie"".<br/><br/>Even the introduction scene which spoofed ""The Exorcist"" is enough in itself to make it worthwhile to sit down and watch ""Scary Movie 2"". That really was a great way to start off the movie.<br/><br/>I am rating ""Scary Movie 2"" six out of ten stars. If you enjoy comedies, then ""Scary Movie 2"" is well-worth sitting down to watch."

","Scary Movie 2 is the follow up to the immensely funny 'Scary Movie' that released in the year 2000. This franchise reintroduced the spoof genre from where the 'Naked Gun' series left off. As a matter of fact it was this franchise that spawned many similar spoof films such as epic movie, disaster movie etc. The Wayans brothers return with more tongue in cheek humour. As a stand alone film it score full points. But one can't help but notice it falling short in comparison to the first film. It felt like a rushed venture. Despite it's short running time, the film didn't seem to have a plot unlike the first movie. Many loose ended comic situations arise revolving around each character. It was almost as if the writer had written the script as production proceeded from one stage to the next.<br/><br/>The whole premise revolves around a group of characters who are invited by Tim Curry to a haunted house to spend the night and conduct supernatural existence experiments. This intending to have connection to 'The Haunting' film. Afterwards strange occurrences begin to happen, which lead to hilarious situations. The film depicts haunting situations in a comic fashion. Apart from some of hysterical content, there were many moments that appeared pale. They were not so funny and the comedy seemed forced at times. For instance the 'basketball' scene. Many films were parodied from the outstanding 'Exorcist' sequence with James Woods, to the 'amityville horror' and 'poltergeist'. <br/><br/>The highlights of the film are without a doubt the scenes involving David Cross and Marlon Wayans. The actors are part of the best moments from the entire movie. Cross is rib achingly funny with his wheelchair antics and Wayans evokes much laughter with his unique acting. The joint and having sex with the ghost segment were the best. Anna Faris unfortunately disappoints as she is shadowed by supporting actors. There was n't much opportunity for her to perform. The 'charlie's angels' scene was bad. and the worst from the selection. Overall this is a good addition to the franchise, but it could have been better if perhaps David Zucker or Aaron Setzler had contributed."

","I cannot work out how on earth this had been rated so low but the only conclusion I can come to is a lot of people mustn't have a sense of humour. I cant tell you how many times I was in fits of laughter at this film, from the very first Exorcist scene right until the end. I will admit there is a few moments that are to stupid but that is no way enough to stop me from giving this a 9. I am just going to give you an idea of how many things I can think of off the top of my head that are hysterical. Firstly the Exorcist scene, the red dress scene, the wheel chair V hand scene, the I.T the clown scene, Sydney escaping form the panic room scene, the Hannibal scene and like I said that is off the top of my head. I think who ever watches this knows they aren't going to get a well written masterpiece but this is a simple story filled with so many good jokes that it is worthy of much higher than 4.9. I can honestly say I have watched this about 12 times and still laugh at all the best one's. Just give it a try, I think its the best out of the whole series. The 1st one is good, this 2nd one is brilliant, the 3rd one is good but the 4th one is a let down (apart from the Tom Crusie scene at the end, that is genius)."

","This film although being so idiot, had a successful release and provided what the audience truly wanted from it: laughs.<br/><br/>The conversations between the characters are so stupid that makes it funny. ""Scary Movie 2"" is basically a spoof of all the things in our society: horror movies, teenagers, selfishness, proud, drugs, women's seduction on men and the constant seek for sex. It's funny the way they approach the women's seduction on men, that thing that makes men say yes to all the girls ask. <br/><br/>Cindy Campbell should have won some Oscar for being the dumbest character ever!! Anna Faris really knows how to interpret this kind of persona!<br/><br/>And you see, this film is unbelievably 9 years old.. the jokes are still current and they'll probably make you laugh (if you've seen the movies spoofed), so give it a chance if you didn't see it yet.

","The first part of the series was very superficial, dumb and boring and only turned around movies such as ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer"". The second movie is easily an improvement as the number of referenced movies is much bigger and even some of the cinema's classics are ridiculously honoured in this follow up. You may really laugh about some scenes if you have seen movies such as ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The exorcism of Emily Rose"", ""Rose Red"" and so on. There are not only childish teen horror movies but some really solid flicks that inspired this movie. Even some movies that have nothing to do with the horror genre such as ""Charlie's Angels"" are referenced in here. One can say that this movie is more diversified and surprising than the first one.<br/><br/>The sexual jokes are still the majority of puns in this movie but they are not as present and childish as they were in the first one. Some of the highlights in here are for example the vomiting scenes during the exorcism, the insulting and weird parrot or the wheelchair rat race between a scientist and a ghost. The puns are still predictable and childish but more diversified and far more entertaining than the jokes of the first movie.<br/><br/>On the negative side, there is only the fact that some chase scenes in the haunted castle are way too long and get quite boring after a while as well as the bad ending that indicates a lack of ideas and seems somewhat suddenly.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie should not be criticized too hard as it is once again a good party movie with some absurd jokes that is mostly well entertaining if you have some good friends and some good beer around. Rent this one to have some fun but once you have seen and enjoyed it, there are no further reasons to purchase or watch it again very soon."

I do think that the jokes do hit their target and if you don't mind the fact, that you do not have a coherent plot/story, you will enjoy this movie very much.

","Normally comedy sequels aren't exactly the better movies but in this case I feel that this is a much better movie than its predecessor ""Scary Movie"" from 2000.<br/><br/>What makes this movie better is its comedy. ""Scary Movie"" was still in lots of parts a very lame movie. Of course ""Scary Movie 2"" also does has its lame moments in it but overall the humor seemed more structured and better written and executed this time. Not to call this movie very mature though.<br/><br/>Its story also progressed better. This time there actually was somewhat a main plot-line and the many movies that it spoofs in this one are better fitted in into the story. The first movie was simply being a spoof for the sake of being one. It makes this sequel a bit more pleasant to follow. Strangely enough this is a movie that got made under pressure from the big studios that wanted to cash in quickly one year already after the success of the first movie. It's strange because this movie its end result seems far better, as does its story.<br/><br/>The characters also work out better in this one. Most of the actors from the first movie reprise their roles in this one again, so the movie doesn't has to waste a lot of time of introducing them again to the viewers. This movie however also has some more big names in it this time, with some big actors appearing in some small roles, such as James Woods and Tim Curry, who both did a hilarious job.<br/><br/>Better humor, better story, better characters.

","If you thought ""Scary Movie"" scraped the bottom of the proverbial barrel for its bowel humor, ""Scary Movie 2"" plumbs even deeper depths of depravity with its politically daring social commentary and its scatological satire. Basically, audiences that roared at ""Scary Movie"" should relish this hilarious as hell sequel with its inventive ghostly special effects and audacious, envelop pushing ribald humor. The pea-green soup projectile vomiting parody of ""The Exorcist"" alone should prompt the Vatican to condemn the Wayans Brothers' latest installment as blasphemous while its ridiculing of Firestone Tires during a game of chicken in wheelchairs must have seemed too opportune to pass up. ""Scary Movie"" director Keenen Ivory Wayans, writers Shawn & Marlon Wayans, and a quintet of other scribes skewer the conventions and clichés of supernatural haunted house chillers instead of ""Scream"" slasher sagas. For the record, ""Scary Movie 2"" roasts ""Hollow Man,"" ""Titanic,"" ""What Lies Beneath,"" ""Hannibal,"" ""Cast Away,"" ""The Haunting,"" ""Charlie's Angels,"" and many other demonic possession epics.<br/><br/>""Scary Movie 2"" spoofs ""The Exorcist"" in a hysterical eight-minute prologue. Father McFeely (James Woods of ""Once Upon A Time in America"") shows up to exorcise the demons from Megan Voorhees (Latasha Lyonne of ""American Pie""), but finds himself caught in the middle of a three way barf-a-rama that leaves everybody drenched before they pull guns on Megan. Anyway, during the exorcism, Megan turns to McFeely's sidekick Father Harris (ex-Conan O'Brien host Andy Richter) and quizzes the young priest about the whereabouts of his momma. The infuriated cleric demands that his mom come out of the head whirling witch. No sooner has he uttered his ultimatum that dear old mom peels back the bed covers near Megan, gives her son a dirty look, snaps ""You're no fun,"" and exits the room.<br/><br/>Abruptly, the action shifts to Jefferson University. An inscription on a monument of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings surrounded by a brood of nappy haired children reads: ""Once you go black, you never go back!"" Cindy (Anna Faris of ""Scary Movie""), gay football champ Ray (Shawn Wayans), dope-smoking Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and Ray's loquacious girlfriend Brenda (Regina Hall of ""Enemy of the State"") are all attending college now a year after the first ""Scary Movie"" ended. Their sexually randy psychology professor, Dr. Oldman (Tim Curry of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""), and his defiant wheelchair bound graduate student Dwight (David Cross of ""Small Soldiers"") have arranged for them and some other volunteers to spend the weekend at a spooky mansion. They are participating in a sleep disorders study which really amounts to nothing more than an attempt to document paranormal activity.<br/><br/>Director Keenen Ivory Wayans pulls out all stops in this no-holds-barred, R-rated farce. Chris Elliot steals the show as a creepy caretaker with a deformed hand. Ultimately, ""Scary Movie 2"" surpasses ""Scary Movie"" with its ripe supply of shameless, slapstick shenanigans.

The opening spoof isn't actually that bad and i found it quite humorous, but after this, the actual funny jokes are few and made the film drag on. Fortuantly the sequel had an improvement over this.

The only really clever scene is the part about the Florida votes.<br/><br/>So, I would recommend watching numbers 1, 3 and 4 before you watch this one.

"the-jerk","7","0","2","18 August 2006"," Awesome opening, decent movie
","The second movie in the ""Scary Movie"" series is, in my opinion, the weakest overall. That doesn't mean that it isn't without its merits, but the whole thing seems kind of like it was slapped together over a weekend. Many of the jokes just don't work, but there are enough side-splittingly funny bits to make it all worthwhile.<br/><br/>This movie opens with an absolutely brilliant parody of ""The Exorcist"". It starts with the singalong scene with Andy Richter as Father Harris behind the piano. ""You guys know this one?"" he asks, and then proceeds to play the opening bars of -- get ready -- ""Shake Ya Ass"". Megan Voorhees (played by Natasha Lyonne) comes down the stairs and starts peeing on the floor, interrupting the singalong. Her mother treats her like a dog! This segues into the more obvious parody of the movie with Father McFeeley (James Woods) coming in to perform the exorcism with Father Harris (""F--- this!"" McFeeley says when he first encounters the possessed girl). It's classic.<br/><br/>Then the movie kind of dries up. The basic story is a parody of ""The Haunting"", a movie that was so bad that parody seems kind of unnecessary. It centers around a bunch of college kids going on an overnight trip to Hill House, ostensibly to study their sleep disorders but actually so the professor (Tim Curry) can summon the ghosts in the house. The only real connection with the first is found here, as some of the kids were picked because of their prior traumatic experiences (which they encountered in the first movie).<br/><br/>Honestly, I thought the whole thing kind of rambled when I first saw it, and there were some eye-rollingly dumb jokes. But there were also a lot of very funny jokes and the cast (including Anna Faris, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and the incredible Regina Hall from the original, mixed with vets Chris Elliot, David Cross, and Curry, Woods, and Richter) was very good; it was the writing that suffered more than anything. That, and the sloppy production values, but I guess that's nitpicking with a movie like this. Also, I didn't think the ending was very satisfying. Still, Brenda (Hall) and Cindy (Faris) messing with the ""scary"" skeleton that tries to terrorize them (""This is a skeleton -- this is bones! Would you run from Calista Flockhart?"" Brenda chides Cindy when they run into each other); Hanson (Elliot) and Dwight (Cross) arguing; and Cindy fighting a cat ""Raging Bull""-style were just some of the few very funny moments found in this movie.<br/><br/>This may not seem like a glowing review, but I actually did like this movie and recommend it if you're into the spoof genre. Just don't expect ""Airplane!"" or even the first ""Scary Movie"" when you see it. On the bright side, it ain't ""Spy Hard"" either."

","""Scary Movie"", was a somewhat breath of fresh air in the year 2000, with a concept in the tradition of ""Airplane!"". Making a movie that parodies every cliché of the late 90s teen horror genre like ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer"" seemed like good fun. The Wayans brothers hit the target with their particular brand of crude humor that was very attractive to the MTV generation of the end of the last century.<br/><br/>A year after, they broke their promise of no sequels with this movie focused on the big CGI horror movies like the remakes of ""The Haunting"" and ""Thirtheen Ghosts"" as well as other popular movies of the time, keeping the crude humor and the sex jokes in the same style as the original; the difference being that, as any sequel, there is the more of everything.<br/><br/>Actually those two aspects are the main problems in the film; first, the popular culture references are only funny if one is familiar with those, and also become dated quickly as the time goes on. The comedy aspect of the film, unlike the original movie, is very weak, with most gags being repetitive and masking the movie tiresome. Sure, the Wayans are a very creative team and still can make a laugh, but in this movie it feels as if they had written the script on a hurry and without caring too much on the result.<br/><br/>The acting is mediocre at best, with Anna Faris being again not only our lead character, but also the only one who knows how to give a good performance. Such a shame that her most famous role to date is as the lead star of this series of films, because she is a real talent on the rise. The rest of the cast is unconvincing and even the Wayans brothers seem bothered by their own script. The brilliant cameo by James Woods at the beginning of the film is among the few really enjoyable moments of the film.<br/><br/>The special effects are far better than in the first one; having a bigger budget helps and director Keenen Ivory Wayans makes good use of them. Unlike the horror movies it parodies, ""Scary Movie 2"" doesn't abuse of CGI and at times it keeps the indie-look of the first one.<br/><br/>The first ""Scary movie"" promised no sequels. If they had stayed true to their promise, maybe ""Scary Movie"" had been remembered as a jewel product of its time and not as the multi-sequel bore that is right now. 4/10"

Because of this, the dialogue is sub-par with the jokes either a rehash of the original, overly raunchy as to be very unfunny, or just plain dumb. The only real highlights are Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks (they are the highlights of all 3 Scary Movie films so far).

It was like watching the murdered brother of American Pie! Give us a break people. Maybe it's good for 13 year-old American boys who wanna play tough guys. No thanks."

","Well, after 'Scary Movie' made so much money, it was inevitable that there would be a sequel. And it was inevitable that it wouldn't be as good.<br/><br/>There were several problems with this movie, the largest of which is its lack of material. 'SM1' had five recent horror flicks (the three 'Scream' and the two 'I Know What...' films), the 'Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', and I don't even know what else to draw on in its sharp, sly parody. Having used that for the first movie, the sequel is left with having to use things like 'The Exorcist' (can you say overdone?) and gross-out humour to make us ""laugh."" They even use their own gags (from 'SM1') but not as well.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie isn't terrible. It just shows why Hollywood can, for lack of a better word, suck: rather than waiting a few years to make a sequel that could have been as good as the original, they rushed this one out to capitalise on the success of the first movie. In its own right, the movie would be O.K. As 'Scary Movie 2', the follow-up to one of the most hilarious and on-target parodies of all time, it sucks."

","Starring: Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Masterson, Tori Spelling, David Cross and James DeBello<br/><br/>Rated R for Strong Sexual and Gross Humor, Graphic Language and Some Drug Content<br/><br/>Genre: Horror/Comedy/Mystery<br/><br/>Star Rating: **** out of 5<br/><br/>This is the second installment of the Scary Movie series with more spoofs and crazy stuff! As we left off from the first Scary Movie the survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting. So this movie spoofs ""Charlie's Angels"", ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""13 Ghosts"", ""Paulie"", ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""The Poltergeist"". One of my favorite parts in the movie is where Cindy is driving in her car and listening to Vitamin C's song ""Graduation"" and Cindy is singing along to the song very badly so Vitamin C on the radio tells her to shut up and let her sing! Another funny part I liked was when Anna, Theo and Brenda were going to fight Hanson the guy with the funny looking hand, the three girls where running down the stairs while changing into their Charlie's Angels costumes and then when they come down you at first see them with their underwear and then they run back to change into their costumes. Another part I liked was the part where the group was with Dwight and he was handing out their items to defeat the ghosts and Brenda asks if there where any communication systems like walkie-talkies but instead all he had was just a line of string with two dixie cups on both sides! Another funny part was Shorty was teaching Cindy how to be all ghetto. I like this as well as the first one! Another thing I liked about this movie is that Tim Curry is in this movie and I think Tim Curry is hilarious and a good actor.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: FUNNY AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND I'M STILL LAUGHING!"

","I'd be interested to know when this was shown in theaters if staff clearing up after showings found a lot of unconsumed hotdogs and popcorn buckets under seats. The humour is for the most part of the kind that puts you off your food. It's crude and it doesn't always come off. There's crudity in Austin Powers but it's manipulated so skillfully that it's hilariously funny. There are other non-crude jokes which are funny. The scene where the marijuana plant grows to giant size and tries to smoke one of the Wayans brothers is brilliant. A scene early on in the film where the girl is driving in her car and singing along to the car stereo and the singer says tells her to shut up and let her sing is funny although spoiled a bit by an unnecessary swear word. But a lot of the jokes just fall flat unless you've seen the films that are being parodied. In Airplane you could still have a laugh at the scene where Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are rolling in the surf and get covered in seaweed and pollution even if you hadn't seen From Here To Eternity. Not so here. I see that Scary Movie 3 is to be directed by David Zucker so it might be worth watching. He might bring his touch that made Airplane so hilarious to the series. You don't usually see such pretty girls in comedies like this. Kathleen Robertson is gorgeous and so is Andrea Corr lookalike Anna Faris. On the subject of lookalikes, did it occur to anyone else when watching this film that if you took a picture of Joan Crawford and mischievously pencilled a beard on it you'd get Tim Curry? If there was an actor who looked like Bette Davis with a beard a good vehicle for him and Tim Curry would be a film called ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jim""!"

I still hadn't seen it, until just today (26 September 2002), I had hired out 'Scary Movie 2' (plus the 1990 thriller, 'Misery'). I sat down and started the movie. I had wasted around 82 minutes of watching a film that was just full of sex and inappropriate swearing. The best bit that I really enjoyed was the spoof of 'The Exorcist'. That was very clever! I loved that spoof plus the 'Charlie's Angels' spoof was alright too. But the rest was AWFUL!!!

My advice to all of you: don't tarnish your memories of the first with this abysmal sequel.<br/><br/>One accepts that by the very nature of the series as a parody the story will be stupid, the acting deliberately bad and the humour silly. That was the case with the first movie, but in the first movie it was funny; it worked. Here, it's lost its edge. That's the problem with parodies. It's hard to do them more than once and keep them funny. This reminds me a bit of the ""Airplane"" movies spoofing airline disasters. The first one was great, after that - why bother? Now, sometimes the parody format can work in a sequel. I'm thinking of the ""Naked Gun"" movies or ""Austin Powers."" But ""Scary Movie 2"" doesn't cut it as a worthy sequel. I'm not sure that I even broke a smile the entire way through. <br/><br/>While most of the cast is back (including Anna Faris as Cindy, around whom the sequel also focuses), I have to say that I really missed the character of ""Doofy"" from the original, and there was no one in this cast to really fill the hole that was left.

It definitely kept me laughing. This film not only poked fun at horror flicks (new and old) but also other comedy and action flicks from the recent years-much like the first did. The kids this time (minus Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro, and Jon Abrahams characters) gather with some new friends and are tricked by their professor into spending the night in a haunted house (sounds like The Haunting, right?). This scenario in itself is destined to be humorous. Don't try to look for meaning in the opening Exorcist parody scene. There isn't any. It's just there mainly there for added comedy.

","There's no denying that Scary Movie 2 is a bit of a mess. The film, put together in less than year to make its targeted release date, is full of bad and mildly confusing editing, uneven performances, careless writing, and lazy repeat gags from the first movie. At the same time, I can't sit here and that the movie isn't hilarious at times. Just as with the first Scary Movie, the film is absolutely stuffed with non-stop jokes. There isn't twenty seconds in between where one joke ends and another begins. It's hard not to admire the commitment in that sort of comedy. Despite the fact that there are a few scenes that are painfully unfunny and forced, the number of solid, hilariously funny scenes far outweigh the terrible, laughless ones. Scary Movie 2 is about as lowbrow as one can get, but it also has the good sense to mostly spoof bad horror movies that deserve to be mocked. Even the scenes that spoof masterpieces like The Exorcist work better than they probably should. I won't defend Scary Movie 2 as a well made comedy since its rushed production schedule is obvious at every turn, though Scary Movie 2 is well worth watching for fans of the first installment. 7/10"

","Scary Movie 2 basically takes the formula that worked for Scary Movie and exploits the hell out of it. The dialogue and story, although funny at times, does nothing except try to recreate the original. This movie is more of a raunchfest than a spoof. All the situations that made the first movie click with audiences (i.e. sex, drug use, handicapped people, racial issues) are reproduced here, but just not nearly as funny. Anna Faris plays well in this movie, but it would be nice to see her branch out into a project that doesn't involve the Wayans', and give her a chance to showcase her talent away from the genre of gross-out comedy. I give the Wayans' credit for making the attempt, but I can't help but feel that this movie was rushed in production to ride the coattails of the original film's success. Unfortunately, that production rush left little place for funny jokes and laughable situations, and only made room for mediocre screenwriting that was pounded out without thinking about whether it would be funny or not. A big fan of the first movie will somewhat enjoy themselves here, while a mild movie-goer will probably wonder what happened to their 8 bucks."

","Usually when greeted with a sequel to a movie that was great, I cringe. This was the case with Scary Movie 2.  From what I saw of the previews I figured that it would be a ton of vulgar jokes aimed at spoofing more movies.  I was pleasantly suprised.  The jokes were great, although I was right about the vulgarity.  The movie was short, but it was one great moment after another.  I won't go into detail about the plot summary, because then anyone reading this would go into the movie and would not get the same effect as me.

So with the first film in mind I went in with very low expectations for ""Scary Movie 2"" and well, let's just say they weren't met.<br/><br/> For reasons never explained, (probably because that meant the Wayans brother might have to come up with an actual story) some of the cast members are back in the sequel, whether they died or not is obviously not a problem. Instead of spoofing horror movies, like in the first one, the sequel spoofs many horror flicks, among them are ""Hollow Man"" and ""The Haunting,"" but for what seems to be no reason, the Nike commercials, ""Save The Last Dance"" and ""Charlie's Angels.""  But unlike the first film, in which the scenes at least seemed to go together, many scenes seem to be just poorly shot and put together in a sloppy package that was quickly rushed to theaters so it could make a lot of money like the first one did.

Complete it by tying everything together with the Wayans Brand toilet humor (some of it recycled from ""Scary Movie"" and even ""Don't be a Menace in South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,"" some of it new), and you have Scary Movie 2.<br/><br/>After the initial sequence, with James Woods and Andy Richter as the Priest and his Assistant, trying to exorcise Natasha Lyonne's character (the possessed Jasonia Voorhees), the movie seems to get lost for about a half hour.

"mattymatt4ever","7","0","1","4 July 2001"," Lots of laughs, but pleeeeeease get your minds out of the gutter!!!
","After watching ""Scary Movie"" I never thought there would be a filthier R-rated movie ever!!  But then the sequel came along and...for all those parents who covered their kids eyes during the original, make sure you keep a thick blindfold in handy if you're planning to take the young ones to this filth-fest!<br/><br/>I'm gonna give this movie a mild recommendation, because I did laugh a lot. The first half is hilarious!  The opening, I think, is the funniest moment. I don't want to give it away, so I'll just say it's an interesting rendition of the song ""Shake That A**.""  Of course, this is your only chance to see veteran actor James Woods taking an on-screen dump.  Who can resist that? Can you believe Marlon Brando actually considered that role initially? It's just refreshing to see a big-time, serious actor humiliate himself like that!  So for that:  Thank you Keenan, Shawn and Marlon.  The film's second half is not as successful, and pretty much sinks to a hit-or-miss level. As I said, Shawn and Marlon (and the many co-writers of the script) didn't once get their minds out of the gutter.  So the dirty jokes do get tiresome after a while.  Chris Elliot has an obnoxious role as a creepy butler with an underdeveloped hand.  He has a few disgusting (not funny) scenes, especially one at the dinner table, that simply made me groan.  I don't know what the hell the Wayans found funny about the character when thinking him up. There are some sharp, smartly written scenes that spoof pop culture, just like the original's attempt at spoofing the ""Whazzzzuppp!"" guys.  There's an interesting and wildly funny scene where they spoof a sneaker commercial (I think that's what it is, I can't remember exactly what the commercial was for) where the characters bounce a basketball to a certain rythm, including the guy in the wheelchair.  There's also a fine tribute to ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and another one to ""Charlie's Angels"" (Don't you love it when they spoof movies you totally hate?).<br/><br/>I think the main actress (Anna Faris), who was also in the original, has totally awful timing and most of her comedic scenes just come off as bad acting.  Then again, the timing in this movie isn't exactly priceless.  You can usually tell when the next punchline is coming.  You don't always know exactly what the joke is, but you sometimes have a good idea (any opportunity to journey into the scatological).<br/><br/>My beef with this movie is pretty much the beef I have with a lot of the recent comedies.  First of all, most of our recent comedies are aimed towards young people.  And comedy writers assume young people will laugh at ANYTHING that deals with sex or bodily functions.  The problem is:  they're usually right!  There are many young audiences (with the exception of me) who crave anything tasteless and crude, no matter how cheap and mindless the joke happens to be.  Even dirty jokes should require a certain degree of intelligence.  One good example is the Tori Spelling ghost/b**w-job scene. I can't go into detail about the gag without the IMDB staff kicking me out, but the joke was hilarious and original.  There was a certain amount of brains behind the comedy, in that instance.  ""American Pie"" is another good example.  There are some great, though crude and scatological, gags in that movie.  The reason why they worked was because there was intelligence behind the comedy.  Let's not forget, even comedy is an art.  With ""Scary Movie 2"" and other past movies like ""The Animal"" and ""The Ladies Man"" the writers tend to write things that are dirty, just because they're...dirty.  I know there are tons of young people without a brain, who can't handle humor that doesn't journey into that territory, but does that mean you should cater to them and lower all comic standards?  You'd think in 2001 writers and directors would've advanced, and learned to write things that are MORE effective comically, rather than slack off and write a comedy/softcore porno flick.  But it's the exact opposite.  And some of the best comics are still people like Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy. They're timeless classics.  No matter what age you are, you can crack up watching those old-time comics.  There are some great contemporary greats at comedy, but as a general comedians and comedy writers are becoming more and more lazy by the minute.<br/><br/>Sorry to be preachy, but it's true.  I'm not totally badmouthing ""Scary Movie 2"" and still feel it's a very funny comedy.  I just wish there was more variety in the movie biz.  Give us more adult comedies!  And if you can't do that, write a teen comedy with SOME sense of maturity and intelligence!  If the teens boo and complain you're not giving them what they want--screw them!  It IS possible to be funny without being disgusting. I can just hear the comedy writers going, ""Really?""  Yes, it's true.  Get to work!<br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10), but for the Wayans--try to be a bit more tasteful next time."

That in itself is original these days.<br/><br/>This film is the best of its kind since the original scary movie which in turn was the best of it's kind since Spaceballs.  Just watch it and let yourself laugh at the jokes, at the plot, at the acting and at how something with so many bad parts can actually put a smile on someones face, after all isnt that the most important thing ?"

","This movie is in the same boat with Scary Movie 1. It has the bad jokes out-numbering the good ones, some missing jokes they could have done but didn't and some jokes that lasted too long (the scene with the basketball). The sex jokes are seemingly toned down as are the body fluid jokes, but then they must have used up most of them in the first movie. The Excorcist/Amityville Horror spoof at the top of the movie was funny, almost a rip-off from Repossessed with Linda Blair, but it may have done a lot more damage to the Catholic church than the series Dave Allen at Large. Anna Faris is as cute as always, but she is embarrassing herself in some of the scenes. Calling her animal fighting moves for one and in her spoof of the cat fight scene from the Legend of Hell House are two examples. Kathleen Robertson is an obvious sexpot, but Tori Spelling ruins every scene she is in. Annoyingly grating as a middle-aged college student, she just doesn't belong in this movie. Regina Hall, Shawn and Marlon Wayans steal every scene they are in, and Chris Elliott and Tim Curry show the more tolerable range of their talents. The disability jokes between Elliott and David Cross are a bit tactless and tasteless and Chris Masterson is funny to watch in this full feature away from his role as a Malcom in the Middle second stringer. For me, the ghost effects are superb even if some of the simulated phenomenon was too over the top. I am definitely waiting for a Scary Movie 3; I only wish I could star in it too !"

Other performances are second rate, but that doesn't matter as the movie takes you on a rollercoaster ride of laughs. The down side to the movie is that it can't make up its mind if it wants to be a spoof (of the Excorcist movie) or a collection of comic skits.

It is amazing how horrible a comedy can be, and I think this one might just take the award for the worst ever.  Unlike part 1, there was no coherent story.  Granted, the plot in part one wasn't totally solid, but in part 2- it wasn't there at all.  It seemed more like a series of skits that made no sense together, and none of them were funny at that.  The same old jokes used in the same exact way. Some of the jokes in this movie were IDENTICAL to the jokes in part one...the ""sex"" scene being one of those.  Same fire hose like spray of liquid knocking the very annoying Faris down.  That's another thing...if that girl wasn't annoying in the first, in this one- she is so annoying you just want someone to strangle her  to get her out of the movie.  I am very disappointed in the writers and everyone involved in making the film, because it seems like they thought they had to automatically make a part 2 to make some more cash, and they clearly thought it had to be made, edited, and released within a few days...that's what it looks like.

","This movie is ignorant, insulting and crude. There is not a single section of society or repressed minority who should not be deeply shocked by this sick sick film. I laughed my back off all the way through.<br/><br/>The laughs start form the very beginning and go through to the very end. spotting the references isn't difficult, in fact having only seen the trailers for at least two of the films mocked proved background knowledge enough. There is nothing intellectual or taxing about this film. It simply mocks everything in it's path including itself from beginning to end.

","I saw the first Scary Movie on video at the beginning of this year, and I couldn't stop laughing. So naturally, when Scary Movie 2 finally came to New Zealand, I was practically lining up for it.<br/><br/>I went on the night after it came out, and despite being only 14, I managed to get me and 2 of my friends into the R16 film - it took a while, but damn it was worth it!<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the first scene of the movie, a take off from the 1973 hit The Exorcist, is the funniest scene in the whole film, but I won't give too much away, and I don't think I could describe it to be as funny as it is.<br/><br/>But anyway, the sequel reunites half of the cast from the original even though they were all killed! Anna Faris (Cindy), Shorty (Marlon Wayons), Ray (Shawn Wayons) and Brenda (Regina King) all came back to do the follow up.<br/><br/>This time, the gang are asked to spend a weekend in a haunted house. The house is complete with ghosts, housekeepers named Hanson that have screwed up hands and pervy college professors.<br/><br/>A Scary Movie 2 review couldn't go without mention of the Beverly Hills 90210 element. Bev Hills starlet Tori Spelling is cast as one of the gang who goes to the house and gets down and dirty with a ghost, meanwhile her 90210 co-star, Kathleen Robertson plays the g-string clad seductress of the gang, plus Christopher Kennedy Masterton (Malcolm In The Middle) plays Cindy's sort-of love interest.<br/><br/>Still as funny, still as sick, but maybe not quite as good as the original, Scary Movie 2 rocks!"

","Scary Movie 2....Boy wasn't this film made in a hurry? Its pretty obvious, just watch the movie, and you will think they did the whole film in one take. The film is VERY short....Thats what makes it feel very cheap, you would expect alot more, the original was GREAT this sequel had potential but it was far from great.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with an Exorcist spoof...Wow.! Well done, that was a good job and left me laughing alot...After that though, many of the jokes just aren't funny or are simply irellevant. Many of the jokes fall flat some examples would be (The clown scene,Nike Ad, Weakest Link,Hannibal,The Haunting) they obviously weren't thinking, after seeing these scenes you would think to yourself ""How long did this really take to make""?. The acting was mediocore, the film barely had any dialogue, and it doesent have that precious relationship from the original.....Cindy is with Buddy, thy barely communicate and they're not funny together. Tori Spelling is there for nothing..I mean who is she? And the ""I LOVE DEAD PEOPLE"" chick...Who is she? Sure the whole movie is a spoof, but there must be SOMTHING, the movie had no plot and it lacked in structure, it was all messed up.<br/><br/>On the other hand there are a few jokes that were great to watch (Charlies angels,Exorcist,VITAMIN C,Guy with weird hand) they were good...Yet they dont save the film from its many downfalls. Scary Movie 2 was very sexually crude, i dont reccomend this to anyone under 15 at all....Gross Humor is good in American Pie...Gross Humor in Scary Movie 2...Well..It doesnt quite work.<br/><br/>ACTING: The acting wasn't good at all...Acting was barely required in the whole film, it is SO short and there is barely any dialogue, and this is what furthers the gap between this and its worthy original.<br/><br/>ACTORS: Most of the original cast is back (Even though half of them died) a few good names...Excluding Tori Spelling, i guess the casting was ok..I wasnt expecting any better.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Very poor, this is what made the film sink....If they spent abit more time on the script, closing pot-holes, making the movie make sense etc. etc. Infact if they re-wrote the whole thing it would have been better...Seriously, they must have written this with their eyes closed.<br/><br/>CINEMA: Very poor, lack of locations, its like the movie was made in a few days, i wouldnt be suprised if it wasnt.The lighting was good for the Exorcist but other than that, poor Cinematography.<br/><br/>COMEDY: Had alot of potential, didnt really reach its goal. I did expect better, sure you will laugh in the movie, but dont expect many laughs...Just a few official laughs...Not artificial laughs where you are just laughing WITH the audience even though it aint funny to you.<br/><br/>MUSIC: Hmmm music? all i really remember is GRADUATION DAY by VITAMIN C...Oh there was ""LET ME BLOW YA MIND"" by EVE and Gwen Stefani, also the music during Charlies angels was ok..Not bad!<br/><br/>OVERALL: Scary movie 2 i recommend you watch ONLY if you liked part one, and i am not promising that you will love this film, you might end up hating it.... Yet i personally think the film had lots of potential, it tried...But not hard enough.<br/><br/>** (2 stars)"

","Despite finding the original Scary Movie an incredible disappointment I was dragged to see this much-of-the-same sequel.<br/><br/>The opening 10-20 minutes are actually quite funny; there are hit-and-miss moments but generally the jokes hit the spot.  I found myself laughing at both the Exorcist parodies and the cringingly disgusting ""Caretaker"", and was preparing myself to be pleasantly surprised.  However I should have known better and the film quickly descended into the same boring junk as the original.<br/><br/>What is so infuriating about sitting and watching a film like this is how you can watch it and KNOW in yourself: ""I could write something funnier than this"".  'Spoofing' is one of the easiest forms of humour yet the writers of these Scary Movie films still seem to be able to miss the spot on so many occasions.  The majority of the jokes are lame and predictable and I felt embarassed being amongst fellow adults who were laughing hysterically at the most pathetic scenes.  The makers have also managed to miss many obvious comedy moments which - while being predictable - would have at least added some generally amusing moments to this weak attempt at a spoof.<br/><br/>I was also ashamed to see the amount of scenes that had been stolen from other films.  I am not talking about the parts that had been spoofed but rather the bits that had been taken straight from other COMEDY movies, such as the cat attacking Cindy (remember There's Something About Mary, anybody?).  And why was this film given an 18 certificate when it was clearly designed to be enjoyed by viewers in the lower-age teen bracket?<br/><br/>I am a young adult who enjoys 'toilet-humour' comedy films, but I did not enjoy this.

","Hi, I'm viewer Marchy, you may remember me from such movie reviews as...'Scary Movie.' And, once again, I find myself questioning what it is people expect a film such as this to do for them. If they're expecting chilling horror, they won't get it. If they're expecting a 'Memento'-style plot that twists like Chubby Checker, they'll be disappointed. However, what they will get is a SPOOF. A SPOOF. A MICKEY-TAKE. Yes, the plot is basic, if existent. It's part of the parody. Yes, the characters are one-dimensional and do stupid things. It's part of the parody. Yes, there's some pretty gross bits (well, actually, just one bit springs to mind, why the uproar?) but here's the tricky bit - these bits are for the benefit of people who actually find slapstick things funny, not only ironic or black humour. You saw the trailer, you saw the opening scene, if you didn't like the sight of a bodily-fluid-heavy Exorcist spoof which is the film's opening and main selling point, why persevere? I choose to see this as a film fan's film. Having seen all the lampooned flicks I found it fun to spot the references, some of which were pretty subtle - it added a whole new level to the humour; the play on the climactic scene from 'Hannibal' isn't going to mean much to those who haven't seen it, but it's still funny. And to those who have blasted the references to the wheelchair-bound and so on - lighten up and stop looking for reasons to dislike the film just because you're so much more mature than the rest of us. They did it in X-Men, Naked Gun and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where were you then?<br/><br/>Worse than 'Scary Movie' - slightly less clear references Better than 'Scary Movie' - KATHLEEN ROBERTSON<br/><br/>8/10"

For example, The Exorcist scene with the brilliant Natasha Lyonne and James Wood was quite funny and the cast in the film, including: Tori Spelling, (Who was great here and who fell in love with a ghost.) Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, James DeBello and Chris Elliott (Let's just say his hand....) did a good job here, of spoofing the movies, such as, Hannibal, House on the haunted hill, The Haunting, What Lies Beneath, Charlie's Angels and even Dude, where's my car. The scene where Cindy (Anna Faris.) is singing to the Graduation Song (Friends Forever.) by Vitamin C (Colleen Fitzpatrick.) and then Vitamin C interrupts Cindy by telling her to shut up and let her sing, was funny too.

","Memo to the Wayans Brothers: That scraping sound you're hearing? It's the bottom of the barrel. Actually, I'm sure you've been hearing that sound for a year now, so it's time to give it up.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced that the Wayans Brothers have truly understood parody since the fleetingly amusing ""Don't Be a Menace..."" A good first rule of parody, you see, is that you shouldn't parody something that was already a parody to begin with. The original Scary Movie broke that rule, mocking the already self-referential Scream movies. And the people loved Scary Movie and for despite being as memorable as glass of water, it still had its moments. A good second rule for parody is not to mock things that were already horrible, trashy bombs to begin with. Well, Scary Movie 2 is a mock-up of the ""recent"" slate of ""haunted house"" movies. But nobody liked House of Haunted Hill or The Haunting. They were just bad movies. But in this distinctly sorry sequel, the Wayans Brothers manage to make the awful even worse. There aren't more than half a dozen chuckles in the movie and with the failed jokes coming pell-mell, this movie becomes painful to sit through.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a brief play on The Exorcist with James Woods in the Max von Sydow role. Marlon Brando was originally going to play the part. But Woods is fine. Certainly better than anything else in the movie. But that scene is over quickly. It's a year after the first Scary Movie and Shorty (Marlon Wayans), Ray (Shawn Wayans), and Cindy (Anna Faris) are in college. There's a joke at the expense of Save the Last Dance that isn't so bad. But then the movie quickly goes into its ""plot."" A psychology professor (Tim Curry) has assembled a group of students to go to a haunted house for some kind of study. The house has a knocker shaped like huge testicles. It isn't funny. And neither is anything inside the house.<br/><br/>Once everybody is assembled we meet the two disabled characters that the movie will laugh at for the next hour. Chris Elliot plays Hanson, a caretaker with a stupid accent and one baby hand. And David Cross (of Mr. Show) plays Curry's double jointed assistant. Neither character is funny, but they're both plenty annoying. Rounding out the cast we have 90210 alums Tori Spelling and Kathleen Robertson. Neither has any background and their links to the main plot and the characters from the first movie are tenuous. They're just there. As is Christopher Masterson, always reliable on Malcolm in the Middle, totally stranded by awful writing here. Night Court's Richard Moll appears briefly as the least scary, least funny, least interesting villain in the history of cinema (why'd they even bother?).<br/><br/>The characters run around in circles and they make jokes that aren't funny to begin with and get even worse with repetition. A pea soup barfing contest in The Exorcist scene is only worth a chuckle at first and then after it's gone on for a minute it's just mind-boggling. Or a trash-talking parrot. I guess it's funny the first couple times, but by the time it does a ""Weakest Link"" joke, you realize that it's just past its expiration date. There's an amusing take on Hannibal. The Charlie's Angels joke is good for another chuckle. And... I'm trying to think of other positive moments. But it's just too tough.<br/><br/>The film is badly directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, but the editing might be its most embarrassing technical feature. What can you say about a movie that runs 82 minutes and still feels like it's laden with too many pregnant pauses. The movie could have been much tighter. That wouldn't have made any of the jokes funnier, but it would have cut ten minutes off the mess.<br/><br/>The other alternative is that the three editors were just working with what the actors gave them and they couldn't find any takes that were better. Every performance is awkward and the movie feels badly improvised. You watch the actors and you can see them waiting for their next lines of dialogue or for the next not-amusing prop to come into play. The best of the acting is grating (Elliot and Cross), but Masterson, Spelling, both Wayans Brothers, Faris, and Regina Hall are frequently shockingly bad. I let Curry and Robertson off the hook because he is totally wasted, while she was always my favorite 90210 girl and I firmly believe that given the right material, she could probably act.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie, nobody laughed. Sure, there were titters for the first fifteen minutes -- anticipatory good humor, if you will. But the main body of the movie, the haunted house scenes, played to total silence. Nobody seemed grossed out. Nobody seemed offended. And certainly nobody seemed amused. Should have kept that ""No Sequels"" promise, boys. This one's a 1/10 bomb."

Starting as they mean to continue, the Wayan brothers set us up with much green vomit and rip off plotlines.<br/><br/>After our foul opening, we move to some generic college where the professor (Tim Curry) tricks his students into visiting a haunted house for a school project.

It was clear that most of the material was created the same way stand-up comedy routines are, except that instead of all the visual comedy being simulated by someone on stage with a mic and describing it, visual effects, stuntmen and actors were able to portray the ridiculous events.  A couple of things didn't work but most of it did.  Cindy Campbell and Buddy's characters aren't surprising, knowing who wrote them but Anna Faris and Chris Masterson playing their parts was hysterical because Anna Faris has a very wide range of expressions that are quite striking.

I knew about 15 minutes into to this one that there was NO WAY I'd have to consider whether or not to add this to my collection.  Aside from the fact that it's not as funny, the direction and editing are atrocious.  Angles where the actor is nearly out of the frame or shots that last literally half a second.  Wayans has directed a number of movies, so who knows why he dropped the ball here and made this look like a student film.  But, of course, above all else, you have to focus on the lack of laughs.  The targets this time around were either too old (""Poltergeist"" was damn near 20 years ago people!) or too unknown (did more than 10 people actually see that crapfest, ""The Haunting""?).  Then when they stray away from horror all they do is copy something instead of parodying it.  The ""squeaky cleets"" basketball commercial is basically just re-shot, and the ""Charlie Angels"" stuff looks like that movie's scenes.  Or they just throw in confusing and out-of-place moments like the idiotic wheelchair battle (what the hell was that supposed to be anyway??).  Only three cast members return, like poor Anna Faris, a cute and talented actress, who is reduced to bugging her eyes and dropping her mouth every other scene.  The unfortunate young girl appears to be trying hard, given the junk script she's working with.  And when they can't come up with witty lines for her, they reduce her to getting put downs, or touches, upon her breasts, as well as masturbating a guy till he bombards her with gallons of sperm.  Yep, that's right!  They even resort to ripping THEMSELVES off here!  Everyone else is reduced to swearing (even a trash-mouthed parrot), or is just wasted, like cult fave Curry.  This whole thing smells of ""rushed into production"" as over 10(!!!) writers couldn't come up with more than 2 or 3 good jokes.  The opening 10 minutes featuring James Woods in an ""Exorcist"" spoof actually provide a bulk of the film's big laughs, but don't seem connected to this movie, seeing how awful the rest of it is.

","I noticed the irony that in the Scream movies they stated that no sequel could surpass the original film.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that it is. Everything that follows is goofy(obviously).<br/><br/>I found this movie to be simply delightful. Sure the cat fight and the cursing parrot were annoying and retarded as hell, but lots of other funny stuff and a funny cast make up for it's flaws. I particularly found the Charlie's Angels spoof to be funny, unlike the Matrix spoof in the original. The Wayans brothers, as usual, were funny.

I spent the first hour telling myself that, at least, the last half would be funny.  Little did I know that the ""last half"" was fifteen minutes long and, no, it only got more inane.

","Having enjoyed the original upon originally seeing it in theaters (It loses something in the translation from theater to video), I, of course, was interested in the sequel. Like I'm sure anyone else would tell you, it's not award winning material, but it's not supposed to be, and anyone who's watching should know that. Personally, I prefer this over recent ""award-winners"" anyway. The story is, for the most part, a spoof of the recent remakes of ""The Haunting"", ""House On Haunted Hill"", and the classic ""Poltergeist"" and its sequel, however you can pick a haunted house movie made within the last two decades and it's probably in there if it made it to theaters, the beginning featuring a hilarious parody of ""The Exorcist"" (Ok, maybe not ENTIRELY the last two decades...) and ""The Amityville Horror"".<br/><br/>I thought the movie was, for the most part, hilarious. I also REALLY appreciate that the Wayans bros. actually took the time to research this one a little with a few nods to the past, as well as the present instead of doing what they did with the original, which was focussing entirely on the Scream trend and calling it a ""slasher parody"" and having absolutely NOTHING involving the true greats which did themselves inspire Scream, like the Nightmare On Elm Street series, the Friday The 13th series, and all of the Halloweens with the exception of the tremendously bad H20. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. But, I realize these films are put together for a quick laugh and not analysis under a critical eye for centuries to come, so such little annoyances can be quickly dismissed. After all, neither the Scream trilogy or the two I Know What You Did Last Summer films were that bad, mainly just garbage like H20 and Urban Legends...Anyway, enough of my Scream trend bitterness...<br/><br/>Chris Elliot is at his all time greatest as Hanson, the butler. The character is based entirely around Julian Beck's ""Reverend Kane"" persona from ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"", but my favorite character was definately Marlon Wayans' reprisal of Shorty, the loveable pot-head. Now that Doofy's gone, Shorty is really the only likeable character, which I also believe is intentional. The others are such repulsive, back-stabbing, consciously cruel sex fiends, you almost applaud their misfortune. Shorty, however, seems oblivious to pretty much everything. You can't really blame him for being an @$$. I miss Doofy...<br/><br/>Anyway, Richard Moll played a great goofy villain...again. I think this casting decision was a nod to one of my favorites from 1986, the Steve Miner vehicle, ""House"". Another favorite, Tim Curry, pops up, as well as James Woods, replacing Marlon Brando due to illness just before shooting began.<br/><br/>All in all a very funny picture except for one small thing...what the hell was Tori Spelling doing there? I don't think her character even had a name...or not a spoken name anyway. There are also a few missing characters which we'll hopefully see the return of in the event of a Scary Movie 3; Doofy, and Cindy Cambell's drug-dealing father. Interesting note on Rick Ducommun, who played Cindy's dad. He portrayed the character 'Art' in THE all-time greatest horror spoof, 1989's Joe Dante classic ""The 'burbs"". I recommend it, as well as Scary Movie 2."

Then he takes  the turkey and touches that all over then he licks it. When the professor (Tim Curry) asks him if there is anything he hasn't made, Hanson says he ordered a pie.

Oh sure the talking Parrot was retarded with his graphic explictives but they were hilararious. The plot: A college professor sends  like 7 stupid teenagers to Hell house, a haunted house. That's it. It was stupid, It was a spoof. Spoofs are supposed to be like that. And sure the Haunting wasn't that great but poltergeist was. Put a good movie and a bad one together and what have you got. Some funny s*** recreating Charlie's Angels. Oh and the biggning was some of the funniest stuff i've seen. James Woods make an appearance and does that thing from the excorsist, shh. i can't give it away.<br/><br/>This movie is entended for young-young audiences. And old er audiences should see it only if they can remember what it was like those years. The movie was what i like to call the-man. It wasn't the greatest but the bird was pretty original unless you can remember the movie ""Paulie"". The wayans brothers have done it again only if you make a  3rd, please put somemore effort into it. You know Shorty in space or something. Pitch Black or Star Wars or something really sci-fi horror. . Keep it up guys.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 stars"

","Sorry, but you have to either be really drunk or have the mind of a 12-year-old boy to appreciate this movie.  Apparently the Wayan brothers think it's automatically funny to take any scene from otherwise decent movies, throw in a few farts, some vomiting, and bucketloads of gratuitous and hackneyed sexual references.  I just lost a great deal of respect for all the adults who could actually stomach this movie long enough to act in it."

","Like most sequels, ""Scary Movie 2"" was not as funny and raunchy as the first instalment, but nonetheless, it was still absolutely hilarious.  At one point, I laughed so hard that my eyes watered.<br/><br/>It's a bit loopy that nearly the whole gang came back to this movie, especially since the majority of them died during the first movie.  This is just their way of making fun of movies that lack continuity.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great movie (a ""10""), just not as good as the first.  It was definitely better than any other movie out recently.<br/><br/>If you enjoy movies that portray unrealistic circumstances and (extreme) humour (i.e., the Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Airplane, etc. movies), then this one is for you.  If you are wanting to see a drama with character development, then look elsewhere.<br/><br/>For those of you who are concerned, there's more than enough pea-soup vomit for everyone!  Way-to-go James Woods!"

","Great parody movie!  Although Ray and Brenda somehow return from the dead to appear in the movie it was really great!  I loved the opening sequence..Priceless!  There were times where I found myself sitting there waiting for something to happen.  Mainly when Tori Spelling was trying to act I found myself looking around.  Other than a bad casting move with Tori the movie rocks.  Go see it and don't start on your popcorn until the first sequence is over. -PR"
"Subzero7","3","0","1","10 July 2001"," What a disappointment. Don't bother with this one.
","I'm a movie nut and like just about everything so it takes a lot for me to not like a movie.  But SCARY MOVIE 2 achieves that.  This is very unfortunate because the first one was so good.  <br/><br/>There are some humorous moments in 2 but overall the ball was dropped and never recovered.  After watching this film, I basically feel they must have thought to themselves, ""Gee, the first one did so well we could just throw this one together and toss it out there and it will do well just on the merits of the first one.""  And based on the first weekend gross that maybe what happens.  <br/><br/>It basically felt like the just threw the movie together without any real thought for the script at all.  I don't they think they gave any real attention to detail, writing or anything.  This is very sad because one of the best types of film genres there is, is parody.  Look at the NAKED GUN films.  The original SCARY MOVIE was excellent but number 2 just tanks. <br/><br/>
Strangely enough, I hope they do a number 3 because I think there is so much good material to use but I hope they decide to give it some time and thought and try to actually make it good instead of just tossing something out there for a quick buck.  Based on the $35mil it made on it's opening weekend (and I expect a fairly low budget), I'm sure this one will make money but I'd be willing to bet that it won't come close to the first when all is said and done.  After a big opening weekend and, I expect, a mediocre second weekend, I am expecting this one to drop out of site and go to video quickly. <br/><br/>
Personally, I feel that if you haven't already seen it, then don't bother. If you really feel you must see this one, then wait until it comes out to rent.  Or better yet wait until it's on HBO or Showtime (or whoever ends up with it).  But if you can at all go without it, then don't even both with it when it comes out on video.  It's just not worth it.  :("
"Scooby Gang","7","0","1","6 July 2001"," Good Sequel
","Scary Movie 2 is a pretty damn funny sequel for anyone looking for an entertaining no brainer movie to spend a summer night at. The movie is in some places more better then the original, and thrives on the knowledge that most movies don't pay attention to continuality. Thus Cindy, Brenda, Ray, and Shorty all return, even though they all died in the first. NO mention of how this is possible is explained, but who cares, they make this movie, Espcially Brenda, whose facial expressions and dialogues are just laugh out loud funny. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh."

"orub","10","0","1","6 July 2001"," Funniest movie I've ever seen...
","OK, now that I've got your attention...  If you thought the first movie crossed all boundaries of taste and morality, you have no idea what you're in for.  To enjoy this film, you must have the sickest sense of humor possible.  Any line that could possibly have been crossed was, and any attempt to exploit a scene for all it was worth was taken.  Many of the ""bodily function"" jokes take place out of nowhere and make absolutely no sense, but that's what makes this movie so funny.  It's quite obvious that Wayans made no attempt at a coherent story and put forth no effort in terms of plot and character development, but this film doesn't need them.  Like I said, this movie will offend many and disgust even more, but if you can put your political correctness aside and check your morals at the theatre entrance, you'll have the time of your life."

","This movie is very, very, very funny!  Chris Elliot is hilarious and Andy Richter from Conan is very funny even though he only has a small role.  The girls in this film are hotties!  It is a classic parody of all of the crap movies that came out this year.  There is a very funny parody of Hanible, which was a fantastic movie, in which Beetlejuice from Howard Stern makes an appearance!  Check this out and pay no attention to any bad reviews you have read!  These people are looking for Shakespear while watching Benny Hill!"
"Klopzi","6","0","1","6 July 2001"," Less laughs than the original, but you'll laugh harder...
","I'm a big fan of the original Scary Movie, and I wasn't that disappointed by the Wayans brothers' sequel.  I'll admit that, overall, Scary Movie 2 isn't as funny as the first.  However, without giving anything away, the first 10-20 minutes of the movie are gut-busting funny.  I don't think I've heard an audience laugh that hard in recent times.  Thinking back now, I can't help but laugh at certain scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the original Scary Movie, this is a must see.  But just in case, see the movie on a Tuesday night or see it as a matinee.<br/><br/>K."

","I liked this movie. The ending pretty much sucked, but I liked the rest of the movie. It was funnier than the first one. Also, any one actually expecting a good movie like a top 50 movie of all time of this is an idiot. This movie was funny, and it had a few really funny parts that made it definitely worth seeing. It is better than the first one. i would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10, but that's because i really didn't like the ending. You can tell it was rushed, like they just kind of ran out of time and said, the end. Go see this movie, it is funny."

","Now if you were a fan of the first movie, as I actually was not... but rather a pawn to the hype, this might be just what you are looking for. Now, I say this thinking that the first time around, I did not know what to expect in a Wayans' brothers horror/comedy. But, in needing a good laugh today, I found that this was just the movie to see. Now all the jokes that they are trying to get laughs from won't, but what movies really hit with that kind of accuracy. It seems that yes, the toilet bowl mentality is used here, but to some effect and if you choose to see this movie... I am sure that if these kind of gags are your cup o' tea, then you will be rolling in the aisles. It was kind of fun to see a couple of the 90210 vets in this film, as the two ladies looked beautiful and apparently the Wayans brothers did find sexy outfits that they had not already worn on that show. On a business note, this movie I am sure will not succeed to the heights of its predecessor, but with the nickel and dime budget that I am sure that this production company has, this movie will make back it's money in spades. A funny, average written slapstick with a semblance of a plot with sight gags and vomit jokes for everyone to enjoy... once again, if this is your thing. I give it a 6 out of 10, and I don't feel like that is underscoring it, but hey, it's just me!"
"dwfreeman","Null","0","1","6 July 2001"," Don't Over-think This Movie
","A lot of comments about Scary Movie 2 summarizes it as collage of stolen scenes from other movies( as well as from commercials, TV shows, and music videos) that have jokes sketched into them.  Well if that is what you think then you understand the whole concept of this movie.<br/><br/>Some comedies are meant to play out as a cohesive story that not only makes you laugh, but gives you a memorable movie-going experience.  Scary Movie 2 is not one of those comedies, and it's not meant to be that way either.  I will admit not all parodies are funny, and that the Wayans parody I'm Gonna Git You Sucka was better, but for the most part if go into a movie like Scary Movie 2 and turn the logical part of your brain off you will enjoy this film and films like it.<br/><br/>I will warn you that there are a lot of scenes that feature flatulation, urination, defecation, and regurgitation.  So if you plan to have some popcorn and you have a weak stomach, be prepared."
"glamiss-1","Null","0","1","5 July 2001"," funny, but not quite as funny as the 1st
","Unlike some viewers who claim this movie is ""bad"", i would have to say that this movie is almost as funny as the first one. If you're like a standard newspaper critic and don't like funny movies (you prefer Patriot Games or Dances with Wolves), then yes, you won't like this. TOO BAD FOR YOU!<br/><br/>Like any spoof, it takes scenes from other movies and makes fun of them / puts a comically-sick twist on them. There are plenty of funny things about this movie, but you'll have to see it to know 'em!<br/><br/>Obviously, if you don't usually watch horror movies / ""scary"" movies, then you might be lost here and there -- if you think this might be you, bring a friend who has seen those."

","Going in, I didn't think there was the slightest chance that Scary Movie 2 could match the wit and satire in the first.  I was WRONG.  Using images from a host of films, both classic and current, the Wayans brothers deliver another genuine piece of comic genius.  Sure, there is crude humor and questionable content, but one wouldn't go to this film expecting any less."

","Keenan Ivory Wayans' Scary Movie 2, a somewhat pale sequel to it's predecesor triumph Scary Movie, has some of the old characters back in a story resembling the Haunting and other spooky haunted house pictures.  <br/><br/>
As far as gags go, once again the film dishes out lurid and often distasteful (however quite funny) batches of them.  Some are actually ones that were used in the last film (I guess Miramax thought you can't go wrong with semen and genitals), but while some might say that's a bad thing, I guess if the shoe fits, and can make you cringe as well, it's good.  Worthy summer gross out comedy, although not as potent as the original.  The best scenes- the first exorcist scene with James Woods and Andy Richter as the old priest and young priest, and the Beetlejuice in the brain gag.  Grade, somewhere between B+ and A-"
