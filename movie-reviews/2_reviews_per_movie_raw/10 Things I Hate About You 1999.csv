"bob the moo","Null","109","124","13 October 2002"," Funny, lively and enjoyable despite being a little predictable
","On his first day at a new school, Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford. However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister, Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the same old plots and clichés that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like `She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically `The Taming of the Shrew' updated - most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn't matter - the core is interesting enough to stand on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not it.<br/><br/>No - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in `She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here - he doesn't over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider' cliché given to her and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character.. Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles, likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a `minority face' in a predominately white film, just as she was in She's All That - maybe I'm being a little paranoid but that's what it feels like.<br/><br/>Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!"
"sirokai","10","190","224","27 November 2004"," I can't stop watching this movie!
","I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but never did. I didn't get a copy until a week ago and finally watched it with my girlfriend. I have to admit, I've seen it five times in the past week. A lot of teen movies have very basic or clichéd plots, but not this one. It's based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and it has a lot of interesting twists. The music is awesome, every song actually fits the moment, and the two love stories are actually interesting to watch. Even all the actors did a really great job. The only bad thing is the occasional dirty jokes. If you don't care for teen movies, don't worry, you are just like me, this movie is still worth watching. I'm giving it a 10 to bring those ratings up!"
"ILoveDMB","9","151","178","5 April 1999"," Sweet *teenage love, lies, & consequences* flick!
","I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Granted I'm just 15 years old, and also a huge fan of Shakespeare, but it was really a great film. I would have to say it's definitely more directed towards the teenage/GenX generations, but it was awesome.  The tongue-and-cheek Shakespeare references were great (the ""Stratford"" girls, etc.) Julia Stiles & Larisa Oleynik were convincing in their roles, and not to be shallow but the guys of the movie just all looked really good. =) I recommend this to most teenage girls, although it's not totally a ""chick flick"" because my brother enjoyed it too.  In any case, the scene with the ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" ballad at the soccer practice is a can't-miss for all you love saps. =) I will tell you right now, the ending IS predictable, but not hackneyed. It leaves you with a happy bubbly feeling about teenage love.  Excellent movie, that is.  (P.S. When watching this in the theaters-- DON'T leave as soon as the credits roll.  There are some hilarious out-takes afterwards.)"
"Boyo-2","9","113","137","1 May 2000"," It was very good
","A movie like this doesn't exactly hit you over the head with its originality, and can only be as good as the actors. They must convince you that you've never seen anything like this before. In this case every single member of the cast is so good that they sold me on the movie from minute one.  Heath Ledger & Julia Stiles make a great couple and his rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" was one of the highlights. When Julia listed the ""10 Things"" she was crying and I was, too - extremely unusual for me in a movie like this. Everyone else was just as good and this movie is a keeper."

","Love love LOVE this movie. It is a classic, story is great, the actors are amazing, and the comedy is funny! There is something to laugh at every minute, and all the elements marry together perfectly to make a feel good movie, with depth and humour that isn't seen very often these days.<br/><br/>The cast are brilliant, Heath Ledger is awesome and brings an honesty to his character, Julia stiles is authentic and someone every girl can identify with. Has a lot of actors who made it big after the film - great cast.<br/><br/>An old school movie, they don't make them like this anymore!"
"Pookyiscute","Null","140","180","6 March 2004"," One of the best teen movies of all time...
","I can't say enough good things about this movie.  I do remember the first time I saw it, coming away thinking that I wanted to be just like Julia Stiles' character in it, though.  She was so cool and did such an excellent job in her role, that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest teen in any 'teen movie'. <br/><br/>Basic Plot: Cameron (Levitt), a new student at Pagua high school, falls in love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford (Oleynik). <br/><br/>However, Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school named, Joey (Keegan).  Cameron's sidekick Michael (Krumholtz)tells him, that Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides that's how he'll ask her out on a date.<br/><br/>Kat Stradford (Stiles) is Bianca's sister.  Totally opposite of Bianca, she is anti-social and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever meet.  Against boys, dances, and anything having to do with prepiness and silly fun, she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father and the city she lives in.<br/><br/>Bianca desperately wanting to date, is told by her father (Miller) that she will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does.  Desperate and not knowing how to get her sister to 'date for her', ends up asking Cameron, her new French tutor, to help her with her predicament. Enter Patrick (Ledger).  An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on the black market for a new set of speakers, also attends Padgua high, and is unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.<br/><br/>Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work, they need a backer.  ""Someone who's stupid, but has money.""  So they go to Joey, telling him that they know he likes Bianca, and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy sum, to have him date Kat, in order for him to date Bianca.  What Joey doesn't know, is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca, while he pays Patrick to take out Kat.<br/><br/>It may sound like a very confusing movie.  But it is so funny, cleverly written, and not entirely true of American teenage culture, but pretty close.  The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would have worked as well, without the people who played their characters.  As I said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on, and no one could have done it better. Her best role, more than certainly, and I love this movie so much!  I would have to say it's my favorite teen comedy next to The Breakfast Club.  One the best movies, and a great watch!<br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10.  Go rent it, or better yet go buy it!  You won't regret it!"
"BettieTeese","10","106","142","12 March 2005"," A masterpiece that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling! 10 out of 10 for 10 Things
","All the praise in the world goes to every individual involved in the production of 10 Things I Hate About You,a film that rarely leaves my DVD player.I'm not a fan of Shakespeare's traditional plays,but the modern day screen adaptions are brilliant,and 10 Things I Hate About You is no exception.The highschool stereotypes of the cool kids nobody messes with,the wannabe's that try too hard to be something they're not,the geeks everyone picks on and the rebels everyone is afraid of,mean there's a character in this film everyone can relate to.The stand out performances are Heath Ledger as Patrick,the rebellious,feared and elusive bad guy who wins the heart of Kat Stratford played to perfection by fine actress Julia Stiles who has no interest in the opposite sex and is perceived to come from the planet 'Loser' while her more sociable,boy crazy sister Bianca (Larissa Oleynik)hails from planet 'Look at Me,Look at Me'.Her good looks catch the eye of the smooth,suave and egotistical Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) who is a male model,and fights for the affections of the prettiest Stratford sister with Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the highschool geek,with a big heart and a big crush on Bianca.The hilarious Larry Miller stars as Walter Stratford-the kind of father who puts his girls on a short leash and desperately tries to shield them from the horrors of sex,drugs and rock and roll,and of course,boys.A typical teenage comedy,but its witty dialogue,goofy,sexy,cool and bad ass characters,and enjoyable storyline set it apart from all the rest.There's plenty of memorable moments,romance,and clever and classic lines,all leading up to a predictable but perfectly good ending that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling about teenage love."

","i know that teenage movies are extremely worn out, but this one will stay hip for ever! i think i will re watch it a hundred times and i will never get bored! why? because it's super cool!! you have the adolescents in your normal high-school, and you have the prom and this cute all-adored babe and this very hot and hip guy is after her but of course something is in their way: her sister! and we have our normal constant fight and arguing. but....there is Heath Ledger who is the ultimate babe and the perfect guy in this movie, and seriously gets you thinking 'why didn't this happen to me when i was in high school?'.the story is extremely cute and i think i can say original, anyways more exciting than the other movies that are in this category. there are some extremely funny scenes and you will never ever get bored! a must-see!!!!! and a perfect 10 score!!!!"
"MovieAddict2016","7","70","94","8 December 2004"," Pretty good overall
","Based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew,"" ""10 Things I Hate About You"" offers a refreshing revival of the ""good"" teen films, as compared to the ""typical"" teen films. <br/><br/>It's based on Shakespeare's story somewhat loosely. It's about a teenaged girl whose father will not allow her to date. Finally he comes up with a clever idea - if she can convince her older sister (who is a strict, boring ""b***"") to date someone, the younger sibling can as well. Her father knows this is as realistic as saying ""When pigs begin to fly"" but then he can't be accused of being unfair.<br/><br/>""10 Things..."" is overall pretty good. It's better than I thought it would be. It has some funny moments, it's got a talented cast with some older actors popping up in various humorous roles, etc. It's not as refreshing or unique as a John Hughes teen comedy but it certainly plays upon some of the clichÃ©s of the genre (invented by Hughes no less) to good effect.<br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed with the movie, and the actors, and that's saying a lot considering it's a teen film (a genre I have come to loathe recently with entries such as ""Slackers"" etc.)."
"saimahuq","Null","7","7","25 November 2002"," obstacles to true love knows no time era
","One thing about the Bard -- he knew the plots that touches everyone's lives, no matter where on the social strata or when in history they may be. It is made apparent in the case of Cameron James, new kid in school, as he falls for the lovely Bianca, who cannot date until her older shrewish sister Kat will date. But Kat doesn't WANT to date, and thus Cameron must scheme to find a suitable guy for this harpy-with-the-heart-of-gold if he is to win the fair Bianca.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles may be no Elizabeth Taylor, but then, she doesn't have to be. This flick relays the same message to a brand-new audience and is fun and entertaining to boot (plus I don't think Taylor could dance on a table quite like Stiles does in one of the more memorable scenes.)<br/><br/>
In the end, this is a charming movie that will entertain and educate high-schoolers as well as those several years past graduating. After all, Shakespeare knew what he was writing about -- there is no age limit when it comes to matters of the heart!"
"Darth_Stat","Null","60","80","4 March 2001"," You can't fault this one, it just aint typical.
","When hiring this movie was first suggested I turned up my nose at it. I thought, another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard, and any old somebody can avoid cle she's in the finer details, coming up with decent alternatives is the hard part, whatever they did here works like clockwork. I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.<br/><br/>Firstly, the acting is perfect, the roles are not overly demanding but Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.<br/><br/>For once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in, you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.<br/><br/>
The best quote of the whole movie would have to be ""it's just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives"" that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the ""bitch"" role in this, both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit of the movie.<br/><br/>And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.<br/><br/>To sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships, if they can be called such. So here is the count.<br/><br/>Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Screenplay 2/2, Originality 1/2<br/><br/>Anyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a must. For the movie it is I would give it 10 but going by the main qualities listed above which all movies can be measured by it would get<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","I'm 19 now (so was only 9 when '10 Things I Hate About You' came out) and I have seen this film way too many times to count. There have been countless sleep-overs, film days, random get-togethers and quite evenings alone that have all featured this film, so much so that I can now pretty much recite the entire script off by heart. Yet it is a mark of just how great this film is that, despite knowing it inside out I can still sit down and watch it and thoroughly enjoy doing so - it is and always will remain one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>When I was younger I never questioned anything in the films I watched - it is only as I have grown up that I have learnt to be critical of films, books and music, and even now, I can't fault any of the acting in '10 Things I hate About You'. Heath Ledger gives a dazzling performance as usual (which is surprising considering how reluctant Ledger was to take the part in case he became typecast) but the real breath-taking performance for me was by Julia Stiles - it is only now I am older that I can appreciate just how believably she managed to pull off her character that you do not for an instance question whether she is the 'rude, aggressive, bitter older sister of the most popular girl at school who only behaves in this way as a defence mechanism'. The remainder of the cast, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz etc all play their parts perfectly, and with a true 90's script and killer soundtrack this film couldn't fail to be anything but a success.<br/><br/>I guess that part of the appeal of this film for me is the fact that I grew up through my teenage years constantly watching it. If I was to be introduced to this film for the first time today, I am not sure whether I would like it anywhere near as much as I do now, but it has a certain sentimental value for me, and brings back many, many memories. And I have to say, in this genre of film, '10 Things I hate About You' will always come out on top. I guess that this film is my generations High School Musical, however, there is one key difference in my opinion - although this may be a teen chick flick it is in a class of it's own quality wise, and definitely should not be disregarded as anything less. Love it!!"
"jENNA007","Null","68","101","17 July 2001"," The best teen movie.. ever ; - )
","I loved this movie to death, it has the BEST teen cast I've ever seen. Hot talent, excellent writing, good direction, and a kiss-azz music score makes this movie able to be watched over and over again. I was so amazed at how talented the actors were, I just have to tell you what I thought of them ~<br/><br/>First off, I love Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford, Julia is the only blonde I have ever seen who could probably not pull off a clueless valley girl act (which is a good thing, trust me, black-haired, brown-eyed girls like me don't wanna watch dumb blondes.) Joseph Gordon-Levitt is adorably sweet and lovable here, I just wanted to kiss him. Heath Ledger, i can explain in one word : hot. And last but not least, Larisa Oleynick was great, very pretty, and not annoying although some of her dialouge wasn't my style.<br/><br/>

","You know how teen flicks are usually shallow, stereotypical, poorly written tripe? And you know how most romantic comedies are shallow, stereotypical, chick flicks?<br/><br/>Well, this film will forever put those films to shame. Brilliantly written, funny and warm this film deserves a spot on everyone's Watched list. And anybody with a teenager should buy a hard copy, because they will love it.<br/><br/>I feel that I am fairly well qualified to write a review of this film, as I have been conducting an unofficial study of teenage behaviour for the last 25 years as a high school teacher, and I have been showing this film to my classes every year since about 2000. All up, I have probably watched this film about 5 times a year for the last 15 years. And I still enjoy it!<br/><br/>The writers are to be commended for this film - rarely do you see a film that can blend comedy with true human experience. This is a film where every scene and every shot has been carefully crafted - and the meaning is not lost on a younger audience.<br/><br/>I could write about the storyline here, or give you a few of the many really funny one liners or tell you about the brilliant casting (the actors really are perfect). But instead I will just leave you with this - nearly 2 decades on and this film is STILL enthralling teenage audiences. For that alone it deserves a spot in the list of greatest teen flicks of all time. Students, today, have stills of this film on their smart phones and they tell me it's their favourite film, like, ever. Do you know how nearly impossible that is? To create a teenage flick that both guys and girls will love? Or a film with a PG rating but young adult humour? Or to make a film about teenage angst where every viewer walks away identifying with the characters and feeling empowered? Lets not hold back here, a film that can win over audience after audience, for nearly two decades deserves 10 stars - even if it is just a light hearted, teen comedy. I'm bringing out my green pen and giving this a great big tick and smiley face, well done."

"cbobs","8","3","3","25 May 2019"," One of the best high school movies of the 90s
","This was the Kickstarter to three big actors careers. Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Some of the comedy is well utilised and the jokes can come in so bizarrely that you can't help but laugh. I mean, I love how random this film is. Parts of the film feel so different and bizarre and it actually works. And also the multiple amount of main characters. I mean, at first u think it's gonna be Joseph Gordon Levitt because he is the new kid at school, but then it changes to Bianca and Cat and it starts to become a story about two sisters but then it sort of changes to a love story about Heath Ledger and Cat. However, it doesn't feel bad either. But if I were to say anything negative about it then I would say that Cameron's backstory was kinda glanced over and he isn't really given much character development. Also, there's really strange scene. This is where they are trying to ask a bunch of strangers whether they would date Cat. Now they could have just had them all laughing which they do, but then proceed to ask them one by one. It just feels a bit too strange and the editing isn't great either. Anyway, my favourite character is probably the English teacher. He's just the embodiment of what you wanted, but also didn't want your teachers to be like. But obviously the best scene in the entire film is the 'Can't take my eyes off you"" performance done by Heath Ledger. The acting is gray with Julia Stiles giving a strong performance and Heath Ledger killing it in his role. R.I.P Heath Ledger! Another great scene is the one where Cameron's friend nearly cycles all the way down to the sports stadium. It was so bizarre and out of left field but great at the same time. Anyway, while this film isn't perfect it's different to your average high school romcom and makes you feel just whelmed. Definitely worth a watch."

The acting is great and the soundtrack is awesome, just in general everything about this movie is great.

"zkonedog","9","3","3","9 April 2017"," Is This Maybe The Best Teen Rom-Com Ever?
","(Right off the bat, I'm reviewing this film as a stand-alone movie without any connection to Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"", which supposedly the film is based on. I've never read that particular play, but looking through the plot synopsis it bares only a passing resemblance to this flick...at least in my opinion. As such, I'll be reviewing based solely on the viewing experience.)<br/><br/>Though perhaps not my favorite genre of film, I can usually get into a teen romantic comedy/drama as long as it is done right. Despite being pretty much prime age (15) for this one when it first come out (1999), for some reason I had not (until now) seen the whole thing straight through. What I discovered after finally crossing it off my watch list is that ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is one of the most engaging, witty, emotional, and all-around best teen movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie can be a bit cumbersome to explain, but here are the basics: Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the prettiest, most desired girl in high school. This certainly does not escape the eyes of new kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who desperately wants to take her out. The problem? Due to a very strict father (Larry Miller), Bianca is not allowed to date until sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) does, and Kat has no interest in high school culture (thus dating) whatsoever. As such, Cameron--with the help of pretty boy Joey (Andrew Keegan)--enlists the help of school bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to woo Kat so he can have a shot at Bianca.<br/><br/>""10 Things"" has a special energy to it that never wanes from beginning to end. It also expertly combines the stereotypical language/activities one is used to seeing in a teen movie (at least one from the late 90s!) while at the same time turning them on their head (usually via Kat's snarky remarks). Basically, it is the perfect combination of ""fun"" and ""deep"" (in that special way that only high school can be ""deep"").<br/><br/>Only helping matters, of course, is the incredible cast. I mean, just look at the above names! At the time most of these actors were relative unknowns, so that fact that most of them are established or legendary in the business today is quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>About the only ""ding"" I give this movie is one area where it is a bit transparent: In the early goings, the film expects audiences to believe that: A. Stiles' character could never get a date; & B. Ledger's character is a true ""bad boy"". Neither of these things really work because Stiles is probably the most beautiful woman in the movie and Ledger is too handsome to really pull of ""mysterious"". Fortunately, the film doesn't require a total buy-in on this point (almost as if the filmmakers realized it themselves and didn't hit those characterizations so hard as the film went on), but for a while it is a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I was incredibly impressed by ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and actually kind of mad at myself for missing out on its greatness for so long! I have a relatively high ""BS meter"" when it comes to movies like this, but ""10 Things"" captured my interest from the get-go and never saw me wane. Perhaps this sounds a bit clichéd, but what ""The Breakfast Club"" is for 80s teens is similar to what ""10 Things"" accomplishes for the subsequent decade.

The reason that i thought it was incredible was because of the taming of the shrew link which made the film more excitable.I laughed at everything that Kat said in the movie because i loved her character and i liked her don't care attitude.Bianca was my favourite character of the lot because of her dumb humour and shes a person who thinks she is so popular.This movie has got the most strangest but the best cast of characters which are perfect for the part.I say 2 huge thumbs up for this movie."
"zedex","Null","3","3","18 June 2001"," Surprisingly funny romantic comedy
","When I went to see 10 Things I Hate About You, I expected the usual boring, pointless romantic comedy, where the romance is unbelievable and the comedy part seriously lacking. Instead I got an excellent plot and funny jokes with actual chemistry between the leads. As it is a modern remake of Shakespeare's The Taming Of The Shrew, you might think you need to know all about the play, but in reality the plot of the film is different and only the occasional bit of name-dropping has any connection to the play. Julia Stiles as Kat is undoubtedly the best actress, with Larisa Oleynik as her sister Bianca (an airhead eerily similar to Clueless' Cher) is also funny and believable. Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also good as their eventual boyfriends. The dialogue is hilarious and while the romantic plot is corny, it is entertaining (although the happily ever after ending is a bit too routine). The soundtrack and in particular the main title song (by Letters to Cleo) are catchy and the outakes at the end are good, although including outakes of scene that were taken out of the end movie is kind of confusing. I would recommend 10 Things I Hate About You to absolutely anyone as it is hilarious and without doubt the best romantic comedy I have ever seen.<br/><br/>RATING: 4/5"
"charlotte-yonge","10","5","6","27 January 2011"," Film is dying...
","...for a refreshing movie like 10 things I hate about you. Let's be honest, maybe back in the day when this movie first came out people thought it was only so-so... but having just watched it again after all these years, well I bloody well loved it. There was just something about the 90s. There was less technology to hide behind, feelings were more true, movies were more original and actually funny. And who would of thought the underdogs like Joseph Gordon-Levitt would of turned out as handsome as he has today? What I'm basically trying to say is give this film another chance because it definitely deserves more than 6.9/10 rating! It has everything: real visions of high school, crazy cliques, teenage angst, HEATH LEDGER IN GLITTERY TIGHT PANTS, real chemistry & etc. It was just a really cute, cute movie I don't know how else to put it. Instead of just everyone sleeping with each other throughout (ahem, seems to be a popular storyboard these days) 10 things had the works: Pretty boys aiming for the fresh meat, caring but somewhat psychotic parents (can relate), misconstrued images of one another, I mean the last one in particular DEFINED high school for me. No one was who you thought they were, in fact they were better.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, I demand thee to give this another go, it doesn't take much effort (I watched it on Youtube :) and please, this message goes out to all IMDb members and movie watchers alike: stop being so darn critical! Especially about the 90s, leave them alone. They will forever remain pure nostalgia for me and I'm sure many others."
"tedg","Null","16","28","5 July 2000"," A New Shakespearian?
","I checked out this video because I just saw Hamlet and was completely captivated by Julia Stiles. Then I learned that she has already done three Shakespeare adaptations (this, Hamlet, O). <br/><br/>This is really interesting. Is this really a talented actress (only 19) who understands something of Shakespeare and has purposefully targeted film adaptations? I've heard she was a success on TeeVee. I have to know, wondering if the flash of brilliance in Hamlet was a one-shot deal.<br/><br/>As for the quality of this film, I cannot say. Teen dating dramas succeed or not based on a secret, everchanging language of the subculture. I don't have a pass to that area, so must demur. This isn't much Shakespeare though, just the barest skeleton.<br/><br/>Her acting seems fresh, but its mighty hard to tell much here. She's not asked to do much, except for one moment when she reads a poem. Gwyneth Paltrow turned out to be limited, albeit sometimes entertaining in what she could bring to Shakespeare. Maybe Julia will do better."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","22","41","28 November 2003"," This was a story by Shakespeare?
","It's kinda weird that people say this story was based off of a Shakespeare story, yet no one ever mentions what this was based on. But 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the classic teen movies that came out of the 90's that was actually pretty good. It had a great cast, the story was original and a lot of fun, and the whole movie made you laugh and feel good. This was the movie that really sky rocketed Heath Ledger's career in America and I remember in school how all the girls were just drooling over him. Also all the guys fell in love with Julia Styles, she was also just awesome in this movie and made for a good strong female lead. This movie captured a great amount of what most teens go through in their world, wither it's just wanting to be different, popular, having an over protective parent, dealing with sex and rejection, this movie just worked on so many levels.<br/><br/>Cameron James, the new kid at Padua High School, is given a tour of the school by Michael, who is an audio-visual geek. Michael provides Cameron with information on the school's various cliques. During the tour, Cameron spots the beautiful and popular Bianca and is immediately smitten with her. Michael warns that Bianca is shallow, conceited, and worst of all, not allowed to date. Michael does, however, inform Cameron that Bianca is looking for a French tutor. Bianca's outcast sister Kat is another problem of hers' as well as her protective father, Walter, as he wants Kat to attend college nearby and wants Bianca to not date thinking it will lead to pre-marital pregnancy. Bianca begs her father to allow her to date, but is rejected, Kat's aversion to dating prompts the father to come up with a new rule: Bianca can only date if Kat is dating. Cameron starts tutoring Bianca, and she informs him of her father's rule. This news motivates Cameron and Michael to set out to find a boy who is willing to date Kat. Patrick Verona, an outcast who is just as ill-tempered as Kat. Cameron tries asking Patrick for his assistance, Cameron pays Patrick to take Kat out. Patrick agrees, but Kat, however, wants nothing to do with Patrick. Leading into Dawson's Creek drama.<br/><br/>If you do have the opportunity to see 10 Things I Hate About You I do recommend that you take the chance. It's a good movie and doesn't push you around or play games with you, and that's why everyone loved it, because it was just honest. Plus you just have to love the adorable scene where Heath Ledger sang to Julia Styles on the bleachers and got chased around by security, if that's not love and commitment, then I don't know what is. It has a great happy ending and just makes you feel good.<br/><br/>7/10"

","At Pardu High School young perky sophomore Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) wants to date--but her overprotective father (Larry Miller) won't let her until her older sister Katerina (Julia Stiles) dates. Problem is Katerina hates everybody! Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wants to date Bianca and hires tough boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Katerina. Trouble is Patrick falls for Katerina...<br/><br/>I can't believe I'm giving a 10 to a teen comedy (I'm in my 40s!) but I loved this! It's bright, full of color, quick with many interesting characters and some absolutely hysterical one liners. I laughed out loud more than once! The script is sharp and just great--it updates Shakespeare's play in a very affectionate manner.<br/><br/>The acting is just perfect. Stiles has already proved she's a good actress--she plays the comedy and drama to perfection. Oleynik is perfect as her younger sister--she could have been too perky but she wasn't. Gordon-Levitt is touching in his role. Allison Janney has a few hysterical bits as guidance counselor Ms. Perky and Andrew Keegan plays the drop dead handsome but obnoxious jerk Joey Donner very well--his verbal fights with Stiles really work! Ledger is just OK.<br/><br/>There's also a great soundtrack and some truly funny outtakes during the closing credits along with the band Letters from Cleo belting out a song on top of the school! The only negative I have is that there was a bit too much swearing and sexual innuendo for a PG-13 movie. Still, I loved this movie from beginning to end--funny and moving. Highly recommended!"

","I have to say that this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It has a cast good, camera work and the plot is great. It leaves you feeling satisfied and happy. Being different from a lot of teenage movies today it has substance and contains characters rather than thin pretty superficial girls. The music gives the movie a happy down to earth feel and there is lots of great comments and quotes to pick up. Easily laughable. There isn't any other movies similar in plot so you know you'll be watching a unique story when you view this movie. This is the sort of film you can watch over and over without getting tired of it.

","10 Things I hate About You has a wonderful soundtrack, an awsome cast, and gives a whole new audience the chance to appreciate a classic, even if they don't realize it. The remake of Taming of the Shrew is done beautifully, in a way to get the point of the story across to a whole new generation who would probably never read the original story anyway.  The soundtrack provides the same idea, with great remakes and samples by modern yet somewhat underground bands.  The soundtrack is as great as the movie. Julia Stiles, admittedly my favorite actress to date, seems to actually ""be""  Kat, she plays the part so well.  And Heath Ledger is her perfect match in every way...they even have the same smile.  Larrisa Olynik is almost as convincingly clueless as Alicia Silverstone's Cher, and Joseph Gordon Levitt was perfect in his puppy love. The cast was great, the story line was great, the music was great, and I couldn't appreciate the movie more.  It was a cool and convincing way to bring Shakespeare up to speed (though universally classic as he is) and to just plain have fun.  The 10 is in the title for a reason."
"saraarts","9","4","5","28 May 2000"," Great job
","Okay, I admit it.  I loved this movie.  I loved it even more than the classic play on which it is based.<br/><br/>Remaking, and especially modernizing, a classic is a delicate business. It's terribly easy, when bringing old truths into modern idiom, to fall so far into the pool of popular culture as to lose depth, or to work so hard at making an old story accessible to a young audience that the result is pure tedium for all ages. <br/><br/>In 1999, She's All That, a very loose and unacknowledged update of Pygmalion, gave us a perfect example of this kind of failure.  Thankfully, however, the same year brought us this movie, 10 Things I Hate About You, an update/remake of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew - and a great example of how to do it right.  <br/><br/>Doing it right, you see, is not about putting the thing into modern dress and language or adding gimmicks you think will appeal to people who might otherwise expect themselves to be bored.  Doing it right is about deconstructing something old until you get right down to the barest timeless truth of the thing, the reason why the author wrote the original, the reason why you are drawn to retelling the story in the first place, and then - and only then - reconstructing the story around that truth in the spirit of the original author, but dressing it according to your own zeitgeist.<br/><br/>Ever since my parents took me to see The Taming of the Shrew when I was eight years old, I've had kind of a love/hate thing going on with it.  I've loved the humor, the cleverness, and the fact that everybody who deserves happiness and love gets it in the end.  The parts I've hated are, first, the part where Kate is privately humiliated, and then the part where she has to appear subservient to her husband, even though she does it for love. Without spoiling it for you, I can tell you this is not quite what happens in 10 Things I Hate About You.<br/><br/>Strip away all the business and temporal context of Shakespeare's Shrew and this is the message you are left with: Love, trust, and respect must be earned.  They are not simply consequences of being young and cute.  Having a good relationship, loving well and being well loved, require trust and respect.  These are earned in a relationship when two people are kind, generous, and honest with each other, and bound up in all that, a little humble and a little nakedly needful and desirous of each other.<br/><br/>And guess what?  When you strip away all the business and temporal context, this is also the message of 10 Things I Hate About You!  Of course, it's been put into modern context, young language and dress.   And I love the fact that this version has also been thoroughly adapted to the modern consciousness that a young woman can learn this stuff herself, just by being smart and true to herself, and without being forced there by a bunch of men. I also love the way that the boys in this version of the story have to go through the same painful process and learn the same lessons.  But all the best elements of the original - the timeless truth, the humor, the cleverness, and the just deserts - remain intact.  <br/><br/>The really cool thing about this version, though, is something I don't remember from the original.  In 10 Things, we really get to watch all the main characters grow up.  We get to watch them make choices, right and wrong, hurt each other, heal each other, and learn.  We get to watch them all become more human.  <br/><br/>And that's the kind of transformation that makes a classic."

","'10 Things I Hate About You' is pretty much a typical teen movie that has nothing new to offer. It follows all those clichÃ©s about girl not liking guy in the beginning, guy woos her, girl likes him, there's a conflict, guy and girl split and then girl likes him again. Said to be based on 'The Taming Of The Shrew', this adaptation is fairly week and it would easily be lost among the dozens of forgettable teen films. However, it does have its funny moments. Plus, the chemistry between the actors makes some scenes work. The cast does work in favour. Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do quite well. Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles irritate a lot in the beginning but in the latter half of the film, they improve. Allison Janney is a scene stealer as the principal/aspiring erotic novel writer. It is not a bad movie by any means, just not a very good one."

","10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a smart, sweet, caring and funny film. This film's characters aren't your normal mid 90's dumb teens, they talk eloquently, they actually think and not utter useless lines (except for one or three dumb teen lines). The script, written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith is funny and throws in some Shakespearean type dialogue in there because this film, after all, is based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" written by William Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie is about this new kid Cameron (the incredibly talented Joseph Gordon Levitt in a very early role) wanting to date the beautiful, popular girl in school Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) but in order to do that she has to find someone to date the ""wild beast"" of her older sister played by the hormonal and teen angst ridden Kat (Julia Stiles). Kat has her own set of rules that she abides by and believes that she doesn't need to be someone that other people want her to be. That's true and all but to a certain point. Cameron's adventure in finding the right guy to even breathe near Kat comes to a screeching halt when he sees the dark and mysterious Patrick Verona (the late and great Heath Ledger, not his movie debut but came into the spotlight after starring in this film). All sorts of funny and interesting scenes abound after meeting Patrick that I will not spoil.<br/><br/>Cameron is being aided by a nerdy, audio guy named Michael played by the funny David Krumholtz who I first saw in The Addams Family Values (1993), another hilarious film. He may be nerdy but he's a good ad helpful right hand man to Cameron. The film is a genuine mid 90's funny and romantic film with very likable characters and somewhat witty, charming dialogue. When I first saw it 10 years ago, I immediately was hooked and never realized that this movie would give way to two very talented actors who would go on to have interesting film roles that showcased their talents in Levitt and Ledger. I forgot to mention that Kat and Bianca's dad is played by character actor Larry Miller, and he's hilarious in this film as well."

","Yet another teen flick that ends at the Prom! But still 10 Things I Hate About You is lively enough to be reasonably appealing.<br/><br/>And at no stage were 10 things listed about anyone! That bit must have hit the edit room floor.<br/><br/>This is pretty familiar territory. Boy likes girl. She doesn't like him. Someone is bribed to go out with someone he doesn't like. He falls for her. She finds out. You get the idea.<br/><br/>There's a Shakespearean spin on this version though. There's a shrew and so we have a taming of the shrew. The school is called Padua High and the shrew is called Kat and her surname is Stratford.<br/><br/>But really it would be stretching it to call this Shakespeare and most of its intended audience wouldn't even notice.<br/><br/>Full marks for Padua High though. The buildings really look stunning and are used to great effect, especially in a final pan with surprise, surprise, a rock band on the roof.<br/><br/>And would that band notice or care about the over reactive acting style that infects these types of films? They probably wouldn't because most teenagers are like this in the company of their peers. Under developed personalities are by definition shallow, even if this trait is amply compensated for by enthusiasm and embarrassment.<br/><br/>But I still couldn't help wonder how actors who are obviously adults can hope to pull off the idea that they are children in these films.<br/><br/>There aren't too many school age actors who can pull off mature acting performances. There aren't that many actors like Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio;  who have had the magic touch at a suitably young age.<br/><br/>10 Things I Hate About You hasn't revealed any more of these either. They didn't even try. In particular Australian actor Heath Ledger looked unlikely to be of school age. And when he slides back into his school desk after a night out drinking and playing pool with his bikie mates, well it seemed a bit rich.<br/><br/>But that's all irrelevant, especially since school agers seeing the film would probably much rather see someone who's as adult as Heath playing the hero anyway. Why aspire to pimples?<br/><br/>Anyway the dialogue is smart, the school looks good, the music is bouncy and the characters are interesting in spite of their shallowness."

First it has a fabulous cast (the ever- brilliant Julia Stiles and the up-and coming star, if A Knight's Tale is anything to go by, Heath Ledger), a superb script and it's just really clever. Yes, it is a love story, but a very intelligent re-working of Shakespeare's(also known as the king of writers)The Taming of the Shrew. Yes the ending may be all too perfect and happy but by the end you'll just love Julia Stiles' character sooo much that you'll be glad for her. There are some great laughs and a hilarious overprotected father played by Larry Miller who has some killer lines that had me in hysterics. There's not just comedy though, there's a few heart felt moments (those who've seen the movie I'm talking about the bit with the poem!) Overall I would recommend this movie to everyone.

The entire thing is one pretentious cliche. While I appreciate films like Hobgoblins (1987) for their campiness, this film really seems to try and say something.  I mean, that's why I hate it so much.  I can think up 10 things that I hate about this movie.<br/><br/>1.  Julia Stiles - supposed to come off as some feminist boy-hater, comes off as just whiny.  That's it.  Her acting isn't very good.  I'm sorry. 2.  The Shakespeare scene in the High School.  It was like a cinematic version of ""Saved by the Bell"". 3.  The parents' rule - who would, in their right mind, prevent one of their girls from dating because the other one won't date anybody?  What?  What if ""Kat"" was a lesbian? Then her sister would never date anyone. 4.  The examples for teenage girls.  You're not anybody unless you date anybody. 5.  The whole macho bribe thing.  I'll bribe you to date her.  How offensive to women. 6.  The headache that it gave me. 7.  The way that it depicts youth as an MTV culture.  Young life for some people is alienated and depressing.  Not a 24/7 party. 8.  The fact that only beautiful people exist in this movie's world.  If this movie had the characters from ""Gummo"" in it, I would have appreciated it more. 9.  The dull cinematography. 10.  The way that it vomits on Shakespeare's grave in a late 90's drunken stupor.<br/><br/>All in all, this film should be reviewed by some future ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" show.... they could have a field day with it.  1/10"
"gr8t99one","3","6","13","22 June 2000"," Grow up, it wasn't that good
","The first thing is, I am sick of people telling me how good this movie was. It's not a good movie.  The only decent part is the plot, and since all they did was adjust a good Shakespeare play, (who, I'm sure, was not the first to use the plot, but has arguably one of the better adaptations) of course it was good.  The acting was horrible, it wasn't anything like real life or high school (definitely not the same thing), and it plays to every short-attention-spanned flaky teenager who likes ""cute"" things and an easy emotional high.  If you actually watch the movie as a movie, it sucks. Spend your time actually reading Shakespeare, or watching a better movie."
"polkadotlegwarmers","8","3","5","18 August 2004"," The best teen movie ever.
","This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and by far the best teen movie around. It's the kind of film you can just sit, watch and be entertained without having to do too much thinking. It doesn't seem to matter how many times I watch this film, it always makes me laugh.  The best bit of this film has to be when Patrick and Joey are arguing about taking cat out on a date in the corridor and Patrick does a cheesy grin. That is one of many hilarious parts in this film that will guarantee to get you smiling. This is a feel good film to watch when you're feeling sad. And even if you don't like the story it's worth watching for the brilliant soundtrack."
"n-mo","5","4","8","15 April 2008"," If there's a way to hackney Shakespeare...
","Any movie that uses as its base such strong source material as a William Shakespeare play can't be completely written off. Still, while 10 Things I Hate about You followed the heels of Clueless in adapting popular classic fiction to the then-flagging teen/chick genre, it ultimately sputtered on poor writing and sloppy characterisation so that anyone sophisticated enough to appreciate its literary heritage will moan and groan at the paradoxical plot headaches.<br/><br/>First of all, I really have to suspend disbelief to imagine that an OB-GYN like Dr. Stratford who, after seeing too many teenage pregnancies and being left to raise his two children all alone, is so tightly-wound as not to let his daughters date until they graduate, would continue sending them to a coeducational school, much less a *public* school where the ""same little ***wipes'-****-for-brains"" roams every hallway, in the words of Padua High's own guidance counselor.<br/><br/>Second, while it is hard to complain about seeing Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik for a couple of hours, their characters really needed more than this script gave them. All of the characters are written up verbally to add a bit of Elizabethan flavour, and Stiles' Katerina is portrayed as a rebel against meaningless pop-consumer culture and seeking a more nuanced intellectual path... yet at the end she turns out a poem that reads like something I wrote at age fifteen. She plays herself up as so much more mature than her classmates and she's going to school on the opposite coast in a few months, yet even after she discovers she's been set up to fulfill her ex-lover's Playboy fantasies with her sister, she slides almost immediately back into a relationship with a willfully complicit boyfriend she'll probably never see again. This was so perfectly satired, by the way, at the end of Not Another Teen Movie.<br/><br/>And, hey, the original ending of The Taming of the Shrew showed Katherina coming to terms with convention--but on a more profound level than the ordinary wife. She submitted to her husband because he subjected himself to her torments. But the play never condemned traditional society, whereas the film's parallel ""convention,"" teenage smarm culture, is expressly condemned throughout the movie, by Katarina and others, and yet it's vindicated by the end.<br/><br/>The development of her sister Bianca is equally fragmented. She falls in love with the ""good guy,"" Cameron, long before Katarina's lecture on the terrible truth of her former hotrod, Joey. So what does she have to learn from her sister? Does she even learn anything at all? What didn't she know to begin with? Even at that point, she's still sitting in her room pining away for the prom in front of MTV. (And wouldn't an uptight, frustrated, paranoid OB-GYN cut the cable, as well? I know I sure would...)<br/><br/>How pitiful. HOWEVER... when all is said and done, it *is* a modern adaptation of a Shakespeare play, it's one of the films where Heath Ledger's presence does not elicit disgust, and the occasional spitball hurled at contemporary teenage life is indescribably amusing. So, too, is guidance counselor Ms. Perky (at whose indiscretions I ought not amuse myself, but I can't help it). How many public school teachers not-so-secretly want that, I wonder? It's not quite as stylish or subtle as it sometimes thinks itself, but it has its moments. Don't expect Shakespeare, though."
"rochelle-rochelle","4","4","8","11 April 2006"," Predictable, Cheesy Comedy
","This movie is nothing short of predictable, cheesy and goofy. The transformation of Julia Stiles character is quick, unbelievable and cheesy. The filmmakers must think the viewers were idiots to buy the change in character's ""overnight"" transformation from ""men are scum"" to ""i want a man"" as it comes about. This movie should have been a made-for-TV small screen gem vs. a large screen goofy, cheesy and predictable comedy that is far from being a ""classic"".<br/><br/>PLOT - Strict rules in the Stratford household forbid Bianca from having a boyfriend until her odious sister has one of her own. Mating mayhem ensues when Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger)--a sullen young man with a mysterious past--is bribed by Bianca's wannabe boyfriend (Andrew Keegan) to woo and win Kat, in order to clear the way for Bianca to begin dating.<br/><br/>They say it's a twist on Shakespeare's play, however this is a far cry from it. It doesn't come remotely close to being in the same class as a Shakespearean play. The comparison is laughable and a downright lie."

"sddavis63","2","6","14","9 November 2012"," A Stereotypical Teen Movie; Nothing Fresh Or Original About It
","I'm not going to argue with teenagers. This is a stereotypical teen movie filled with every cliché that the genre uses. And of course there are a lot of teen movies filled with those same clichés simply because they work for their target audience. This one clearly works with the target audience. It has a good rating. So be it. But my warning: if you're not a teen, please avoid this. <br/><br/>I didn't find it funny or fresh or original. It's the same basic plot that gets respun over and over: kids (some cool and some not) desperately trying to fit in, and somehow in the midst of it all finding love in the most unexpected places. It didn't do anything for me - but then again, I'm not a teen. In fact, I wasn't really a teen even when I was a teen! So I'm definitely not the target audience. And maybe that's the reason that I spent a good part of this movie wondering about the title. What 10 things? I didn't really make the connection between the title of the movie and the content of the movie. It's like someone just made up a title out of thin air because it sounded cute or funny or something. But what did it have to do with the actual movie?<br/><br/>It's not a bad cast, but you really have to be into this kind of movie to enjoy it. I'm not, and I didn't. It has two or three mildly humorous and/or heartwarming moments. The father/daughter talk near the end of the movie as Mr. Stratford finally lets go of Kat was basically THE heartwarming moment of the movie, and it actually worked quite well, and so left me with a bit of a more generous reaction than I might otherwise have had. Still, though, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this in any way, shape or form. (2/10)"
"funkyfry","5","6","14","1 March 2010"," just OK
","I'm sure somebody has already come up with 10 things to hate about this movie, so I won't bother. Basically this is actually an easy movie to either hate or to love, but my reaction was more tepid amusement. It's a very typical teen comedy based on the plot structure of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" (like Cole Porter's ""Kiss Me Kate"", but without good music). Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are both really fun to watch, but not really matched in quality by Larisa Oleynik or particularly by the underwhelming Julia Stiles. Stiles has the right face and mannerisms but we can't tell that there's actually supposed to be a human being inside. Ledger has most of the really memorable scenes; it brought a big smile to my face to see him crooning Motown hits over the PA system to his beloved.<br/><br/>The movie is just good enough to entertain some kids and prevent adults from tearing their hair out. The soundtrack is one of the most annoying aspects by the way, as there are constant appearances by some blonde rocker who is apparently supposed to be a big deal. I can see why this movie might be great nostalgic fun for those who were in high school when it came out, but it had little to offer me."

","I'm sorry but this movie tries way too hard. I understand the cleverness of the characters' names and all but the movie kind of over does the Shakespeare thing. It's like, ""I get it, you're basing it off of the Taming of the Shrew."" I'm really sad I didn't love this movie because I love the cast. How could you not love Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles? My problem is with the writing. Kat's character is unbelievably harsh and cynical. It's too much. and as for the teacher rapping sonnets? it could have been really cool but came off cheesy instead. Basically, the whole time I was cringing because of the script- not the acting. I'm truly sorry I had to give this movie such a poor review, but it just wasn't that great."

The first time I saw this movie I was 23, and even though I was skeptical (another one of those boring and predictable teen flicks?), I was blown away. The actors are all great - even the guy who portrays Joey, the underwear model, is somehow cute. I mean, he's kind of the ""bad guy"" of the movie, but I like him anyway, he's just funny. The best character was Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) in my opinion, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) a close second. Julia got to show a whole lot of emotions onscreen, and she's bloody good!

The romance from each character is creative and makes you fall in love with them. I think this movie is a worth everyone's time."
"sopopia","9","1","1","22 January 2020"," Coming of age story turned classic
","10 things I hate about you, directed by Gil Junger, is categorized as a coming of age/ romantic comedy film. I believe the Disney's interpretation of a romantic comedy written by Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah should be considered one of the classics when it comes to romantic comedy. One reason for my belief is because the writers pull elements from classic authors like Shakespeare, forbidden love to so close but so far its a direct spin off of the Romeo and Juliet storyline.
10 things I hate about you is a film centered around a boy named Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) how falls for a girl named Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), but their is a problem her father has very strict rules about dating. He says Bianca cannot date until her sister Kat (Julia Stiles) who is known as the moody, and angry starts dating. Trying to solve the problem Cameron gets the only guy in school with a reputation worse than Kat Patrick (Heath Ledger) to try and take her out.
10 things I hate about you did a fantastic job using tracking shots and low angle shots to capture every scene to its maximum potential. There is one scene in particular that sticks in my brain when I think of tracking and low angle shots. This scene takes place when Patrick is still trying to get the attention of our mysterious Kat. He attends a concert that she is at and you see the camera become his eyes as he moves from the back of the crowd to find Kat in the middle. Once he gets to kat the camera immediately changes to have a slightly lower angle on Kat even though Patrick is taller this really highlights the intensity of Kat's character and that even the toughest of guys still are intimidated around her.
On top of the excellent shooting techniques used in the film the acting does not feel like cookie cutter acting whatsoever. Julia Stiles who plays Kat does a tremendous job displaying a moody teen how really doesn't care what people think about her. Then you have Larisa Oleynik whos representation of a peppy highschool teen is so spot on. The best part is that since the two are so different when they have sense together the way the filmmakers used lighting and the colors in the clothing really helped sell this idea that they were so different from one another but yet so similar.
Like every good film there is always at least one element you would change. In my opinion I would change the soundtrack of the film. I don't believe the soundtrack adds anything to help the film, but in the same token I don't feel it was awful. I believe if the filmmakers had spent a little more time on the soundtrack it would have brought the film to a whole other level entirely.
I will always appreciate a feel good Romantic comedy but when you think of the classics, there are a few that always come to mind the 1989 film When Harry met Sally and 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle and now in my opinion 10 things I hate about you."

Hats off to you Sir.
Having a good story to work with is always a boon and to have Mr. Shakespeare as your story writer a heavenly gift. But kuddos to all the screen writers for adapting the story to a common school life with utmost ease.
On one side we have Kat and Patrick, a little mature couple and on the other Bianca and Cameron a young at hearts pair. They are just lovely together. Then you have high school stud Joey, gothic dressed up girl Mandella and everyone else they just strike a chord with you in their own way.

","Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew"" is the basis for ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" a fun, sweet, romantic-comedy that has a surprising amount of substance. Julia Stiles plays the ""shrew,"" a highly intelligent teen who is fiercely independent and speaks her mind at all times. So what's the problem? Well, her sister is a social butterfly who wants to date but isn't allowed to by the father...unless Stiles also dates. The father's idea is that Stiles will never date, and so the other daughter won't either, and neither of them will do any crazy, sexual things with boys.<br/><br/>But two young men - one of whom is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - desperately want to date Stiles' sister; and so both of them work up a scheme to have a fearless, bad boy in their school (played by Heath Ledger) to ask out Stiles. Typical of a rom-com, the lead romantic couple ""meet cute,"" they start to really like each other, then a monkey wrench gets tossed into the situation that can potentially mess everything up.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is the scene when Stiles gets up in front of her English class and reads a poem that is basically a list of things she hates about Ledger. It was the most poignant part of the movie as well as showing the wonderful talent of Stiles.<br/><br/>What sets ""10 Things I Hate About You"" apart from the typical, teen rom-com are: solid, three-dimensional characters of Ledger, Stiles and Gordon-Levitt; very clever dialogue dished out by Stiles; the two lead characters are very likeable; and the great chemistry between Stiles and Ledger.

Kat is Bianca's bigger sister, who is annoyed by everything. The movie is about Cameron who falls in love with Bianca and Patrick who falls in love with Kat. The movie is very good for romance movies lovers because it shows the pure love between the 4 teenagers. You should really watch the movie because it's very good."

","10 Things I Hate About You is the perfect teen movie- hands down. It has a lot of competition but is perfect.

I was eleven when I first watched this film and I loved it and I still do it will always be a classic in my mind despite the measly 7.2 rating on IMDb. Don't be put off by the rating for that is not an accurate representation of the film. An Accurate representation of the film would be in the nine star region. A wonderful high school love story starring the late great Heath Ledger, Oscar Winner, and Joseph Gordon Levitt, star of Inception, one of the greatest films of all time, the talent in this film is very fresh and young at the time and the stars of the film grew up to be world renowned for their acting. The movie based on a Shakespeare play fits under the feel good genre, so if you want to be happy watch 10 Things I Hate about you: It is guaranteed to brighten your mood.

","Being a more mature and sophisticated 16 year old I really didn't think this typical teen movie would make the cut. Boy was I proved wrong!! The soundtrack was awesome and the casting was outstanding! Of course people are labeling this movie as being ""heath's worst mistake"" but everyone needs to start somewhere and hey lets face it you don't suddenly wake up one day and get cast as the Joker! With all the crap on TV these days I think 10 Things is a great movie that also didn't contain any what I like to call ""photoshop actors"" (you know the ones that are so unrealistically good looking they look, well, photo-shopped) All in all a great movie definitely worth a watch if you're sick of all the sappy teen crap circulating through the cinemas :)"
"alyssamarion","10","1","1","1 October 2014"," Thumbs up!
","The movie 10 Things I Hate About You (1995) perfectly depicts how high school can be the ideal place to let our hearts dictate over our brains. Gil Junger, the director of the movie, casted it superbly. Starting with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona, he takes on the mystery and charm of a bad boy. With Heath Ledger being born in Australia, as stated by his bio page on the website Biography by A&E, his accent only adds to the excitement of the character that everyone knows nothing about. His equal, Kat Stratford, is played by Julia Stiles, who happens to be one of my favorite actresses. In her unconventional way, Stiles' beauty shines through her characters introverted ways. Even if she is not popular among the rest of her peers, she walked with confidence down the halls of Padua. On screen, Ledger and Stiles compliment each other with their various acting techniques. The two are different in ways and seem to still have the chemistry you would find in a real life teenage couple. To say their characters belong together when played by the two, is an understatement. <br/><br/>This was also one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's first movies as a young teen. Before 10 Things, Levitt was only recognized for his role in Angel's In The Outfield. In an article published to the website, Thought Catalog, Levitt's work from the movie is recognized and followed by movies that he starred in after his role as Cameron James. Also, in the article he is even compared to his on-screen co-worker, Heath Ledger, as having more ""depth."" The movie centers around Cameron James' plot so why not have an up and coming actor play the fellow? His young looks and boyish charm make watchers sympathize for the love sick James, which only adds to Levitt's success in playing this particular character. Larisa Oleynik, plays the innocent, yet sought after, Bianca Stratford. For Oleynik, it took a certain charm to be one of the most desired girls in school and yet be so sheltered and naïve. In my opinion, Oleynik makes the movie. She's the light in the movie and has to constantly be a sort of comic relief. With this character, and that job, Oleynik makes it seem effortless. <br/><br/>Every movie needs its villain. Joey Donner is played by Andrew Keegan. Keegan's pretty boy face makes him perfect for the role. He also, adds a nice touch of spoiled rich kid flare with his slicked back hair and feminine features. The parts of the movie become whole when these actors and actresses interact with one another. I have seen my fair share of movies and no other one has quite the easy-going flow as this movie does. 10 Things I Hate About You is easily one of my favorite movies. I feel with the cast's efforts and amazing story-line, it takes a pleasing twist on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. Any high school student can relate to the heartbreak and excitement of this movie and finds comfort that other people may be going through similar situations. I would say that 10 Things I Hate About You is arguably the best comedy movie of 1995. A great cast and amazing team of directors can be responsible for the success that is still widely watched today, almost ten years later."

","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is just as great as it was when I first saw it in 1999. One of the better re-tellings of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", writers Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith did a nice job bringing Shakespeare's work into the almost-21st-century. The characters are well defined and excellently played, particularly Kat Stratford by Julia Stiles and Patrick Verona by Heath Ledger. The supporting characters are all nicely played and fun to watch, filling out the cast nicely and keeping the movie clipping along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is spot-on, in that wonderful way that seems to only happen in teen movies.<br/><br/>Still great after 15 years!"
"g-bodyl","9","1","1","7 March 2014"," A Pleasing Teen Film!
","The late 1990's and early 2000's is home to a truckload of teen films and many of them are the same thing over and over again. But I'm pleased to announce, 10 Things I Hate About You is one of those above-average ones. In fact by today's standard, the film manages to hold up very well. It's sweet, charming, and funny and that's what I expect from these films. It also happens to bring back some nostalgia in me especially when every social group is explained in the film.<br/><br/>Gil Junger's film is about a new student at school, Cameron who happens to fall this pretty girl named Bianca. When he's told she's not allowed to date because of her father, that does not stop him from trying. Meanwhile, this thug named Patrick gets paid to take out Bianca's older sister, the ill-tempered Kat. But he realizes that he may actually fall for Kat.<br/><br/>This film has some solid acting by future big stars. Heath Ledger makes a name for himself here and is really charming. Julia Stiles has some great scenes and is my favorite character. I loved her dialog between herself and her black English teacher. Very funny indeed. Finally, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really good here as well and it's weird to see him this young.<br/><br/>Overall, despite many teen clichés including the prom scenes which have been done to death, this is an awesome film that many of us can relate to. It's a believable story and the characters in it all seem realistic. There are some good themes such as ones like never give up and such. Of all the teen films that were pushed upon us, this is one of those that stand out. I rate this film 9/10."
"cbcoope","7","1","1","24 February 2014"," 10 Things I Hate About you follows teens that are trying to fall in love.
","Is it possible for a movie to hire actors that are too good for their roles? If so, then 10 Things I Hate About You did this. Gil Junger directs this 1999 Touchstone teen romance that follows the love adventures of 4 teens. The plot line is nothing too different from every other teen romance movie and is quite predictable. The actors, however, were charming, engaging, and lovable. Their wonderful portrayals brought the seemingly worn out plot line to life and left the audience feeling happy and filled with warm fuzzies. The dialogue and one-liners added humor and made the movie enjoyable for everyone watching. The story follows the classic chick flick plot line and doesn't stray too much. While it is quite predictable, viewers still find themselves drawn in and excited when things work out. The standout actors in this film are Joseph Gordon Levitt, Heath Ledger, and Julia Styles. Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays the adorable Cameron, the new kid who falls for the popular, beautiful Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). He is cute, sweet, pure hearted and very easy to love. Ledger and Styles, on the other hand, play the ""scary"" and misunderstood teens. Styles gracefully embodies her ""heinous bitch"" character but is immediately liked by the audience because of her sass and wit. The same goes for Ledgers character, Patrick. This fierce Australian boy is surrounded by mystery and rumors, which causes the students at Padua high to be very afraid of him. He plays the bad boy role well but in a way that leaves room for later in the movie when his character is seen as a respectful, kind guy. Andrew Keegan, who plays Joey, and Larisa Oleynik playing Bianca have much easier characters but also portray them well. Joey simply has to be the handsome, popular jerk and Bianca is the ditsy cute girl who eventually gives up her selfish ways. Its no surprise that this film racked up seven nominations for awards based on actors performances (IMDb). The actors were excellent, and it was obvious to everyone who saw the movie. Having such good actors, however, may have hurt the film. Viewers are forced to see the actors change their minds with almost no prompting. The plot does not address why Bianca suddenly changes her mind about Cameron, or why Patrick eventually falls for Kat. All that the viewer sees is that these teens now magically have feelings for people that they were originally using for their own selfish gain. As Robert Ebert said in his review ""Sometimes it's a mistake to have acting this charming; the characters become so engaging and spontaneous, we notice how they're trapped in the plot"" (Ebert). If you ignore the over used plot structure, however, you see a great movie. The story has a lot of heart and some great one-liners. The dialogue in the movie is fantastic with the sexual innuendo and sassy retorts. For example; in English class when Kat and Joey were arguing Joey asked the teacher ""Mr. Morgan, is there any chance we could get Kat to take her Midol *before* she comes to class?"" to which Mr. Morgan fired back ""Someday, you gonna get bitch-slapped and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it."" What makes this line even better is that it is foreshadowing because at the end of the movie Joey does get bitch-slapped and not a single person helps him after. Even the sisters' outrageous father is hilarious when he is telling them what not to do when they go to a party; ""No drinking, no drugs, no kissing, no tattoos, no ritual animal slaughtering's of any kind. Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas"" (10 Things 1999). While some of the lines are a bit wacky, they give the movie character and help it stand out from the thousands of other films in the genre. It is these moments that really make the viewers fall in love with the characters and become invested in the story. When a movie is quotable, people talk about it more, mention the quotes whenever possible and thus they want to watch the movie again to hear the funny lines. Overall, the movie, while being very predictable, has a lot of heart. The witty dialogue and the fantastic performances make 10 Things I Hate About You a memorable and enjoyable movie. I would give the movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Anyone can find something they like about this movie. Guys, if your girl is going to force you to watch a chick flick this one might not be quite as dreadful as some of the worn out, sappy ones out there. 10 Things I Hate About You has romance, but also comedy and a positive vibe."
"bbewnylorac","8","1","1","3 September 2013"," Newsflash: an intelligent teen movie
","Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger elevate what could have been just another high school movie to something really interesting. Stiles' character is not just a bitter shrew: with some tough life experiences -- her mother leaving, a horrible previous boyfriend -- she has reason to be. Ledger's character, as the new boy in town, with nothing to lose, takes outrageous risks and is sneaky in his manipulation of his new classmates, but later shows a very tender side in trying to woo the Stiles character and not taking advantage of her. One scene I didn't like was Stiles' recitation of the poem at the end; it was too self-conscious and weepy and didn't gel with her earlier snappy, confident character. But overall, this is a beautifully acted and directed film. A great teen film, and it will make you smile."

","This film works because the audience are given a group of well rounded characters; many of which are quite likable, which helps. These are then put into a sequence of situations that resolve themselves into a satisfactory conclusion. Of course we are taken on quite a journey before this conclusion and I can see how some may find the plot a little hard to follow. Fortunately I have read the Shakespeare play and even seen it performed and so am familiar with all its twists and turns. I love the way it's written with allusions to the original text, for instance calling the school 'Padua' was a very nice touch. All the performances were excellent with both Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona and Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford taking the plaudits. I must also give a nod to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James, Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford, David Krumholtz as Michael and Andrew Keegan as Joey Donner. Oh, and look out for a nice comic turn from Allison Janney as Ms. Perky; very funny.<br/><br/>It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I really enjoyed this film and have every time I've seen it! I know it got few plaudits from the critics when it came out, but it certainly speaks to me. It's surprising just how many people 'love that movie' when I bring it up; but so few can tell me what it's about. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it and if you have, give it another look sometime; it's well worthy of a second look. Watch right to the end of the credits as well for some amusing outtakes.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.5/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","I don't tend to do reviews of films as I watch films I like and like the films I watch. Films that I have no interest in or don't like I don't watch. Therefore most of my reviews come out as gushing sections of superlative prose, showing only positive criticism of anything. My reviews don't tend to give any negative comments. However this film deserves my praise.<br/><br/>This film is a case in point. I love it.<br/><br/>I was 25 when this film was released and so was arguably at or above the age range that this was targeted at. I was aware of this when I choose to watch it, and being male was a little quiet about my willingness / keenness to watch it.<br/><br/>I generally don't re-watch films. There are a few exceptions; epics like Lord of the Rings; classics like Star Wars and comedies like Spaceballs, Hot Shots and Monty Python. Even then I haven't watched them that many times. However 'Ten Things I hate about you' I have watched again and again – not obsessively five times in a day, but probably once a year (or more) since it was released.<br/><br/>Why do I keep coming back to this film? I don't know, but everything about it exudes quality. I'm male, cantankerous, stubborn and cynical but this film is emotional and of such a calibre that it affects me each time.<br/><br/>The plot is not simple, it is a number of different people and how one persons goal affects and intertwines them all. Only later did I discover that this was based on Taming of the Shrew by Shakespeare, no wonder it presents as a well written and carefully thought out story.<br/><br/>The acting from all the main parts, lead and supporting roles are excellent. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play the main leads with superb skill, as if the roles were made for them. The music is all well chosen and exactly appropriate to the scenes.<br/><br/>But what makes it for me, what holds the whole film together as an excellent portrayal of a superb story is the overprotective but exquisitely loving and caring character that is the father to the main female protagonist. Larry Miller does an excellent job of giving the story meaning and holding all the story together. Without this father figure with his rule about dating for his daughters, there would be no story.<br/><br/>It is slightly predictable, but in away that doesn't distract from the film in anyway.<br/><br/>It is one of my favourites, and I suspect always will be, despite not being sci-fi or fantasy based, despite being a little chick flick, despite being based on a classic work of literature.<br/><br/>The film just works. 9/10"

","10 Things I Hate About You is a generally nice, fun and easy going film to watch.

Just saw her In Dexter and I cannot believe she still looks exactly the same all these years later.<br/><br/>I remember watching this all those years ago and totally falling madly in love with Heath Ledger and realising how amazing he is in this film. OK it pains in significance with his future roles e.g. Brokeback/Dark Knight etc but all the same he does carry this movie. Joseph-Gordon Levitt also is very good.<br/><br/>It's a nice film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

One day I hope people will watch this movie and understand that this movie provides pure entertainment, in the way that movies and theater have always provided entertainment.<br/><br/>Plus the fact that it is based on a Shakespearean play only adds to its intellectual depth.

","""Teen comedy"" and Shakespeare: two concepts that shouldn't fit very well in the same sentence, especially if the former turns out to be an adaptation of a work by the latter, set in the present day. Thankfully, the writers of this film get it right most of the time, which is why 10 Things I Hate About You should be rightfully considered one of the more interesting interpretations of the Bard's works.<br/><br/>One of the smartest moves on the makers' behalf is actually the choice not to reveal the origin of the story: Shakespeare's name isn't mentioned anywhere in the credits. Instead, we get a few playful and fun references to the original author and the comedy The Taming of the Shrew, on which 10 Things is loosely based: the high school where most of the action unfolds is called Padua (the city where The Taming takes place), the female protagonist's last name is Stratford (Shakespeare's place of birth) and the male main character is named Verona, after the town where Romeo & Juliet was set.<br/><br/>Instead of two ill-fated lovers, we have two people who can't stand each other: Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles), the ""shrew"" who refuses to socialize with anyone, and Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), an Australian textbook rebel who allegedly served jail time for setting a cop on fire. Thw two are brought together thanks to the actions of a younger boy, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a crush on Kat's sister Bianca (Marisa Oleynik). Unfortunately for him, her father (Larry Miller) won't let her date guys until Kat dates someone as well, and since no one will spontaneously go out with Kat, Cameron and is friend Michael (David Krumholtz) come up with the idea of paying Patrick to ensure everyone gets their happy ending.<br/><br/>Naturally, as in all rom-coms starring teenagers, things get a little more complicated than that, and so the entire third act is about how everyone screws up and has to fix the mess they caused. It's all quite predictable, but that doesn't lessen the movie's appeal: sure, it'a very traditional genre comedy, but it's executed with wit and pace, both delivered by sparkling dialogue and above-average performances. Stiles, best known for more troubled roles, pulls off the difficult task of making Kat sympathetic in spite of her apparent coldness, while Ledger, in the part that got him noticed in Hollywood, goes beyond a mere ""brooding thug"" clichè. So much of the movie is in their hands one wishes there was less focus on Gordon-Levitt and Oleynik, who might provide the tools for setting the story in motion, but also happen to be incredibly daft compared to the main couple and constitute the film's biggest flaw (paired with an embarrassing paint-ball scene). Fortunately, that kind of blandness is compensated by a terrific adult cast, most notably Miller (familiar to Seinfeld fans) and Allison Janney, whose two-scene cameo easily qualifies as the best laugh in the whole picture.<br/><br/>To summarize, romantic comedies aren't always that good, especially when teenagers are part of the main plot, but when they work, the result can be something as warm and funny as 10 Things I Hate About You. Then again, the Shakespearean roots of the screenplay must have helped a great deal too."

"aimless-46","8","1","1","16 July 2007"," Underrated
","""10 Things I Hate About You"" (1999) is probably the all-time most ambitious of the teen comedies. Updates of classic literature like this have become relatively common; ""Emma"" is adapted as ""Clueless"", ""Othello"" as ""O"", ""Pygmalion"" becomes ''She's All That'', etc. etc. ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" (which has also been adapted as the Broadway musical and film ""Kiss Me Kate"".<br/><br/>The strange title is less Shakespeare derived than a play on the Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins ''How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.'' Even knowing this, the title withholds its relationship to the film content until the climatic scene late in the film when Katerina (Julia Stiles) reads her poem (in iambic pentameter) to the class: ""I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all"". Either the producers can't count of they didn't like the sound of ""13 Things I Hate About You"" <br/><br/>The film was fairly popular at the time of its release and made a considerable amount of money, but critical reaction was mixed. Most of the negative reviews came from critics who felt the film was too distanced from the original; specifically that Katerina was not Shakespeare's mega-shrew and that her taming was just too tame. While these observations are correct, in this case toning down the original makes the film work better. A less gritty story allows for more lyrical storytelling and better a unity with the great pop soundtrack and the inventive cinematography. And few will miss the original's out-of-control misogyny. The film goes out on fantastic rotational helicopter shot of the group ""Letters from Cleo"" as they perform the closing song on top of spectacular Stadium High School in Tacoma. <br/><br/>The story begins with obstetrician Walter Stratford's (Larry Miller) grudging agreement to allow his younger daughter Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) to date if her older sister Katerina (Stiles) starts dating. Walter's occupation has made him super-paranoid about teen pregnancy, but he feel quite safe with this compromise because Katerina is a brain with little interest in boys and an abrasive enough personality to drive away anyone who might be attracted to her. <br/><br/>Miller and Stiles are exceptional in these roles, the best performances of their careers. Oleynik (formally Alex Mack) does not have nearly as much to work with but is solid in her role. My main criticism is that the film has the same dynamic as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", with the abrasive tomboy significantly more desirable than the foxy girl every guy is after. Back in her ""Alex Mack"" days Oleynik was the #1 ranked female in a People Magazine survey of the most beautiful person in the world. I don't see it and I'm pretty sure that I have a lot of company. <br/><br/>One interesting bit of trivia is that Oleynik went on to attend and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College, the school that Katerina wants to attend in the film. <br/><br/>Female viewers will generally be pleased with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona (afterall the action takes place at Padua High School), who is hired by two of Bianca's admirers to tame the shrew. Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) is the obnoxious pretty boy who is cruising for his comeuppance throughout the film; but he is not close to the bad guy standard set by ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and Pretty in Pink"". Allison Janney is hilarious as a porno-writing guidance counselor. <br/><br/>I really liked the tentative feeling between Patrick and Katerina. In one of the most enjoyable scenes he appears in the grandstands while she is at soccer practice and sings ''I Love You Baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him down on the field.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

Julia Stiles has the ability to play a exceptional mature teenager and not some valley girl ditsy time (for example she does not play the stereotypical blonde girl roles). I just recommended to a friend to watch. The credit goes to the director, we need more movies like this. This movie is before HL became a big range. He is not that bad either, especially in the scene where he serenades Julia's character that was very funny and very sweet. Every girl likes that! The two sisters were funny."

","As copied:Steve Baker (s.baker@iig.com.au) from Cairns Australia Yet another teen flick that ends at the Prom! But still 10 Things I Hate About You is lively enough to be reasonably appealing.<br/><br/>And at no stage were 10 things listed about anyone! That bit must have hit the edit room floor.<br/><br/>The ten things Katherina Stratford hates about Petruchio are written in the poem that she writes explaining that although she hates him she loves him as well. This is at the very end after the prom. You should watch the film properly before slating it!! This film is a great remake of an old classic, with a mixture of both humour and romance. Perfect for everyone to watch."
"xXsineadXx","9","1","1","10 January 2006"," Teen Rom-com heaven!!!
","Absolutely everything you could ask for in a teen romantic comedy!!! The roles of Patrick Verona and Cat Stratford are excellently portrayed by Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. The story containing hilarious dialogue and cute teen romances comes together to create a fairytale ending!!! Contains a very original storyline and plot to it, never before have i seen a movie in which a guy gets another guy to pay another guy to go out with a girl so he can date her sister!!! It may sound confusing from how I have just explained it but it really is quite understandable and interesting when watching this film!!! Overall an excellent film recommended to teenagers and young adults!!!"

","I love the movie its my favorite. i love the part when they are at the prom and the paint balls. oh i just love the movie and i think heath is cute too. hes my fav actor and Julia stiles is my fav actress not just cause of this movie but she was also in another one of my fav movies ""Save the last Dance"" overall i think this movie was the best movie ever. I don't think the comment was necesary at the part where there outside the cd shop and he says ""But you sure thought about me naked"" that was the only downpart of the movie.I love the split part about half about cameron and Bianca and the other half about pat and Kat. overall the movie was great cause i've never seen anything like it and it was really original."

I hated Joey, he's such a poser. I can watch this film over and over again. I like the bit when Kat crashes into Joey's car and when Patrick starts singing a song to Kat. I think it's cute how Cameron has the courage to ask Bianca out. Not much people can do that. I thought parts of it were very funny. I'm glad Bianca beat the crap out of Joey at the end, he definitely deserved it. Does anyone know how you can reach Julia Stiles?

","I'm a sucker for romantic comedies, and especially teen ones. However, my tolerance of them is usually limited to just enjoying them because even the best aren't that good. This is the exception. 10 Things I Hate About You is not only a brilliant re-take on Shakespeare's Taming Of The Shrew, but also just a good stand-alone movie. The few clichés they use are handled well (besides, it wouldn't be a romantic comedy if there weren't a few). The characters and motivations are believable, and the frequent comic relief scenes are put to good use (it's a Shakespearian Device, after all). It's cute, it's sweet, and Surprise! Hot actors and actresses abound! If there's only one Teen Romantic Comedy to see, this is the one."

","I must say that this movie is an evergreen movie, which you will always be dying to watch. The plot, soundtrack, story, the cast, all was very captive. this is one of those movies which make you stick to it till the end. Larisa Oleynik had a strong character with Joseph Gorden Levitt, must say it was a nice couple in the movie, while Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger were also just like them, but not totally like them. My fave Part was where Larisa Oleynik appears for the first time in the movie. Those who haven't watched this movie, haven't seen any teen love, romantic stories. It's a must see movie, which will keep you entertained till the end."

I have always been a fan of child actors because I feel they show what natural talent really is. Oleynik and Stiles where great.  Because of language and scenes with alcohol I would not suggests this for kids under thirteen. The ending was a little predictable but most American films are. This is loosely based on taming of the shrew so do not expect it to be the same.  I missed the out takes because I left early.  This is a must see."

The two lead actors, Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, had very nice chemistry and I'm sure will graduate to some very good movies in their futures.  It was a cute, tongue-in-cheek movie that was enjoyable and very funny.  I will definitely have to see it again as the first time I missed the outtakes at the end."

","Saw the film this weekend; soundtrack a bit obnoxious to my nearly-40-year-old ears, but otherwise, it's a cute movie.  Obviously geared toward a young audience, especially those who aren't familiar with this formulaic plot.  Heath Ledger got squeals from all the young girls in the theatre--every time he grinned, they went nuts.  Reminded me of Beatle-mania!  I'd recommend this film highly for young people, or those who don't feel like thinking too hard."
"atomic28","9","1","1","12 April 1999"," Surpassing All Expectations
","I saw this film for exactly one reason.  No, not Julia Stiles.  Not Larisa Oleynik either.  I saw it because it was filmed mostly in Tacoma, WA, about 15 minutes from my parents' house where I live when I'm not in college.  I didn't really expect to be that good, though.<br/><br/>I was wrong.  This has to be one of the best youth-culture films of recent years, and it stacks up well against classics like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller"".  The characters and plot had depth (thanks to Shakespeare) and there were plenty of laughs.  For two hours, I wished I was back in high school.  This movie's a winner, even if you can't find Tacoma on a map."

","10 Things I Hate About You is smart and funny, but lacking in some areas. It is a fantastic film to see if you view yourself as the high school outcast.  Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles had great chemistry as Patrick and Katarina.  The film could have been less predictable with fewer stereotypes. While it didn't stray from your typical high school films, it is definitely one of the brighter crayons in the box."

","I went to see this movie because it had quite a few good actors in it.  I loved the plot and the way both Patrick and Kat changed, proving that maybe they weren't what everyone thought they were.  I loved the scene when Patrick sang that song for Kat on the bleachers, probably my second favorite scene.  My favorite scene is when Kat read her poem to Patrick, hence the name of the movie.  A very good movie, not just a teenie movie with teenie actors.  I wonder if I could get my English teacher to let us all see it?"

The target audience for this film is teenagers and the superb writing and effervescent acting appeals to its audience.  Shakespeare is always a popular form to follow and if done so properly one can produce a fine film. 10 things I hate about you did a superb job of telling a story of coming of age and can be viewed upon as an intelligent movie that complements Shakespeare's work."

","I went to this movie expecting to see just a normal teen flick to fill my uneventful spring break days, but I came out after seeing a really fun, funny, smart, sad, movie thinking ""wow-now that's not the normal teen flick"".  I think the Ms. Perky thing was brilliant, because the normal teen movie would have the counselor be the friend, and turn out helping the kids, but in this case it was different :) (I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it).  This movie reminds me a lot of Pleasantville (a great movie, might I add) because it shows that young people really can act, and our movies don't have to be sugar coated and stupid-they can be...well...very Shakespearean."

The whole story is based on normal stuff (with an occasional exaggeration) teen problems.<br/><br/>The overall acting was really great, making it believable.

"Jonnie Comet","Null","1","1","29 March 2002"," The young female intellectual.
","This may just be one of the most significant pieces of accessible idealism to come round in a long while.<br/><br/>As a literature teacher I have used this film as an example in the classroom.  The concept of a THINKING teenaged girl who is able to make rational judgements about the attitudes and actions of others, and then to actually live by her extraordinarily high standards, is an invaluable example.  We've seen enough bimbos diving into the sack.  If only more girls were like Kat--!<br/><br/>But shrewish Katrina is more than an intellectual snob.  She's been hurt, and her deeply-closeted motivation is to spare her sister the pains she herself has known: 'Not all experiences are good.'  It's appropriate that the story takes place at a school-- for the real purpose of education is to learn from the mistakes of others instead of stupidly repeating them yourself.  That alone makes the film worth watching for young people, younger teenagers... and maybe even tweens.<br/><br/>Some observations: 1. The producers seem stuck in a '70s-'80s musical rut, choosing Cheap Trick and Joan Jett numbers.  But the hook in Nick Lowe's tune 'Cruel to be Kind' comes from 'Hamlet', a connection that Kat (and perhaps no other character) probably appreciates. 2. NO public-school teacher would EVER get away with Mr Morgan's behaviour in the classroom.  This is the worst drawback in the story, and it's major. 3. Why don't we ever see Bianca and her date go sailing?  It's a wholesome sport requiring brain power and responsibility, and seeing them actually go would assuage the audience's concerns as much as Dr Stratford's. 4. I can't help it-- I just keep seeing Katrina as.. DARIA!"

"ironhorse_iv","6","3","6","30 May 2013"," 10 Things why I hate this movie & 10 things why I like this movie.
","'10 Things I hate about you' is a very interesting movie in the late 90's. High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of our lives. I watch it when I was indeed at the age where it was fun to watch, but after 10 years of maturity out of my teenager stage and into adulthood, this movie became harder and harder to watch for me. It's still watchable, but the story isn't that fresh to me anymore. '10 Things I hate about you' is loosely a modern retelling of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew about a surly wench and the man who tries to win her and in here, its transfers to a modern-day high school comedy. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is the shrew, who isn't very kind to anybody. Her younger sister Bianca (Laris Oleynik) is more poised for high school wanting to date people. Don't know why they couldn't have kept the original last name of Minola, but Stratford works alright, since in this 'world', William Shakespeare's works do exist here. What I hate about the film version of Bianca, is that she isn't ingénue at all. She isn't that sweet, and not virginal at all. She doing this to get more and more popular in the school. Anyways, their overprotective father (Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until men-hating Kat does, which is to say never. Larry Millers gives a lot of good humor as the paranoid father who scare of his girls becoming pregnant teenagers. Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who wants to date Bianca, heard about this, he hires the boastful, selfish, mercurial Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to go on dates with Kate. Of course, like any other high school drama what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as both Kate and Patrick might love each other. Here is the 10 Things what I love about the movie. 1: it's sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teen humor. 2. Great adult characters such as the English teacher (Daryl Mitchell) could have stolen this movie out from under all the other stars if he'd had just one more scene. Or just a few more minutes of screen time than he already had. Like really, he had some of the best lines, the funniest zingers and the funniest things to say. Also the guidance counselor (Allison Janney) had some interesting humor like secretly writing a trashy romantic sex novel. In real life, I doubt these two characters would ever become teacher, and yet again probably not allow to step on the high school grounds at all. 3. Heath Ledger was just a promising actor at the time. He will be miss. 4. I love all the Shakespeare references. 5. The main characters aren't sugar-coated; there's something charming yet detestable about all of them. 6. Great soundtrack with awesome 1990's songs. 7. The ending works. 8. There are key scenes that I love such as the paint-ball scene, the 10 Things I hate about you speech and Heath Ledger singing. 8. Not really a chick flick, as there are things about even the guys to love. 9. Amazing cast of worth good actors. 10. In my opinion, the best high school comedy of the 1990s. 10 Things I don't like about the movie are 1. The over use of high school clichés as a grouping or labels. 2. The party scene with underage drinking 3. The cheesy rich character Andrew Keegan plays. It's a 1980's, early 1990's bad teenager stereotype. 4. The characters could be a little bit too mean 5. The washing down of Shakespearean characters and dialogue or mistakes. The cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. In the Shakespeare version, the younger sister could not marry until her shrewish sister did. This was a custom of the time. Here it's seems weird to have that in a modern day settling. 6. Lacks of the deep social themes that made Taming to the Shrew famous such as the economic aspects of marriage and the Effect of Social Roles on Individual Happiness. 7. The plot was completely predictable 8. Annoying teenager drama that doesn't really matter in the long run of life. The people who were dating kept on getting mad at each other and made up about three times. I don't want to hear people complain about their teenager's life when adulthood is a lot harder. 9. Some parts were unrealistic, it's a bit annoying. 10. The original story wasn't supposed to be romantic comedy. In the original play, Petruchio sees Katharine as a challenge for his manhood, and rather than using romantics, he abuses her into submission through starvation and intimidation. Petruchio wins the bet because he has essentially bullied Katherine into an obedient, submissive wife. Not a really romantic story indeed. Anyways, overall: the film is pretty good at the time. I was a bit surprised that it was PG-13 than R, but for parents do warning, even if its PG-13 doesn't mean it for all teenagers. There is quite a lot of sex-related dialogue, some nude artwork, and teen drinking that need a more mature audience to watch. Disappointed that there is little alleged connections to the 16th century play, but its OK because it works out for a teenager popcorn flick. So check it out if you want to."

","1st watched 8/14/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Gil Junger): Formulaic older than teen high school movie that had very little going for it except for the music sounded good on surround sound. The talent was wasted with this piece of TV-like fluff. Julia Stiles & Heath Ledger have a lot of talent but apparently not very good agents to allow them to be in this. This is basically about two sisters who are very different and want to date boys but daddy won't let them unless they both do it together. Soooooo, basically they work it out so that they both live happily ever after by the end in their high school heaven. And the title doesn't work at all for this movie because this isn't about chicks putting down guys, but this was a poem brought up near the very end of the movie that the Stiles character didn't even believe. Nuff said, please avoid this loser."

","Oh god,oh god,oh god: ANOTHER modern translation of Shakespeare with teens? This movie sucked.That is the best and most simple way to put it.

","This teen comedy is definitely not all it was cracked up to be. It had a stupid storyline and the acting wasn't exactly superior either. I am personally not a big fan of Shakespeare and he was the one who wrote the first version of this dumb story except it did not take place in a high school when he wrote it. After hating this movie immensely, I thought I'd try reading the Shakespeare version and compare the two. Shakespeare beat the movie by 100% and I didn't even like the Shakespeare story!

","I thought this film would be a typical teen-romance-comedy that centers around a romance that leads to the prom.  But, I was amazed, only this film (and American Pie) is the only good teen film of the year (if American Beauty doesn't count).  Why?  Because it is a replica (a good one at that) of Bill Shakespeare's Taming the Shrew.  So much in fact the names match (the two daughters are Bianca and Katerina like the play), and the story reads like the play, so I don't need to go into the plot.

","After hearing lots of good commentaries involving this movie, I thought maybe it would be a refreshing teenager comedy. Its title doesn't fit with the plot or story-- actually it makes sense only in a fast scene in the end. Several moments of this picture are similar to the controversial ""Not Another Teen Movie"", the difference is that ""10 things"" doesn't make jokes or references to other films. Heath Ledger doesn't show any differential in his acting-- people would never imagine him as the unbeatable Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" years later. Rest of the cast is just okay and the plot is the classic American stereotypical, just like in the other teen pictures. Don't expect too much from ""10 Things I Hate About You""."

","Firstly let me say I'm 23 and I first saw this one it first came out in the cinemas when I was 13 - and promptly loved it, bought the soundtrack and a year or two ago bought the movie. The two couples have good chemistry and play their characters with feeling, the music was up to date, up beat and completely fitting for when it came out and still fun to listen to now. Also around that time and still today I am Shakespeare buff and am always happy to sit down and take a look and a new adaptation.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say that the fashion has dated and some of the ideals have too because they have but honestly in comparison to the other teen films coming out right now this is well written and well acted by people who have gone on to do amazing things and who actually played characters who were both likable and relatable.

I have been watching this movie at least 2 times a mon since it came out on DVD. I just can't get enough. My obsession is soo bad that i have memorized the whole movie and i see scenes flash in my brain during random moments in my day.

Kat (Julia) is a purpose social outcast her sis Bianca is loves being in the spot light. When Carmero comes to Padua High (as an army brat) he falls in love w/ Bianca. Bianca is ONLY allowed to date if Kat does. So Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) is paid (by Joey -Andrew Kegan) to 'date' Kat. And the story goes from there.

","There was ONLY one good thing I loved about this film and that was Heath Ledger. What I hated would take more space than allowed, however I can't resist a few inspired comments. I am a HUGE fan of Will Shakespeare. I sat through Leo DiCaprio's modern version of Romeo & Juliet without major trauma, but this remake of Taming of the Shrew, shredded my innards. From a raucous soundtrack to mindless teenage acting to simplistic direction, man, oh man was this one BAD. As I said at the onset, the only redeeming factor was Heath Ledger, who manages to come off good in anything he's associated with. He was the only true actor among this travesty of sleep-walking, boring, over-acting thespians. Duh, gag me with a spoon man..."

","Seventeen years later, Ten Things I Hate About You still strikes a chord with audiences. 423 years later, The Taming of the Shrew continues to hold relevance to the modern population. An adaptation of the famous Shakespeare play, Ten Things I Hate About You (directed by Gil Junger) illustrates the story about the popular high-school sweetheart Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) being told she is unable to date until her independent, rebellious, ""shrew"" of an elder sister Katherine ""Kat"" (Julia Stiles) does. Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Michael (David Khumoltz) plot with Joey (Andrew Keegan) to convince Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to go out with Kat so Bianca is free to date.<br/><br/>The plot line closely resembles that of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew where Bianca is informed by her father she cannot marry until her older sister—""the untamable shrew"" — Kat does. However, the film takes a modern spin, changing it to fit the frame of high school teenagers. In the play, Kat is untamable through her independence and outspoken nature, just as her character is in the film. Three men wish to woo Bianca, but two, Hortensio and Gremio, are deceived by Lucentio, the third, who dresses up as Bianca's tutor to gain her love. The three then band together to observe Petruccio's attempt to tame Kat in order to free Bianca. Although a triad of Joey, Cameron, and Michael plot for Kat to be wooed in the film as well, her ""Petruccio"", Patrick, is paid by Joey to take her on a date. Cameron convinces Joey to pay for Patrick's rendezvous by pretending he will end his pursuit of Bianca to give Joey a clear opportunity.<br/><br/>Gil Junger successfully transforms the humor and social class marriage struggles of The Taming of the Shrew into a modernized, relevant version of high school dating, social status, and teenage angst in Ten Things I Hate About You."

Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out Junger's high school version of The Taming of the Shrew. When popular sought after Bianca Stratford is forbidden from dating until her feminist, tradition despising sister Kat decides to date, she feels as though her life is over. Bringing to life the Bard's work for a new audience, Gil Junger graced us with a modern-day classic.<br/><br/>New student Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is instantly smitten by Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) His student tour guide, Michael (David Krumholtz) quickly informs him that Bianca is off limits to all, as her strict father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister starts dating. Cameron believes finding a date for Bianca's sister Kat (Julia Stiles) sounds like an easy enough task until he meets her. Kat is introduced to the audience tearing up a prom advertisement lecturing the student body on the patriarchal origins of the prom tradition. Realizing his feat to be almost insurmountable, Cameron enlists the help of Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) the school bad-boy with a mysterious reputation to hopefully lure Kat with his mystique. Cameron also cons the school model, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) into convincing him that he will be the one that gets to take Bianca on a date after Kat falls for Patrick. Believing he will get a date with Bianca, Joey provides the monetary bribe to Patrick promised to him if he can successfully manage Kat to agree to a date. When Patrick begins to fall in love with Kat, however, the whole strategy might fall apart. <br/><br/>My favorite part of these Shakespeare adaptations are the allusion to the actual works of Shakespeare that are sprinkled into the adaptations. In 10 Things I Hate About You, some of these allusions include Kat actually being called a shrew by a classmate, Shakespeare being read in Kat's literature class, and their school being within a castle. These allusions act as great kisses to the original work, and provide a nice touch of enjoyment to members of the audience ""in the know"". 10 Things I Hate About You is made up of a predominately young cast that really bring their characters out of the Victorian Age and into the modern day quite nicely. The music in the film also goes a great length to making the story fun and relatable even to audiences who know little about the film's original inspiration. A well-done Shakespeare adaptation will be enjoyable for fans of the Bard's, as well as people who didn't even realize that the film was based on another; 10 Things I Hate About You accomplishes this feat, bringing Shakespeare to an audience who may otherwise have skipped him."

","A brilliant romantic comedy, but one that exhibits more typical aspects which are traditionally displayed in such films of this genre, for example; a bad-boy who is reformed, an unpopular girl who finds love, a nice guy gets the girl, a bad guy gets his comeuppance and there is a happily ever after.<br/><br/>The lovely blend of multiple story lines, character developments, music, comedy, romance and sadness helps to create a vibrant and enchanting film that manages to bring all story lines together in great fashion at (you guessed it) the prom.<br/><br/>The merging of comedy and romance makes its way into Patrick's (Heath Ledger) wonderful and comical performance of Can't Take My Eyes Off of You as does Cameron's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) excessive planning to get the girl of his dreams. However, the film's exhibition of a very touching moment is what has made this film stand out from other rom-coms, Katarina's (Julia Stiles) poem that she reads aloud for which the film gives its name to is beautiful and symbolises the heart-wrenching and competing emotions of love. The film despite its clichéd structure, has these types of moments within the film that separates it from the others.<br/><br/>10 Things I Hate About You is a lovely, funny and superb romantic comedy which I will watch over and over again much like 500 Days of Summer.

","This is such a fabulous movie. It's one of my all-time favorite movies. It's funny, it's witty, it's intelligent and well-written. It still relates today and it has an amazing cast. I just love it so much.<br/><br/>In this movie, there are two sisters. Bianca is fun-loving and popular and really wants to start dating. Her older sister, Kat, is well, not bitter, but she is very anti-popularity cliques and she likes to be original. She doesn't want to start dating anytime soon. Cameron moves to their school and really wants to date Bianca. Bianca and Kat's father now has a new rule, Bianca can date, when Kat does. So Cameron tricks a popular guy, Joey, who wants to date Bianca, and Joey finds someone to date Kat and pays him. Patrick is the only one who is willing to do it. Patrick tries to get Kat to go out with him and it takes her a while to say yes. When the two eventually date, Bianca goes out with Joey, crushing Cameron. Then Cameron eventually dates Bianca, which is addable. At the prom, Joey spills the beans about paying Patrick to date Kat and she is furious. The sad thing is, she really liked him and he really liked her. It takes until the end of the movie to get Kat to forgive Patrick. In the end, Patrick and Kat are together, Cameron and Bianca are together, Cameron's friend and Kat's friend are together and Joey gets punched in the face. He really deserved it.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

","The Taming of the Shrew Ten Things I Hate about You shows how the ""tough guy"" in high school, Patrick (Heath Ledger) and the nonconformist girl, Katerina (Julia Stiles), get set up on a date. Katerina found out the reason they went on their first date was a complete set up where Patrick got paid to ask her out by her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). The reason Bianca set this date up was because their father said the only way Bianca could date was if Kat were to date someone too. After Kat found out he got paid to be with her, she did not understand why he would lead her on like that because she was really falling in love with him. In the end she forgives him because he gives her a guitar and he realized that by the end he wasn't in it for the money anymore -- he was in it for Katerina.<br/><br/>When this movie was made it was based on the older movie Taming of the Shrew. So when the director (Gil Junger) made this movie he wanted to make the plot come off similar but in modern times. He still made Katerina's character the shrew but she becomes tamed in a way that she actually gets feeling for a boy because her beautiful sister wanted a date. The modern movie was set at a high school because more people can relate to it.<br/><br/>I love this movie because the dialogue is so entertaining and it the whole movie is put together so well it drew me in the first time I watched it. I can relate to this movie because, I was in high school. I know how it can be with the people, who don't want to conform, or the people that think they are the prettiest, and even the ones who think they are the toughest and coolest kids in class. What Patrick did to Kat I think is completely wrong but he did make up for it in the end of the movie.

Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are both awesome (and will be together again in ""The Dark Knight""), David Krumholtz was a crazy surprise, and Miss Julia Stiles is just a delight.

"dallasryan","8","0","0","30 June 2012"," Charisma, Romance, Ledger, Icon Discussion
","I will talk about the movie a little bit in this review and then I will talk more about just Heath Ledger. First off, This is a very romantic and cute movie to watch. All the romance is genuine and terrific. The chemistry is really there with the two different couples(Ledger and Stiles, Oleynik and Gordon-Levitt) and you like the characters, you dislike the bad guys and it has one of the most romantic scenes in history where Ledger's character sings to Stiles' character on the Football field.<br/><br/>This is a classic and it's where I first noticed Heath Ledger. This is a movie where the character that Ledger plays should not be liked this much, and Ledger brought this character to such a deep level that only a great actor like Ledger could do. Only time will tell if Heath Ledger will become a Movie Icon, but I think it's fair to say with performances like this one and many others that he had, he most certainly will. <br/><br/>I think what makes a great movie icon is the fact that the actor/actress has to be a great actor(with a few exceptions) and they also have to have a lot of likability about them, which co-exists with good acting as well as co-exists with a certain humility about that actor/actress. A few examples are James Dean and John Wayne.<br/><br/>People forget John Wayne was a fantastic actor and he was such a cool guy and the same goes for James Dean as well. You could identify with Wayne and Dean through their extreme likability and great acting. Patrick Swayze wasn't the greatest actor but he had extreme likability, and I think over time he'll be a movie icon too. <br/><br/>And to kind of give an example more about the likability factor, in Heath Ledger's last film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, 4 actors played the same character(because Heath Ledger had passed away and 3 other actors did the part to finish up the film). All 4 actors were good in their own way. The 4 actors were Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell. Now Johnny Depp will be a Movie Icon, no doubt about that, he already kind of is. <br/><br/>But my point is, Heath Ledger was the only actor as the character in the movie, who would really let you in, really let you in to a part of his soul. The other 3 actors were great, but they had some distance to them, you could appreciate their acting, but you couldn't get into them as a person/a human being. Ledger had always been very charismatic with all his roles, and he didn't have distance, he always let the audience in close to him, into his soul almost, into his humanity and you never quite get that from Johnny Depp, Jude Law, or Colin Farell, all great actors, but they're always a little distant in all their roles, with the exception of Farell who will let you in with certain roles he's played. <br/><br/>I think Heath Ledger will be a great Movie Icon over time and he is also the big reason why 10 Things I Hate About You was such a great and special kind of movie. Heath Ledger let you into his humanity in this movie, and because of that, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't just your usual teeny bop, cheesy romance movie. It had some substance, it had some real driven emotions, sincere humanity and love to it. <br/><br/>You don't usually find that kind of substance within a film like this one, in this genre, but because of Heath Ledgers performance in particular and the other ones, 10 Things I Hate About You is a very romantic, very special and great movie to watch by yourself or with the girl or guy you love."

The main cast in this movie includes Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Larisa Oleynik, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This was Heath Ledger's breakout role. The movie is based on Shakespeare's play ""Taming of the Shrew"". Julia Stiles plays ""Kat"" the rebellious older sister. Larisa Oleynik plays ""Bianca"" the popular younger sister. Their father, who is played by Larry Miller, doesn't let the girls date because he doesn't want them to get pregnant. He is a little overbearing. Kat has no intention on dating, but Bianca wants to date. Therefore their father comes up with the plan that Bianca can't date until Kat does. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, the boy who likes Bianca. Heath Ledger plays Patrick, the bad boy in high school. Cameron comes up with a plan to get someone to date Kat so he can date Bianca. Little does he know that Bianca wants to date the popular guy ""Joey"" who is played by Andrew Keegan. Eventually Bianca realizes what a jerk Joey is and ends up falling for Cameron. Kat finds out about the plan and finds out that Patrick was paid to go out with her. Although Patrick was in it for the money in the beginning, he came to like Kat and everything turns out good in the end. Of course there are a few more characters involved in this plot. The movie has great dialogue and acting and includes a great cast. The movie is hilarious and has some twists and turns but is definitely a must see.<br/><br/>I was in high school when I first saw this in theatre and it immediately became my favorite movie. Although it is a teen flick, it definitely isn't like the other teen flicks of its time. It is more mature than the other ones like She's All That or American Pie. I would recommend it to anyone."

","This is an EXCELLENT movie. Sure, the plot wasn't the most original one. It was cliché, but for some reason, I still loved it! I mean, the way the movie was executed was just great. All the actors did a wonderful job. They all had great chemistry which made the movie very enjoyable. I found myself interested in both sisters' romances. I wasn't only rooting for Patrick and Kat. I found myself also rooting for Cameron and Bianca.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles had SO MUCH chemistry. I absolutely loved them together. They were very sweet with each other, but they were still very real. If I could pick out one of my favorite scenes to talk about, I'd talk about the date that they had. I loved their paintball date! I thought that it wasn't too formal or stuffy. It was just plain and simple, but still very fun. During this scene, it was like they weren't even acting. They were just having fun with it! That was great because this IS a rom-com movies for teens and in this scene, they were just that. Teenagers having fun.<br/><br/>When I was younger, I watched this movie, but never really understood it. As I grew older, I remember wanting to rewatch this movie again, but I couldn't remember the title. I felt very frustrated with myself. But I did remember one particular scene, though. (SPOILERS:) That one scene where Patrick serenades Kat out in the field. (/SPOILERS) Thanks to that scene and with the help of YouTube, I managed to figure out what the name of this movie was. This very well proves that this movie is a classic. Almost 12 years has passed since the release of this movie, but no one has forgotten that epic and heartwarming scene (SPOILERS:) where Patrick just forgets about everything puts himself out there for Kat. (/SPOILERS) While watching that scene, I had this huge smile on my face the whole time. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who felt that way. And YouTube can prove that with their many videos of this particular scene- one video with almost 7 million views!<br/><br/>I really don't know what else to say about this movie, except that it's great. It is truly an excellent movie that I doubt there's really anyone else in this world who hasn't watched it yet. If you're part of the minority who hasn't watched this movie yet, there's just one thing I want to ask you: ""What are you waiting for?!"" This was really a truly great movie and I'm pretty sure that it's on my top 10 favorite romantic comedy movies now."

","Knowing the unfortunate fate of Australian actor Heath Ledger (1979-2008), it now feels oddly nostalgic to view his breakout success movie 10 Things I Hate About You, even though I hadn't even seen it until just now. The story is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's famous play Taming of the Shrew set in a present day American high school: a new guy named Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) arrives in the school and instantly becomes attracted to a pretty girl named Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). Much to his chagrin, Bianca's overprotective father won't allow her to date any guy unless her hostile big sister Kat (Julia Stiles) also dates somebody. Together with his preppy friend Michael (David Krumholtz), Cameron devises a plan to get a handsome bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to persuade the smart and independent Kat into going out with him, so that Bianca would become available as well. However, Cameron is not the only guy after Bianca – a vain male model Joey (Andrew Keegan) is also keen on winning her heart.<br/><br/>Even though high school comedies are a cliché-heavy type of cinema and 10 Things doesn't exactly strive to reform the genre, it manages to feel pretty fresh considering its old building blocks (referring to high school movie conventions, not Shakespeare's writing). The colourful fashion and brightly lit locations, such as the castle-like Stadium High School, bring pleasant echoes from the 1990s, a decade I remember fondly. The obligatory scene of showing the new guy around and pointing out the rivaling social cliques is pretty amusing too, even more so than in average school movies. One notable big scene involving Ledger performing ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"" while fleeing security officers also belongs among the highlights of the tale.<br/><br/>Some energetic performances by the young cast help to maintain interest in the criss-crossing romances: I have always liked Julia Stiles' appearance that is somehow both strong and timid at the same time and she fits in the role of the sarcastic indie girl effortlessly. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Heath Ledger aren't given highly memorable roles, but they do what they can alright. This is why David Krumholtz frequently gets to steal the show as Cameron's talkative but socially awkward friend Michael, not to even mention Allison Janney's small role as Ms. Perky, the school's aptly-named guidance counselor and writer of erotic fiction.<br/><br/>To recap, the story is not highly imaginative and the ending is pretty cheesy, but many individual scenes earlier in the movie are fairly entertaining. A very obvious comparison can be made to another Shakespeare-in-school movie She's the Man (2006) starring Amanda Bynes: both films succeed decently in what they do, even if they are nothing groundbreaking. Gah, why am I being so apologetic about liking the movie? In the end, I think it is alright and recommend it to fans of its kind."

","Many words have been used to describe 10 Things I Hate About You. Not all good. I've seen predictable, fun, stereotypical, touching and so on. All of these might be true but the key to the film is that it will endear itself to you. In the decade since I saw it for the first time I have likely seen it dozens of times and every time I simply fall in love with it all over again. The fact that it is a brilliantly clever retelling of Shakespeare's Taming of The Shrew only helps solidify it as a really fun, and better than other teen type flicks of the nineties or any other decade. The characters make this film what it is. Fun loving, over the top, and a very diverse group of people that everyone will easily find a favourite or more than one favourite character. The cast works so well together, and the story moves at such a perfectly entertaining and hilarious pace that you will just enjoy every minute. The film has the demographic of mid to late teens in mind certainly but it doesn't try and treat the audience like kids. The film has plenty of gross out humour, tastefully used of course, and a crass feel to it but some sort of life lesson about romance and growing up is firmly in place.<br/><br/>The late Heath Ledger became a household name as the bad boy Patrick Verona with a heart of gold. Ledger is just absolutely charismatic in his role and is enough to make guys high five and girls swoon. I actually consider this character and Ledger's performance to be probably one of my favourite. Absolutely holding her own and matching Ledger's Verona shot for shot is the amazing Julia Stiles who gives probably her best performance or close to it as the vivacious, tempestuous Kat Stratford. Misunderstood, catty, angsty, brutally sarcastic and downright hilarious Stiles plays a strong willed, if not slightly flawed teenage girl who goes through a lot of growing up as a lot of the characters do. Stiles and Ledger are absolutely brilliant together and one of my all time favourite romantic comedy couples. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quiet and subtle and almost too adorable as Cam. Even though he isn't as bold and strong a character as some of the other he is easily the sweetest in the film and will be plenty of people's favourite. If Stiles is the perfect match with Ledger then the perfect match for Gordon-Levitt would be the equally as sweet Larisa Oleynik. She is first presented as extremely vapid and shallow but quickly gets far more depth and gets to grow up a lot in the film. She learns some valuable lessons and her and Stiles are terrific together as siblings. David Krumholtz is deliciously geeky as Cam's new best friend Michael. He's downright hilarious and has some truly amazing moments and gets to have some great romance in the end as well. Andrew Keegan is hilarious as the conceited teen model Joey and the object of Bianca's (Oleynik) affection...at first. He is a bit of a villain to the story but certainly never much of a challenge to anyone as he gets shown up time and time again. And finally the absolutely amazing and hilarious Larry Miller who plays Stiles and Oleynik's insanely over protective father. He is one of my favourite Dad's and is absolutely perfect. I will forever remember him in this role.<br/><br/>This cast just works so amazingly well together and everyone fits these perfect roles and brings them to life. Director Gil Junger has a ton of experience if not almost entirely from Television but in this case this isn't a bad thing whatsoever. He obviously has a great grasp on humour and knows how to tell a story. The cast works so well together and Junger should be given credit for putting them together. The writing team of Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz have gone on to write some incredibly fun scripts including Legally Blonde, The House Bunny, and She's The Man to name three of my favourite. They're stories are simply fun and hugely entertaining but I'm not sure they've done anything that meets the level of this absolute classic. It is one of my all time favourites and is fun from beginning to end. 9/10"

"flutesalad202","10","0","0","26 May 2010"," one of the best teen movies ever
","Ah, teen movies. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. We've all memorized the formula and the variables by now. Jocks, cheerleaders, outcasts, the boy/girl next door, or loners must overcome either social status, circumstances beyond their control, or the expectations of others, in order to win the prize, which is usually the heart of a particularly good-looking member of the opposite sex. Teen movies tend to be set in a high school, so that we get to see all of the above social groups together in action, and they tend to involve numerous elements of ""yeah rightlike that would ever really happen."" 10 Things I Hate About You has all of the above. <br/><br/>AND YET...this movie is amazing. Thanks to an excellent cast, fine performances, a good soundtrack, and above all, an amazingly witty script, 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the best teen movies around. Loosely based on William Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" this movie is a must-see. (No, I won't list ""10 Reasons I Love 10 Things I Hate About You. Although I'm sure I could name 10.) The story is fairly simple: new guy Cameron (variable: boy next door) comes to Padua High, where he is shown the ropes by former A/V god Michael (variable: geek). Cameron immediately spots the beautiful Bianca Stratford (variable: gorgeous shallow airhead), and immediately falls in love. There's only one problem: Bianca's overbearing protective OB/GYN father refuses to let her date until her sister Kat (variable: loner) dates. Male model Joey Donner (variable: jock) also wants to date Bianca, so he pays bad boy Patrick Verona (variable: bad boy) to date Kat. Of course, Patrick ends up falling for Kat, and Bianca blows off the sweet and perfect-for-her Cameron for the self-absorbed Joey, until Cameron illustrates the difference between a gentleman and a user, and it's revealed that Joey was just planning to nail Bianca at prom, if you know what I mean. Needless to say, Bianca learns her lesson, punches Joey in the face and chooses Cameron, and after their own share of relationship problems, which culminate in Kat's reading of her sonnet appropriately titled ""Ten Things I Hate About You,"" Patrick and Kat fall in love and no doubt end up living happily ever after. <br/><br/>Julia Stiles plays the female lead role of Kat Stratford, a high school senior with a reputation for being aloof and cold. She doesn't wear makeup or jewelry, likes girl bands and guitars, and doesn't give a damn what anyone thinks about her. She regards prom as an event where students ""get all dressed up, so some Drakkar Noir-wearing dexter with a boner can feel you up while you're forced to listen to a band that, by definition, blows."" Stiles delivers her sharp one-liner opinions and social observations with pitch-perfect sarcasm, and yet somehow manages to never let her audience forget that Kat is human and has a softer – maybe even vulnerable! – side. Stiles' role is a refreshing reminder to teens that ""you don't always have to be what they want you to be,"" and we never doubt that Kat truly doesn't care what other people think of her, and that she does what she wants for her own benefit.<br/><br/>Kat's sister Bianca, as played by the perfectly cast Larisa Oleynik, is the polar opposite. Bianca is beautiful and shallow, and ""happens to like being adored, thank you."" Oleynik portrays Bianca's shallowness and conceit perfectly, and yet we still like Bianca because she is still innocent and unaware of what a user Joey ""eat me"" Donner is. One of Oleynik's best moments is when Cameron calls her out on her selfishness; Bianca admits to being selfish and conceited, and her embarrassment and shame are evident without her saying a word. Though she isn't given as much to work with as Stiles, Oleynik manages to shine in her role.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast: Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James, David Krumholtz as Michael, Andrew Keegan as Joey, Larry Miller as Walter Stratford, and particularly Allison Janney as the guidance counselor, are simply superb. Heath Ledger's bad boy role softens as the movie progresses, until the guy who drilled a hole in Cameron's French textbook encourages him to pursue Bianca because he's ""ten times the man Joey is."" Gordon-Levitt is first-rate as the sweet boy-next-door Cameron, and his awkward sincerity and heart of gold are established from his first scene. Krumholtz and Keegan are perfect in their respective roles of geek and jerk, and Larry Miller and Allison Janney are simply sensational as the heads of the adult cast. Watch Janney's two-scene cameo in particular – you will be in awe of how hilarious this woman can really be. And finally, the script. Each line seems to have been injected with as much wit and hilarity as possible. Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have carefully sculpted almost every line to fit each particular character perfectly. The delivery and timing of each jab at teen society is brilliant. 10 Things I Hate About You has it all: a perfect cast, an incredible script, and an awesome soundtrack. See it now."
"badajoz-1","8","0","0","6 March 2010"," Really funny and charming
","A film to see over and over - twice in three days and I still laughed at the jokes (verbal and sight). The writing is sharp, the direction is crisp, the acting fresh and involving, and everyone plays just short of going over the top. Of course, it's based on the Bard's 'Taming of the Shrew', which will never get the feminist vote as one of his greatest plays, but the film does not baulk at a submission scene at the end. And for a US teen movie that is an incredibly brave decision, which pays off handsomely as the two leads play it brilliantly. So funny and vivacious, the plot line has a believably angry Kat facing an off kilter dude in the High School world of barely human weirdos, using the usual clichés and stereotypes to play off and against. It works far better than the other teen movies of the year - 'Clueless' OK, 'American Pie' lewd if funny and boring, 'She's All That' disappears halfway through its premise. A pity the stars have not quite gone on to great things - Heath Ledger was dragging himself back before his death, but would have been trapped into going over the top after 'The Joker.' They act well and can play different things, eg Julia Stiles. But enough said - buy the DVD and repeat your laughs!!!!"
"tacmovies","8","0","0","18 December 2009"," A Time Capsule of Stars
","Story: When updating Shakespeare, a strong story is virtually guaranteed, and this one doesn't let us down. It remains true to The Taming of a Shrew but doesn't feel terribly locked into an era. It should still be enjoyable in 20 years. A <br/><br/>Acting: Everyone brings the goods. Ledger, Stiles, Gordon-Levitt, and Oleynik all give memorable performances. A <br/><br/>Direction: It's almost shot like live theater, in that the takes are long instead of the usual quick cuts that get associated with modern cinema, and it works, largely because the actors were strong enough to make it work. B <br/><br/>Visuals: Nothing terribly memorable here. The dialog was the star of the movie and the visuals weren't bad, but they also weren't awesome. C <br/><br/>Overall: This movie is a lot of fun and it captured many stars in their younger years. Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have all gone on to make names for themselves, and this will be a testament to the fact that they've always been good. Heath Ledger fans should remember Heath as Joker and as Patrick Verona from this movie as I feel they are his best performances and they showcase his range as an actor, as Verona and Joker are so different that it takes a careful eye to notice that the same man portrayed them. You should see this movie and I give a B overall."

I've watched it a couple of times now and enjoyed it just as much. The sort of thing you would enjoy more watching with your boyfriend/girlfriend, its not really that much fun watching alone. Probably more of a girl's film, a lot of girls I know consider this film to be very good, but for me it's enjoyable anyway.

","Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) desperately wants to ask out Bianca (Oleynik) but she can only date when her moody and opinionated sister Kat (Stiles) is dating.<br/><br/>In this modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's Taming of the shrew, Gil Junger brings a subtle charm and sly comic romantic edge to the students' lives that should enable viewers of any age to sit back, chill and watch the comedy unwind.<br/><br/>This film is one of the few early films that would set the benchmark for future Hollywood stars Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. Both deliver the necessary components of teenage morale fibre to give the film a feisty chemistry without diving too much into the conventional side of the romance genre. Inevitably there is a formula that follows the usual guidelines but above all other modern day romantic comedies this is a high contender as it is dark and significantly likable.<br/><br/>The beginning shows us Cameron, the new student who gets shown the ropes by the humorous David Krumholtz and when we look at today's modern stereotypes, its quite interesting to see the way they were ten years ago. David's Michael shows us the list of the groups the teenagers form, from the geeks to the models and so forth. It's no Mean Girls as the stereotyping is settled relatively quickly as the plot moves up a gear.<br/><br/>The film really gets going when we see Cameron's lust towards Bianca and therein lays the complications. The bizarre implication of the sisters' dad deciding the rule if one dates then the other can date is initially strange but this opens up a can of rivalry with a thirst for emotional battles that are spicy with a strong dexterity of drama and equal comic value that says a lot for the plot's themes.<br/><br/>This is a film very much about rivalry and bitterness between people. From Patrick's (Ledger) feud with Joey (Andrew Keegan) and the sister's constant war of words this film justifies the genre and is plentiful to deal the drama when necessary.<br/><br/>There are obviously numerous teenage romantic comedies out there so you may wonder what this one has to offer say over American Pie or Cruel Intentions? Well unlike American Pie this has humour in the normal sense, one liners and funny spurts of craziness, from the motorbike on the hill to the drawing on the face. There is no crude violation of human nature here it is all down to earth. Like cruel intentions, this has a cool soundtrack with modern collection of pop songs adding spice with a more electric and vibrant motive. Not to mention Heath Ledger's ""I love you baby"" singing scene is one of the coolest romantic sequences to grace the screens for teens.<br/><br/>This film is also very well equipped with character establishment. Ledger's mysterious presence in the early stages is well equipped with bizarre rumours but he learns the value of honesty as he goes on whilst Kat learns that everyone isn't fighting against her. Stiles is well controlled to portray the intelligent opinionated mind of her protagonist."

","Looking back, this movie had a pretty (no pun intended) decent cast. The now deceased Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as front runners of course. It is a pretty good romantic teen comedy, that is pretty nice. And that's saying something, if you consider the fact, that it came out the same year, American Pie was.<br/><br/>While the latter was a pretty gross comedy, that still had heart to it, this is more the classical approach to a teen comedy. Something that hasn't been done that much after ""10 things..."" came out. Which obviously lies within the fact, that it's pretty easy to slide down the cliché road and wind up boring people more than entertaining them. But which also states the fact, that this is pretty decent and a nice addition to the teen rom-coms!"

","""Sweet"" Bianca can not date until her tempestuous older sister Kat does. So who can face her wrath? Why the guy with the worst reputation in school of course, with some monetary incentive. Only time will reveal what all of them are really like.<br/><br/>This is a truly brilliant adaptation of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", because it makes sense in the modern setting, is timeless, and adds even more than the Bard put into the original. This is a must-see for any parent to remind them of high school days and current pressures, and a must-see for teenagers to prevent some pitfalls of high school. Even though it is now 10 years old, everything still rings true, in an exaggerated way. But sometimes, that's the only way one can recognize things.<br/><br/>The direction just added to the already great script by allowing for the over-exaggerations in a realistic way, and by telling parts of the story WITHOUT dialogue. The sound track is critical to this film. (John Ford would have been proud!) This was the first film I saw both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger in. I knew quite a few years ago that they would both be huge stars because of their brilliant subtlety. (She is an Acedemy Award winning actress who just hasn't found the right vehicle yet.) It's years later, and I still love this movie and laugh even harder. (P.S. For me, high school was over 20 years ago.) Add another star if you are a Shakespeare nut."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","20 May 2009"," There are a few things to like about ""10 Things I Hate About You""
","If one thing is true about plot, you can rarely go wrong with Shakespeare. ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" based on the bard's comedy ""The Taming of the Shrew"" isn't exactly more than an homage to the theatrical classic, but it's a teen comedy from the '90s that sticks out because of its fresh quirkiness and good heart.<br/><br/>When Cameron (Gordon-Levitt, ""3rd Rock from the Sun"") arrives at Padua High School, he's easily smitten by Bianca (Oleynik, ""The Secret World of Alex Mack""), but word is that her strict father won't let her date anyone, especially if her older sister Kat (Styles) doesn't. So Cameron and his friend Michael (Krumholtz) conspire to trick self-centered jock Joey (Keegan), who also has the hots for Bianca, to pay off local bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to take out Kat so that Bianca will be available.<br/><br/>""10 Things"" assembles an impressive cast of young talent. Ledger and Stiles are the highlights. Despite the fact that the script calls for their relationship to make no actual sense, they manage to sell you by just acting together on screen. In honesty, what the script lacks in practicality, it makes up for in charm, a charm it couldn't pull off without Stiles and Ledger.<br/><br/>For another thing, the movie is not filmed like a typical teen comedy. In this way it's both better and not as good. It feels more like a TV show, not a surprise because director Gil Junger has made a career directing TV sitcoms. Junger likes to choose strategic camera angles, especially in more comedic scenes, emphasizing the film's sense of humor. There is a whole comedy element based on the characters not minding their surroundings or making clever remarks. Junger keeps the camera where he thinks these jokes will be most amusing. <br/><br/>The script he works with is very teen drama and definitely accurate in a sad sort of way though definitely exaggerated at times. Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz definitely come across as rookie writers with some really good ideas. Between some of Junger's work and the talented young cast, there's a lot to smooth over the bumps in ""10 Things"" to make for a satisfying and not too over-the-top romantic teen comedy. It doesn't avoid clichés, but it works with them better.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Visit my blog at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/"

","Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a shy, somewhat dorky, but good-hearted new guy at Padua High School in Washington State. He falls head over heels for Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), a somewhat vapid popular girl who is not allowed to date by her father (Larry Miller) until her older sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) does. Sadly for Bianca - who is also the target of sleazy jock Joey's (Andrew Keegan), er, affection - Kat is a man-hating feminist rebel, so there's no way in hell of that happening, right? However, Joey, Cameron, and popularity-craving Michael (David Krumholz) hatch a scheme to convince the school ""bad boy"" Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Kat - and of course, things don't go quite according to plan.<br/><br/>I went into this movie not expecting to like it; to say I'm not a fan of the teen movie genre is a huge understatement. The main reason I watched it is because a lot of my friends at school liked it, so I decided, what the hell? Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I really appreciate the fact that ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" is, for the most part, a notch above most teen comedies. While its plot is cliché, it is lacking in gross-out/scatological humor (there's some but not an excessive amount). I appreciate the comparatively intelligent humor, and the very well-written script and characters. I loved Patrick's song-and-dance number at the soccer practice - perhaps the funniest scene I've yet seen in a teen film - and Katrina's sparring with her English teacher (Daryl Mitchell) over Hemingway, Shakespeare, and related topics (I do similar things at school so I really appreciated that). The ties to ""The Taming of the Shrew"" didn't really catch my interest - I mean, you can only stay so faithful to Shakespeare in a modern-day high school setting, though I appreciated the effort.<br/><br/>The big problem I usually have with teen comedies, past and present, is that I find it hard to relate to any of the characters. The ""American Pie"" films feature teens who obsessed with sex and nothing else. And while that subject is certainly on the minds of teens quite frequently, with school, college, extracurriculars, etc., it certainly isn't the ONLY thing we think about. (If ""American Pie"" was funny I'd be more willing to let that slide, but that's another review.) Even movies like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Footloose"" which feature less clichéd teenagers don't really engage me.<br/><br/>However, with ""Ten Things"", while I couldn't personally relate to any of the film's characters - I'm probably closest to Cameron, though the odds of my getting a girl like Bianca are slim to nil - I was able to sympathize with them, perhaps because they didn't spend the whole film ejaculating into a pie or talking about it afterward. They were all believable characters, and ones I can recognize from school. I've known many, many girls who are like Kat, and so hers was probably the most believable of all.<br/><br/>The film's depiction of adults is not too bad, and that's always a plus for me. It's not a big deal, but I don't like the fact that most kid/teen movies portray adults as martinets or idiots. Mr. Straford is strict and somewhat dorky, but at least we get to see he has his daughters' best interest at heart. And the characters of Mr. Morgan (Daryl Mitchell) the black militant English teacher and Ms. Perky (the always-wonderful Allison Janney), the sex-obsessed guidance counselor, provide amusing scenes, brief though their appearances are.<br/><br/>The acting is not ""Paul Scofield holding a skull"" (to quote Roger Ebert), but it's good enough for the material. Julia Stiles creates a very believable character as Kat, a tough outsider who is at heart an insecure girl with inner demons to combat. Heath Ledger is also a standout as Patrick, the bad boy who's really not so bad. Larisa Oleynik, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Andrew Keegan, David Krumholz, Susan May Pratt and Gabrielle Union all create believable characters, though they're somewhat overshadowed by the leads. Larry Miller, Daryl Mitchell, and Allison Janney do fine work with fairly two-dimensional characters, but then the story's not really about them, is it? <br/><br/>""Ten Things I Hate About You"" deserves credit for transcending the teen movie genre and just being a really pleasant and enjoyable film. It isn't nasty, it isn't too gross or vulgar, and its only sin is its (understandable) regression to age-old clichés (how many times do we need to see a romantic bet turn into real love?). To quote Ebert again, ""One of the pleasures of going to movies is to meet nice people."" By that score, ""Ten Things"" is a triumph.<br/><br/>7/10"

","On his first day, Cameron (Joseph Gordon Lewitt) falls head over heels for the most popular girl in school, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) who seems to quietly reciprocate his feelings. The problem is that Bianca is not allowed to date until her older anti-social sister Kat (Julia Stiles) does because their father is overbearing and, let's face it, pretty mental. Determined to win Bianca over, Cameron thus sets up a payment-plan for the school badboy- and outcast Pat (Heath Ledger) to take her 'difficult' sister out. So begins a romantic piece of characters, promises and hidden intentions, all escalating to an enjoyable teen mess.<br/><br/>Classic Shakespearean stories typically translate well on screen. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of them, but it is glazed with a lush modern High School movie coating. The result is a sensationally creative comedy that keeps you laughing and engrossed throughout. It features some viciously quotable dialogue, in particular from the quick mouth of Julia Stiles' character but also the token black teacher who is fed up with white prissy students in his class never having any 'real' problems. The film occasionally falls prey to predictable sappiness, especially toward the end, shifting to Hollywood auto-pilot. I don't want to use the word 'cliché' here because as far as teen comedies go, 10 Things I Hate About You was made just before the grand influx of similar-natured films, making it fairly original. However, yes, it does feature some very recognizable teen scenarios.<br/><br/>10 Things I Hate About You can proudly boast of being Heath Ledger's claim to fame, in his original Aussie accent. This film also welcomes a refreshingly funny Julia Stiles, vaulting her into the world of respectable films. On some basic level, teen comedies nearly always satisfy me. But 10 Things I Hate About You is not only satisfactory, but it is excellent. 8/10"

","There was a lady interviewed in the Enron movie, The Smartest Guys in the Room¸ who said something to the effect of ""For me the only mythology really is high school mythology."" That sentiment resonates with metoo a very large extend, my high school experience is my own mythIf all of my experience prior to high school is the Genesis of my life, then high school is the equally important, perhaps more important, Exodus of my life. Ten Things I Hate about You also appreciates the mythical potential of a high school story, with its icons, the immensity of the protagonist's investment in his desired object, the emotional intensity of the conflict, it's all there, not as good as in Say Anything, but then again, this is, at least in the explicit sense, more of a high school movie than Say Anything, though Say Anything represents the more intense impressions that I associate with my high school years. The implications of how it is most natural to translate Shakespeare's plays into high school stories is connected to the mythical potential of those stories."

","This is one of the best movies, I love it. I loved all of the references to Shakespeare without making it boring. Patrick Verona, the Stratford girls, The taming of the shrew references and so many more. It was such a nice movie to show relationships between teenagers and groups, but also between siblings and parent/child. I really enjoyed the 'realistic' English teacher, Mr. Morgan and his interactions with the students. I think that for teenagers, they all did a good job and the two leads, Julia and Heath have gone on to do additional pictures that are well done. I could watch this movie over and over again and still laugh at all the funny lines."

","This is the best teen-movie of all times. Period. There have been numerous efforts to make equally good movies of this kind after this movie (most of them starring Freddie Prince Jr), but without even getting close. This is the story of a high-school girl, Katarina (Julia Stiles), who, after being let-down once decides not to date again. Ever. It is a set-up by the Casanova of the school, who wants to lay hands on Katarina's sister, that after many twists and turns allows Katarina to once again trust a guy...Only to be let-down again. Stiles' performance is great, probably her best, and Heath Ledger convinces in the part of the bad-boy. Larisa Oleynik is perfectly sweet and naive as the sister. As in every American teen movie, everything is a bit too cute, but still it's not too much. The ending is predictable, but not in any way bad. The Shakespearean undertone is also very typical. Most of you will still love the very slimy, though quite smart, ending where Stiles reads her poem about hatred... :) Teenmovies are not meant to be perfect in anyway, but the the minor flaws in this movie are outnumbered by the many great moments. The AP-movies were great, but this is as close to perfection it gets as far as teen-movie-making goes. 8+/10"

When Kat (Julia Stiles) got her makeover, I thought she looked good, especially in the clothing she wore after that point in the movie. However, I thought she was an absolute b**** for the most part! This was because of her attitude and the way she treated other people. If you ask me, the rule about dating that Mr. Stratford (Larry Miller) had set was so silly. That is so unfair!

","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is not as cleverly written as ""Clueless"" in modernizing a classic. <br/><br/>But leads Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger (he of TV's ""Roar"" on Fox a couple of years ago) have wonderful chemistry that carries the movie (and into the out takes over the credits).

"xxxlittlemillyxxx","9","0","0","18 September 2005"," 'Ten Things I Hate About You' - Film review
","'Ten Things I Hate About You' was made in 1999. Directed by Gil Junger and written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik it was a widely successful movie with an entertaining storyline loosely based on Shakespeare's comedy 'The Taming Of The Shrew.<br/><br/>Although the film follows the stories of several different characters it is mainly based around Kat (Julia Stiles) who is the difficult older sister of the beautiful and very popular Bianca (larisa Oleynik) who's father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister does. When Cameron (joseph Gordon-Levitt) starts the first day of his new school he instantly falls in love with Bianca. However he has some tough competition from the overwhelmingly egotistical Joey (Andrew Keegan), but he shows that he is substantially more intelligent than the unbearably vain Joey and forms a clever plan involving Trailer park rebel Patrick (heath Ledger) and tricks Joey into helping him get the girl.<br/><br/>However this film is more than your usual clichéd teen movie. The storyline and script have a genuine depth which demands more of the viewer than most other films in this genre. The characters are wonderfully played by top quality actors and actresses who play their parts with amazing insight into the characters and how they are portrayed to the audience.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film because not only is the main character female, she is also an extremely strong and intelligent person who is never afraid to express her own views and feelings. The fact that she is not your average teen-movie dumb-blonde type or completely gorgeous and impossibly popular also helps people relate much more easily to the character and makes you want to get to know her. I particularly admired her witty comebacks to any insults from people who disagreed with her less than conventional attitude to her social life and popularity. This character is a particularly good role model as although she made mistakes she learnt from them and never let any 'guy', or anybody else take advantage of her again. <br/><br/>This film is also very different to most of it's genre as the script and storyline are extremely intelligent and well put together. It is an excellent modern adaptation of a classic play which hopefully would encourage more teenagers to be willing to enjoy the works of Shakespeare, and help them realise that the aim of his writing was to entertain and that his plays were certainly not written to be taught in schools. It also carries on the comedy genre of Shakespeare's play as the film is genuinely extremely funny. This is exaggerated by the fast pace of the film and the witty jokes and comments from characters. The screenwriters manage to successfully retain Shakespeare's original sophisticated aim and similar morals are communicated to the audience, along with added ones which are more relevant to teenagers today. The blend of old and new ideas works surprisingly well and enhances the quality of the film, making it modern but classic at the same time.<br/><br/>My favourite part of this film is where Patrick sings 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' to Kat in front of a playing field full of his fellow students. The band starts playing along to the tune and everyone stops to watch. Now in your average teen-movie this would be unbearably sleazy but in 'Ten Things I Hate About You' it is made hilariously funny when Patrick runs around after policemen, who are attempting to restrain him, and slaps their bottoms. The swift movements of the camera in all directions and the jaunty camera angles in this scene exaggerate the humour and everything from the huge idiotic grin on his face to his sarcastic run adds to this effect and gives this scene two very positive qualities: humour and romance. <br/><br/>The only part of this film which disappointed me is the ending. Like most other teenage movies this film of course ends with a prom. For such a thoroughly entertaining and quite unpredictable film this is an extremely discouraging ending which seems to have had very little thought or enthusiasm at all put into it. A prom seems to be the easy way out of your typical teen movie and i certainly expected much more from a film with such an admirable and creative storyline. The audience should by now be expecting a huge ending with humour and fast movement which sums up the rest of the film with a huge bang, but instead we are left feeling duly disconcerted with this totally uninspiring choice of ending. <br/><br/>Although the clichéd ending does not spoil an otherwise excellent film, it left me feeling unfulfilled and disappointed and the experience was not as it could have been if the ending was just a little more inventive."

","First I had this movie on tape and watched it over and over again, after some time I bought the DVD and now I'm still not bored. The story isn't very complicated, but it doesn't need to be, because it's a sit-back-and-have-fun romantic comedy. Cameron is in love with Bianca, but her dad has a rule about dating: no dating till you graduate. Later on he rewrites it to: Bianca can date if Katherina (her sister) dates.The only problem is: Kat is ""a bit"" antisocial. After a while Cameronand his friend Michael find the perfect date for Kat: Patrick. They say he ate a duck when it was alive, he was in prison, sold his liver and stuff like that. But because Cameron and Michael know Patrick won't listen if they say: ""hi, you have to date Kat!"", they approach Joey,the most popular guy in school, who wants Bianca too, just as a toy.Michael says it's a win-win situation: he gets to date Bianca and Michael is cool by association (If Joey says hi to Michael in the hallor something). Joey talks to Patrick, gives him money for a date. Now Cameron can try to seduce Bianca, but off course also something happensbetween Kat and Patrick. I'm not gonna say how it ends, but I think you already guessed it.<br/><br/>The story is cool, it's written by Shakspeare (Taming the shrew). I think Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are great actors and the music is fun too (Letters to Cleo, Save Ferris). My message is: Watch '10 things' and you'll have a great time!"

This movie has obviously had a lot of thought put into it and deserves good ratings! I think that Julia Stiles really takes the part well and really shows off the 'stroppy teen' part excellently. I think Heath Ledger makes clear that Patrick is a mean boy...but softens up when he starts to love Kat. All the actors have worked so hard at the film and really showed the expression. I do not much like teen movies with a couple of exceptions...but this is one that you can watch over and over again without getting bored! There are not many films like that and this has got to be one in a million! Each time you watch it...you find something else that you didn't see before. My favourite part is when you find out about Kat's past with Joey...how once she used to be a normal teen. It was only after that that she started to be an individual and stand up for what she believes in. A real clever piece of work. Well Done!"

"kola_dom","Null","0","0","6 December 2004"," A Satisfying Teen Comedy
","'10 Things I Hate About You', which relies heavily on Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew', is a very satisfying teen comedy with fresh dialogue and a modern unique charm. This motion picture casts Julia Stiles as the moody, head-strong Stradford sister Katerina whose younger sister's, Bianca's 'fate' lies in her hands - too bad for the younger sister. Single father Mr. Stradford made a rule that Bianca isn't allowed dating until she graduates (this rule is for Katerina also, but doesn't effect her much as you will see in the movie). Dad eventually gets a new inspiration however - Bianca's not allowed to date until Kat does. Dad, knowing that Kat will refuse to do this until snowmen can dance, thinks that he will have a longer time to not worry about his daughters. However, since Bianca is eye candy to many of the boys at school, a particular student (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) decides to finally get a date for Kat, knowing that he can date Bianca thuswise. 'Dangerous' and risk-taking senior (Heath Ledger) is then asked to date Kat, with generous compensation in advance. Though the plot may seem thin, which it is in some respects, this entertaining teen comedy manages to move along with near ease. The characters are likable, in spite of their shallowness, and the movie itself manages to keep the audience entertained. A must-see! Rating: 3 1/2 out of Five Stars."

","`10 Things I Hate About You' begins as all teen movies should, with a tour around the high school, someone pointing out the various groups (i.e., stoners, geeks, athletes) for our amusement.  This may be the perfect set up; nearly everyone goes to high school and every school has cliques. Grounding us in the familiar is a fair way to prepare us, as high school didn't, for what is about to come.<br/><br/>	Reconstituting the theme (and it could use a rewrite) developed by no less a teen story author than William Shakespeare in `Taming of the Shrew', we find that a father has two daughters of which the youngest cannot date until the elder one has done the same.  Since the older (Kat, played by Julia Stiles) is an asocial asexual head case, it seems unlikely any boys will get a shot at the far more desirable younger sister (Bianca, as portrayed by Larisa Oleynik).  And so the fun begins as a bevy of young men contrive to have school bad-boy legend Patrick (Heath Ledger) hook up with Kat.<br/><br/>	As it plays out, no real surprises occur.  But the shenanigans and complications which arise as Pat woos Kat and Cameron (Joe Gordon) sets his sights on Bianca are more than pleasantly wrought.  In fact watching each rite of passage (house party, prom) is a treat, more than can be credited to most teen flicks.      <br/><br/>	After a house party which both sisters attend, we see a dramatic thawing of Kat, but not such a change that she is willing to offer a good night kiss to Pat.  And so it goes that Pat, initially repulsed (strictly in it for the money) by Kat will move her; nonetheless, she does make it a hard road for him all along the way.<br/><br/>	The film breaks down a bit when Pat croons to Kat at soccer practice and plumbs even lower depths when Kat springs Pat from detention.  But these are small departures from the overall dynamic.  Credit Director Gil Junger - this is his first feature film effort  with putting together a good script (not heavy on the Shakespeare, rapid fire comedic touches delivered with almost no letup) and the kind of actors that can carry off the pace and look good in the bargain.  Junger has been a fixture in television for years, having directed for no less than 17 series  as diverse a lot as `Dharma and Greg', `Nurses' and `The Jeff Foxworthy Show'.<br/><br/>	As to the supporting cast, there really is no one to not like.  In particular Michael (played by veteran David Krumholtz) is great as kind of a sidekick-AV nerd to Joseph Gordon and just watching the former introduce Cameron around the new school as the movie begins is worth seeing.  And Michael delivers the set up to the best line in the movie in the lunch line (Pat's response is perfect).  <br/><br/>	Since this is a comedy, and one that makes no bones about its intent, the acting is suitably droll, at times fleetingly clever but always a shade light.  But hearing Julia Stiles deliver the `10 Things' of the movie title is sufficient reward for those seeking some real acting.  In no other moment are the actors required to show anything of a serious nature.  But as has been mentioned, Shakespeare is the originator of the story, making one wonder:  Has there really been an onslaught of Shakespearian-themed movies more recently as critics suggest?<br/><br/>	Let's look at some numbers.  Using only the key word Shakespeare in searching archival plot summaries, one comes up with the following:<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes (# of Hits by Era) - 2000-04 (6) 90's (72) 80's (26) 70's (10) 60's (12) 50's (14)<br/><br/>IMDB (# of Hits by Era) - 2000-04 (21) 90's (34) 80's (13) 70's (9) 60's (3) 50's (5)<br/><br/>	However the plot summaries address (or don't address) Shakespearean themes, these searches suggest there are a lot more movies somehow tied to The Bard now than there were then, to put a loose term to it.<br/><br/>Rating: Three Stars.<br/><br/>	 ¹ - Taming of the Shrew - Induction  Line 135"

","This is an AMAZINGLY witty movie in my opinion. It is a remake of Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew"" but modernized wonderfully. The main character, Kat Stratford(Stiles) is a rebellious teenager who doesn't care at all what other people think about her. Her sister, Bianca Stratford(Oleynik)could not be more different. She is a popular, adored, and self centered teen who loves being a girlie girl. The new kid, Cameron (Levitt) immediately falls in love with Bianca. But alas, the Stratford sister's father is an extremely uptight, paranoid man who is deathly afraid of his daughters getting impregnated, and so has set a rule that Bianca cannot date until Kat starts dating. So now, Cameron has decided to come up with a plan to hook up Kat with the school's extreme bad boy, Patrick Verona(Ledger). <br/><br/>This movie is one of the funniest movies, and my friends and i totally love it.

","Yes, I know what you are thinking¯just another mawkish film for teenage girls. Maybe you're right, but not everything in life has to be in-depth, philosophical thinking. Besides, if you're one of those persons who think that a film is worth seeing only if it conveys some kind of important message, you'll be surprised to find some interesting things in this film. It tells us about the lives of some students in their last years at high-school and, of course, you'll be able to enjoy the typical sickly sweet romances and the famous US balls at the end of the academic year. But, in fact, for me it's essentially the story of Kat, one of the main characters, who shows us that it's possible to be mature (and so charmingly different!) even living among a bunch of childish teenagers. The preppy girl's club (leaded by Kat's sister), the archetypal bully (who will try to get Kat to go out with him 'just' for money), the shy new boy. and Kat, just a different girl who is aware of the importance of education and who¯and this is the slushy part of the film¯ will eventually find the magic of love. Not to miss: the sound track, with Save Ferris, The Cardigans and the funniest version of 'Can't take my eyes off you' I've ever listened to!"

The story is well-written and the acting is good. I loved the scene where Bianca was getting told-off in the car after the party.  The scene where Heath Ledger is singing ""Can't take my eyes off you"" to Julia Stiles in the stadium was also hilarious.  An above-average teen movie with some depth.  8/10."
"vertigo_14","8","0","0","13 April 2004"," Funny, she doesn't look Shrewish.
","I was surprised with this movie. Finally, a modern teen movie of some merit, not all the obnoxious themes and insipid story lines. I wouldn't mind, however, seeing a teen movie in which the characters don't live in massive upper-middle class homes and attend schools that span a city. Can't the folks in these movies just survive without a Rob Reiner-esque neighborhood?<br/><br/>
While so many reviews have been posted already, there's no point in going into much detail about the plot, as it does get quite involved. Based on Shakespear's Taming of the Shrew, the movie is a romantic comedy about hard lessons learned by it's young characters. Appearances aren't always everything, you know. It is quite a sincere movie, actually showing intelligent teenagers working out their own kinks while in search of true love, and not boggled down by two hours of simply trying to get laid (though that may be Joey Donner's (Andrew Keegan) sole motive for living).<br/><br/>
It's quite a funny movie that introduced me to both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger. Levitt, Oleynik, Keegan, and Krumholtz have been performing since they were kids. Since this movie, I find it interesting that Stiles has appeared in quite a few other Shakespeare adaptations. Nonetheless, the movie has a lot of fresh faces, a good soundtrack (if only they put that techno song just before the real party starts at Bogie's on the CD).<br/><br/>
Anyways, it's a movie that is well worth seeing, especially when you've had enough servings of your crap teen comedies these days."

","Simply a masterpiece.  Yes, this isn't the epic, artsy critically acclaimed type movie that is so often supposed to be the ones we like.  There are no academy award winning actors here, and isn't the typical movie a person would call a masterpiece.  Regardless of this however, I would recommend `Ten Things' to anyone in an instant.  In the saturated, gigantic and sometimes seemingly overpopulated genre of teen movies, this one not only stands out, but does so in brilliant fashion.  This is the greatest teen movie of all time.  The well know Julia Stiles is perfect for her part.and being able to watch the absolutely, beautiful, gorgeous Larisa Oleynik is worth the price of admission and cost of DVD itself.  It is sad this is Larisa's only major role, and we are all poorer for it, for to me Larisa is the most beautiful to ever live. For outright wonderful entertainment and a good watch, `Ten Things' is flawless."

","This is one of the relatively few romantic comedies that are actually based on a good premise, and, as such, it's watchable for guys too. It's very funny, the humor is well-placed and perfectly timed. The romantic scenes aren't sappy or boring. The chemistry works out pretty well between the actors; you actually believe that these characters would get together, realistically. I read that it's based on Shakespeare's ""the taming of the shrew""; now, since I haven't read that, I can't comment on how good the movie is compared to it, but as far as I know, the basic idea and theme is the same, as is most of the plot, and, considering that, it's a very good modernization of the story. The plot is good and involving, you are interested in what happens to these characters. The acting is all good. The script is well-written, and allows for the characters to be in some very funny scenes. The humor is directed at teens, but it isn't crude or offending, except for a few scenes, and even then, it's not too bad. I found it interesting how the focus completely shifted, in the last part of the film... the lead characters became supporting ones, whilst ones that were supporting before are now leads. I leave answering the question of whether or not this is true to Shakespeare's original text(or at least in the general spirit of him) up to those who have read his work. A good comedy for teens to watch, probably good for teen couples too. I recommend this to most people who enjoy teen comedies. 7/10"

As the climax of the movie, I cannot see how anyone could miss the 10 points she states.<br/><br/>Although a truly unrealistic movie with the personalities involved, it does show every possible exaduration from the horny guidance counselor to the unique composition of the literature class, to the overprotective father who believes more in the following of rules than the spirit of that rule.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a classic satire on teenage life."

Unfortunately too many of the characters are written as stereotypes of what the writers think teenagers are supposed to be like. We have all seen these characters many many times before.

","10 Things.. is honestly a very honest and genuine representation of teenage life. I saw the movie thinking that it would be like ""She's All That"" which is a great teen movie. I left feeling that it surpassed its predecessors.<br/><br/>
The movie follows the story of the Shakespeare classic ""The Taming of the Shrew."" Now, I personally do not like Shakespeare, due to the overemphasis on his ""brilliance"" which probably only caught on in his time due to the lack of any originality of his period. But, the story of a tough girl whose sister cannot marry or date until her sister takes a suitor, does provide an interesting opportunity for a contriving plot.<br/><br/>Bianca Stratford, a prissy, uptight princess wants to be Miss Popularity, and in today's society, that means going out and selling your soul to the popular kids. Only, Kat, her ""evil"" sister is very liberal in her pursuit of a unpopular lifestyle paradox. The rest of the story is contrived on a bet involving an outcast, Patrick Verona, to begin dating Kat in order for Joey Dahmer, the classic dumb jock/model, to ""land"" Bianca.<br/><br/>
The movie has some great moments, including a serenade of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" from Patrick (Heath Ledger) to Kat in order to win over her heart. As well as Bianca beating the crap out of a Joey when she realizes her stupidity in his intentions. The humor is up-to-date and is still quoted amongst teenagers with lines including ""There's a difference between like and love. I mean I like the sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack."" and ""I know you can overwhelmed and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed? I think you can in Europe.."" It's stupid comedy on Bianca's part, but smart sarcastic retorts from Kat (Julia Stiles).<br/><br/>Definitely recommend if you haven't already seen. It makes you laugh and what is better than that?"

","As the setting of the film would make You except seeing just another teen-movie, this one had a magical spark. There's a reason for that Shakespeare's plays are still popular and appreciated. The themes just never die.<br/><br/>This one's a love story, but it also makes observations about the human character. Kat has grown a shell to protect her from the world outside. Pat Verona helps her to come out and to show her real and fragile personality. What comes to the love story... the biggest flaw was that the story of Kat and Pat didn't grow to it's full potential. The director should have concentrated purely on that instead of trying to show also the story of Kat's sister. To carry on with both stories, the movie should've been 20-30 minutes longer, but then again it would've been too long for it's target group: females 14-20. Anyway, Shakespeare - being a rebel of his time - would have loved this adaptation, just like I did."

","This film, being a modern remake of The Taming of the Shrew, already had a great plot thrust upon it. Some critics say that it was too predictable but, if one thinks about it, so was most of Shakespeare so that was not a problem in my opinion. The main actors were Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles and they were both excellent playing their roles, but I felt that the most praise should have gone to Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford. She normally plays an age range of about 14-18 and her rendition of the self centered Bianca was outstanding. Being an 18 year old at the time, she slid into the role with exceptional ease but it is unlikely that she will become as big as the two main actors. Gordon-Levitt also played his role well and their was chemistry between them because of the past roles on Third Rock From the Sun that they had. Overall it was a brilliant piece of work from all involved. It will probably act as a starter film for Stiles and Ledger but I hope that the directors out there don't forget the roles that Oleynik and Gordon-Levitt played. Remember, there are no small roles, only small actors."

Either way, he looks young enough to pull off a 17 year old. Also, this time one of the main characters is a typical teen for a reason - while we think she's just a moody girl, it turns out that she has an excuse for why she is that way. Phew, at last a cure!

","Gil Junger (and naturally the screen writers, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith) have pulled off the impossible; they have made a smarter, sassier and altogether more likeable version of the Bard's ""The Taming of the Shrew"", up-dating it to an American High School on the eve of the millennium.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the nostalgic factor, (yeah, this was the High School 'prom' I went to here in Ireland some 30 years ago) but I think more appropriately it was a combination of terrific direction, great dialogue and first-rate acting (Heath Ledger has already proved his worth but Larisa Oleynik and David Krumholtz surely have major futures ahead of them) that made this such a pleasureable experience.<br/><br/>It isn't every Shakespearean play that lends itself to a modern up-dating (just because HE wrote it dosen't mean YOU have to do it) but one thing Americans are good at is comedy and the great one-liner (not to mention rock n'roll, of which this has a terrific smattering) and ""10 Things ..."" rocks, rolls and bounces with the best of them.

I do find it odd when movies insist on having high schools be the size of castles (in 10's case, you can take that literally. They actually do learn in a mother freezin' castle!), but what ya gonna do? Also, the story is just about the same as the one from She's All That, but doesn't involve the dark girl becoming a prom queen. The characters simply just want to date one another, which makes more sense (prom queen is not necessarily a role that EVERYONE cares about and scrutinizes over in the real world).

","This was a good adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew,' far better than 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'Midsummer Night's Dream.'  To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed the film more than I enjoyed reading the play. This may be an awful and controversial thing to say, but I thought the characters were developed well and the story was just much more entertaining.  The male roles were done well, but the best part of the film was Julia Stiles as Kat.  She was great and I think she is simply gorgeous. She makes the film what it is."

","Frankly, I thought this movie had the most ridiculous movie title, and thus I initially had no intention of seeing it.  However, after one of my best friends encouraged me to go see this with him (he already saw it), I went along.  It is definitely the best movie I've seen all year.  So it's not the deepest movie in the world (I minored in philosophy), but as a young high school teacher, I can tell you that this is as close as Hollywood will ever get in the mind set of a real high school situation.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone in high school are as articulate as the characters were in this movie, but the situations and ""cliques"" as as real as it gets. Don't go see this movie if you are/were really bitter about your own high school experience, or can't take a joke.  This movie will be even more enjoyable if you know American pop culture, esp. pop culture in the media.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

I am so tired hearing about Sarah Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, and the huge group of folks trying to be the new brat pack (which I am not impressed too much by either).<br/><br/>I was surprised how much fun I had.  This is a silly little brainless romp. So what if there are some cliches, like the new guy getting prepped on where certain obligatory cliques hang out and what they do.  Also, the actors don't really look and truly act like teenagers  The whole was more than the sum of the parts.  The colors were bright and the scenery was nice.  I would have given anything to have gone to a high school that looks like a castle. The ocean view was gorgeous too.<br/><br/>Kat is a girl that is the obligatory ""bitch"".  She is the Bikini Kill listening, riot girl acting, feminism spouting, girl from hell.  I found her portrayal to be a little too predictable.  I could see her comebacks coming a mile away.  I think this makes sense though.  We find out later that this is all just affectation.  All teenage ""outrageous"" behavior can be boiled down to affectation.  Kat is tough, but not the cliche she pretends to be.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is good.  They did a pretty good job breaking down all the facets of high school life.  The kid from 3rd Rock From the Sun did a good job portraying the most accessible kid, we can understand him the most. My favorite character in the entire movie was the only adult that had a major part.  Kat's dad was really funny.  His overreactions to his daughters trying to have a life are hilarious and understandable.  His character was the closest to being complex.<br/><br/>By now everyone knows that this movie was based on The Taming of the Shrew, which I'll admit is one of the Shakespeare plays that I have never read. You could see it coming through in the classic battle of the sexes.  The writers were way to heavyhanded trying to get the original writer of the story across.  Padua High? Kat Stratford? Patrick Verona?  Why didn't they just have a character named Roman Juliette?  High schoolers these days probably need such obviousness though.<br/><br/>All these things put aside I couldn't remain snobby about this movie and left with a smile on my face."

","Teen flicks are a drug.  I've come to realize that when I go to see a movie like ""She's All That"" or ""10 Things"", it's not because I think the story will be particularly interesting, or even because the leading actresses are gorgeous (though they are), it's because I know that I'll leave the theater feeling giddy and charmed.  ""10 Things"" and ""She's All That"" are extremely similar premises:  money is offered to turn the female school outcast normal, only to have the boy and girl fall in love.  The twists are few and the ending predictable, and yet I find myself interested in these characters and the high school environment that they live in.  ""10 Things"" has its humorous bits and its touching moments, but mostly it's just enjoyable to watch these surprisingly talented high school actors interact.  It may miss by throwing in a few to many trite teen-flick scenes--a school-wide party, a climactic prom scene--but the characters are warm enough to make us care.

","Pulling in over $8 million opening weekend, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is not your typical under-rated movie. Most of the time, people wouldn't see a movie because of its poor ratings but this one, I made an exception. That exception was no mistake either! A romantic comedy, wonderfully adapted by Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" is a movie that has everything. This movie is hysterical the whole way through from the wacko guidance counselor to an obsessive, over-protective father. This movie gives you only a slight preview of the next wave of teen stars. The hot and beautiful Julia Stiles (NBC's The 60's) and the glamourous and attractive Larisa Oleynik act out their parts as completely opposite sisters wonderfully. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (TV's 3rd Rock From The Sun) and Heath Ledger, two very talented young actors do everything they can and can't do to pursue these girls. ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", a very well done movie has everything for a typical teen movie. Examples, Julia Stiles's exotic bar dancing and her extremely crude insults. Also noting, Heath Ledger's charming and romantic persuasions and his rather well singing act. This movie is worth seeing again.

"its a long way to the top if u wanna rock n roll","Null","0","0","29 January 2002"," clever mix of light hearted humour, depth of character, and a satirical take on popular american culture
","From the opening chord of the Barenaked Ladies tune ""one week"", it appeared that once again I was about to waste an hour and a half of my life on yet another straight-off-the-hollywood-production-line-sure-fire-big-money-winner-""teen"" -movie. Thankfully, as it turned out, I was wrong. Gil Junger's ""10 things I hate about you"" is something of a refreshing departure from your average american teen romance. Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the shrew"" (loose being the operative word, don't expect for a long time another classic reworking like that of Luhrmann's 1995 effort ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet""), writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith cleverly capture the Bard's often piquant humour and bawdiness, all the while incorporating their own satire and modern take on the story.<br/><br/>""But she's a mutant! what if she never dates?"" exclaims an obviously exasperated Bianca Stratford. You see, Bianca is in the position of not being allowed to date until her anti-social, non-conformist (""heinous bitch is the term used most often,"" states the guidance counsellor) older sister Katarina does. This poses a huge problem for Bianca, who is the beautiful, often ditzy sophomore that dumb model Joey Donner and shy yet sincere Cameron James both desire as the object of their affection. Enter resident bad-boy Patrick Verona who then joins the fold as the one hired to ""tame the shrew"" - Katarina.<br/><br/>The mostly young cast make sure that their characters all rise to their written potential, while also managing to add the charm and constant good looks of american youth(?! - obviously we're missing out in australia). Julia Stiles hits the target as the strong-willed Katarina, embracing her whole heartedly and confidently bringing across her dry humour and ""hate the world"" attitude without over-acting and ruining the character. Heath Ledger is perhaps to ""pretty boy""-ish to be take overly seriously as the rebel, however he charms his way into the audiences' heart with his natural charisma, easily conveying both side of Patrick with distinction (plus, how could one look past that thousand-watt smile?!). The two lead characters are confidently and professionally backed the whole way by an eclectic cast, providing a strong character base to play with if the story was to end up in the quagmire.<br/><br/>Cynics would say it was to be expected, but I would genuinely say that the most impressive revelation comes from the ""elder"" players in the cast - Allison Janney, Daryl Mitchell and Larry Miller. In a rare, although not entirely unheard of, and unusual twist (think Jack Nicholson in ""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest""), all three seem perfectly cast. Although obviously well written, you are still able to sense the way in which each of them have discovered the particulars and peculiarities of their respective characters and worked them to the forefront for all to see and enjoy. Their one-on-one scenes with the central characters produce some of the funniest dialogue of the movie and add a whole new dimension to both the film itself and the acting, in the way that the entire cast are quite content in playing off each other.<br/><br/>As the title, young cast and genre casting exhibit, this is a film that is aimed squarely at a teenage market. However, its clever mix of light hearted humour, depth of character, first rate casting, satirical take on popular american culture and its Shakespearean origin make it a film that you can watch with your friends, sibling, parents and grandparents alike. Although not a life altering, Oscar deserving film, it does stand out from the ever-the-same movies of its kind as fun, thoughtful, fresh and well put together.<br/><br/>And what are the ""10 Things I hate about you""? You'll have to watch to find out."

","Ok, I confess. I'm a bit past my high school days and I actually did find Shakespeare fun and interesting back then. So then, do I expect 10 Things I Hate About You to be as enduring as the Bard's classics? No. Is it one of the best 'teen flicks... no scratch that... one of THE best flicks I've stumbled across in a while? Yes. Here's why... It wasn't the twists and turns in the plot. Any self respecting, John Hughes loving movie-goer could navigate this thing like a high school senior sneaking from study hall to the mall. It wasn't that the director presented the images in unique and novel ways. Smart, knowing  and in no way distracting from the real goodies. This movie was great because we knew exactly where it was going, how it would get there and it still remained a joyous ride. The entire cast was fresh and fun and delivered lines we've heard before in a new voice. It used the fact that this was familiar territory to combine unnecessary expository scenes into a shorthand that allowed us to spend more time on the fun parts. The only weak scene in the movie was the obligatory falling-in-love-set-to-music montage, and even that wasn't horrible as it was offset by one of the coolest get-the-girl scenes to date as the high school troublemaker woos his woman with the assistance of a 60's love song and the school marching band. Oh, and it didn't insult it's audience, from the teens to the post (well honestly, post-post) teens like myself. To use the vernacular, the soundtrack rocked! Some 80's gems like Madness coupled with some 90's Ska and a pretty cute remake of Nick Lowe's Cruel To Be Kind. If I was a real critic I could probably find a lot of blowhard reasons not to like this movie. Fortunately, for an average guy like me, I can't find one thing I hate about 10 Things I Hate About You."

","""Ten Things I Hate About You"" is the typical romantic love story but with a twist. It is like no other film and the comedy is exceptionally humorous. It is an American teen film and anyone who isnt a teenager would surely hate it. The movie is based on stereotypes of the different teenagers i.e punk,swot and this is made fun of in the film. I think it was a great idea to revamp ""old"" literature to make it more appealing to to teenagers today, even if it isnt proper shakespeare, it isnt far off the general idea. Ten Things I Hate About You has to be the funniest film i have ever seen. The actors are amazing and this is shown well in the film at making non humourous lines comical.

","One of the few films which makes a lie of the perpetuating idea that it's impossible to create a teen movie that is both literate and about something. Granted, it should, being based on something Shakespeare and all.  But literary adaptation is never always an insurance policy.  What makes '10 thing' so special it's ongoing need to find new or unpredictable ways of telling its story, so that even though we know the inevitable outcome, nothing is actually set in stone.  'Shrew' has always been a bit of a problem of a play, containing as it does that final scene which flouts all natural feminist laws.  '10 things' solution is a much more believable solution.

","10 Things I Hate About You is great teen-flick, but adults alike will also like the charm and wit of this movie, starring some great new up-and-coming teen stars. The film is all about a new guy in town, Cameron (played by ""3rd Rock's"" Joseph Gordon Levitt) who falls in love with Bianca (Larisa Oleynik, one of the few girls from the 'Babysitters Club Movie' that has done anything since, aswell as Rachael Leigh Cook).<br/><br/>Only problem is, Bianca's dad is REALLY strict, and won't allow her to date guys unless her freakish older sister, 'Kat' does. Kat is a loner, who has a girl-powered opinion on just about everything, and is dubbed 'heinus bitch' by half the school. So Cameron and his friend ask another freakish loner, Patrick (Heath Ledger from 'The Patriot') to ask Kat on on a date, so he can go out with Bianca. But, arrogant model-type, Joey (Party Of Five's Andrew Keegan) also has his sights set on Bianca.<br/><br/>When the dance comes (and it always does in these movies) Bianca takes Joey, while Kat and Patrick go together. Poor Cameron is upset that Bianca is out with Joey, while he (Joey) blabs to Kat that the only reason Patrick is going out with Kat is because he paid him to. Only trouble is, Patrick had already fallen in love with her.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles (Down To You, Save The Last Dance) is brilliant as Kat, as is Larissa Oleynik. Heath Ledger is also really good and Joseph and Andrew are also great. <br/><br/>A great teen-flick that'll have you laughing, and as good as 'She's All That' and 'Never Been Kissed', if not better!"
"pleiades10","6","0","0","29 January 2001"," Misleading title. Cliched ending.
","Based on the title, it seemed to me that ""10 Things I Hate About You"" should have been a movie about unlikeable characters doing despicable things to one another with comedic results. Probably a black comedy, perhaps along the lines of ""The War of the Roses"". <br/><br/>It turns out, however, that the plot is a sweet high school romance story in which several unlikely scenarios play out just right, and everybody ends up happy in the end. The cast works well together, highlighting Joseph Gordon-Levitt's (""Tommy"" on NBC's ""3rd Rock from the Sun"") attempt to romance Larisa Oleynik, whom is not allowed to date until her sister (Julia Stiles) begins to date as well. Unfortunately, Stiles' character is rather bitter at men and life in general, so getting her to date proves a chore until the school criminal played by Heath Ledger comes into the picture.<br/><br/>
I wasn't aware that this is actually based on a Shakespeare play. I only read ""MacBeth"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" in school, although because of this movie, I'm now interested in reading ""The Taming of the Shrew"". (upon which this movie was derived.)<br/><br/>One complaint I must note: In the past year or two, I've seen several movies where either the main plot or a sub plot involves a teenage guy dating a girl for purely selfish reasons (getting paid by friends, trying to win a bet, etc.), but SURPRISE! he ends up falling for her anyway. Then of course, right when the most romantic moment promises to be right around the corner, SURPRISE! the girl finds out and gets her feelings hurt, and then the guy has to convince her that ""it's not really like that"", and eventually she forgives him and they stay together. It's starting to get a little overused as it's been played out in recent movies as diverse as: Cruel Intentions, She's All That, Carrie 2: The Rage, and now 10 Things I Hate About You.<br/><br/>
Maybe Hollywood should start writing some new material, instead of rehashing the popular plot lines of previous films. But then again, I suppose it wouldn't be Hollywood with any real originality, would it?"

","I didn't know it was a shakespeares kind of film until much later. I found myself very attached to the role of Catarina Stratford. I just love her! I also think the romance-quality of this film is very good and the humour is fantastic. Joey Gordon-Levitt play Cameron, a newcomer who falls in deep love with Catarinas younger sister, Bianca. Bianca is the most popular girl in school. The hot-shot Joey, a model posing underwear and socks, tells his friends he's going to get Bianca. The only problem for both of them is that the Stratford sisters are not allowed to date according to their father's rules. But when their father changes his rules to let Bianca date, when Cat does, Cameron and his friend Michael set their minds on getting Cat a date she can not refuse. Catarina, perhaps the only girl in school whom does not care of dating and have a reputation about herself that she is a very difficult girl, is not an easy ""schrew""/cat to tame. A lot of humour, romance and good music. See it and believe it!"

Right from the start to finish, it always keeps me very awake (and that is a good thing 'cause movies are supposed to be entertaining)! The jokes are so funny and clever, too--something not easy to do. The only mildly offensive reference is Kat's comment to the size of Joey's er, package. Not only the two young leads really shine in this movie, the adults are the even funnier ones! Ms. Perky (now that's a good name!) and Mr. Stratford has some of the best lines like, ""My insurance does not cover PMS!"" and ""...and hell is only a sauna."" The ditzy airhead little sis of Kat, Bianca, is also played well by Larisa Oleynik. As annoying as Kat sees her, she's still a likable little girl and boy, can she punch! Basically is this a flick for teenage girls...of course guys can appreciate it too, but be warned, there are some very embarrassing moments. <br/><br/>The fact that it was adopted from a Shakespeare play doesn't hurt it at all. okay, they perhaps should delete those strange little Shakespearean quotes, cause it doesn't fit in very well. I haven't read the play (""The Taming of the Shrew"") so I don't know how the original story goes, but 10 Things I Hate About You is definitely a refreshing update and I'm sure Shakespeare didn't include the flashing bit (haha)! To top that off, this movie also has a fantastic soundtrack , so many great songs that they couldn't cram it all on the actual soundtrack, so go rent the movie. My personal favorite songs are ""I Want You to Want Me"" and ""Can't Get Enough of You"" but there are a lot of other hip songs--go look for it's 'Sountrack Listings' for full details.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie and I give it 8/10."

","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a teensploitation movie.  Don't get me wrong, because that's not a bad thing.  At least, it doesn't *have* to be a bad thing.  But the reason that most people over the age of 21 groan when they hear about yet *another* movie about teenagers, is because the teensploitation fad has given us the recent ""Scary Movie,"" and less-recent releases like ""American Pie,"" ""She's All That,"" ""Varsity Blues,"" ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" and the abysmal ""Drive Me Crazy.""  Now, there's nothing wrong with putting a bunch of attractive twenty-somethings in a plot about the trials and tribulations of high school.  But (and this is my only complaint about ""10 Things"") could they at least aim for a little more realism?  Whose high school looks like a castle?  Who has gone to their senior prom to find all the attendees dancing in unison?  Who's ever had an inappropriate sexual encounter with an apple pie, and who has ever had a hot exchange student masturbate on their bed, live on the internet?<br/><br/>Other than the few instances where the viewer is forced to suspend disbelief (come on, we all know that Joey Donner is a closet nancy-boy), ""10 Things"" is a pretty good movie.  If it weren't for modernized versions of the Bard, many of us wouldn't be able to stomach the mandatory studying of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" ""Macbeth,"" and of course ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  By putting the plot and characters in a setting that most people understand-high school-the filmmakers have proven that Shakespeare's work is truly timeless, and definitely worth studying.  (I don't mean to insult Shakespeare fans out there-in fact, I admire you; you're a lot smarter than I am!)<br/><br/>""10 Things"" is funny and has its touching moments-like when Patrick (Heath Ledger, ""The Patriot's"" adorable Aussie) serenades Kat (Julia Stiles) in the stadium.  When I saw that scene, I thought, ""Who cares if it's believable? That's so sweet!""  Several notably good scenes include the party, where the writers say (by way of the students' acceptance of social outcast Kat only after she performs a drunken table-dance, something she would never normally do) that ""everyone's popular when you're drunk.""  During the inevitable prom scene, when Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fights with Joey (Andrew Keegan, in a wonderfully snotty performance) to defend the honor of Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), it shows that likes her for who she is, and not just because she's pretty.<br/><br/>The movie has good character development and some great acting, especially by Ledger, David Krumholtz as Cameron's A/V Club pal, and Allison Janney as a demented guidance counsellor.  Don't write it off as just another teen flick-it's a big fish in a small pond, and it's not only watchable, it's enjoyable.<br/><br/>I give it 8 out of 10 stars."

For, although the movie tips its hat to Shakespeare in many subtle and not-so-subtle ways, the dialogue certainly isn't penned by Bill - but manages nonetheless to capture some of his wit.<br/><br/>For me, this was far more successful than some recent attempts to bring Shakespeare up-to-date, and most notably than the woefully overrated ""Romeo and Juliet"" from a couple of years ago.  Again, though, it should be understood that the film isn't ""The Taming of the Shrew"", and nor does it try to be.  Rather, it's a touching, amusing, clever film with sterling performances from all involved.  The plot itself isn't all that complicated, of course - but then, nor was Shakespeare's play.  Nonetheless, it succeeds in holding the viewer's attention, and gives a lift to the most jaded soul."

","Kat, the furiously flip take no prisoners heroine of ""10 things I hate about you"" might be described as a ball buster, although that would hardly do her justice. Brainy, beautiful and haughty as hell, with dancing feline eyes she narrows in contempt at any guy unlucky enough to make a play for her, Kat has a lot in common with the babelicious teases who saunter through high school movies, like leonine queens of the adolescent jungle. The difference is that Kat isn't going to win any popularity contests. She's a willowy high strung misfit who armors herself with gender war rhetoric, pretending she's better than everyone around her. She uses her bitchery and wit to put down guys for the unforgivable crime of being guys. This may be the cheekiest ""literary"" update yet - a post riot grrrl gloss on ""The taming of the shrew"" with Shakespeare's plot twirled around devices that have become cliches, virtually overnight in the new teen comedies - the guy who struggles to land a girl in order to win a bet - the ingenue - in this case Kat's younger sister - the button nosed Bianca - who's a virgin to everything but consumerism. The film casts an amusingly jaundiced eye on the unholy status games of contemporary teen culture. When the big keg blowout arrives, it's a quesy tequila soaked suburban sprawl, with make out session glimpses in all their squirmy desperation and a nerd bragging to two girls about his play to buy... a Toyota Tercel. At the center of this nasty spitfire is, Kat. The young actress Julia Stiles in her first major roles, casually plays against her luminescent Pre-Raphaelite glow. At times her hot blooded earthiness recalls Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth"" and she makes Kat cruelly ambivalent about the effect of her sexuality on others. Along the way Kat is wooed and then ""tamed"" by a suitor of surprising Charm - Patrick a gentle Aussie heart-throb who's like Val Kilmer before he went falky - he knows just how to kill Kat with kindess.

"alice liddell","8","0","0","22 March 2000"," Better than Shakespeare (possible spoiler)
","This is a wonderful, funny, romantic teen comedy that may not be as laugh-out-loud uproarious as AMERICAN PIE, but whose drifts into seriousness and sentimentality are far more plausible and acceptable.<br/><br/>The film is at least the second modernisation of Shakespeare's The Taming Of The Shrew, but is much less objectionable than the Bard to its title character.  Surely it will soon become a commonplace that Shakespearean makeovers are more successful than actual dramatisations.  The advantages for the scriptwriter are legion - characters with a ready-made set of characteristics; forward moving plots etc.  But the exercise never feels contrived here - characters may be named Stratford or Verona; one goth-hippy worships Will; the wired Bruno Kirby-a-like may spout the odd Bardic tag - but the rich inevitabliity of the plot allows for many themes to be touched on.<br/><br/>An adherence to this plot allows for some narrative surprise - for instance, Shakespeare, unlike most mainstream films, rarely begins his plays with his heroes, so it's a surprise when nearly ten minutes are spent introducing a character in the conventional Hollywood manner (past history; explanatory friend; introduction to him of other characters etc.), that it comes as a pleasant surprise to discover that he's only a subsidiary character after all.<br/><br/>This non-claustrophobic opening out applies to the film as a whole - although the relationship between Catherine and Patrick is clearly central, there is an even-handed treatment of secondary characters, not just plot enablers, but with problems and plot crises of their own, that makes the film seem so rich and alive.<br/><br/>Shakespeare's big theme is the mask, the roles we are forced to play in life, how we are fixed by how others see us, how this can lead to emptiness and perversion in our own nature.  10 THINGS is a brilliant essay on this, the adolescent battleground of reputation being the perfect place to test it.  The theme is stated right from the start with Cameron, whose army-background means that he is starting at a new school for the ninth time.  This accumulation of continually inchoate selves, the sense of the itinerary and the unfinished, plants seeds of ambiguity and doubt into a mechanically constructed plot of elegant closure, undermining the outcome not only of Cameron's subplot, but Catherine and Patrick's too (although not the pleasure we derive from such outcomes).<br/><br/>The main issue of reputation centres on Catherine and Patrick.  The former is a very hostile, intelligent young woman, exasperated with her jock contemporaries and the fetishisation of shallow values.  It may seem misogynistic to suggest that these very valid objections are just a smokescreen for the usual fear of sex, but it's not neccessarily sex per se Catherine rejects, but the egotistical male-gratifying power games that seek to put her in a very inferior place.<br/><br/>This is a marked improvement even on Shakespeare, and the resolution of her plot is not a climb down, but actually enabling, couched in terms of possible creativity and independence, as Patrick gives her a guitar to form a band, something she earlier said would annoy her dad.  This is a uniquely open ending - she has already ruptured family ties by accepting a college place on the East Coast - what if she actually does form a band?  If she doesn't, will Patrick follow her to Saint Laurence?  Will she outgrow him?<br/><br/>Remarkable in a Hollywood movie, the male lead exists mainly to  reflect and extract elements of the female lead's character, to push her plot.  And yet it is his plot that distills the conflict between what you are taken for, and what you do.  We aren't told until near the film's end over the 'truth' of Patrick's life (after all, we only have his word); up until then, we are forced to hold in tension the seeming connection between his actions (going out with a girl to make money) and his negative reputation, and its opposition to his likeable personality and evident desire.  This ambiguity casts further doubt on the ending.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast brilliantly mirror this theme, from the staid careers officer who writes erotica, to the hipster teacher who loves Shakespeare. The film's very existence is called into ethical question by the discussions on the exclusionary literary canon.<br/><br/>Because it parallels a second interesting tension in the film, one of class. As in AMERICAN PIE, every character is fantastically rich, with huge houses and their own cars, all except Patrick, whose reputation is rooted in a criminal underclass.  There is a tacit contrast between haves and haves not, conspicuous consumption and the disturbingly unknown that is quite surprising in such a good-natured comedy.<br/><br/>And it is scrupulously good-natured and fair.  All the secondary characters are given depths and insecurities, even the silliest (Joey), while the blossoming of Bianca from a trivial beauty into a very complex, self-aware young woman is one of the film's great achievements.  The fairy-tale school setting adds to the 'unreal' flavour of the plot, as do the snatches of Surrealism (playing golf into an American football sportsground; the scene with the marvellous Stratford dad doing his exercises).<br/><br/>The humour is remarkably clever and verbal, easily co-existing with the expected slapstick fun.  The Shakespearean use of ritual spaces (eg Prom Nights) for the playing out of social anxieties is compelling, as is the wonderfully uncontrived gender reversal in the expected fight.  The invasion by an army of  drunken students of a huge upper-middle-class home has the right degree of terror and exhiliration.  A real treat."

","""10 Things I Hate About You,"" a modern updating of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" demonstrates what happens when filmmakers drain The Bard of his poetry and language and cater to modern moviegoing tastes - they reduce a classic work to yet another in a long line of lamebrained, dull teenagers-on-the-make tales featuring a contingent of adolescents who would never be caught dead reading Shakespeare.<br/><br/>In this version, set in contemporary Tacoma, Kate and Bianca have been converted into two squabbling high school sisters, the former a notorious harridan from whom all peers flee and the latter a virginal beauty whom all the boys covet but who is laboring under her father's edict that she not be able to date until her older sister does.<br/><br/>That Shakespeare's plot fails to translate to modern times goes without saying since the father's obsession lacks the kind of logic the original author provided.  In the original's historical context, the cultural tradition dictating that the older daughter must marry before the younger one rings true as a motivation for the story's narrative underpinnings. Here, since the fathers seems mostly concerned with the - real or imagined - horrifying consequences of his daughter's dating, his decision to allow Bianca to date only if Kate does seems counterintuitive and counterproductive.  It seems hardly sensible that his fears would be allayed by having TWO daughters out on the town with boyfriends.<br/><br/>All this could be forgiven if the filmmakers had provided a screenplay with even a smidgen of cleverness and humor.   In fact, the first ten minutes hint at a reasonably astute satire of modern high school life, particularly in the character of a sex-obsessed female counselor who provides the only moments of amusement in the entire film.  Since she us dropped almost immediately from the action, all we are left with is the spectacle of a group of shallow teenagers laboriously executing the mechanics of a once irresistable plot.  Kate is nowhere near the terrifying shrew nor her pursuer the arrogant rogue they need to be to be comically effective.  They come across as only slightly askew, but basically ordinary, adolescents who lack the charisma to make them even slightly interesting.<br/><br/>""10 Things"" proves yet again that Shakespeare without Shakespeare results only in a bareboned plot devoid of wit and artistry."

ANYTHING that will get a new generation hooked to the classics is fine---if you don't think so, watch Mr. Holland's Opus.  HE was about strung from the rafters for using Rock N Roll to teach music, and it worked.  I wish some of the snoozer teachers I had in school had been that creative (although some of the language the teacher used would NEVER fly in a real school... unless things have drastically changed in 10-15 years!)"

","Go and rent this movie now! It was really sweet and funny. Heath Ledger is a total hottie, and the cast looks so real. You fall in love with them, and wish they would get together in real life. Joeseph Gordon-Levitt was perfect for the sweet little geek who was crushing on air-headed Bianca. Bianca was the popular little sister who was ditzy, but not enough to start to bug you. Andrew Keegan really made you believe he was an a** hole, and Chastity was the perfect bit*hy little back-stabber. Overall, this movie deserves about 9 thumbs up and a perfect 10. The cast was awesome, the script funny, and the acting flawless. If all of this doesn't convince you to see the movie, maybe this will: I'm buying the book and the DVD this Christmas, I have the soundtrack, multiple posters of the cast, and saw it 3 times in the theater. If you want to see a really awesome movie that would be over 100 dollars to rent if people charged on how good the movie is, go see ""10 things I hate about you."" You really won't regret it!"

","I generally avoid teen movies as best I can because they are almost invariably shallow offensive stereotypes that present a totally inaccurate view of what an average sixteen-year-old ( or  any teenager ) should be/think/look like etc.<br/><br/>Although this film isn't a great insight into what real high school life is like, at least they got some things right that most of the others in this genre miss.  The school is populated by stereotypes, but at least there are consequences and some realistic expectations of life.  Kat was wonderfully sympathetic and gave a decent role model for high-schoolers in terms of not having to do what 'everyone' is doing.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see a 'don't judge a book by its cover' message that wasn't quite so shallow as usual.  The geeks were still geeks at the end, but they found other people that they could relate to.<br/><br/>One thing I especially liked was the fact that this film wasn't about a bunch of sex-crazed teens.  The plot was initiated because of one kid's over-active glands, but he was the exception, rather than the rule.  The couples were able to end up together without ending up in bed.  I much prefer that because I get tired of the generalization that all high-school and college students think about is sex and beer ( or sex and football as another film put it ).<br/><br/>Anyway, off the soapbox.  The one way that I knew for sure that this was a good movie was that I kept thinking to myself ""I hope it's not over yet."" Not a great work of art and aptly rated PG-13 for not-for-kiddies language and humor, but a solid 7."

","Pulling in over $8 million opening weekend, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is not your typical under-rated movie. Most of the time, people wouldn't see a movie because of its poor ratings but this one, I made an exception. That exception was no mistake either! A romantic comedy, wonderfully adapted by Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" is a movie that has everything. This movie is hysterical the whole way through from the wacko guidance counselor to an obsessive, over-protective father. This movie gives you only a slight preview of the next wave of teen stars. The hot and beautiful Julia Stiles (NBC's The 60's) and the glamourous and attractive Larisa Oleynik act out their parts as completely opposite sisters wonderfully. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (TV's 3rd Rock From The Sun) and Heath Ledger, two very talented young actors do everything they can and can't do to pursue these girls. ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", a very well done movie has everything for a typical teen movie. Examples, Julia Stiles's exotic bar dancing and her extremely crude insults. Also noting, Heath Ledger's charming and romantic persuasions and his rather well singing act. This movie is worth seeing again. ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" sure is one cool flick with nothing to hate about it."

"GrammarCub","7","0","0","31 March 1999"," Funny, clever update of Shakespeare classic
","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a funny, clever update of the Shakespeare classic, ""The Taming of the Shrew."" The premise for the story is much the same -- in the original, Bianca Minola could not marry until her older sister Katharine was wed -- in the new movie, Bianca Stratford cannot date until her older sister Kat does. Petruchio, now renamed ""Patrick Verona,"" is paid by one of Bianca's suitors and thus neatly sidesteps the whole dowry issue. The jokes are funny, and the situation is just ludicrous enough to be entertaining without insulting the audience's intelligence. This is the ""Clueless"" makeover (""Clueless"" was an update of Jane Austen's ""Emma""), and it works quite well.<br/><br/>The one performance that never quite rings true is Andrew Keegan's as Joey, presumably the Hortensio role. He seems somehow too uncomfortable with the material to really sell it, and I have a hard time believing that this person was ever that popular. Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik, as the Stratford sisters, are both excellent. Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, in the Lucentio role (Cameron), is the best of the ensemble as he makes his play for Bianca. He is a fine actor, especially for one so young. It probably doesn't hurt that he's had some of the most experience of the young cast, starring in the hit sitcom ""Third Rock From the Sun."" David Krumholtz (""The Slums of Beverly Hills""), as Cameron's friend Michael, also turns in a funny, convincing performance.<br/><br/>The one quibble I had with the picture was a mainly regional one: I live in Tacoma, Washington, where most of the picture was filmed; our town's historic Stadium High School was transformed into Padua High for the purposes of the screenplay. However, I was offended by the supposed premise that this picture takes place in Seattle. Shots of the Space Needle and Gasworks Park are clearly visible, side by side with shots of downtown Tacoma and ... Stadium High, one of the city's most famous landmarks. The view from the Stratford house is also plainly Commencement Bay (my own house is less than a mile away), and I question how the filmmakers could decide to be so blatantly ambiguous. Pick a city, folks.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the movie was delightful enough, and a terrific date movie. Prepare yourself to laugh your sphincters off."
"Ace-38","Null","0","0","16 October 1999"," As teen movies go, not too bad
","""10 Things I hate About You"" starts off as your usual teen flick.  Somewhat devoid of any real enjoyment....the first 30 minutes is completely forgettable.  You get an immediate distaste for it, with the primary characters (Bianca, and her friend Chastity) being your stereotypical self absorbed teen queens.  Then you have your arrogant pretty boy, your anti-social sister (Kat) that ruins Bianca's very existence.  Your love struck new boy in school, the nerd assigned to show him around and the misunderstood romantic tough guy.<br/><br/>Once you get through that though, the movie begins to take on a certain charm, as Kat begins to fall for Mr. tough guy, =who turns out to have a heart of gold.  Bianca's pretty boy turns out to be a self absorbed jerk, and she falls for nerdy new boy.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles steals the movie, although I firmly believe this was designed as a Larisa Olyneck vehicle.  Her Kat is the only character to reach beyond the teen stereotypes the others fall victim too, and she simply steals each scene.  Her table dance is one of the most memorable in recent history, and reveals her character's ""soft"" side<br/><br/>Being a guitar player, I was quite pleased to see my favorite guitar (Fender Stratocaster) get some screen time.....way to go there!!!!<br/><br/>
Anyway, ""10 Things"" is an enjoyable romp worth your 97 minutes.

","In the last few years it seems as if we have seen another boom of teen movies.  Like teen pop music, teen movies come into our lives and scar us forever.  Things like this must go. But in a world where Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt rule the teen movie genre, a refreshing teen cast can actually be found.  And where is it found my friend?  In the blockbuster hit '10 Things I Hate About You'. Sure, Julia Stiles is a pro at teen movies.  But this was the one that thrust her into the limelight.  As Kat Stratford she really did know how to shine.  Her character was never wishy washy or annoying.  The one character that was annoying.  Yes... there actually was one.  His name would be Cameron.  This character was played by Third Rock From The Sun's Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Let me tell you kid, you will never have a movie acting career.  Stick to telivision, its your forte.  Larisa Oleynik, one who was both on Third Rock From The Sun and... my childhood favorite... The Adventures of Alex Mack was great as Bianca.  I hadn't seen her in much since her stint on television shows, but she did a great job fitting in on the big screen.  And Heath Ledger had his breakout role as Patrick Verona. This character seems a lot like a normal person.  I was actually happy to see Heath in this role since most of his roles afterwards weren't up to par. He just seemed more down to earth and real in this movie. And the storyline of this movie was great.  It was truly a wonderful remake of a Shakespeare classic, The Taming Of The Shrew.  I had a chance to see the play after seeing the movie.  The movie did the play justice.  It's one of the best adaptations of a Shakespeare play I've seen. Humor is found throughout this film, and that's refreshing considering most teen movies of this time are sappy when it comes to humor.  Another breath of fresh air is the soundtrack including bands like Letters To Cleo and Save Ferris.  If you like ska you might want to listen to some songs on that soundtrack. Well with this said... one last thing.  Gabrielle Union is in this movie as Chastity.

Kat Stratford was one of the most realistic, smart, great characters of all the teen movies. A girl who doesn't want to act like the other ones expect her to do. Come on, that's a REAL person. I think the best things about the movie are Julia Stiles, the sequence where Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Cameron) explains to Larisa Oleynik (Bianca) what kind of person she is, and the Heath Ledger's (Patrick) song scene. These are just awesome things. But there are not-that-good things too, like how Bianca can't understand anything about Joey until the moment he starts pausing in front of her, and how can a person like Kat can sell (yeah, i can only find that word to use, sell) herself to just a GUITAR?

I was also relieved to see that none of the main characters was involved in the run for Prom Queen. It wasn't even mentioned. Hallelujah.

I can tell you, there are real people like that. I would certainly like to be one of them. I would also like to say that Heath Ledger, although perhaps too old for the part, was a wonderfully inspired piece of casting for Patrick Verona. I'll certainly be keeping an eye on his career! I thought, however that the plot could easily have done without Miss Perky. She didn't seem to have any reason for being in the film. Perhaps if her character had been seen more she could have developed into one of the more comedic people, but as it was, she was just excess baggage.<br/><br/>One of the things that caught me the most was the excellent soundtrack. As we went home, my friends and I just couldn't stop singing the chorus from the final ""roof top"" scene. The outtakes were also a nice surprise.

","I don't know who couldn't see the Taming of the Shrew (things I hate about you - ooh, odd rhyming parallel there) in this film, it's quite obviously there. Fair enough, the story is an absolute classic. The movie storyline does stick reasonably closely to Shakespeare's story, perhaps, in fact, a little too much in places to make the story mildly awkward. The characterisation, strangely enough for a teen-romance was well done. Heath Ledger did the best job at getting the audience (me at least) to feel his anguish. Julia Stiles also does a great job at being repulsive in the beginning but then growing to be really likeable, reminiscent of Christina Ricci in ""The Opposite of Sex"". Andrew Keegan did a brilliant job of just making you want to smack him! Like so many films now, there are these cunning little jokes and references that could be missed so easily, especially some of the Shakespearean references for example one of the lead character's surname being Verona. I was a little disappointed to see the film end at the Prom, surely that's going out of fashion now, though I was impressed with the audacity of the writers to attempt to show a teen-party in more detail than usual; not many films have a go at that. I shall end with possibly the most satisfying part of going to see this at a cinema and that was watching everybody leave as soon as the credits start. I'll admit I'm one of those who does like to watch the film to the very end, and what a treat I got doing so. Some of *the* funniest out-takes I've ever seen. I was literally in stitches with one of them. They also explain how no-one ever dances in time with the music in films. That was something I didn't know.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that you've probably seen before in some form or another but it's definitely worth seeing this one. Fully recommended."

","A cast of up and coming actors and actresses including Larissa Oleynik and Julia Stiles(both 18) star in this twisted high school romantic comedy. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the real star. He steals every scene with his squeaky voice. Heath Ledger is dodgy. Some scenes, he shines, and in others, his Australian heritage is obvious. Both of the girls do well. Oleynik is great as the 'girlie girl' whilst Stiles is equally as good as the more rebellious sis. Daryll Mitchell is also good as the quick tempered English teacher. <br/><br/> Despite its beauty, 10 Things also managed to annoy me-the erotic novelist guidance teacher who disappears after half an hour, the Shakesperian student who appears, as if from nowhere, half way through the film.<br/><br/> Still, 10 Things I Hate About You is a nice easy film to watch with pleasant enough performances.

","I loved this movie. Shakespeare in origin, but almost seamlessly updated into such an engaging story. Sure, you know it ain't reality, but this was a romantic teen movie comedy for which you're so willing to suspend the disbelief. The cast is great, especially because they are all just around the right age and as much as was made of the 'fresh-faced unknown cast,' they work perfectly here. Ledger and Stiles especially have a great chemistry. If you're a fan of the John Hughes-esque 80's genre (of the Sixteen Candles or Cameron Crowe's Say Anything type), I strongly recommend you see this."
"TheEdge-4","Null","0","0","6 August 1999"," Sweet and very funny
","I like this film a lot. Admittedly it does have its faults. The first fifteen minutes or so are a bit disjointed and shaky until it settles down into the main story but it has an infectious joie de vivre that makes it hard to dislike. Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's script contains a great number of quotable lines which, while perhaps not up to the standard of Mr W. Shakespeare, are memorable enough in their own right (I particularly liked the line ""I know you can be overwhelmed. I know you can be underwhelmed. But can you be like just whelmed""). I can't help feeling though that certain scenes have been cut out to keep the film down to its relatively brisk running time. This is one instance where a film would have benefited by being longer. Certain elements of the plot do seem rather rushed (after Kat's character has been initially established as the scary shrew, she does seem to thaw rather quickly under the influence of Patrick Verona, and when she discovers she has been the victim of a bet, she doesn't seem to be as particularly upset as she would have a right to be) and a certain amount of time is taken to introduce Alison Janney's Miss Perky which suggests she will be one of the major supporting characters, only for her to disappear after the opening sequence (a pity as there was much more comic mileage left in her). There are certain scenes shown as outtakes at the end which never made it into the main body of the film itself but I'm not sure if they were ever intended to be(stay to the end of the credits. they're hilarious).<br/><br/>But like I said, I like this film a lot. It succeeds despite its flaws and although a lot of the dialogue is good, I think the reason for its success is down to the actors. I can't say I'd heard of any of the actors and actresses in this before but they all give great performances. Contrary to some of the reviews I've read, I think Larisa Oleynik does a great job as Bianca. I've never seen The Secret World of Alex Mack so she is new to me but she manages to create a character that is both selfish and shallow but sympathetic as well. You can understand why she is as she is. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Krumholtz and Susan May Pratt also do well in their respective roles. Larry Miller is just hilarious as Mr Stratford and reminds me a lot of Den Hedaya who played Cher's father in Clueless. Admittedly it helps that he gets a lot of the best lines but he doesn't come across entirely as the stereotypical spoilsport father. If I was in his position, I'd be worried too.<br/><br/>But the two revelations in this film are Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I had my doubts that Ledger's Verona would be a character that I would particularly like. Happily, I was wrong. Although his character also seems to change rather too quickly from the rebellious loner prepared to drill holes in Cameron's French book one minute to one allowing himself to be seen with Cameron and Michael in the school canteen the next, Ledger invests his character with a lot of charm and his rendition of Can't Take My Eyes Off of You is the undoubted highlight of the film. By the end, you really want him to succeed. I predict great things for Heath Ledger after this.<br/><br/>Even better though is Julia Stiles. Although she, like Larry Miller, gets most of the best lines in the film, she knows how to deliver them to their best advantage. She's a marvelously expressive actress and very attractive (but thankfully not in an obvious way). Watching her reminded me of when I first saw Michelle Pfeiffer in Grease 2. You get the feeling of having discovered an unknown who you just know is going to be a big star in the future.<br/><br/>She, like the film itself, is terrific."

Heath Ledger played the perfect Patrick. Hard on the outside, yet sweet and mushy on the inside. Julia Stiles was sparkling as Katarina Stratford, temperamental and edgy. Larisa Oleynik was the perfect Bianca, sweet and simpering. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a brilliant Cameron, scheming yet all too charming. Andrew Keegan was great as Joey Donner, self obsessed and hateful. I was thoroughly liking the movie until the scene in which Patrick (Ledger) woos Kat (Stiles) with a heart-melting rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" that literally brought a stadium full of people to become an ooohing and aahing mass of fuzzy, warm happiness.

","I really very much enjoyed this film.  10 Things I Hate About You unfortunately will be lumped in with the slew of teen films already out or coming but this movie will endure I feel where as the others will be forgotten.  A very well done updating of The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare I feel and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't contain any sex, language that was too foul, or demeanor that was offensive.  It was a very good way to spend an afternoon and I can hardly wait until it comes out on video.<br/><br/>All of the characters were very well written, but I didn't feel one way or the other about Ms. Perky the school councilor.  My favorite character the school bad girl Kat is very well thought out and written.  She's not scarey like the girls in The Craft by comparision.  You wouldn't have to worry about her sacrificing the school mascot but you'd still stay clear of her none the less otherwise you'd catch her wrath.  She's opinionated, doesn't take anything from anyone, still participates in some activities, and is written as a very smart young girl.<br/><br/>Each of the characters was written and cast perfectly.  They were each written smart and not typical teen.  Then they were cast correctly as well. Michael the audio/video nerd and ultimate sidekick to Cameron wasn't in fact a nerd. Bianca the school princess yes was a princess but wasn't stuck up about it other then a few brief glimpses.  Patrick, whose actor was a little too old for the part but none the less well cast, was well written to be a match for Kat.  Under his gruff exterior lied a round about nice guy.  And Joey was so full of himself and had such an ego that it was both belieable and funny to see him strut himself straight out of Bianca's likes and get used without even knowing it.  And good marks to Cameron for liking Bianca for who she is and not what she is or represents.  And also for calling her on the carpet for not wanting to try new things rather then just letting her have her way cause she's a proverbial princess.<br/><br/>Well thought-out, well scripted, and well done this film should stand out with die hard teen film fans.  While it won't be remembered as fondly as some of the films that grossed more or had bigger stars, this film is still a hit.  Go see this movie if you haven't already, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>

I also love the touch at the end of the film/credits, where they show some scenes that they had to redo, it shows how the actors/actresses actually enjoyed filming this movie, probably because of the brilliant way it was written in to the 1990s.

Originally I had avoided seeing the film because I considered it just another of those pappy films put out by Hollywood to snag the teenaged market, however, it pleasantly surprised me. The acting is top notch, especially the performances turned in by Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger as the leads, and Larry Miller as Katerina Stratford's father. The nods to Shakespeare are everywhere, in the name of the high school where the majority of the action takes place (Padua High) to the names of the characters (Katerina Stratford, Patrick Verona).  This film is simply an updating of the play, and it is remarkably well done.  Less well done, however, is ""She's All That"", the recent update of ""Pygmalion"".

","Sometimes I think my age is a hinderance when it comes to enjoying films aimed at people that are about 10 years younger than me.  And then I think that maybe it isn't my age but my memories of films that I grew up liking. And if I have to be honest about the films that I enjoyed, I remember older people thinking the same things that I think of most teen films today: they are good  but nothing great.  I remember films like Fast Times and Mischief and Secret Admirer and Porky's.  They were funny and they looked at high school with a more sexual themed story.  And maybe that is what is missing in films today.  I'm not saying that T&A makes a movie better, but it sure makes it more realistic and funny.  Because when it comes down to it, high school is a time when most people find out how amazing sex is.  It is the first time they start to discover their bodies and it is the first time they actually make a concerted effort to get laid.  That is what made films from the early 80's entertaining and it is the lack of that edge that makes movies like this one and every other film that comes out ( except American Pie, that is a true 80's film and it may as well have been directed by Bob Clark and produced by Amy Heckerling )in the late 90's a little disappointing.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but it is hollow.  I don't remember this as being all that high school was about.  This certainly has elements of high school, but it is missing something.  I do recommend this film because it is good, so much better than Never Been Kissed, but if you are in your late 20's and yearn for silly films like Fraternity Vacation and Wild Life ( have a maple bob brotha, they're fresh ), then you will be disappointed.  But if you are under the age of 20 and have no idea who Jeff Spicolli is, then this is your cup of tea.  I am unfortunately in the former group.

The scene at near the end of the movie provided her with the prose to really hit audiences and provoke emotion.<br/><br/>The support cast portrayed the teenage 'falseness' to a comic end.  The performances acted like a combination of 'Can't Hardly Wait' and 'Clueless'.<br/><br/>In summary, I think that people should view this film if they want to see a good lighthearted film with a good ending.

However, compared to the many truly mindless teenage-comedies excessively tiring our patience of(f) late (with ""American Pie"" just the epitome of the lot, repeating everything that has been said before conclusively and therefore the single one movie poised to have closed that sorry chapter for good enough) ""10 Things"" annoys ever the more by mistaking its classic groundwork to make amends for dull improbabilities that weren't even funny enough at the masters times (like: moron father says dumb younger sister can only get laid by some moron when older sister gets a moron first): a glorious source is no excuse for a dumb movie. And someone who wrote ""Hamlet"" is not a glorious source when it comes to judging ""The Taming of the Shrew"", ""Love Labours Lost"" or ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"".<br/><br/>Given that ancient drama and classical works became as lasting as they are because they basically deal with eternal human frailties, any pubescent teenage nonsense will have grecian models somehow or has been made into a play when Shakespeare, when Moliere, Goldoni, anyone of those, where at their times in need of easy cash - they remain tales told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing."

Listening to Letters to Cleo hardly defines a high school rebel. Limp direction and tired rock and roll covers."

"Tweekums","9","1","2","25 March 2019"," 'The Taming of the Shrew' in a '90s high school
","This film, loosely based on Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' is set in a high school near Seattle. New student Cameron James is smitten by Bianca Stratford; there are two major problems though; she is keen on the wealthy Joey Donner, who also likes her, and her father has banned her and her older sister Kat from dating till they graduate high school. This latter rule is changed to state that Bianca can only date when her sister does... potentially a stricter rule as she appears to show only contempt for boys and they are all scared of her. Cameron tutors her hoping to get closer and when he learns of the rule he, and his friend Michael, plot to find a boyfriend for Kat. The candidate for this role is bad boy Patrick Verona; he will need some persuading though. Here things get complicated as he approaches Joey suggesting he pay Patrick to date Kat... inevitably things get a bit messy.<br/><br/>The way the film ends won't surprise too many people but how we get there is fun and provides plenty of laughs. The cast does a fine job; most notably Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as Patrick and Kat respectively; they have a good chemistry that makes the potential relationship seem believable. Other notable performances come from Larisa Oleynik; as the pretty, and not as vacuous as she first seems, Bianca; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron and Andrew Keegan as the vain Joey. If you are a fan of high school romances I expect you will enjoy this. It has many good characters; both the teens, their teachers and the Stratford sisters' father. While it doesn't reference its source material as much as 'The Easy A', for example, there are plenty of nods with references to other Shakespeare works in class and even the sisters' surname. Overall this is definitely one to watch if you are a fan of the genre."

","This movie is okay. There's really nothing special to it. Next to brilliant teen movies as Breakfast club and Clueless, this one can't compete. <br/><br/>It seeks to get emotional but it wasn't at any point. The characters doesn't seem true and I don't feel like I should care about their love troubles. It'as a bit too superficial and stereotyped for me.

"PredragReviews","8","1","2","21 June 2016"," Nothing to hate about this one!
","The movie is based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It is about two sisters Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katarina ""Kat"" Stratford (Julia Stiles). Bianca is the popular sister who wants to start dating a popular boy, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan)and Kat is the social outcast. Trying to keep his daughters from dating for fear they may get pregnant, their paranoid father (Larry Miller) makes a family rule where Bianca cannot date until Kat does, which seems impossible. New kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has a huge crush on Bianca and, thinking Bianca likes him in return and wants to date him, he and his friend Michael Eckman (David Khumoltz) devises a scheme where they try to pair Kat off with the school ""Bad Boy"" Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger).<br/><br/>The dialogue is pretty clever, sharp, and well written. It is head and shoulders above most teen comedies of the last decade. The actors are all well suited for their roles and are enjoyable to watch. Larissa Oleynick is as cute as a bug. Allison Janney from ""The West Wing"" has a hilarious, but all too brief role as the school's guidance counselor who is in the middle of writing a trashy sex novel. David Leisure also appears as the gym teacher. It is unfair that this movie has to have the tag of ""teen movie"" attached to it. To some people, that equals poison. Especially in this day and age. I'm telling you right now people, this movie is better than that. This is enjoyable for any age. It's funny, cute, and has more depth and intelligence than most of these movies combined. If only all teen movies of this modern era could be as delightful as this one.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","2","22 July 2011"," A modern adaption of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew
","I'll leave my original rant about this movie as an example of what the result is when one listens to ignorance and goes to see a movie with the completely wrong expectations. My friend originally told me that this movie is like Daria, and as such I went expecting to see Daria, and was very disappointed. However, upon learning that this movie is actually Shakespeare, taken from 16th Century Padua, and placed into an American high school, it changes substantially. It does not necessarily mean that it is any better, but at least one can approach the movie in the way that it is expected to be approached. This movie is supposed to be 'The Taming of the Shrew', and we have the main characters in the play (Katerina, Bianca, the father, but not by the name from the play, Patrucio, though he is named Partick Verona. We also have some suitors for Bianca). However, despite the similarities to the plot, and the characters, this film is not really Taming of the Shrew but rather inspired by it. The most significant difference is that this movie is a lot tamer than the original, which is not surprising since heavy criticism can be brought against the original for its treatment of women. We note that Patrick Verona is nowhere near has devious as Petrucio. However, we note that the reason as to why the girls' father does not want them dating until after high school is a fear that they will become pregnant. However, because Katerina has pretty much become incredibly anti-social, he believes that he is safe by allowing Bianca to date if Katerina dates, which Bianca does not believe this will happen. The play is somewhat different, and no real reason is given as to why Baptista wants Katerina married first, with the exception that he does not want to be left burdened with an unruly daughter. One could go on and on comparing this film with the original play, however I believe that the intention of the film makers was not to make a better film than the play, but rather to make the play more accessible, and palatable, to the modern audience. Like in She's the Man, I think they have succeeded.<br/><br/>Okay, 10 Things I Hate About this movie: 10) The person playing Kat did not seem to fulfill the role that well. 9) Bianca was too nice 8) None of the people in the movie were losers. 7) Kat was not sarcastic nor was she capable of talking back to people. 6) Alex got Bianca in the end. 5) Bianca liked Alex and let him know it. 4) The character changed halfway through the movie. 3) Kat was too emotional 2) There was no Kevin and Brittany equivalent. 1) This was nothing like the TV show Daria. In compiling this list I was comparing it to Daria as my friend claimed that it was like it. There are similarities, but generally the characters are quite different. If the makers were trying to copy Daria then I feel that they failed. I say this because Kat loosened up in the end and Bianca easily tied herself to a guy. Daria is very critical and simply doesn't care about anything - Kat is simply rebellious. Quinn is an airhead and loves leading guys around, Bianca simply wants a boyfriend but her father won't let her have one. Finally all of the ""normal"" people in Daria are portrayed as losers, they are not in this movie. I guess I am being too critical about it because I was expecting something else. It seems to be a little like Daria, but it really falls far short. I was really disappointed that the guy that Kat falls for in the end seemed to change character during the movie, and the only thing he really did was to stop smoking. At the beginning he is portrayed as being rebellious, scary, and very intimidating, but he quickly changes around and I don't think it is because he is ""misunderstood"". Kat is not misunderstood, she simply does not care. That is the theme of the movie, what is popular is not always right and what is right is not always popular. This is inscribed on the back wall of the English room (I really did like the English Teacher - probably his blackness had something to do with it). The father was interesting: he was paranoid that his daughters would become pregnant but he was going far beyond what is considered sane. I really can't think much regarding this movie, it was okay, funny in spots, and the school building was beautiful, but other than that it does not stand out that much. Don't worry if you miss it, your not missing anything outstanding."

"DICK STEEL","7","1","2","1 July 2007"," A Nutshell Review: (DVD) 10 Things I Hate About You
","10 Things I Hate About You is one of your typical teenage romantic comedy, loosely based on William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Taking place over a semester with the introduction of new kid on the block Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and culminating in the school prom, the movie has a surprising number of sight gags and plenty of pop music throughout, so much so that it really does have a bloated soundtrack which seem to give a whole extended music video feel to it all.<br/><br/>As with plenty of the Bard's stories, there's quite an ensemble cast assembled, starting with the Shrew herself Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), two sisters who are living under their father's strict house rules of no dating until graduation. Despite Dad's ultra protective nature in having his daughters live out his worst fear of being impregnated, the rules do get modified - Bianca can date if Kat dates, and that in itself is a tall order given Kat's nasty I-don't-give-a-damn attitude.<br/><br/>And the suitors in competition are none other than Cameron, who's after Bianca, and his rival the school heartthrob Joey (Andrew Keegan). As with Shakespeare's stories, expect a little strategizing and some mistaken intentions at certain points, with Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger with that trademarked frizzy hair) being roped by the two men to woo Kat, thereby freeing them to go after the girl of their dreams.<br/><br/>Without gazing into the crystal ball, you'll know that Patrick will probably fall for Kat for real, and thereby complicating matters, affecting even his own chances. For the most parts I thought where in the movie will the title be referenced, because it doesn't seem to be the case, but when it finally is included into the plot, it's actually quite an emotional, moving piece.<br/><br/>The introduction perhaps inspired Pretty Persuasion, with the orientation of the rookie in the school premises, pointing out the various cliques and school politics. The supporting casts, especially the school teachers, were fun and totally opposite what you might consider proper conduct. And I thought it was pretty fluffy material until the romance between Patrick and Kat touched upon impressions, and the building of walls as a defense mechanism to fragile hearts. I thought that was a pretty frank outlook, with the characters mentioning it as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>Still, don't expect the masterpiece although it's based on a classical play. The editing and narrative flow do seem to be choppy at times, with transitions proved to be quite abrupt, allowing me to suspect that some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor for some reason, except to smoothen the flow. It's quite jarring and sticks out like a sore thumb, but nonetheless it's still a fairly enjoyable movie for a lazy weekend afternoon."

"Phantasm01","9","1","2","1 August 2006"," Great teen flick!
","Being an advocate of the claim that you can find good movies in every film genre, it's always nice to see movies coming out to support my point! The genre of teen movies is considered by many as an easy target for criticism, which of course is not completely unjustified. Nevertheless, films belonging to that genre are not necessarily full of flaws. ""10 things I hate about you"" is such an example.<br/><br/>I have not read Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" so I cannot say if the script of ""10 things I hate about you"" is close to the Bard's original work, from which it was inspired. What I can say though, is that ""10 things I hate about you"" is a fresh, witty movie with sharp dialogs and a rather interesting set of characters.<br/><br/>The plot: What can you do when your high school love interest is not allowed to go on a date with you, unless her older sister first goes on a date herself? What about becoming an ally with your main rival in order to find a guy capable of dating the older sister?<br/><br/>Larisa Oleynik plays Bianca, the pretty, always in fashion but rather shallow, younger sister. Kat (Julia Stiles) is the older sister. She is the one that has to go on a date first, if her younger sister can go out too. The problem is that Kat is unpopular and ""incapable of human interaction"". Bianca immediately catches the attention of Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), the likable, smart (how else would he be able to learn French so quickly??), and shy, new boy on the block. Cameron with his friend (David Krumholtz, in a role that provides some good moments of laugh) will have to try and persuade the wild and scary Patrick (Heath Ledger), who may not be that wild and scary after all, to go out with Kat. Of course, there is the ""bad"" guy, played by Andrew Keegan, who will try to mess things up, just when everything seems to lead to a happy ending.<br/><br/>I especially liked the Kat-Patrick couple. Stiles and Ledger definitely have the required chemistry and are able to make us believe how their relationship gradually develops into genuine love.<br/><br/>Apart from the main characters, a big asset of the film is the supporting characters, like the English teacher (who makes a habit of throwing Kat out of his class, without any apparent reason) or the sex-obsessed counselor (who tries hard to find fitting words for her new novel...)<br/><br/>Overall, ""10 things I hate about you"" offers quite a number of moments of genuine laughter, without ever resorting to cheap or crude humor. It is a movie that you will enjoy, if you know what to expect."
"rosemaroc","10","1","2","24 May 2006"," Delightful humor, surprisingly sensitive and realistic, excellent acting!
","When this film came out in theaters, the title itself repelled me; I expected a shallow plot from such a title. But after seeing Julia Stiles in several films, and Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, I became curious and rented the video. I did not expect to watch this movie three times, but that's precisely what I've done. <br/><br/>This film is so much fun. It contains upbeat, intelligent humor (even for this over-fifty female), and it has a lot depth as well. I could particularly identify with ""Kat"" (Julia Stiles' character), not because of her ""bitchiness,"" which we see on the surface, but because the anger, pain and self-loathing reflected beneath her ""I don't give a rat's ass"" attitude was so poignantly and sympathetically portrayed. Stiles is a talented actress, bringing sensitivity and a quality of tension, frustration, hope and despair through the moods and angst of her teenage character. <br/><br/>Heath Ledger is delightful as Patrick, the ""bad boy"" whose reputation is larger than his real life persona. In fact, it is Ledger's understated facial expressiveness that indicates his character's increasingly engaging personality. Ledger's character brings forth an unexpected quality of wisdom in his interactions that both surprised and pleased me. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Stiles and Ledger dances between charming and incendiary, innocent and wise, graceful and awkward, humorous and sensitive  quite as one would expect two teenagers on the brink of adulthood to act. Well done!<br/><br/>The supporting characters are also well defined, though they are a little bit stereotyped, but it is their agendas, of course, which create the action and push the plot forward: Because of their father's fears, Kat and her younger sister are not allowed to date until after they graduate from high school. This doesn't bother Kat because wants nothing to do with guys, but Bianca desperately wants to go out. On a whim, their father changes the rules: Bianca can date when Kat dates. Bianca, Cameron and Joey (the two guys who want to date Bianca) and Cameron's ""master-mind"" buddy Michael contrive find a way to get Patrick to date. And from that, all manner of delightful chaos ensues.<br/><br/>As with many supporting roles, the characters of Bianca, Cameron, Joey, and the girls' father bring other dimensions into the mix. Though they are subordinate to the leads, their agendas generate the action. Several other minor characters (the guidance counselor and the literature teacher) add to the tapestry of interest and humor, giving the plot a quirky humanity, and an unusual depth for this type of film.<br/><br/>Will I watch it again? To quote a potent line in a more recent Ledger film, ""You bet!"""

Putting these things aside, however, you will be entertained (putting all disbelief aside).  It is a decent movie, but few scenes ""stick"" in your mind and your recollection of the movie will become ""yeah, it was good.""

The big problem I have, though, is that it follows the IDENTICAL (aargh!) template to every other teen film ever made, campy Shakepeare references notwithstanding. I must admit I'm getting a wee bit tired of seeing a social outcast having to be convinced to go to the prom/dance/house party (She's All That, Carrie 2) where she can find out she was just a bet (She's All That, Cruel Intentions, Carrie 2), although the striptease on the kitchen table is indeed a new wrinkle. Please, stop putting grunge chicks on the screen and trying to convince me they're the ultimate sex symbols (Carrie 2, The Craft, The Faculty). I already know that. Cease and desist with the nerd wins babe routine (Can't Buy Me Love, The Faculty). I've tried it, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Couldn't Touchstone, with their oodles of dough, have given us something the least bit creative?

","I am late to have heard about this ensemble comedy but got it at the Video Rental Outlet before seeing Julia Stiles' new film this weekend (""O"").  She holds her own in both commendable movies and displays ""star power"" against the mostly second-tier co-stars.  I don't know much about Heath Ledger but he's sort of like Kevin Costner in the PRINCE OF THIEVES Robin Hood-vehicle of a few years ago: his accent needs clarification in such ""red,white, and blue"" American surroundings.  This film sadly lacks the appealing love of a local context (Seattle, Washington) that a drama-comedy like SAY ANYTHING (1989)had for its high school protagonists; yet it does have some authentically funny moments via excellent set-ups and punchlines.  Borrow it and enjoy the updated give-and-take of a romantic comedy that doesn't need pre-marital sex to explain all of the longing that teens have always felt about each other.  I do have some consternation that the single major African-American female character comes across as two-faced and petty but the film's English teacher succeeds and one-ups the History teacher of FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (Ray Walston) with a truly funny series of in-class Shakespearean assignments.  Well worth your rental fee!  Rating 9 *'s out of 10 *'s."

","Though I really love teenage high school comedy, this film just didn't work for me. The characters seemed two-dimensional and often acted totally without any motivation, without any heart. Julia Stiles does not work with Heath Ledger, and the Baywatch boy certainly did not work at all as junior casanova. Some of the actors seemed too young, some too old, and the plot was often so cheesy that it was not only hard to swallow, but also hard to bear.<br/><br/>So all in all, we watched three teenage movies that evening and this one was the worst.

","""10 Things I Hate About You""<br/><br/>""Disturbing Behavior"" director David Nutter complained loudly that his film was taken away from him and cut to shreds. MGM executives said that to appeal to the teen market the film had to be short and no shot should last more than 4 seconds. ""10 Things"" seems to come from this school of thinking. It's a miscalculated film that feels like it was trimmed quite a bit. Certain scenes are very slapdash, and the whole film seems to edited to make the littlest possible effect on the viewer. I was also not duped into finding it clever just because it's source material is Shakespeare. That's an idea that needs to go away for about 20 years. The reason it worked in ""Clueless"" is because Amy Heckerling in a vastly talented director, not because of the gimmick.<br/><br/>Leads Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger seem to be appropriately talented actors. They have a nice chemistry in this movie, and the best scenes are of when the two just stay still and talk. The rest of the actors are just a bore. Larry Miller plays his millionth role as himself, and it's still not funny. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is introduced as one of the main characters of the film, but without explanation is pushed aside, becoming a supporting player by movie's end. David Krumholtz showed a comedic spark in last year's ""Slums Of Beverly Hills"", but saddled in this with lame sight gags, he cannot make an effect. The rest of the cast is predictably a Hollywood version of High School students.<br/><br/>Director Gil Junger comes from a extensive TV background. You don't really need to have that information to see that ""10 Things"" is really just a glorified episode of ""Saved By The Bell"". Packed to the brim with a shockingly schizophrenic soundtrack that blasts a new tune every 30 seconds, this is another case of shameless self-promotion. I detested a lot of this movie. And I wished that it could have been more. But what I question the most is why this film is praised by some critics. I'm not opposed to having fun at the movies, but when it panders to the lowest common denominator, then I ask ""wassup wit dat?""------------ 1"
"Little1-2","10","1","2","3 April 1999"," A twist from your average teen movie (this has depth and character development)!!!
","Wow. Of course this movie has it's typical I can tell what's going to happen moments, as the large majority of movies do. But the acting quality, the relationships between the actors, and the budding stars casted make this movie phenomenal. I must rave about all of the cast, but particularly Julia Stiles. She is fantastic. I saw her on NBC's ""The 60s"" which was not very good, but she made a huge contribution to help pull if through. It was her acting quality that made me return to watch the conclusion on the second night. Anyways, back to the movie. Larisa Oleynik was also very good at bringing the character of Bianca through her metamorphosis, as you learn to like her character.<br/><br/>Based on Taming of the Shrew, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), a sophomore, is told that she cannot date until her older sister, Katerina (Julia Stiles), a senior, does. (the father actually changed the rule to this from his previous ""no dating till you've graduated"" rule). Throughout the movie you see the setup of he lovable Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) of trying to find a match for Katerina (Kat) so that he can take a shot at the seemingly-unobtainable Bianca. Follows the general plot of Taming of the Shrew. Of course you have a happy ending, but I won't tell you what that is.<br/><br/>The innuendo-ish comedy and the slight language and the drinking and stuff they say gave it the rating. And maybe it isn't appropriate for the any-bit naive pre teen, all teens get the idea. I am one myself. I may not experience what happens there but I definitely know it exists.<br/><br/>****1/2 (4  1/2 stars)"
"cofemug","10","1","2","2 April 1999"," The best teenage movie of recent times (late '90s)
","I LOVED this movie.  This is everything a teenage movie should be and more. It takes ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" and modernizes it, and also places it in a situation that is more suitable to kids.  ""Cruel Intentions"" stunk because it was kids being like adults.  This movie avoided the total stereotypes, and showed that everyone has reasons for being the way they are.  It also shows that most people have more than one side to them and that most people are not all smart or all dumb.<br/><br/>The acting was some of the greatest acting for teen movie in years.  They were so believable, and the characters were not over done.  I'll admit, Cameron and his sidekick were a little cheesy, but isn't teen life?  My favorite characters, Kat and Petruchio (now, Patrick) both remained as mean as ever.  I walked out of this movie with a smile on my face from acting alone.<br/><br/>The plot was different but the same from ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  They had to change the plot because what happened in ""The Taming of the Shrew"" would not fly in modern times, especially in only dating situations.  I was happy with the changes.  At least they came up with plausible reasons for the occurrences, and the reason for why the taming worked.  They did not over-exaggerate anything in the movie.  Everything was played as it should have been.  I laughed my butt off.<br/><br/>Run don't walk to this movie, and see it often.  That is how much I liked this movie.  It is great for teenagers, and I think that everybody, including adults, should see this movie.  It is not bubble-gum, you're-a-moronic-teenager, let's-see how dumb-you-are movie, this is a great movie.  I highly recommend it.  However, those of you who do not like drastic changes to the classics, stick with the Elisabeth Taylor, Richard Burton version of ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  For the teenagers out there, I hope this inspires you to read the play.  Read as much Shakespeare as you can, he rocks.  Take it from me, I have read six of his plays this year already.---------10"
"ReddTabb","8","1","2","2 April 1999"," Quite good, even for a modern adaptation
","10 Things I hate about you, was, in fact, quite a well done movie.  It's based on the Shakespeare play The Taming Of The Shrew, where one popular sister cannot get married if the other, and anti-social 'shrew' dosen't. The movie had to be changed for today's adolescents, but sticks true to the orignal plot line.  The acting is well done, especially on the part of Julia Stilles, who plays 'Kat', the 'shrew'.  Larissa Olyneik is well-cast in the part of Bianca, and Joseph-Gordon Levitt makes a good showing as Cameron. Larry Miller is hilarious as their up-tight obstetrician father, who feels all men are evil, and only want to get it on w/ his daughters. 8/10."
"Meredith-7","5","1","2","13 November 1999"," Tries way too hard
","In the past year or so there have been a number of 'teen films' loosely based on concepts of classic stories and books. 10 Things I hate About You is probably the worst one I have seen so far. From the onset it tries far too hard to be cool, to have a look and feel that will appeal to the teen masses. The only probably is it really slams you in the face with its brutal approach to teen love, rather than taking the sweet route ( She's all that) or the sexy road ( Cruel Intentions), it just tries to exist by shoving the principal story line down peoples throats. The acting is atrocious, although its hard to determine whether thats the fault of the actors or the one dimensional stereotypical characters that they have been forced to play. There are a couple of scenes that are not too bad, but most of the time the viewer is left cringing at the antics of the immature and irresponsible teens and parents on show. The main problem with this film is it has absolutely no point to it, its not even entertaining. A total waste of time and money."

Of course it is based on the old well-known story, so everything is predictable, but still I expected something more...

","Larisa wasn't in the movie as much as I'd hoped. She was very attractive, but played the traditional popular spiteful sophomore. She flaunted lines like ""Oh, you're so cute. What was your name again?"" when Levitt was trying to teach her French. She wore lots of small, short, and tight clothing which was definitely a plus. However, the lack of development in Larisa's character and the over development of the butthead personality where things did happen, stunted my enjoyment of the scenes she was in.<br/><br/>Kat was my favorite character, due to the fact that I feel I can relate to some of her dealings in life. She was knocked up by Keegan's character one time, and she decided not to do anything anyone else was doing. This is the cause of her rebellious attitude. She is definitely a hardcore rebel with a marvelous body to boot. She executed the role of Kat perfectly, which made the movie what it is.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was full of stereotypical sluts (Larisa's best friend for example), whiggers, jocks, Starbucks coffee drinkers, nerds, and others. For a relatively old (2 years) script, the movie did a very good job of portraying a 1999 high school. The movie was a tad on the slow side, but I only looked at my watch once during the entire movie (the more looks, the worse the movie).<br/><br/>I really loved ""Ten Things I Hate About You"". The translation of Shakespeare into a modern work is a tough one. The writers did a magnificent job. The acting was perfect, especially with Julia Stiles' Kat. Perfect in every case except for Larisa Oleynik's Bianca. Don't get me wrong, she's a wonderful actress especially in 3rd Rock and Alex Mack. However, she did not pull off the job of Bianca Stratford as I had hoped she would.<br/><br/>C+ for Larisa's job. A- for everyone else's."

","1. The pathetic, one-dimensional characters, with the exceptions of Bianca, Patrick, and Kat.<br/><br/>2.

That either Kat's transitions were edited out or she spontaneously bounced from bitch to lovable and back again, giving no reasons at all.<br/><br/>4. That Cameron and Bianca looked too young for high school while Patrick, Kat, the nerdy guy, and the model looked old enough for college.<br/><br/>
5. That the school band, consisting of maybe two dozen total members, practiced on the same field as every other athletic team in school AT THE SAME TIME.<br/><br/>6. That they never identified the band ""letters to cleo"".  I'm sorry, they're not popular enough to recognize by SOUND, much less by sight.<br/><br/>7. That Bianca's prom dress was inspired by ""I Dream of Jeannie""  meeting Clueless.<br/><br/>8. That there was an entire relationship developed with the Shakespearean angle, with the nerd and Kat's friend, for no reason and with no logic.<br/><br/>9. That this much sexual content and foul language was allowed in a PG-13 movie, AND<br/><br/>10. That I really didn't completely hate this movie. While it didn't even have the low level of charm that Shakespeare's original dull play had, the actors were cute and the jokes occasionally funny. Very few of the characters matched their analogues in Taming of the Shrew, but for this movie it didn't matter.  While I feel that I wasted my time seeing this, I'm voting it a 4, very high for a movie I didn't even like."
"cricketbat","5","1","3","4 February 2020"," Too immature for its own good
","10 Things I Hate About You is too immature for its own good. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make the leap to raunchy R-rated teen comedy, but were too scared they'd lose the tween audience, so it falls awkwardly in between the two. There are parts of this movie that I like, but if you're looking for a good film adaptation of Shakespeare's famous comedy, I'd recommend watching 1967's The Taming of the Shrew starring Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton instead."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","9 December 2016"," A bit generic and predictable at times, but the charming young cast makes it work
","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is an American movie from 1999, so this one will soon have its 20th anniversary. The director is Gil Junger and the two writers are Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith. For the trio, this is probably their most known work, even if ""Legally Blonde"" is nothing too shabby either. The story in this 1999 movie is also connected to a Shakespeare work. Anyway, looking at the cast, this film we have here is also for them a contender for most known work, except for Ledger perhaps where it's gotta be the late actor's Oscar-winning work. But it is especially true for Styles and Oleynik and probably also for Allison Janney and Larry Miller who I recognized. I myself really loved to see Larisa Oleynik in here as I have been a big Alex Mack fan for a long time. I don't mind Stiles at all, but there's no way she'd have gotten my preference over Oleynik's character. I'm with JGL on this one. It still makes me a bit sad to see her career peak at that point already. That's how much I like her.<br/><br/>This 90-minute film is a bit of cult classic now and even younger generations still know it, even if some of them have not even been alive when it came out. I cannot really see why though. The characters are not really written with a whole lot of depth and they are either 100% good guys or bad guys. And with ""good guys"", I am referring to all the 4 people at the center of the film. Maybe the film's popularity comes a bit from the fact how cool and likable they all are, even if they may be very different. And then there is the romance aspect of course and I can see all these girls falling for Ledger's character the way he fell for Stiles'. The story sadly is nothing too amazing either and the character transformations all feel a bit for the sake of it and not really that authentic. But I don't blame them. I guess they did what they had to do to get this movie into all kinds of teenage hearts and in many of these, it has its safe place until today.<br/><br/>This is really the epitome of a generic, yet charming, teenage-oriented movie that is a mix of comedy (sometimes working well, sometimes not at all), romance, drama, coming-of-age and relationships between teenagers and parents that most audience members could really relate to as they've been through similar scenarios themselves already. All in all, to me the most memorable aspects were probably the three protagonists and JGL to a lesser extent, but also because of how generic and forgettable he was written. It is a bit of an omission how the story of his and Oleynik's character moved further and further to the background the longer the film went as all the focus is on the other soon-to-be couple. And yes it is a very predictable film. If there was anything ever in doubt, then maybe only who would get together with whom and maybe JGL's character possibly getting together with Stiles eventually because the story starts with him. I did not like the way the film speaks negatively about Oleynik's character on several occasions. She is not promiscuous or so, just a regular teenage girl and you can't blame her (not even you, Heath) for not being such a different person than her sister. She is what 95% of girls are. But she still stands out just like every one of these 95% do because everybody is a unique individual. I would not call this one a unique film (or on the level of ""Mean Girls"",) but it is still a relatively good work overall and definitely worth seeing once. I give it a thumbs-up and suggest you check it out."

It's obviously for teenage girls and gay guys, and not meant to please anyone else.<br/><br/>Its a movie based on Shakespears The Taming of the Shrew. A new kid comes to the cliché high school and gets a big crush on a girl. The girl is out of his reach and she has the hots for another boy who's full of himself. The new kid at school thinks he can get the girl if he can show her how sweet he is and keep her attention long enough. One problem is in the way and that is the girl can't go on dates unless her older sister can. Her older sister is an individual and doesn't ""need"" a man so the new kid and his new found friend come up with a big scheme to get the older sister a date and ultimately get his crush close to him...<br/><br/>Teens...ugh...is there anything more pathetic than high schoolers? This movie tried so hard to hit on EVERY teen cliché ever put on film. It tries so hard to be ""hip"" and cool and makes my stomach churn with disgust that the world is full of people like this.<br/><br/>The writing was nothing good here, it was something you have seen a billion times. The directing wasn't meant to be great and it wasn't, production was run of the mill and all it offered was a so so soundtrack by many hot artists at the time.<br/><br/>I hate most of these teen actors and this one was full of crappy leads. Julia Stiles actually auditioned for the role of the younger sister and I think she would've done better at that. She does much better as a snobby teen cause she looks the part of a stuck up B*tch, not the part of a ""cool"" rocker chick. I guess though shes rather ugly and doesn't look like the kind of girl a guy would crush over. Heath Ledger is a horrible actor, esp. in his early years. Its sad he started getting better just before he died, but here he didn't amaze me at all. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a decent teen actor and looks so much like the cool innocent kid we all knew and loved back in high school...kudos to him, I also think his friend in the movie David Krumholtz does a great job.<br/><br/>Principal Perky (Allison Janney) was hands down the best character on the whole movie even if she only had about 5 minutes of screen time. Andrew Keegan would've done so much better in Ledgers role, but Ledger could not have pulled off his part...So I guess the casting is my biggest flaw with this film, also many of the extras kept looking right directly into the camera and god if I noticed it, why couldn't the director.<br/><br/>I gave it 2 out of 10 because I didn't completely hate it. I have seen worse. I can only suggest it to the teen flick/ chick flick lovers though.. I hope to never see it again"

","As a teenager myself, it is sickening to see the way teens are portrayed in this film. Shallow with their minds in the gutter 24/7 and blatantly disrespectful. Although it might be accurate, there is no excuse for this film to be pretty much promoting this kind of behavior. I did find some parts quite funny, but mostly they were sick jokes which made me flinch and I don't see how anyone could find them funny at all. But I suppose in order to appeal to the larger teenage audience they made everyone into a stereotypical teenager. Surely they could have made the characters a little more believable instead of the only things on their mind being parties, vanity and sex. And people today wonder what has gone wrong with young people. Movies like this certainly don't help. I find it disgusting and insulting. At least the movie was right about something. To quote Kat, ""I guess in this society, being male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time."""

This seems unlikely as Katrina is forthright and opinionated to the point of alienating almost all her school. But Cameron hatches a plan, he encourages the schools rebel, Patrick (Heath Ledger) to approach Katrina, hoping that if successful, his path to Bianca has been cleared.<br/><br/>Time has not been kind to ""10 Things"". One aspect of that is not in the least related to the film itself. The untimely passing of its leading man casts a shadow over watching any of this films. There's a melancholy to seeing him, knowing that this is one of the few movies he made. Away from that, the film has aged badly, the visuals for the opening credits look awful, musically (though there's the odd good song ) it is mostly terrible, even the film stock (of the version I saw) looked like it had seen better days.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that the film is awful, the performances are nice and the script raises a smile from time to time, there's a definite wit to it. The story perhaps is less solid, there could have done with a few more story beats to convince me that there is actually something to the relationship between. . . well, actually either of the principle pairings. It also unravels pretty quickly if you start to apply any logic to the situation. The dad has a ""no dating until college"" rule in force when the film starts, why does he open up the loophole of dating when her sister does, what actually constitutes ""dating"" anyway. Bianca is alone with Cameron, away from school grounds on a couple of occasions.<br/><br/>Whilst I appreciate that some people love this film, looking at it constructively, 20 years later (how old is J G-L anyway he looks the same!) it's a decent, if slight film with a couple of classic moments, but a few bizarre ones.

I don't want to assume that the many people who worked on this movie didn't care about it, but somebody along the way sacrificed the story for jokes. Now since it's a comedy, that's not such a bad thing, but really good comedies make the story work with the laughs rather than competing with them. There's definitely a story here, but I really wish it had explored the motif of societal expectations a little more deeply. People's expectations and ideas of what is normal are discussed a lot, but these discussions are used to fix plot holes instead of giving the story a unifying theme.<br/><br/>The characters were okay, but pretty two-dimensional. The conversations between Kat and Patrick about how people perceive them were distractingly on-the-nose. I would have liked there to be a little more attention given to Bianca and Cameron because I think they both had internal problems that weren't really treated like problems. Bianca is really superficial and unconsciously uppity, and Cameron is blinded by Bianca's physical aura, but neither of them ever suffer for their faults. The minor characters are mostly there for laughs, and they deliver by and large. <br/><br/>Going back through the dialogue, I'm realizing how many witty lines there are throughout. The issue with that is they don't serve a whole lot of purpose and don't feel that realistic. Still, the actors own their lines for the most part, although Julia Stiles masks her inability to act behind a decent stage presence. There are a couple of plot holes, the most obvious of which is Joey's system for paying Patrick to date Kat. If Patrick really wanted to, he could have just prolonged the process to get more money out of Joey, but this possibility was ignored. <br/><br/>This is good if your looking for a decent comedy, though it's not John Hughes. I kind of felt like it wanted to be a dramady, but the people in charge decided to make it more of a comedy in order to make it more marketable. I don't know how well it does justice to the play it is based off of, but I doubt many people will be offended by the mutilation of a play they were forced to Sparknote (is that a verb?) in high school. So, it could be kind of a fun way to spend 90 minutes with some friends, but it's no great work of cinema. Overall rating: 6.7/10."
"aasthat-98209","5","0","1","5 April 2017"," My love to this great actor Heath Ledger made me watch this film. Don't put your high expectation from the movie though!
","Well, I remember watching this film when I was a teenager, and that time I used to like all the movies that are sweet and simple and not complicated enough that I couldn't get them. But, then I introduced myself to the world of great cinema, with awesome directors like Stanley Kubrick, Woody Allen, Fellini(few more), I just couldn't connect well when I saw this one again. This movie failed at that point while I was expecting it to give me something extraordinary, as it was just plain drama. So, if you're in that mood where you don't want to think and just lie down and watch something with popcorns, you can just go ahead and watch this. But, not if you're looking for something substantial."

","Meet Kat (Julia Stiles) the meanest outcast girl at school; whom younger sister Bianca (Larissa Oleynik) is the popular girl of the school and wanted by not one boy but two boys (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Andrew Keegan). Only problem is that Bianca can't date until her sister goes; in comes the mean boy of the school Patrick (Heath Ledger). Trouble is guaranteed.<br/><br/>The film is adapted from William Shakespeare's play 'The Taming of the Shrew' and while the film references quotes from Shakespeare; there is no need to be a fan to enjoy this film. It can make you laugh within minutes of the opening scene with the number of jokes riddled throughout the script; it really is a laugh a minute film. Including the sarcastic motions and attitude it is perfect for a person who has dry humour. With the opening song 'One Week' by the Barenaked Ladies you can predict the film is going to be packed with amazing songs and it is; Joan Jett, The Cardigans, Save Ferris and Letters To Cleo to name but a few. <br/><br/>""Go Behind Enemy Lines""<br/><br/>The story introduces our entire main cast within the first few minutes of the film (all major actors of their time) when Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is shown the breakdown of his new school by Michael (David Krumholtz). This is the precise moment when Cameron develops a major crush on Bianca and finds out that she can't date anyone. In comes the plan to get Kat to date Patrick so that Cameron can date Bianca. Scheming, Parties, Decent, Singing and Suspicion that follows in the story are to the expectation of the audience. <br/><br/>With all the cast and the supporting actors (Gabrielle Union, Sarah May Pratt, Larry Miller, Daryl Mitchell, Allison Janney and even David Leisure) holding their own performances to a high quality; it is quite the perfect romantic comedy. The small role that David Leisure has is so memorable, with comedic timing that it is a scene that won't be forgotten easily. The director shows that they know what they're doing; with noticeable scenes conducted in motion and in rotational movement. With the added music to a scene that would be silent or empty is faultless; in even the smallest scene. Though the ending is thoroughly predictable it is satisfying with the only omission that there should have been some more drama between the sisters; particularly towards the ending"

","At the beginning, I thought this movie was going to be absolutely dull and incredibly stupid because the therapist really put me off haha! She really didn't give us audience a good introduction to be honest!<br/><br/>Anyways, my god, Heath Ledger really looked like a teen in his 20's like! I mean, I wouldn't consider him the hottest but the handsomest actor that I've ever seen. I have seen Brokeback Mountain and he has really come a long way from acting in his first Hollywood movie which is this til his death. I couldn't believe he actually sung in the movie, it was really such a surprise, it's so amazing how well known actors can break their shells by showing off their singing talents in some of their films. Heath really has the voice of a rocker, he really needed to do that in his other movies. It would be awesome!<br/><br/>I'm also surprised in this film because while you can see there are jocks in the movie, they never got the chance to hurt anyone especially the Tony guy and his gang. They probably must be the kindest people around even if they look threatening xD"

","All in all the film in my opinion was indeed very predictable. It was a chiche girly movie which is not my cup of tea :/ I watched this film as my friend recommended it, and we do have very different movie tastes so.. As soon as the movie started progressing , I knew that Patrick and Kat were going to fall for each-other even though Patrick was first paying to follow her and make her think he likes her, and after a while they both truly start falling for each other.. Also very predictable that Joey was not going to be with Bianca but instead Cameron was. There's nothing that particularly caught my eye, probably the only thing that caught my eye was Patrick's good looks and his accent (played by Heath Ledger) Would recommend this to people who like a lot of romance, chick-flicky type of films :)"

","10 Things I Hate About You (1999): Dir: Gil Junger / Cast: Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Andrew Keegan, Larry Miller, Joseph Gordon-Levitt: Teen comedy about the things we love about people and the ways they sabotage those traits with destructive behaviour. Typical teen setting introducing sisters whose widowed father forbids dating. The popular jock pays a new student to go out with older sister while he snags the younger. Predictable formula directed by Gil Junger who elevates the genre with the right casting. Julia Stiles holds strong as a young woman graduating into adulthood and dreading it. Heath Ledger steals scenes as the misunderstood teenager who is the target for the bet. Andrew Keegan plays the scheming ex-boyfriend who wishes to exploit others. Most of the performances are solid but Larry Miller as the over protective father has a few great lines but ultimately his role is straight forward. He forbids males making claims on his daughter but we can sense that he will lighten up by film's end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the guy pursuing Stiles and basically screws up. Well made teen flick that isn't very demanding but it lacks the edge of superior teen flicks such as The Breakfast Club or Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I can think of ten reasons to hate this recycled teen drivel but teenagers may look past the familiarity and think of ten reasons to love it. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

","'10 Things I Hate About You' is atory about a teenage girl and guy who are mutually repelled by each other but thrust together by a fellow with a large crush on her sister. Predictably, their mutual dislike eventually melts into something quite different. While mom is out of the picture, dad is comically overprotective. The plot deals with topics of interest to young adults, but is generally weak and escapes being a candidate for the dustbin only by good acting from Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. The overuse of Northwest scenery also held my interest. To summarize, unless you were born after 1990, there are plenty of better things to do with your time than watching this film."

","There are good and bad things about this film. First, the bad, there's an over-reliance on teenage movie character archetypes; the good looking sensitive rebel (Heath Ledger), the semi-intellectual rebellious feminist rebel (Julia Stiles), the seemingly vapid princes with emotional depth (Larisa Oleynik), the slightly goofy and sweet natured nice guy who inevitably gets the girl (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the conceited mean-spirited athlete/model (Andrew Keegan). There's also a few teachers and parent authority figures thrown in with only slight character development. It's a reworking of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew with Heath Ledger in the Richard Burton role of Petruchio and Julia Stiles in the Elizabeth Taylor role of Katarina. That's a heavy pair of shoes to fill and this Shakespeare-lite teenage comedy that is intended for an audience that's probably largely illiterate in the classics."

","So let me get this straight....a dull feeble minded (un-husky) father makes a decision to let his daughter Mandella date a guy if Kat dated, kind of dumb and unappealing in the other way its sort of smart, which captures people's attention, both Kat and Cameron are linked and so as the bad boy burlesque who's the riveting hole in the story, but don't you think its kind of wrong to use people Gil Junge, or were you raised by animals. The acting was the superb and i kind of thought Kat's poem was elegant and the whole love in first sight between Cameron and Mandella was so cliché, i wanted to hurl.

Not only are the characters irritating and unreal but the actual story has no plot to it. I honestly don't know how they managed to fill almost 2 hours with it.

","Modern versions of Shakespeare can often fall flat on their faces, and there were times while watching this when I thought '10 Things I Hate About You' was one of those failures.<br/><br/>Bianca and Kat, transposed to American high school and aiming to go to the Prom, mirror Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' characters to a point - however, this Kat is just a sarcastic, roll-eyes, typical teen we've seen hundreds of times before.<br/><br/>This film's Petruchio becomes Pat, an arrogant rebel (played well by the late Heath Ledger in his debut movie role in the US). At first he pursues Kat (spiky but effective Julia Stiles) as a bet but, guess what, the path of true love ...<br/><br/>One of the best scenes is the 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' song in the stadium, but even that becomes a cliché and despite its charm, doesn't really work.<br/><br/>This film is OK. It has its moments and some touches (Kat's poem instead of her 'big speech') which work well, but in the main it suffers from the usual teen movie problems - bad language, cardboard background characters, tedious back-plots (which have little to do with the Shrew source).<br/><br/>As Shakespeare for the masses it is fun, pacey, and fairly true to its theme.

","Romantic comedy about high school sisters different as night and day. Bianca Stratford(Larisa Oleynik)is cute and popular, but her extremely strict father(Larry Miller)will not let her date until her older sister does.

Cameron(Joseph Gordon-Levitt)wants to date Bianca bad enough, he pays tough guy Patrick Verona(Heath Ledger)to try and take out Kat. Sex-related humor and dialogue plus drug and alcohol scenes account for a PG-13 rating.

Thought this was completely out of character and an unnecessary scene. Apart from that, highly recommended and an entertaining film. I especially liked David Krumholtz as the comedy relief, he is far more convincing in this role than he is in 'Numb3rs'. It was also really nice to see an Aussie actor in a leading role in this kind of film (teen comedy/ rom-com) and nice that his career is doing so well.

","I saw this once before during my secondary school days, possibly in one of my classes, I knew it was a modern retake of the William Shakespeare story The Taming of the Shrew, in the similar field to Clueless, but I had to see it again to get a better opinion, from director Gil Junger (Black Knight). Basically Cameron James (Inception's Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the new student at Padua High, shown around by his new friend Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz), told about the different types of student that he will be hanging around. On the tour he notices beautiful second year student Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) and has an instant attraction to her, and neither is her older indie rock loving ""shrew"" sister Katarina 'Kat' (Julia Stiles) does, and she is not allowed to date either. But their father Walter (The Nutty Professor's Larry Miller) changes this house rule, Bianca is allowed to date, but only when Kat starts dating, but of course she is not interested in dating at all, so Cameron has to find someone who can turn her around. Michael decides to help him by tricking pretty boy jerk Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) that he will be able to get Bianca if he pays outcast Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Kat, they seem a good match though because they are both as rebellious and ill-tempered as each other. Patrick does go along with this plan for the money, and he does everything he can think to convince Kat that he does have a thing for her, and meanwhile Cameron tries to get closer to Bianca, who is of course pestered by Joey. After winning her over with a rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" in front of the soccer team and with the help of the school band, Patrick has truly fallen for Kat, and he happily invites her to the prom. Bianca and her do attend with their father's permission, Cameron is happy to be taking his love interest as her date, but Joey finds out, and he confronts Patrick about their deal, loud enough for Kat to hear. While Joey is punched and lying on the floor, and Cameron and Bianca are happy and share their first true love kiss (second technically), she and her sister are closer because of the dilemmas, and Patrick wins Kat back buying a guitar she wanted and convincing her he really loves her, and they have their first kiss. Also starring Susan May Pratt as Mandella, Bad Boys II's Gabrielle Union as Chastity, Galaxy Quest's Daryl 'Chill' Mitchell as Mr. Morgan and American Beauty's Allison Janney as Ms. Perky. The cast all do their parts (some possibly a little stereotypical) really well, Stiles memorable as the sulky older sister, Ledger as the cool good looking guy who doesn't play by the rules, and Gordon-Levitt as the nice guy wanting the girl. You can recognise the Shakespearean elements in the story, and being set in a modern high school it makes the story still very engaging, and it gives way for some good music, a good teen love story with some funny moments, and a film that is fun for the adolescent and adult audiences, a fun romantic comedy. Very good!"
"LingXiaoyu","7","0","1","30 March 2005"," One of the better teenage comedies
","To be honest with you, I've never really been into these teenage comedies. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the better ones, tho. It's slightly based on the Shakespeare play Taming of the Shrew. It's about love (what else?) mostly, but it also has some other qualities plus attitude! My favourite character must be the all-around tough and rough chick Kat Stratford played by Julia Stiles.<br/><br/>To play out the basic plot, there's two sisters, Katarina and Bianca Stratford. Kat is the outsider, attitude-girl who pretends never to have cared for anyone. Bianca on the other hand is real outgoing, smiling girl who boys find attractive. Neither of the two sisters have been allowed to date boys, it's strictly denied from them by their overprotective father. Bianca can date when Kat does, but that never appears to happen. Two boys have a crush on Bianca and the rich boy pays a guy to date Kat so he can date Bianca. But what the rich boy doesn't know, is that the other boy, Cameron, is dating Bianca behind his back. And Kat doesn't know that the boy who seems as if he had a huge crush on him is just really been paid to go out with her.<br/><br/>The best thing in this film is definitely the music, especially the music Kat likes in the film. I'd love the soundtrack, it's definitely in my wanted-list! If you like a nice, humorous teenage romantic comedy, this is the one to get, I assure you. It just doesn't get any better."

"traptc","Null","0","1","10 August 2003"," Remake that rips the heart and soul out of the original
","Suppose, one day, a group of film makers decided to make a remake of ""Die Hard."" Only, instead of having John McClain save the day by shooting Hans, they have him save the day by buying Hans flowers and serenading him with love songs. Afterwards, John and Hans embrace passionately and go paintballing together.<br/><br/>Well, then you'd have a good idea of what I thought of ""10 Things,"" a remake of ""Taming of the Shrew"" where they try to make the ""shrew"" too sympathetic to be shrewish, and there isn't any actual ""taming"" involved.  True, I doubt that the studios would have allowed Pat to tame Kat by starving her out until she learned to say ""Thank you,"" but the LEAST he could have done in this movie was play hard to get.<br/><br/>The original story had potential.  For instance, it could have been a story about how nice guys will be viewed as doormats.  Instead, the filmmakers go the exact opposite route and turn this into a cliche ridden feature with no real sense of truth. Instead of trying to ""tame"" Katrina, Pat wins her over by trying to be all sweet and mushy. Any edge that the story might have had is lost, and the film is reduced to being yet another teen movie for 14 year old girls.<br/><br/>If you liked it, I wouldn't be surprised, plenty of people did.  But as for me, I'd have to rate it a zero.  A remake that misses the main idea of the original is a pretty poorly done remake."
"Mexiward","8","0","1","13 July 2003"," Enjoyable
","This is a really enjoyable film which doesn't try to be too clever or to make you cringe.  The soundtrack is excellent which helps tell the story as the film centres on young people learning about love, life and heartache, which is what most songs are about, isn't it?  I haven't seen a film with as much vibrant colour in it before, and the use of the colour helps the film in the sense that it's a happy, light hearted positive film.<br/><br/>This is a film for the girls, but it's a lot more enjoyable for for blokes than most romantic comedies. I think the idea of having the girls' father as a maternity doctor was brilliant.  For those of you who haven't seen the film watch out for the way he deters his daughters from making out with boys by making them walk around the house in a pregnancy mock-up with all the padding and bulges etc.  The fathers one liners throughout the film help keep the pace going and help in preventing it getting to mushy. Over all this is an enjoyable film that you could watch with your younger brother or your Gran as it is inoffensive, has no swearing, and has no nudity.  What it does have is a great script, great cast and great soundtrack.  Enjoy."

","Ten Things I Hate About You tracks down a very simplistic storyline and blends it with semi-cheap humour on the quest for, what all teen movies search for, love and lust.  In an effort to date the girl of his dreams, a young school boy has to make a plan in which to be able to date her.  First he begins learning French and starts tutoring her in a subject he's hardly great at himself.  <br/><br/>The girl's older sister, an angst-ridden, femme-rock loving, bitter girl hasn't dated for years.  The two girls' father tells the youngest that when her sister dates, she can begin doing it herself.  Next thing you know, the almighty head-over-heels boy starts a scheme in which to hook the older sister up so that he can make his move.<br/><br/>The movie is entirely predictable and cliche, and, other than an appeareance at the high school prom by Save Ferris, is highly worth missing.

","Okay, this is like ""Taming Of The Shrew"" with the cast of ""Daria"".  But unlike ""Daria"", every character has a brain and flaws that make them overrule it at times.  The humor is sharp, sarcastic, and hilarious (the scene where the father explains, ""I'm down, I've got the 411,"" is one of my favorites).  It also has a lot of heart as it avoids most cliches and treats the characters realistically.  A simple kiss is not what it takes to convince others of true emotions.  Admittedly, having the father more concerned about pregnancy than, say, ""AIDS,"" makes it a little tough to swallow, but his concern is genuine, as it Kat's.  There's a lot of energy, and it was good to hear Madness playing again, even if it was a song from the early 80's.  Unlike most movies with romance as the lynchpin, you believe in these characters, root for things to work, and wonder what will happen next when they don't.  Easily worth full price, but see it early. There'll be fewer noisy teenagers in the audience (trust me, I speak from experience)."

Watching from that point, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie -- so much so, in fact, that I went back to see it again from the beginning.<br/><br/>Perhaps that was where I made my mistake.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes have a number of dubious lawn flamingoes (stuff which is purely there for decoration) -- the guidance counselor writing the porn novel, some really cheesy introductions of characters, and the like.

","I'm going to keep this short because I don't think this movie deserves much more than a quick kick- preferably to the groin around which most of its humor seems to be based. After flashing her soccer coach to get her sweetie out of detention, our heroine Katarina explains herself by saying, ""I used my wits."" And you know what wits rhymes with, dontcha? Geddit? It's an embarrassing admission by both the heroine and the writers of this nasty flick. While Shakespeare's Katarina was witty, smart, and intimidating, this Kat is nothing but sarcastic. She doesn't even seem to be able to get the better of the dumb pretty boy set up as her arch-rival. This Kat has boobies where Shakespeare's Kat had brains. It's an unpleasant trade-off, even if you ignore the disturbing image of a high school girl exposing herself to a teacher. I hear the producers handed the leads Cliff's Notes of ""Taming of the Shrew"" on the first day of production- a gesture both tellingly condescending towards the young, and futile. Excluding a few clumsy references, this script doesn't bear any resemblance to Shakespeare's play. They should have kept a copy for themselves."

","1999 was a year for dumb-ass teen films. Fortunately, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't one of them, I, surprisingly, largely enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>
10 Things I Hate About You focuses on cute, affluent sisters Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katarina (Julia Stiles), the former as sweet and popular as the latter is mean-spirited and sulky. Their dad (Larry Miller) has imposed a house rule that Bianca can't start dating until her older sis does - not the best news for besotted Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). In order to win the saccharine sophomore, he plots to find someone willing to date Kat - the ideal candidate being loner-with-past Patrick Verona (Aussie newcomer Heath Ledger) - and the inevitable sparks fly.<br/><br/>I expected this to be just like She's All That and Drive Me Crazy, but this film is so cuddly, clever and cute that you can't help but have a blast watching it. The performances are great, Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger, both newcomers, have a marvellous on-screen chemistry and they have a promising future. All the characters are properly developed and the film paces itself brilliantly, therefore resulting as one of the better, more carefully worked out teen films of the year. There are faults, of course, the film is extremely predictable and some of the performers sometimes becoming annoying, but otherwise, this film is no less that a good, strong teen flick. <br/><br/>Recommended for a bit of fun on a weeknight, mostly for teens, but larger audiences may also find this entertaining.<br/><br/>I rate 10 Things I Hate About You 7 out of 10."

","In the vain of She's All That and Can't Hardly Wait, comes Ten Things I Hate About You. I loved it. The story focuses on Cameron, the new kid at school, who falls for Bianca, the gorgeous girl of his dreams. The only problem for Cameron is that Bianca is forbidden to date unless her ill-tempered, completely un-dateable older sister Kat goes out, too! So to solve his problem, Cameron singles out Patrick, who can match Kat, the mysterious bad boy of the school, with a nasty reputation.<br/><br/>Firstly, Australia's Heath Ledger was fantastic in this movie. He played the role of Patrick Verona ( the bad boy at school) perfectly. I look forward to seeing him in more films and if you haven't seen him in The patriot, then you have missed a truly great performance. Katrina Straforti (Kat for short) was played by Julia Stiles and she did every mood swing in the film perfectly. As Pat says to Kat, `You're not as mean as you think you are', there relationship is one of the key factors of the whole movie! While Kat's younger sister Bianca, played by Alex Mac star Larisa Oleynik was great too. She shows the potential of being a big star one day. Finally the movie itself has many twists to it and the title in many ways tells you what the flick is going to be like. So if you are dying to see a good teenage flick with a difference, be like me, go to the video store do yourself a favour and hire `Ten Things I Hate About You!' <br/><br/>Rating: 4.5/5 Stars or 9/10."

Yet all the kids in the film are appealing, and I can see that boy from 'third rock' is showing some talent for comedy.

","... Actually, I won't bother to count to make sure that I've got ten. Indeed, the film as a whole I rather like.  The crucial thing is this: Julia Stiles plays a likeable character, and so does Heath Ledger.  (I see they're letting Australian actors retain their accents.  Excellent!)  I was surprised to see that, MOST of the time, the script managed to treat the characters with respect.  A love story involving these two is worth watching.  If the backbone of the film is sound then the makers can afford to muff some of the inessentials.  To proceed:<br/><br/>*  One of the characters is a fan of Shakespeare and Shakespeare is the subject of one of the classes.  Why doesn't someone NOTICE all the parallels?  `West Side Story', after all, kept the fact that Shakespeare had written a play on this very subject tactfully out of sight, and that's the way it should be.<br/><br/>* The English teacher should be fired.  If not for his campaign of harassment against the only talented member of his class, then certainly for performing a rap version of Shakespeare's poetry to make it look `hip' and `relevant'.  Indeed, performing rap AT ALL would be misdemeanour warranting a small fine in any enlightened state.  So many other villains get their come-uppance in this film - why not him?<br/><br/>* Speaking of which, why is it considered necessary for films set in high schools to have a score consisting entirely of songs?  Is it to remind us how many people out there are allergic to music without words?<br/><br/>*  There's too much gratuitous pairing at the end.  Really, there's ONE couple whose fate is worth following - the rest can go hang.<br/><br/>*  Why does the climax always have to be an end-of-year dance?<br/><br/>Gee, that's only five.  Oh well.  I mean, this film is no masterpiece, but it's decent enough - there's no reason to be too harsh."

","I came at this movie thinking another teen movie that's good for a smirk, but this was a hell of a lot better. It was just funny, I'd never really laughed out loud at a teen movie but I was really laughing. The funniest put involved bianca's dad he was the best. The only part i didn't like was andrew keegan's character, I know he was for lack of a better word the ""villain"" and you're not supposed to like him but I really hated him. It just p***ed me off when he was on screen. Besides the one guy this film is great and I suggest you see it."
