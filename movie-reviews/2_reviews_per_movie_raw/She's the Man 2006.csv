"cdelacroix1","8","148","180","18 March 2006"," First Rate Teen Flick
","I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.<br/><br/>I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).<br/><br/>Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!"
"soli1313","9","170","210","22 March 2006"," outrageously funny!!!
","I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I can't remember a movie where I laughed SO hard -- literal out loud, deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. Granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end. The actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. The actors were perfectly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","33","39","4 August 2006"," Yeah, a bit predictable, but still enjoyable
","I have to be honest, I really had a good time watching She's the Man. Despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother. She also has a girl who is chasing after her. Well, the tag line says it all.<br/><br/>This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes did prove something in the film, it's really hard to really act like a guy. :D Well, it's true! <br/><br/>8/10"
"Robert_duder","9","69","87","20 March 2006"," Roll in the aisles funny, a real blast!!
","She's The Man was everything I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type ""chick flick"" films and I knew this one would be great!! In the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You (one of my all time faves) She's The Man is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines, and physical comedy I have seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script, ""Three's Company"" style story of mistaken identities, and mixed messages, and the cast.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is a star!! Even since the days of the horribly campy (yet strangely entertaining ""The Amanda Show"", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. Her style of physical comedy, impersonations, and witty dialect makes her hilarious. Previously her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well made ""What A Girl Wants."" If that wasn't her break out vehicle than She's The Man takes care of that hands down. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. It's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next ""It"" girl. She is the All American, cute, down to earth, bubbly teen (although she's twenty now) and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen. But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! She actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable. Not entirely...but believable enough. Most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious, non stop laughs. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's ""Havoc"" by plays Duke. He's the jock, the captain of the soccer team, and eventually Bynes' object of affection, unfortunately he's also Sebastian's room mate (who is Bynes.) He's a good leading man, and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (who again is Bynes.) She does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is astonishing...they are absolutely believable as twins and further more, from a distance you could understand someone believing Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum but everyone is more or less supporting Bynes terrific performance. She easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film. Relative newcomer director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this film. He weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together. The story which is loosely based off of Shakespeares Twelfth Night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film. It's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think. There isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film. Nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down!!! 9/10"
"badlydrawn1777","6","59","78","18 March 2006"," a mind-numbing delight
","Now I would just like to say that I love this movie for what it is. Namely, a smart and hilarious teen flick that is at its best when its staying with ""the funny"", and completely sappy and or cheesy when it attempts anything else. ""She's the Man"" had solid comedic acting from Amanda. She has really grown as a comedian, and I look forward to seeing her in future roles. The film also had enough pretty people to make the setting nothing like any normal person's high school. I don't know else I can say other than this movie made me laugh way too loud, even for a movie theater, and I had to stifle my chocking laughter numerous times with my coat. i highly recommend this movie to anyone in need of a few laughs and some mindless dialog"
"Nugen10","10","159","229","10 March 2006"," She's The Best!
","I got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in Brea and I have been crazy for it ever since. The film is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night which I have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so I certainly liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not it won't matter - the movie stands on it's on. It is super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious and so was David Cross. Actually the whole cast is great - I just happen to be a huge David Cross fanatic. The cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few I hadn't heard before but I know they have a CD coming out so I will definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!"
"peppermintbuddi","10","87","123","21 March 2006"," Absolutely Hilarious
","I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew it was going to be a funny movie, but it was funnier than I expected. Sure there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me up. I thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were good in acting out this comedy. I have to give kudos to Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they were funny as well. Of course there were moments where you yell at the screen ""how can you not tell?"", but that's all part of the fun. In the end the plot turned out pretty well. There's a happy ending, but what'd you expect. <br/><br/>Overall,just hilarious."
"Lauren_Simpson","6","106","153","16 March 2006"," Bynes and Company Score a Hat Trick
","Though I hate to admit it, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have scored again. ""She's the Man"" is a ridiculous but ultimately entertaining teen movie which takes the gender-bending action of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" and drops it in the middle of a modern-day American boarding school. The premise should sound familiar because screenwriters Lutz and Smith also penned ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" another twist on Shakespeare, starring the likes of Julia Styles and Academy Award nominee Heath Ledger (before he was an Academy Award nominee).<br/><br/>It's more of the same, of course, but seeing Shakespeare's work go Hollywood, and, thus, be ripped to shreds, continues to amuse. ""She's the Man"" also focuses on a decidedly less bitter heroine than the shrew, Katarina, played in 1999 by a very stilted Styles. If that makes the film less witty, who cares? Not half of this film's target audience, who came mostly to see Channing Tatum with his shirt off.<br/><br/>Like Kat in ""10 Things,"" Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a tomboy and a soccer star on the women's team at Cornwall Prep. Her life is soccer, which becomes a problem when her school cuts the women from the sports program. Better than most of the boys, Viola wants to suit up with them but is snubbed by both the coach and the team's captain – her boyfriend. So it's ""end of discussion  end of relationship."" Viola hatches a plan to pursue her sporting dreams at rival school Illyria, where her twin brother has just enrolled. Twin brother, Sebastian, is skipping off to England for two weeks and nobody at Illyria has ever met him.<br/><br/>If you missed the set up, read ""Twelfth Night."" It's pretty obvious what happens from here. Viola disguises herself as her brother and moves into the dorms where she meets her roommate and fellow soccer player Duke (Channing Tatum). She begins to gear up for Illyria's season opener against Cornwall and has to navigate a complicated love-triangle, in addition to other challenges like taking a shower alongside her male teammates, without them finding out about her girl parts.<br/><br/>In reality, nobody who looks like Bynes could get away with impersonating a 17 year-old male. Viola is too pretty to be a boy; in other words, dressed as her brother, she makes Orlando Bloom look like a frost-bitten lumberjack. This fantasy aspect doesn't detract from the film, though. Viola puts on her wig and fake sideburns and, suddenly, she's the most socially awkward nerd-boy you've ever seen. Suspension of disbelief works.<br/><br/>The Sebastian disguise doesn't have to be convincing. What matters is that all the other characters are oblivious to facts that are obvious to the audience. The laughs come from seeing Viola get away with a ridiculous scam. In one scene, Duke and fake Sebastian hug each other, but Viola slips out of character and gets a little too friendly. It's not that homoeroticism or homophobia are inherently funny, it's the knowledge that Duke is disturbed by being frisked by someone who is actually a girl that makes us laugh.<br/><br/>Other than that, ""She's the Man"" offers audiences the simple pleasure of Amanda Bynes who seems to be a natural in comedic roles. Her Sebastian/Viola is definitely a caricature but it's a perfectly illustrated one. From her mixed-up half southern, half Canadian drawl (her misguided version of the typical teen boy cadence), to her crotch grabbing and Eminem-like posturing, Bynes has a lot of fun and, as a result, the jokes land.<br/><br/>It's a teen movie, so the ending is typical and cheesy. While sister film ""10 Things I Hate About You"" had a wild feminist streak in it and touched on somewhat weighty issues, such as the pressure to have sex, ""She's the Man"" lacks a serious undercurrent. But this is probably a good thing. ""10 Things"" was, at times, too earnest and moralizing. ""She's the Man"" doesn't pretend to be more important than it is. It'll earn a spot on the shelf, in between ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Legally Blonde."" (And, like Reese, maybe Bynes will win an Oscar in 10 years. Anything is possible – just look at how ""Crash"" won Best Film.)<br/><br/>Copyright (c) 2006 by Lauren Simpson"
"phillipstephenso","9","44","63","12 May 2006"," Charming
","This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. And the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming coming of age movie."
"golfervaughan","9","71","108","17 March 2006"," Amanda Bynes is hilarious
","This movie is a great movie, however it is, as most movie highly predictable. The greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. She is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the most strangest and gut-busting faces ever made. It's good for the kids, and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. All in all, they did a good job updating an old classic, and deserves to rest on the movie stand along with O and 10 Things I Hate About You. The other actors also do a swell job, in many of their first time debuts."
"five0to180","8","12","15","18 March 2006"," Surprisingly enjoyable.
","At first, I honestly thought it would be a corny movie. But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast (Especially that character played by ""Bullet tooth Tony"" from Snatch. What a contrasting role between those two movies!). Now, i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not, but her act, especially, was thoroughly enjoyable. Even though the plot devolved into a teeny-bopper love triangle (though very funny) half-way into the movie, I feel that this shouldn't discount, what I think, the movie really is: simply entertaining. So if you happen to stumble upon it, whether by DVD or theater, i'm confident that you'll enjoy."
"bingbazy","9","78","124","2 March 2006"," Dorm Daze meets Motocrossed
","I saw this film at a special screening. At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The movie is based on the Shakespeares book ""The Twelth Night"" This movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer. Well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school. On her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love, lies, and deception. This movie is this years Mean Girls. I think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie."

","When the Cornwall school cancels the women's soccer team, the player Viola (Amanda Bynes) is absolutely disappointed since the sport is her passion. Then her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) skips class to travel to London to play his songs and Viola disguises herself as if she was Sebastian to join the Illirya soccer team. Viola falls in love for her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) that has a crush on Olivia Lennox (Laura Ramsey) that feels attracted by the sensitive Sebastian (indeed Viola) that is chased by his girlfriend Monique (Alex Breckenridge). Out of the blue, the real Sebastian anticipates his return from London and he is not aware of the situation and has to play soccer game against Cornwall.<br/><br/>""He's the Man"" is a funny and entertaining comedy with a predictable story similar to the 1985 ""Just One of the Guys"". The cute Amanda Bynes does not look like a boy but her performance is pleasant. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Ela é o Cara"" (""She is the Guy"")"
"christian123","6","10","13","18 May 2006"," Completely Corny yet Still Very Entertaining
","Viola Johnson (Amanda Bynes) enters a prestigious boarding school disguised as her brother, so that he can run off to London to become a musician. Unfortunately, she immediately falls for her male roommate, who already has a crush on a girl who now has a crush on the male version of Viola.<br/><br/>Combining the story of ""Just One of the Guys"" and Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night may sound like a recipe for disaster but She's the Man is a funny, charming and cheesy movie. The original trailer looked really lame yet the film turned out to be quite enjoyable. The story is clearly nothing new but it still works fine. The fact that the screenplay is written by Karen McCullah Lutz explains everything. She's good for harmless, fun films like She's the Man, Legally Blonde and Ella Enchanted. Andy Fickman does a decent job as the director. He never lets the film become too serious or else it would ruin the movie's appeal. He does overload on a few lame jokes though. That was the major problem I had with this film. Some of the jokes just fell flat while others were just incredibly cheesy, even for this film.<br/><br/>The acting was good for this type of movie and most of the actors were enjoyable to watch on screen. Amanda Bynes is full of charm as Viola. It was very hard to actually hate her and she's a much better actress than Hilary Duff. Channing Tatum was not as strong as Amanda. His performance was okay, sometimes his reactions were a little fake. Laura Ramsey plays Olivia and she gives a decent performance. Alex Breckenridge gives a pretty good performance as Monique. Her character was pretty interesting and she had decent chemistry with Amanda. The rest of the supporting actors are good except for David Cross. He plays the school principal and his performance was not funny at all.<br/><br/>If you do give She's the Man a shot then keep in mind that the entire film is highly unrealistic. I was reading some of the posts here and a few people are bashing the film for that. While the movie is pretty entertaining, it's also easily forgettable. It was a fun way to spend 100 minutes but it won't stay in your memory for long. It's also not just a chick flick and a guy could also like the movie. In the end, She's the Man is worth checking out whether that be in the theaters or on video. Rating 7/10"
"Tim Hunter","2","24","39","5 April 2006"," She's not the man at all, she's just embarrassing!
","I went into this film not expecting much, so in that respect, I wasn't disappointed, but even then, I can't believe how dire this film really is. Amanda Bynes as the cross-dressing Viola/Sebastian takes every opportunity to mug for the camera, and reinforce the gender stereotypes that always plague such teen comedies. It's so full of over-exaggerated types, that it seems like the filmmakers took a teen comedy proforma and just ticked the boxes: spunky/pretty/feisty girl? Check. Spunky but dumb athletic jock boy? Check. Ditzy frou-frou mom? Check. Gay best friend/hairdresser needed for makeover? Check. Beautiful but unattainable girl who really is shy? Check. I could go on. What's most disappointing is that this film had a real chance to say something, albeit through comedy, about gender roles, cross-dressing and even sexual attraction, but backed away quickly whenever it got close. The concept of same-sex attraction isn't explored at all in the film: when Duke finds himself attracted to 'Sebastian'; he just says it'd be 'weird'. I'm just giving it 2: one for the all the scenes where Channing Tatum and his hot friends are topless, and one because you can't really muck up Shakespeare that much."

","While on spring break my mom, dad, 9 year old brother and I went to see She's the Man. Being a teenage girl I could not wait for this movie for many reasons.

We got to the theater and of course my dad was being grumpy and complaining about the previews and how we wouldn't be out of the movie until after dinner. Continuing with his current mood, 25 minutes into the movie my dad turned to the rest of us and said, ""You guys owe me big time.""

So I knew the play well. I was very exited about seeing this movie and when I saw it it exceeded my expectations. It kept a lot of my favorite lines and I could see big connections to the play. Though it was like the play it was not as complicated. It was also more of a chick flick than I expected but it was good. It was very funny. It pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies. You saw how viola (Amanda Bynes) thought wrongly about what guys thought and her complications in living in a guys world. You also see her room-mate, Duke's(Channing Tatum), impression of this. I really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme ""Follow your dreams"" but this time it has a twist. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved soccer and stuck up for herself and her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars."

Viola loves to play soccer but, her girls soccer team get's cut because not enough girls signed up, the boy's team won't let her in because they think she's not good enough.

Viola is there to help, she disguises herself as her twin brother, Sebastian, she then goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team so she can prove that she is a great soccer player just like any other guy!<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie and I hope you enjoy it too!"
"harrytrue","8","4","5","30 April 2006"," Spoilers for both ""Twelfth Night"" and ""She's The Man""-Both Good
","I think a person would be well-advised to read or see (I favour reading) ""Twelfth Night"" before seeing, or re-seeing ""She's The Man"". The movie is good on its' own, but comparing the two, and looking for the in-jokes makes it a lot more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he'd give a thumbs-up.<br/><br/>Harld Bloom said in ""Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human"", that most of the people in ""Twelfth Night"" need to be locked up. Malvolio, the person Malcolm is based on, is-for no good reason. People in ""She's The Man"" are sane in contrast. For instance, Duke Orsino is far more leval than the Duke of Orsino. He also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. He displays a lot of self-control.<br/><br/>It's a teen comedy (a clean one), so it doesn't have the dark edges of the play. For instance Olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother. In the movie, she has been dumped.<br/><br/>If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play, they don't have the same attention in the movie.<br/><br/>The in-jokes are quite often quick. The hairdresser Pauls' last name is given once. It is Antonio. Lots of people who've read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than is just friendship. Deep love between men was noted in those days. Some see a sexual side to it-homosexuality was illegal.<br/><br/>The only line from the play I caught is where Duke Orsino quotes the coach on greatness during the soccar game. In the play, it is said by Malvolio, quoting Maria)."
"lizcarr88","10","8","13","18 March 2006"," This is why I love Amanda Bynes
","Ignoring the fact that the movie is unrealistic and a little cheesy, you will love it! I was already a big Amanda Bynes fan, but this movie definitely made me like her even more. If you enjoy subtle or dry humor, she may not be the comedian for you, but she pulls off over the top humor like that of Jim Carey, Lucille Balle, and Mary Tyler Moore. You may know some predictable jokes are forth coming, but you will be surprised at how they are pulled off and what original jokes are presented. If you are quick to judge a movie, i have to warn you that the first 20 minutes have all the qualities of a straight to television tween movie, but as the plot thickens so does the movie and humor. As you watch the movie, you can actually feel the awkwardness that develops as Amanda Bynes character ""Sebastian"" begins to fall for her male roommate. The humor within the background characters such as Eunice, Malcolm, and Principal Gold is down right silly, but in a hilarious way that makes them stand out. She's the Man won't be winning any Oscars, but that didn't stop me from buying it on DVD the day it was released. It has become my favorite comedy without using the obscenity that Will Ferrel, Ben Stiller and others like them often need to make their movies funny. With the exception of sexual innuendos, it is a fun movie that i think your entire family can enjoy!"

I mean how could it have been with the fabulous Amanda Bynes staring in it! She was amazing, really funny & is still stunning! The boys in it were also extremely fit, one major reason for going girls! The plot is strongly based upon the Shakespeare play 'Twelfth Night', as it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the malvolio like character. The script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty. The football skills in it were also amazing, it even made me think of playing football myself! Anyway, to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance, which gets very confusing! Go and see it!"

Amanda is hysterically funny in this movie, as is the rest of the cast. The way she depicts a teenage ""all-american"" guy is right on target!

"mrw8","7","11","20","15 March 2006"," A fine effort
","Just returned from a screening of She's the man. It's not a cinematic masterpiece. There is no nudity whatsoever. No swearing whatsoever. But still a solid production with strong comic performances from the leads, especially Bynes. The writers are Karen Lutz and Kristen Smith who also wrote ""Legally Blonde"" and ""10 things I hate about you"" Expect the same theatrical set up/punchline/soundtrack dominated flick with more ""Series of Shots"" plot development montages than most people care to see. The dozens of 16 year old girls at the screening (""I told you at lunch that I was gonna sit with Amanda. Cause remember during study hall when that cute Senior was walking by and Amanda asked me first if I would sit with her? Remember?) all loved this movie. I have watched Legally Blonde numerous times on cross country flights and it never fails to disappoint me. Mainly because Reese Witherspoon is despicable and one dimensional. She is easy to hate. Amanda Bynes is a piece of work. Impossible to dislike. She reminds me of Lucile Ball and Ellen Degeneres with a natural sense of timing and uninhibited range of expression. Bynes is adorable. These types of comedies live or die on how memorable the cast is. If the performances are wooden such as in 10 Things I Hate About You, the film fades into dust. She's the Man is a fine effort. I found myself laughing at regular intervals. That wasn't true with Mean Girls because the performances in Mean Girls were not convincing. They seemed too rehearsed. The cast of She's the Man is theatrical to a fault, but the situation demands it. Their performances come across as improvised and authentic. They are going for laughs and mostly get them.

","I have to say, I was completely taken by surprise with this film. I originally thought this would be like Big Fat Liar - not that funny. I found myself laughing every other second - and it was hilarious. My whole entire theatre had a great time. Amanda Bynes is really talented, and should be doing more of these movies! So, lets get to the story:<br/><br/>Viola's (Amanda Bynes) school soccer team was cut because not enough people tried out. When her twin brother Sebastian has to go to London, he asks Viola to get an excuse for him. She decides to take his place, and ends up trying to act like a boy so she can get on the Real Sebastian's School soccer team to get back at her school and her boyfriend.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this to everyone except for little kids. This is way too much for younger then age 10! Everyone else will like it, because Amanda actually is a good actress and really makes the movie great. And in this movie, they make fun of the Cliché's! Finally!<br/><br/>Comedy 10/10 Acting 10/10 Directing 10/10<br/><br/>OVERALL - A++++++++++++++"

","Shes the man is great. its funny, original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat. the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods (man trouble)but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face. The story is a bit out there with the whole no-one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable, the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history. Amanda B. did a great job as the main role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous Duke. So girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls! <br/><br/>All in all a brilliant,fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on DVD when it comes out."
"symeon_chiam","9","4","6","22 April 2006"," Simply delightful!
","I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.<br/><br/>Delightfully, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.<br/><br/>The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. I'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee."
"itsnotezbngashoe","3","10","20","3 April 2006"," If you liked ""Bring it On,"" you'll love ""She's the Man""
","This movie sucked. It made me long for Garfield the Movie. I sat through Gigli mildly entertained, yet I wouldn't wish this on Sadam. Its almost as if Amanda Bynes has a King Midas-like ability to turn everything she touches into refuse. So if you're looking for a good movie, or even just a movie that is not too funny but at least somewhat entertaining, then go see Ice Age II. Otherwise just save yourself the nine dollars I paid to Muvico Cinemas and stare at your watch for two hours because that's what you're going to end up doing if you go to see ""She's the Man. For further reasoning on why this modern day adaptation of Twelfth Night sucked, here is the review i'm turning in to my English teacher who forced me to sit through this wretched abortion. <br/><br/>For some reason the writers of this movie decided to not only put the story of ""Twelfth Night"" not only into modern times, but into the lives of high school kids who look like they are twenty five and act like they are twelve. The character of viola is bastardized and betrayed almost entirely. Her motivation from the beginning is changed from fighting from her life from a shipwreck and looking for a way to survive and keep herself alive, to having her high school soccer team dismantled. She joins another schools team pretending to be her brother simply to get back at her ex boyfriend even though she believes ahead of time that she will not be recognized by scouts or prospectors for anything she does nor receive any benefit from her efforts at all in anyway because she is pretending to be her brother. Thus, she has no motivation whatsoever and is not a realistic character. <br/><br/>The characters Toby and Andrew are also abandoned. they are simply friends of Duke and therefore become friends of Sebastian. They have nothing to with the story. They are simply fall back characters to toss lines to whenever writers couldn't think of anymore substantial dialogue for Duke or Viola and needed yet another lame sexual innuendo to fill the dead air time,lest the audience actually listen to the story. <br/><br/>The name Malvolio was used but in such a poor and shamelessly vain way that you cant really give the movie any credit for having such a character. In ""She's the Man"", the Feste character loses his pet tarantula and passes out fliers. On one of these fliers is a picture of the spider and the name Malvolio. This is thrown in for no other reason than to remind you that you are watching a movie based on Twelfth Night, and trust me if they didn't continue to shamelessly point that out you would forget it very quickly.<br/><br/>So do yourself a favor and do something else with your time, maybe read or something,, maybe even Twelfth Night. Just don't make the same mistake i did because i will never get back to two hours of my life that movie stole from me, good luck"

","She's the Man is a fresh and entertaining chick flick following the same league as MEAN GIRLS. The Story,loosely based on the Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night, given a modern touch.<br/><br/>the story is quite twisted and funny with an interesting tagline:<br/><br/>Everybody has a secret... Duke wants Olivia who likes Sebastian who is really Viola whose brother is dating Monique so she hates Olivia who's with Duke to make Sebastian jealous who is really Viola who's crushing on Duke who thinks she's a guy... When her big brother decides to ditch for a couple weeks in London, Viola (Bynes) heads over to his elite boarding school, disguises herself as him, and proceeds to fall for one of her soccer teammates. Little does she realize she's not the only one with romantic troubles, as she, as he, gets in the middle of a series of intermingled love affairs. <br/><br/>There are number of colorful characters with funny dialogues.Though it's not as original or as smart as MEAN GIRLS ,it's still fresh and entertaining. The cast is lively, and Bynes really shines in the title role.She was a joy to watch.<br/><br/>For a good,fun time in the cinema this is a great treat."
"cloudmerchant","3","9","19","17 September 2006"," Just Bad
","My girlfriend talked me into renting She's the Man and I will never forgive her for subjecting me to the horror that was this ""film"". The only slightly intriguing aspect was the idea of Amanda Bynes dressed as a boy. Sadly, even that was not enough to pull it off. Admittedly, there were some entertaining lines and I may have laughed out loud once or twice but the painful moments and pathetic, repeated attempts at humor (during Amanda's attempts at faking masculinity) just made me wince and shake my head. If you've recently been subjected to a lobotomy and have lost all sense of what entertainment is, this is the film for you."
"MovieManMenzel","7","11","25","17 March 2006"," ""She's the Man"" tries to be original and funny but the final verdict is very typical and average
","""She's the Man"" is loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"". The movie is about a girl named Viola (Amanda Bynes) who is basically a Tomboy. She loves the game of soccer with all her heart. But when her school cuts the girls soccer team, Viola is devastated and demands that she can be part of the male soccer team. But the coach of the male team denies her request. As she ventures home after the bad news, Viola finds out that her brother Sebastian (James Kirk) is secretly leaving for two weeks to go to London because his band is playing a concert there. So Viola gets the idea that since her brother is going to be away for 2 weeks, she can go to his school, pretend to be him and play soccer for her brother's high school soccer team. How can she do this you might ask? Well Viola and her brother Sebastian are Fraternal twins. So Viola becomes Sebastian and that's where the fun begins.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer for ""She's the Man"", you basically seen the entire movie. I haven't seen a movie in such a long time that really narrows its audience down like ""She's The Man"" does. If you really want to appreciate this movie you have to be a female between the ages of 10 to 16. I mean sure anyone can watch it and maybe have a cheap laugh or two but most will say I seen this movie before or this is just too infantile for me to appreciate. That's what I felt like when I sat through this film.<br/><br/>This movie can be compared to such movies as ""Ladybugs"" and ""Just one of the Guys"". The movie pretty much mixes both ideas together. One problem I had with this movie was the jokes were just so silly and over the top. I sat in a packed theater today and the only ones who laughed at majority of the jokes were those little girls between the ages of 10 to 16. The older crowd including parents and myself just sat, wondering what was so funny? <br/><br/>Also another problem I had with this film was the plot holes. And yes I know this is a comedy and I should have checked my brain at the door when coming into the theater but how did the mother and father not know about both Sebastian and Viola being gone. Furthermore, how the hell did anyone believe that Amanda Bynes was actually a guy? To me she wasn't very believable.<br/><br/>I think the main problem though was that ""She's the Man"" was just too typical of a movie. It followed suit of every lame teen movie ever made. It's predictable, the jokes weren't original, and the movie never produced anything new to help out an already stale genre. It didn't even try to be original nor did it try to appeal to anyone outside the target audience. Good comedies appeal to many people and although they are targeted to a specific group other groups can view them and enjoy them for different reasons then the target audience.<br/><br/>I don't really know what to say about Amanda Bynes. I have never been a big fan of her work and this movie does very little to change my mind about that. I must admit that I always feel I should like her because she always plays such a likable character but for some reason she can't win me over. Personally, I think Lindsay Lohan as an actress has great on-screen presence and can win an audience over but Bynes still hasn't had the ability to win me over yet. David Cross is hands down my favorite character in the movie and in all honesty was probably one of the biggest selling points to get me to watch ""She's the Man."" Although he delivers some nice solid laughs, Cross isn't in the film enough to really shine like he should. He plays such a minor character. The rest of the cast was pretty much just eye candy for the little pre-teens and teenagers who this movie was targeted for. They all did an OK job.<br/><br/>In the end, if you seen the trailer for ""She's the Man"" you have seen the entire movie. If you are between the ages of 10-16 run to the theater at the first chance you get. If you aren't in that demographic well I would definitely wait for DVD for this one. This movie isn't that bad but I just feel it's so typical and average. It's a film that so many have seen before and doesn't add anything new to the genre. ""She's the Man"" is pretty mild and harmless entertainment but it is also very forgettable. Amanda Bynes really needs to start doing movies that appeal to a larger audience than just teens. She may have the ability to be really good but this movie doesn't show it.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""She's the Man"" is a 5/10. A must for teenyboppers but an average film for the rest of us."
"sonidb","10","4","7","19 March 2006"," Watch it, you won't be disappointed!!!
","I saw ""She's The Man"" last night with my friend who saw it on Friday when it came out. I knew that if my friend was willing to pay twice to see this movie, it had to be good. The only criticism I have for the movie is that it jumped right into the story there wasn't much lead in or maybe I was too busy looking at Robert, Johnathon, Channing and James, to really notice otherwise. This movie was so good. I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a while and it felt good to actually laugh because it's funny and not because it's stupid! Having an interesting storyline, with good punchlines and with an amazing cast probably helped. The chemistry between the characters especially between Channing(Duke) and Amanda(Viola/Sebastian)was really great. When Duke and Viola being Sebastian are talking about feelings, in their dorm room, is an awesome scene because Duke opens up to him(her) and he becomes someone more than just a hot soccer player. Viola begins to see his softer more real side and she(still dressed as Sebatian) really begins to like him. I thought this movie was so well done and like I said, you'll laugh!!!!"
"WarlockFate27","10","4","7","19 March 2006"," Totally not expected
","I was definitely surprised at the maturity of the immaturity that this movie gave us. It was hilarious. I was a bit nervous at first that Amanda Bynes would not be able to pull of a movie like this without seeming too childish...but she's proved me wrong. She's definitely gently glided into womanhood and is a true comedic actress. The gags and jokes in the movie are great, there is always one waiting after every minute. The characters are quite humorous, especially the mom, who's a wack-job and Monique who is a psycho beyond belief. Especially if you're in high school, you'll definitely appreciate and understand what everyone is going through in this movie. If you've graduated high school, then it'll be a good nostalgia of what has been, or what could have been. If you're still NOT in high school, then it's fun to look forward to.<br/><br/>But the idea of someone doing what it takes to achieve his/her dreams, it's a powerful plot and by adding comedy to it, it was worth every dime I had.<br/><br/>Once I knew it was near the end, I got a bit sad...a bit sad because you get so entangled by these characters, that you want to know more...you want to know, ""what's going to happen to them?"" ""Are they going to stay together?"" ""Is Monique really that crazy?"" But alas, perhaps these questions will forever be unanswered."
"thecritic-5","10","4","7","17 March 2006"," Very Funny
","Amanda Bynes, David Cross, and Julie Hagarty are perfect in this fun comedy. I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the film 10 Things I hate About You. The only difference between this and that, is that this is even funnier. Honestly if they ever gave Oscars for comedic performances I believe Amanda would be right up there. She certainly deserves a golden globe nod for best actress in a comedy. Very funny stuff. However, David Cross comes in and steals every scene that he's in, same with Julie Hagerty. But the heart and soul of this film is the very funny Amanda Bynes. This is her best film to date. Funnier, smarter and quicker than all of her other ones. This film is a real joy to watch."
"tedg","Null","5","10","15 May 2006"," Shifting Language
","It may be that if you want to understand the evolution of how we reason about ourselves, how we form models and roles... <br/><br/>it may be that the richest place to look is the way teen movies have evolved. Kids are the most sophisticated modelers in society. They are also the audience most limited in concerns, which focuses the abstractions on matters of identity.<br/><br/>The form of the thing is different than the usual teen version of Shakespeare. Its spliced rather than transformed, which means you have two movies intertwined. <br/><br/>The first is the Shakespeare bit about cross-gender disguises and resulting confused attractions. The second is formulaic teen stuff formed out of the playdough of girls-in- sports (which today means soccer or skating) and ordinary filmteen coupling.<br/><br/>The reason Shakespeare chose the disguises was because it allowed him opportunity to build layers of meaning in his phrases, always with one bawdy thread. When you get an audience engaged in following the situation so they can decode the language to get the joke, you've accomplished your theatrical goal. After all, the main thing is about them tricking us into dissolving ourselves in the play.<br/><br/>Teens don't like clever language, not so far as actual words. What they like is nuance in pronouncing the couple hundred they use. See how writer Kirsten Smith  who has experience with this  shifts the comedic arcs from the phrase to how the phrase is delivered? It isn't always successful  meaning the audience doesn't always laugh. But the shift is as palpable as the multiple gender shifts managed here.<br/><br/>This part of the movie really is interesting. Kids manipulate themselves to make their lives simple and the means they use are sophisticated. Just following that is entertaining enough.<br/><br/>The other part, is almost necessarily banal. Has to be, just as the girlish cotillion in the plot is. Will our female soccer player play? Will the team win? Will all the honest souls find a mate? Guess.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

This movie is definitely aimed mainly at the high school/college level people.<br/><br/>Unlike the person who commented that the movie was much like Mean Girls, I didn't see a real connection between the films. The main thing that was the same was the fact that there are people pretending to be people they are not. Also, She's the Man has a story line that almost anyone can enjoy, while Mean Girls was really a Chick Flick."

Brandon Jay McLaren played some excellent football showing real skill on the ball.

The solicitous drippy music was a bit much in spots. As a farce, fairly tolerable, and probably as good as they could have made it given the plot. I didn't come out wanting my money back, but would survive if I never saw it again. I am 60 years old! This may not be a movie for older persons, but its refreshing to see a flick that doesn't rely on violence and sex to appeal to the kids.

Basically a modern sporty update of Bill Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the premise plays out exactly as you would expect. Locker room awkwardness is followed by romantic interference, that in turn is followed by a sugar coated finale as everyone is a winner baby, that's the truth {thank you Hot Chocolate for the last line}. Amanda Bynes is sprightly in the dual role of Viola & Sebastian; moving from a sort of junior Jennifer Aniston to a junior Jake Gyllenhaal with no little skill, and the soccer scene's are competently constructed.

Not like V for Vendetta when I looked around the theater and thought to my self when will this get interesting. I believe Amanda Bynes is a comic genius, maybe the next Lucy.

","On a flight back from London, I watched She's the Man; apparently Air Canada has a crap movie policy. Perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town. Even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian David Cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion, although is is cleverly mixed (with the caveat of mindless plausibility). The ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. I guess if I was a 12-year-old girl, I might have really enjoyed this one."

Was she a graduate of the Kelly Ripa school overacting??? Watch the TV show ""Faith & ""whatever"" to see what I mean. I don't know how to change my vote to 1. Overly predictable, totally lacking entertainment. Rent/buy at your own risk. I very rarely respond to making comments, but................ Good luck!!! I mean it. I am filling out the 10 lines required to make this be accepted. I had an O.K. childhood. My older twin sister lives in Taos. My daughter has a beautiful baby.

","This is an excellent movie. Personally I love soccer and this movie is not only about soccer, but also bring lots of laughters to us! It's outrageously hilarious!<br/><br/>It's about a young girl pretending her brother to join the High School soccer team. She practiced hard, survived, and won the game at last! This is truly a teens story and talks about how teens strive to reach their goals and also finding love and romance!<br/><br/>Although this is not a big movie, it's good for us to relax from all the stresses in college and work!<br/><br/>By the way, my sister thinks that Channing Tatum is burning hot, so you should definitely watch it!"
"Dingataca","Null","2","3","3 October 2007"," Everyone has a secret...
","I thoroughly enjoyed She's The Man, though I'll be honest that I thought it would be a terrible, over the top comedy, I was very surprised.<br/><br/>Its the best film adaption of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night I have seen. I guarantee that its completely worth it! You will definitely get a laugh! She's The Man uses cheesy lines, and gets away with it, as the comedy gags you.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes really proved herself, she did a fantastic job as Viola/Sebastian. Though she does have her moments, she does a great job. Channing Tatum looks hot, and that's pretty much all he does! He doesn't act, he's what I call a ""stand there and look pretty"". The others get away with decent performances.<br/><br/>A brilliant teen rom-com. Watch it!"

","I did watch the movie. This movie is amazing. Its been 3 days since I borrowed the DVD from my friend. Since then i have seen it almost daily. Some scenes are really funny. But some are just very predictable. The cast is good. Had they shown how she changes daily in boys room it could have been fun. And adding to that if someone was able know her truth, that could have added some more twists to the story. The children's party scene was too much. I mean how could she just change without anyone seeing her?? Overall a real good movie. The movie gives a feeling of ""Bend It Like Beckham"" but changes after 20-25 minutes of running.<br/><br/>I give it a 8 as it made me laugh and kept me gluing to the screen throughout the entire movie."
"ninjagaiden007","10","2","3","27 July 2006"," Amanda is hilarious!
","This movie had me laughing nonstop. I saw this twice in theaters and 3 times on DVD. I've laughed out loud all those times. The laugh hasn't increased or decreased. It's a very clever well written plot of an update of ShakesSpeare. The jokes aren't forced and it never tries too hard to be funny. This is the best Soccer movie i've ever seen. A lot better than Kicking And Screaming. Kicking And Screaming camera would never sit still. This director, Andy Fickman really knew how to keep the camera still and really knew how to direct. Very talented director we have in our mists! The acting is superb. I've always loved David Cross. He played in this movie. Just so you all know he plays as annoying character. But that ""annoying"" character is hilarious. Usually when someone's annoying it's annoying, but this time it's annoying that it's funny. He's so annoying that he's hilarious. He has a few great hilarious quotes too. Vinnie Jones plays the rough/tough coach who is very hard-on. This really suites his role. Amanda, however, she is excellent. Amanda Bynes has far more talent than Hilary Duff. Amanda Bynes is very talented. You could tell she really enjoyed this movie. Everyone (even me) is saying that this is Amanda's best movie and it is followed by Robots. I recommend this to any Comedy lovers. 10/10"

","She's the Man was shockingly more wonderful than the trailer led on. I thought that the trailer has shown all the good stuff and that the rest of the movie will consist cheesiness in between the few good scenes. I proudly declare my opinion Wrong, and I was glad that I went to see this hialrious film. This was the first good movie that I have seen for this year and is a great start for the rest of the year. I love the spider scene and the tampon scene the best in this movie.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is a very talented gifted girl. It's as if Lucille Ball, Juila Roberts, Carol Burnett, Marylin Monroe, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon were running over her body in the entire film. She makes the scenes that would be tiresome in any movie pass away with ease. Give this girl a script, no matter how terrible...She would make the movie and her character likable. Lindsay Lohan And Hilary Duff better watch out, the true Teen Queen is coming close to whooping you out of Hollywood. Amanda Bynes has got to be one of the most Versatile actress/actor since the likes of Jim Carey, Eddie Murphy, and Tracy Ulman. She has to play soccer in this film, pretend to be a guy and a girl, a whole gag of hilarious stunts, and so much more! This girl will be a long term star.

","I saw this movie this evening. The movie is very funny and romantic. I like it a lot. I think everyone should go out and see this movie. In the movie, Viola and Sebastian really do look alike.....I mean when Viola dresses as her brother Sebastian. If it was me, I could never ever dare to do that. I would just rather stay as a girl. Imagine me having to go take a shower with all those other boys or girls thinking that I'm cute. I think it's disappointing that the movie didn't make it at least #2 when it first came out.

","THe funniest movie that I have seen in a very long time. There was times when my brother and I were laughing but the rest of the cinema wasn't. Some of the humour in it is very witty. The acting is to a high standard, with very good performances from most of the actors especially: Amanda Bynes who plays a very convincing man, which is quite scary in places, Channing Tatum who plays a very sensitive guy in it who opens up to Viola (played by Amanda Bynes) when she is his room mate which in the end only brings their friendship closer together then Viola is at a charity event when Duke (played by Channing Tatum) kisses is waiting in line at the kissing booth and they end up kissing and Viola falls in love with duke from there on. Amanda Bynes is a very good looking young lady who plays her role well. Channing Tatum (in my personal opinion) is one of the best looking guys in the acting business at the moment, which there are rumours going around Hollwood at the moment that he MIGHT be GAY (I hope so)! He also performs very well in Coach Carter which stars Samuel L. Jackson, about a high school basketball team that is coached by Samuel L. Jackson. Amanda Bynes was very good in What I Like About You, which is set in New York City where she lives with her older sister because her father moved to Japan"
"GiraffeDoor","8","1","1","11 March 2019"," I'm going to say this is the best of the cross dressing comedies.
","Does anyone expect an Elizabethan play converted into a teen comedy to be any good?<br/><br/>Well it is, actually.<br/><br/>I'm no scholar but this was a pretty charming little story of deceit and going under cover which doesn't lay on the sexual politics too thick and instead focuses on being an easy going (but not simplistic) tale of people pursuing the wrong people romantically and then all the right people by the end.<br/><br/>I loved seeing Amanda Bynes, I have tons of nostalgia for the Amanda Show and she actually plays a convincing boy. Seriously, she is so cute in this but I could believe she was male (albeit one that hadn't had puberty yet). And she handles the comic timing and the more poignant scenes better than the Amanda I thought I knew had any right to.<br/><br/>It's a delightful story about being your true self no matter what other people tell you and does it without being heavy handed. I don't know if that's what Old Bill meant to do but this is worth a look."
"sjstaps","8","1","1","19 August 2018"," Great comedy movie!
","Comedy as good as this is hard to find nowadays, and this movie is entertaining from start to end. The script is incredibly well written and gradually built up reaching new heights one after another while keeping the story dosed by letting the viewer take a breath when we see Viola in her natural form. We cant sit back for long as the movie continues in the rollercoaster story with twists and tricks that keep surprising. The characters are well shaped and round to have good amount of empathy for. Althought some of the predictable/obvious scenes could have been brushed up by a little, the movie's use of details, jokes and loads of twists and a keep-home message make this what it is: a great fun piece of love and definitely must-see."

","like each film for teenagers, the fun is the basic purpose. and, in this case, the mission accomplished is the right definition. because Amanda Bynes is fantastic and Channing Tatum did a great job. and , sure, David Cross gives the perfect spice. the references to Shakespeare, the holes of credibility of entire story, the crazy humor, the nice hypothesis, the lovely music, all are pieces of a seductive film, charming scene by scene, easy but perfect for entertainment. so, a teenager movie. one of the most charming."
"oOoBarracuda","7","1","1","21 March 2016"," She's the Man
","Bringing all of the gender confusion and love triangulating of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night to a high school setting was a wonderful way to bring the bard's work to a younger generation. Andy Fickman's 2006 film She's the Man starring Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum remained faithful to the 1601 work of Shakespeare with perfectly modern twists to engage a brand new audience. Much like Twelfth Night (1996), She;s the Man stayed true to Shakespeare's theme of gender confusion, She's the Man also brings secrecy and betrayal to the forefront more so than the bard himself. Even with gender roles reversed and interchangeable, the overarching message in She's the Man is what it means to confide in someone and how damaging it can be when trust is broken.<br/><br/>High school student Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) is a star soccer player on her girl's soccer team. For Viola, soccer is life, which is why she feels as though her life is over when her school's girl's soccer team is cut. Viola and some of the girls go to the boy's soccer team and ask if they can join. Viola is sure that they will comply as her boyfriend is the goalie of the boy's team and has expressed to Viola that her talent exceeds half of the members of his team. When the boys scoff at the idea of having girls on their team and refuse the girls, Viola seeks revenge. Viola then learns that her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk), newly enrolled at a new high school, is fleeing with his band for London and will miss his first two weeks of school. Viola decides to go to the new high school in her brother's place, make the soccer team, and beat her own high school's boys soccer team exacting revenge on her school and ex-boyfriend. Viola didn't expect to fall in love with her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) who is trying to seduce the popular Olivia (Laura Ramsey). Olivia connects with Sebastian/Viola and eventually falls in love with her, not knowing, of course, that Sebastian is Viola in disguise. Calamity ensues when the real Sebastian returns from London early, unaware that he has been replaced at his school by his sister. <br/><br/>The connections all throughout She's the Man to Twelfth Night were a pure joy for this literature buff. The artful ways in which they brought pieces of Shakespeare's tale of the modern day were wonderful. I especially appreciated naming the rival school that Viola attends in Sebastian's place that of the town Viola washed upon after the shipwreck in Twelfth Night. I also enjoyed the naming of the spider in She's the Man to bring about the source inspiration, as well. I especially enjoy a reimagined film that pays proper tribute to the version it is reimagining. The acting is nothing to write home about. It is a teen comedy with younger actors playing teenagers, nothing extraordinary, but all parts were played adequately. The music was the real clincher for She's the Man. The upbeat fun music really made the transformation for the bard's work of aristocracy to the high school halls in a great way.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, and fleshed out in another review, Twelfth Night deals heavily with the theme of gender confusion, likewise, She's the Man does the same with the main character Viola dressing as her brother. What She's the Man does that Twelfth Night didn't do is focus primarily on secrets and betrayal. Much more emphasis was placed upon the secret Viola was keeping from her roommate in She's the Man than Viola's secret she was keeping from the Count in Twelfth Night. It was interesting to see that turn and the prominence placed on secret keeping in the reimagined work. Even the film's tagline begins with ""Everybody has a secret..."". The emphasis on this film certainly lies within all of the mini betrayals between the gender confusion, and all others involved with it. The shift from the curse of love to trust and secrets was an interesting choice and made for a slightly more engaging film. There's something in this film for everyone, and even if you ignore the bard's inspiration in the film, you will still come away enjoying it."
"random_avenger","6","1","1","9 August 2010"," She's the Man
","Viola (Amanda Bynes), a talented football (""soccer"") player, is appalled to hear that her school is going to pull the plug on the girls' football team and that she's not allowed to join the boys' team either. She devises a plan to keep playing: she disguises herself as her brother Sebastian (James Kirk) and enrolls in another school to join the boys' team there. Easier said than done; besides maintaining a credible masculine appearance and behaviour, she also has to deal with criss-crossing romances of her new friends and herself. She likes Duke (Channing Tatum) who in turn likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey), while Viola and Sebastian's exes Justin and Monique (Robert Hoffman and Alexandra Breckenridge) are also in the picture making things even more complicated.<br/><br/>The comedic style is quite noisy and exaggerated, as expected – rock songs are constantly blasted in the background and overacting is not frowned upon. At first most of the humour is derived from Bynes' behaving like an over-the-top male stereotype, but later on the focus is put more on traditional rom-com plot lines; misunderstandings, jealousy and secret scheming behind each other's backs. Football only provides a backdrop for the story, at least until the finale, but the movie was never really supposed to be a sports film anyway, so it doesn't matter that much.<br/><br/>There are funny moments scattered throughout the film, such as the antics of the school's overly friendly principal (David Cross) and the tough football coach (Vinnie Jones), but ultimately the story is a pretty ordinary romantic comedy. Amanda Bynes is at home in the lead role and saves a lot with her youthful energy though, so if complex but comedic love triangles are your thing, you may well add a star or two to my rating."
"jboothmillard","5","1","1","9 March 2009"," She's the Man
","The title speaks for itself, and I had heard of it plenty times, and with the female star of Big Fat Liar, I was certain to try this modernisation of Shakespeare's Twelth Night. Basically Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) gets her soccer team cancelled, and being passionate for the game wants to join the boys team, but they refuse. So when Viola finds out her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) is sneaking to London for a music tour, she decides to disguise herself as him to get into the boy's soccer team. It takes a little while for the boys to like ""him"" and accept ""him"" into the team, but soon enough ""he"" is one of the best players. Things get complicated when a girl fellow player Duke (Channing Tatum) likes falls for Viola as Sebastian, and out of disguise Viola falls for Duke. It was obvious the real Sebastian was going to come back, and in a big soccer match the confusion ensues, but the game is won, and everything returns to normal with the right people getting together. Also starring Laura Ramsey as Olivia, Vinnie Jones as Coach Dinklage, Airplane! actress Julie Hagerty as Daphne, David Cross as Principal Gold, Jonathan Sadowski as Paul, Robert Hoffman as Justin, Alexandra Breckenridge as Monique and Amanda Crew as Kia. It may not witty or funny as other cross-dressing comedies, but Byrnes is a great young lead actress, and it is quite a watchable film. Worth watching!"

I was kind of disappointed that not as many people watched this film but I guess that's the way it is.<br/><br/>This straight out hilarious. I mean it.

I mean, I bet people didn't mind anything from the movies I've mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is so cute that puts a smile to your face. Yeah, she can't act like a guy? So what? She delivers the laughs and so do many other people in the ensemble cast. You also can't help but admit the plot is confusing. If you've read the plot line of this movie, you'll find out why.<br/><br/>This is as funny (and sometimes surprisingly serious) as many of the films I've mentioned above.

I really enjoyed the over-the-top performance of Amandy Bynes. and Channing Tatum is simply hot. and can act as well. I simply adored him being all shy around ""Olivia"". but for some reason Amanda as Sebastian had much more chemistry with Channing then Amanda as Viola. maybe it was intended this way. there was not much of football in it which I didn't mind but there wasn't much of anything else. just another proof that Amanda is an incredible physical comedian. and that Channing should think of making few more comedy movies himself. what I really didn't like was the ""revelation"" it was way too pathetic. even for an American movie. I must mention the supporting cast, they were simply brilliant. the headmaster cutting roses and serving lunch in cafeteria. the not-so-divorced parents. the supportive friends of Viola - I love Paul. but the best one was definitely the coach of Iliria. just for him I would give this movie 10 points. but I cant."

The acting in this movie, in particular from Amanda Bynes as Viola, is so annoying: your toes will curl in every way they can. From the moment she plays a man, she starts doing things with her face as if she is playing a very bad Laurel and Hardy imitation.

"noralee","7","3","7","22 March 2006"," Surprisingly Funny Girl Power Celebration
","""She's The Man"" is a surprisingly funny take on gender roles in high school sports. <br/><br/>As even more loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" than the rock musical ""Your Own Thing"", with just a bit more effort it could have been up to the level of the previous bard teen adaptation ""10 Things I Hate About You"" by the same co-writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith.<br/><br/>The film's good spirits lift it above difficulties that it unnecessarily sets up. Amanda Bynes is plucky but not very physically convincing as an athlete, particularly compared to Keira Knightley in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" or Blake Lively in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"", even with stunt doubles on the field.<br/><br/>She's also not helped by the odd casting decision to surround her with older hunky and beautiful actors and actresses in their mid-20's who would look old in a frat party movie, even if maybe she's supposed to be a freshman among seniors. The jock object of her hidden affection (Channing Tatum as ""Duke Orsini"") only sounds good in a towel, and is so supposedly tongue-tied with girls, that I was convinced by her argument to competitor ""Olivia"" on all the reasons not to date him so I couldn't figure out why she otherwise would want to. His one discussion about what he would really like from a relationship with a girl is very weak.<br/><br/>The script goes out of its way to avoid sexual orientation issues for its below 12 target audience, who I assume are familiar, as I am not, with Bynes's TV work. There's an implicitly gay hairdresser who for some reason hangs out with teen age girls, unless we weren't told that he's a fellow student who works at a salon, and there's several spontaneously enthusiastic embraces between a guy and the disguised ""Viola"" as ""Sebastian"" that turn awkward, but there's not a single homophobic accusation or coming out by any one. If it weren't for the cell phones and Nike symbol on the girls' soccer team uniforms I wouldn't have even thought this Illyria Prep was in the U.S. today.<br/><br/>While it's too bad that the girls don't take up any Title IX cudgels or consider more recruitment when their soccer team is canceled for lack of participation, the film seems to positively say that there's issues of expectations as to why the girls' soccer training isn't as tough, not lack of skills and motivation among the girls. So too bad ""Viola/Sebastian"" stereotypically faints at the sight of a dissected frog in science class. <br/><br/>While not near ""Transamerica"" issues of course, Bynes's mannerisms are not too credible when she's being a boy (though the quick edits of her trying to learn to imitate boys and her quick switching at a carnival are fun), but she's at her best as a rebel at the ball. Unlike other girls' sports movies, there is an intriguing parallel story about débutante expectations that skirts the tomboy issues by showing that girls can knock down opponents on the field then get prettied up and get the guy too.<br/><br/>Too bad many of the positive images of women are lost when scantily clad cheerleaders suddenly appear to shake at the soccer match, but maybe that was to balance the many guys in the shower scenes in case director Andy Fickman thought this could ever possibly be a date movie. (The few teen boys at my matinée showing were clearly there to mock the film.) They do try to PC up the side story of the geeky girl in glasses and braces, but she's played too much for stereotyped laughs before she too gets a guy when she becomes a bit of a swan.<br/><br/>David Cross's principal was silly, but Shakespeare had clowns too.<br/><br/>Though there's a running musical joke that the ""Viola/Sebastian""s cell phone ring sounds embarrassingly girly pop, the music selections were surprisingly not pop. They miss an opportunity to make a point as well done with a similar mood or lyrics in ""Freaky Friday"", but there's posters on the walls and selections by rockers All-American Rejects and O.A.R., as well as by Joan Jett and indie romantic crooner Ray LaMontagne. Nice touch that the twin brother is a rocker with sensitively written lyrics is how he captures ""Olivia""s heart, which is not much more rationale than the original Will provided.<br/><br/>All in all, the film was a surprisingly entertaining girl power celebration, with lots of laugh out loud opportunities. I will now laugh at tampons in a way I never thought to before."

OK AManda Bynes is a good actor. The very ending was when everybody was kissing each other or something like that. i went to Marcus Cinema thats a good theater.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","2","4","27 December 2006"," Silly and altogether implausible, but often brilliantly funny
","Carved out from the Shakespearean play 'Twelfth Night' and from the creators who penned the majestic '10 Things I Hate About You', comes 'She's The Man', a cutesy and asinine teen comedy romp about nickelodeon starlet Amanda Bynes who disguises as a guy to get into the soccer team of her choice. Through a reverse mandatory make-over moment by a gay helper, she assumes the identity of her brother Sebastian and moves in with the boys, clumsily falling for her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) who is the star of the soccer team.<br/><br/>It should not be a gross overstatement to say that the relative success of 'She's The Man' rests squarely on the apt shoulders of its titular actress, Amanda Bynes. As Viola/Sebastian, she is impressively uninhibited and brave, going the extra mile at every point in the script, goofing about, suffering pratfalls and generally making a fool out of herself in trying to imitate the way she thinks guys act. This includes swearing, manly pats on the back, ogling girls and the whole shebang, sans post-workout showers for obvious reasons. The goldmine of the film undoubtedly stems from the classic absurdist situational comedy in the chaos of cross-dressing and pretending to be someone else, all of which Bynes captures very well, if a little too spastic and exaggerated  but I do think this is the way the bard intended it to be. Few supporting performances are noteworthy and blink and you will miss Vinnie Jones.<br/><br/>The messages of the film are no-holds-barred clear and it is underpinned with the rolling subtitle that says 'Personality triumphs over looks'. Viola is simultaneously battling prejudice and chauvinism in the form of a sexist coach who rejected her from the soccer team on account of being a girl. ""If you can't join them, be them,"", she implausibly reasons and tries out as her brother for a competing school's team while he is conveniently in London for two weeks. There is in this way a soft feminist touch that creeps up again toward the end when it's redemption time in the form of an epic ultimate soccer game in which Viola gets her chance to shine. The whole set-up from scene 01 to the end note is altogether implausible and ridiculously sketched out with so many gaping plot holes you think the film will fall flat at any moment  luckily, it remains afloat... just.<br/><br/>Forget that nobody notices Viola's absence while she is busy spending two weeks dressed up as her brother at another high school, and forget that her parents barely recognise her simply because she has her hair up in a male wig. Forget a wide array of things in fact, and you would probably do best to leave your brain at home for 'She's The Man', a comedy so sophomoric and asinine that it has zero cross-over appeal in terms of its limited teenybobber audience. However what is lacks in satiric adult edge or subtlety, it often rigorously makes up for in sheer goofball fun during which you cannot help but chuckle. On top of this, Bynes remains an extremely likable protagonist and I felt an almost unreasonable happiness for her when her roommate (a fumbling, inept but sexy Channing Tatum) and his hard-boiled soccer friends finally warmed up to her/him.<br/><br/>'She's the Man' does not measure up to '10 Things About You'  in fact, it barely deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as the former. It may help if you are partial to soccer (and I am, a little bit) and can stomach the exaggerated antics of a former nickelodeon starlet. There are literally stereotypes by the bucketload, both in characters and scenarios, but weed through the worst ones (like the over-the-top geeky lonely science girl) and there is definite fun to be had.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","The film revolves around a young and beautiful girl Viola. The girl lives a normal life with her crazy mother and windless brother Sebastian. It's a strange dream to play football, which according to others: a boyish activity, but she likes it. At first Viola played on the girls team and she did very well, but when the team broke up, Viola didn't give up and tried to play with the boys, a lot of people laughed at her ignorance of the rules because as we can see, females can't play between males. Well, you probably understood what I said here. But Viola came up with a plan that I wouldn't even have made myself measured or determined to carry out. She decided to pretend to be her brother, here and so understood by the name alone. Sounds incredible, but that's already the film's script. It's clear as a day that she succeeds and her whole plan: to pretend, to join, to play, is being implemented. And whoever goes on before she pretends to be a guy, you'll be able to see it if you haven't seen it yet. Of course, there will be romances, silly deeds by Viola, or just funny situations that I couldn't stop laughing at."

"kyiala-99108","8","0","0","13 May 2020"," Gender norms
","The film ""She is a man"" seemed to me very interesting in terms of sociological context. This film shows the gender norms of our time. The main character Viola loves to play football, but no one takes her seriously. She has to change school and pretend to be a boy in order to get into the football team. The main character, despite the fact that the girl not allowed to play in the men's sport team, proves the opposite. However, in the movie there are the biased attitude of girls to sports, the female half can get a success.
In our life, there are a lot of stereotypes regarding sports. Men's football is very developed and popular in the world, but no one knows about women's, or mixed football, which does not exist at all. People are used to seeing only men in a team, fewer women in this type of activity. The film conveys to the audience that everyone can do their favorite thing, despite all the difficulties. There, Viola has many difficulties on the way to her dream. All her friends, family, football coach were against her dreams. Her mother tried to make the main character wear dresses and heels, to be more feminine. The heroine reacted negatively to this.
Other characters in the film also conveyed social implications. Viola was in love with Duke. He is her roommate. He is a typical footbal player, who also believes that girls have no place in football. He is in love with another girl who wears dresses and heels. The film shows us two different types of girls: The first type is girls who behave feminine and their behavior seems normal. The second type is Viola, who, on the contrary, loves boyish sport and dresses like a boy.
The film is good and interesting. Despite the ease of the film, it has a semantic implication. It tells all people that despite stereotypes, everyone can and should do what they love. Men can dance ballet, and girls can box. The main thing is that a person should have a desire. If someone will show to other people that he or she can do it well, others on this example will begin to believe and be inspired and they will go against stereotypes.
The film shows a lot of norms: gender norms, norms of clothes, norms of behavior, family values, health standards. It shows people's ideas of how girls and boys should behave, how to dress, how to talk and even what to do in life."

"sofiamerinocampo","8","0","0","22 November 2019"," The best movie adaptation of the best script of all time
","""She's the Man"" is a ridiculous but ultimately entertaining teen movie which takes the gender-bending action of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" and drops it in the middle of a modern-day American boarding school. I am not a big fan when plays are adapted into movies, because I feel that directors make unnecessary changes that transforms the original script real purpose. However, this time I must say that I am impressed. This movie is a modernized version of the play that focuses on a teen audience making the movie-watching experience only enhanced.<br/><br/>This movie is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy that still fulfills Shakespeare's original purpose. Both play and movie, have the same theme of love in which the main characters are connected in a love triangle. The clever ways in which names and locations are re-purposed is one big part of the ""She's The Man"" magic. Viola, Olivia, and Sebastian all have identical names and plots. My favourite scene in Twelfth Night is Act II, scene 4, this is when Orsino that in the movie is Tatum talks about his love life with Amanda/Sebastian and its imperfections, while she declares her feelings that she has for him. In this film, all main purposes from Shakespeare original script are kept the same but at the same time portrayed a bit differently. An example of this is the way how Amanda throws hints of her feelings toward Tatum while they were talking about how he was going to make Olivia falls for him. In the movie, when Taum asks why should Olivia falls for him Amanda genuinely responds that he is hot when shortly after she corrects herself. Whereas in Twelfth Night, Cesario tells Orsino about her love making up a story to convince him that women are true of heart and are able to love someone as much as he loves Olivia through a story of her imaginary sister that loved someone just like her. This doesn't affect Shakespeare's purpose since the only thing that changes is the way how the feelings were expressed in different contexts, but both ended up in the same effect. On She's the Man, this part is shown fast, concise and spontaneous way since it might be more common and relatable for our time along with the setting and costumes used by the actors.<br/><br/>Another part of the scene which I thought followed Shakespeare's original purpose is how the actors comedic sense of timing was impeccable. On Twelfth Night comedy is added by the song that was about love to adapt to Orsino's melancholic mood which expresses passion and obsession toward his love. This comedic song was added to the scene to lighten the mood and make the scene funnier. Although in She's the Man a song is not used, the appearance of a spider is used to make the audience laugh and relate to the scene by knowing that most people hate spiders and at the end adding the event that the day after will take place. Despite the change of props, this part of the scene does fulfill Shakespeare purpose which is to make this scene as comedic and realistic as possible and show how this affects the love triangle that the characters have between them.<br/><br/>This movie succeeds on almost every level, despite being different in many aspects, it still manages to keep the original purposes of Shakespeare. Not every movie lover likes it because it's too predictable, but it is great to appreciate its adaptation."

","Surprisingly good-natured and likeable teen comedy, which mixes and re-uses a number of Shakespearean themes and adapts them to our modern world. The writing is clever and there are a number of good jokes. Amanda Bynes (as Viola) and Channing Tatum (as Duke Orsini) are pretty watchable and the rest of the cast does its best, too.<br/><br/>Like I've said, the movie is aimed mainly at a teenage audience, but older viewers can enjoy it too.<br/><br/>However, this thing works only if you are willing to indulge in some industrial-strength suspension of disbelief. Otherwise you are likely to spend much of the running time shouting things like : ""How can anyone mistake her for a boy ? She's clearly female, you cretins !"" or ""How can anyone mistake her for her twin brother ? For chrissakes, he's a foot taller !"" Mind you, it gives a whole new meaning to the traditional ""So how is your guide dog today ?"" insult hurled at referees."

","In the world today, women in the athletic profession are still fighting for equality. An example is US National Women's Soccer team. Even though they are winning more games than the US Men's team, they receive pay significantly below the men's salary. A stereotype that has been around for generations is that boys are better than girls, especially in sports. But, there is an eye-opening movie that tries to level the playing field for men and women, which is called, ""She's the Man"". It is sport and romance film produced by Lauren Shuler Donner and Ewan Leslie that conveys a need for equality. The main character, Viola Hastings, played by Amanda Bynes, uses her funny, but determined personality, to prove that she plays well enough to compete on the boy's soccer team. ""She's the Man"" is a must-watch for everyone all ages because not only does it relate to the topic of gender equality and empowers women, but also has a comedic twist that entertains a large audience.<br/><br/>""She's the Man"" can empower everyone, not only women, because of the upbeat music and driven character, Viola. The beginning of the movie starts off with an energetic song and colorful graphics that are integrated into a beach soccer scene; it will catch the audience's attention. The song played during the beach scene is ""No Sleep Tonight,"" by the Faders, a rock band consisting of three women. Their powerful voices emphasize the lyrics, ""I can't stop this feeling,"" while Viola is slide tackling and kicking the ball. Another example that can empower women is during the carnival scene, Justin, her ex boyfriend, told her to ""be a girl for five seconds,"" when she was only focused on her soccer situation and not their relationship. Instead of being submissive, she insists that it's not a ""stupid soccer issue"", and calls him a ""jerk"" right before she slaps him in the face. Her actions encourage women to stand up for themselves and their opinions. <br/><br/>A main theme of ""She's the Man"" is gender quality. After the opening scene, Viola and her teammates find out that the girls soccer team is cut at Cornwall. Angry, they decide to try-out for the boys soccer team. But, the ignorant head coach of the boy's soccer team and close-minded male players, including Viola's boyfriend—ex boyfriend— don't think that the women can compare or play alongside them. When the girls said that they wanted to tryout for his team, the coach said, ""Girls aren't as fast as boys. It's not me talking, it's a scientific fact. Girls can't beat boys. It's as simple as that."" But, instead of keeping her down, this remark sparks a fire in Viola that pushes her to impersonate her brother, Sebastian, and try out for Illyria's boys soccer team. Her determination shows that she wants to be treated as an equal. The creators of the movie cleverly portrayed inequality again when they compared Viola and her brother. When she asked him, ""Do you know the percentage of bands that actually make it to the big time?"", he replied with, ""Probably the same as female soccer players"", which puts being a female athlete into perspective. In the end, the Illyria coach saw her potential and dedication and decided to move her from second to first string. It was inspiring to watch the coach judge her based on skill level, not because of her gender. Even after he found out she was a girl, he still let her play because unlike Cornwall, he doesn't ""discriminate based on gender"". <br/><br/>Another example of inequality is shown in her dream, she is wearing a big fluffy pink dress, while everyone else on the field is wearing normal soccer clothes. In a way, the clothing symbolizes that girls are viewed as princesses or aren't able to play a sport. The underlying meaning shows inequality in the treatment of female athletes. A positive about the dream is that the coach from Illyria is yelling at her to be on the field and has the same expectation of her in a pink dress as he does for the boys in soccer gear. <br/><br/>A comedic twist that the producers put in the movie was a scene where they are playing Rondo, a game where they have to keep the ball away from one person in the middle, and Viola, who is pretending to be Sebastian, gets ""hit in the balls"", and she dramatically pretended that it hurt. All throughout the movie, Amanda Bynes's goofy facial expressions kept me laughing and on the edge of my seat. Another comedic moment in the movie was when she told the coach that she couldn't be a ""skin"" because she was ""allergic to the sun"". Her quirky comments and awkward personality kept the movie upbeat while simultaneously breaking the gender normal. <br/><br/>In the final game against Illyria, Viola proves that she is good enough to play with the boys team by helping them win by scoring the winning goal of the game. Watching this movie can inspire girls over the nation to realize that they can do anything they set their mind to, even if it is supposed to be a ""boy thing"". She proves that she can compete against boys through her hard work and dedication toward extra hours of practice, even if it meant dressing up as a man. If that was the only way that she could have been treated with severity, we clearly need to reevaluate society."

The lines of dialogue in this movie are just OK, nothing that's going to knock your socks off. Kind of the same thing with the acting, it's all right, but it's not awful and it's not superb. I think the teenagers will find this enjoyable I'm not so sure if adults will enjoy it though it's really for a teenage audience. There is some sweet romance and friendship. Overall shes the man is not really a gem, but it is sort of enjoyable. 6/10 for she's the man.

","She's the Man is a hysterical romantic comedy that was released in 2006. The audience was geared towards young preteen and teenage girls. As a preteen myself around the time the movie was released She's the Man was one of the first PG-13 movies I was allowed to see. The main character, Viola, is played by Amanda Bynes, who at the time was a very successful and popular actress. This created popularity for the movie before it even premiered. A well- picked cast can make or break a movie. In this movie the cast makes a huge difference by giving life to the story in ways that other actors could not. The movie also ties into a play written by one of the most famous authors in history and has a soundtrack with some songs still play on the radio today. To make the movie even more interesting it correlates with another story. According to the article ""She's the Man vs. Twelfth Night"" throughout the entire movie references are made to Shakespeare's play The Twelfth Night. The two stories are alike in many but also differ in a few. The main similarities come from the names of characters and places, but are also found in the plot. Some of the names that appear in both the movie and the play are Viola, Sebastian, Duke, Olivia, Malvolio, Cesario, Andrew, Toby, Antonio, Illyria, and Cornwall. In both Viola and Sebastian are twins, but they play different roles in the movie and play. Duke Orsino in the movie relates to the Duke of Illyria in the play. Duke Orsino is the captain of the men's soccer team at Illyria and leads like the Duke of Illyria does in the play. Olivia is caught in the middle of a love triangle very similar in both the movie and the play (""She's the Man vs. Twelfth""). One quote that sums up the love interests in this film is, """"Everybody has a secret Duke wants Olivia, who likes Sebastian, who is really Viola, whose brother is dating Monique, so she hates Olivia, who's with Duke to make Sebastian jealous, who is really Viola, who's crushing on Duke, who thinks she's a guy "" (""She's the Man – Film""). Also, in both the movie and film Olivia's lover needs help to win her attention. In the end of both stories though Duke ends up with Viola and Sebastian ends up with Olivia. Cesario is the name of Viola in the play, but the name of a popular pizza joint in the movie. Other little references like this one are made in the film; such as, on a billboard at the Illyria for the upcoming production of the What You Will, which is another name for The Twelfth Night. The names Andrew and Toby are used for Duke's soccer friends in the film and as someone who love Olivia and Olivia's uncle in the play respectively. Viola and Sebastian are from a country called Cornwall in the play and move to Illyria where the play is set. In the film they transfer schools from Cornwall to Illyria to make the exact same move as in the play. All of these similarities between the two in both names and the plot create a dynamic that would add any film.<br/><br/>According to IMDb many different writers and artists composed the soundtrack of the film. Some of the more popular songs featured on the sound track are ""No Sleep Tonight"", ""Hey Sexy Lady"", ""Barbie Girl"", ""Dirty Little Secret"", and ""Move Along"". ""No Sleep Tonight"" (""Soundtracks""). ""No Sleep Tonight"" plays in the opening scene to get the movie going and pumps up the viewers. The rest of the songs played throughout the movie are also used to pull at the viewer's emotions. Also Sebastian's lyrics are used in the movie and quoted a few times (She's the Man). Many of these songs have been used in other successful films trough the years and are still relevant today. ""Dirty Little Secret"" by The All American Rejects still can be heard on radio stations today. She's the Man is a movie I would recommend for anyone to watch. Even though the audience is aimed at a younger generation of girls I feel that most anyone could find something for him or her to get out of it. With the references to Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night it would also be a great movie to consider using in a learning environment. The casting, comedy, and soundtrack all mesh together in perfect collaboration to form a very enjoyable piece of art."

","When Viola is prevented from playing soccer at school, she devises a plot to save the day by impersonating her brother. This leads to multiple cross-dressing complications and romantic confusions.<br/><br/>This teen comedy is not believable in any way whatsoever, but it is a great deal of fun nevertheless. Inspired by Twelfth Night, it transplants much of Shakespeare's original (including character names) to an American high school setting, and does so fairly effectively. The cast all give terrific performances, but credit must go to Channing Tatum in an early comedic hunk role (presaging things to come) and, especially, Amanda Bynes.<br/><br/>My knowledge of Bynes comes from the single performance of hers which I had seen in Easy A - good, but not a very sympathetic character - and her very public burn-out during 2012/13. In this film she gets to play a girl who is variously tomboyish, feminine, and impersonating a boy. The impersonation fools nobody (except every other character in the film, of course) but the entertainment value is in the impersonation, not its accuracy. Bynes is blessed with a face which is both pretty and cartoony. This enables her to play every facet of Viola very effectively: she can be sexy, funny, broad, pretty and, indeed, all of these at the same time. This film confirms her as a real talent and, if she has indeed retired from acting, I hope that she has found her way to a place where her life will bring her peace."
"sholic","6","0","0","13 June 2014"," Pleasantly decent
","The only thing I knew about this cast was Bynes did some work on Nickelodeon and Tatum had a string of teen flicks, neither of which I've watched before. Had a pretty low expectation given the genre so it was pretty pleasant to find out it wasn't as horrible as I anticipated it to be.<br/><br/>Bynes was amusing enough (borderline annoying if your threshold is pretty low) during the whole OTT girl went undercover as boy disguise mission. Her mannerisms were similar to that of Bullock circa Miss Congeniality although I find Bynes being better in the silly department whereas Bullock excels better in bringing the romance into romantic comedy lead.<br/><br/>Tatum made great eye candy although 'twas pretty painful to watch him go through the more serious scenes - like him telling Viola (as Sebastian) off in treating woman badly. He fared slightly better during silly scenes - like whenever he had to act all nervous every time he talked to Olivia.<br/><br/>The supporting cast really shone here. I've always had a fondness for Jones so I'm thrilled anytime I see him (doubly so here since I didn't know he was cast). Cross did a great job along with Torti as well as Viola/Sebastian's crew in supporting her/him with the transformation and Duke's silly frat entourage.<br/><br/>I could enjoy this a lot more if the subplot of Duke and Viola hooking up didn't feel so artificial and forced but alas, (i) romantic (/i) comedy sells better than straight up laugh in your face humour especially whenever we have a female lead. After all, it (i) was (/i) based on the Shakespeare's Twelfth Night play"

","Based loosely on Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night or What You Will"", this is teen farce. Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a good soccer player, but her team gets cut. Her brother Sebastian is running away to London with his band for two weeks. So she decides to impersonate him to join the boy's team at Sebastian's new school.<br/><br/>The convoluted Shakespearian love triangle has a bit of fun. Amanda Bynes was still funny back then. She has the mannerisms and comic timing. Amanda definitely needs a shorter haircut to play the boy part. That wig looks really bad. It has Channing Tatum as the hunky soccer player, but he overplays the bumbling part. He looks stupid doing it. It's the lightest of farce. It's all very silly. Reason be damn.

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","0","1 December 2013"," A retelling of Twelfth Night in an American Prepschool
","Upon approaching this film I ask the question if one were to take a Shakespearian play, change the setting to an American Prep School, scrap the dialogue, with the exception of a few classic lines, and replace it with modern English, and rework the plot so that it is appropriate to the setting, then is it still Shakespeare? The answer is a definite 'no', though it is acceptable to say that it was based on Shakespeare. When asking this question, most people immediately thought of 10 Things I Hate About You (Taming of the Shrew), though this movie is inspired by Twelfth Night. I will be writing about Twelfth Night later (as I have recently watched the 1995 version of the film) so I will focus instead on this film.<br/><br/>It is not a bad film, if one can handle the complete butchering of Shakespeare, but then again, Shakespeare is hardly original himself. To me Shakespeare's skill lies in his plots (which he borrows from multiple sources at times) and his masterful use of the English language. Turning the play into an American romantic comedy does not really do it justice, however the plot is substantially better than boy gets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl again.<br/><br/>The film is about a girl Viola (the name is taken from Shakespeare) who loves playing soccer, but when her school's soccer team is cut due to lack of interest, she is devastated. However, when her brother (Sebastian – Shakespeare) decides to skip the country and go to England for band practice (in the play they are separated in a ship wreck) she uses the opportunity (they are twins) to pretend to be him and start at his school (Ilyria High, which is a take off of the country in which Twelfth Night is set). At the school she bunks with Duke Orsino (the name is taken also from Shakespeare, however he is not a Duke, he is just called Duke) and has to manipulate things so that she is not discovered.<br/><br/>Another thing that differs is the subplots. The only major subplot in this film is the principle and another student trying to uncover what Viola is up to, and attempt to expose her as a fraud. Of course they fail, but then Viola is in the end forced to come clean, especially when Sebastian returns. Malvolio does appear in the film, but he is a pet spider, so the whole Malvolio, Sir Toby Belch, and Sir Andrew subplot does not exist. Another difference, well it is not so much a difference, but a cutting of the original, is when Sebastian returns and Olivia runs up to him and kisses him. In the play the scene is drawn out a lot more, where as in the movie it is only a few seconds.<br/><br/>The final scene, where Viola is forced to come clean, is played out on the soccer field where Sebastian finds himself playing soccer when he is hopeless and Viola is stuck on the side lines. In the end everything turns out quite well. Instead of the main characters all getting married, they all 'get together' in that they become girlfriend and boyfriend, though this does not come anywhere near to the Shakespearian everybody getting married. As for a film, I enjoyed it, and I would say that it is a good introduction to Shakespeare, as long as people know that this is what it is based upon, but as a film standing alone by itself, it is still good."

","If I was the same 9-11 year old that I was when I first watched this movie, I would have given this film an easy 10, no doubt about that!<br/><br/>I remember when I first saw the DVD cover and its confusing (but inviting!) subheadings: Everybody has a secret... Duke wants Olivia who likes Sebastian who is really Viola whose brother is dating Monique so she hates Olivia who's with Duke to make Sebastian jealous who is really Viola who's crushing on Duke who thinks she's a guy... Even now, I'm going, ""SAY WUUUT?"" What more for the past me?<br/><br/>It was a funny movie, no doubt about that. I watched this movie with my maids. I actually thought about downloading it (not because If felt like I wanted to watch it, but..) because Gigi said that she wanted to watch this movie again after many years. I just decided be a friendly hostess by surprising her with this movie. :D I can say that all 3 of our helpers enjoyed it. Maybe they enjoyed it more than me, but that's okay. :)<br/><br/>Even if my initial thoughts while the movie was starting was that I had matured a lot and am too ""mature"" for the jokes that this movie has, I admit that I had more laughs than I thought I would have. The part where Viola's hot girl friends came and helped her trick ""Sebastian""'s friends were hot and sexy. There were lots more other good and funny scenes, like that final soccer game where Sebastian and Viola showed their ""assets"" to prove their true gender. I bet I laughed way harder back then. Hahaha!<br/><br/>I think that the ending was very unrealistic, though. I can't believe that I only realized that now. Though, I have a vague feeling that my younger self kind of questioned this. Why would Olivia go so easily with the real Sebastian? Shouldn't she have been hesitant or something? And how did Duke suddenly fall in 'like' with Viola after only meeting her once? Unrealistic. Aside from those, the whole movie was in fact, unrealistic! But then again, if it wasn't made that way, we wouldn't have had a movie now, would we?<br/><br/>I think the main thing that I just want to emphasize about this movie was that the younger you are, the funnier you'll find it. Or if you watch it with a child or someone who has a child-like sense of humor.. Yeah. You can count on having a good time. But either way, you're bound to have a few good laughs here and there. :D"

","Lows and highs: <br/><br/>A powerful comedy with lots of quality comedy detail. <br/><br/>A useful (DVD extra) explanation of how this translates from Shakespeare. <br/><br/>Not as perfect as Clueless or Mean Girls or Confessions, but the many imperfections are worth shrugging off, to me, anyhow. <br/><br/>My DVD includes a trivia track as subtitle two. This does not have a subtly discrete standard subtitles layout but an unsubtle pop up type box in the lower part of the screen. I ended up by translating these into a standard external subtitles file, playable in such as VLC 8.1, though I doubt that will be practical for me to post at IMDb as posting a tidied up version of their full, if slightly anglicised, 250 line Trivia type subtitles is the sort of thing that would need permission from Dreamworks or Lakeshore. My experience of the UK film industry makes me hold off from trying to obtain that. I plan to post my semi-official detailed chapters list for this, in listing and OGG formats. My guess is that such things are typically on the right side of the borderline for posting without asking, a full subtitles set as on the other side. My guess, these days some should not bother to check their guess? <br/><br/>The trivia track shows the working title as Dude Looks Like A Lady so maybe Amanda Viola not looking 100% 17ish male might fit well. Viola not looking too much like Sebastian, her twin, is a flaw that I need to work to shrug off, but this situation does not crop up all that often. The DVD background notes show that they put in a lot of work to trying to get them close, but deliberately held back from going as far as possible. <br/><br/>That the two assistants who help in boosting Sebastian's image are on the axed soccer team, the two closest female friends of Viola, Kia and Yvonne. There is lots of detail that I did not notice even after loads of viewings of this story. <br/><br/>So this is a story that I can give a lot of viewings to, no trouble, and Amanda Bynes is the start of the reasons why, but there is a lot of positive from other actors too. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Bad guys. Viola's ex, Justin, sometimes called Justine by fake Sebastian, and Sebastian's ex, Monique. Something is happening. <br/><br/>Late mid teen big bust, Justin and Monique are both pure Klingon of the warrior classification. <br/><br/>As a Klingon I have to make some adjustments here. For now I do that by assuming that all those acting the roles of 17ish are victims of the Big Bust problem, just it is showing different faces in the different characters. If it was just those two with Big Bust trouble then it would be lousy typecasting, to me. Assuming that all are showing some of the variety of Big Bust can turn this into feeling useful rather than a flaw. <br/><br/>I note the dog theme in Viola's house. The handbag theme in Monique's room. A range of possible interpretations of such symbols. Many point to facets of Big Bust, if not to good and bad ways for being able to grow the skills needed for facing that. <br/><br/>Hairspray (2007) shows PP's mum's belief in the desert being good for the soul. Instead I feel a need for healthier ways when dealing with dogs. Union Jack, Amanda and Sebastian both point to this during the early scenes, this story includes a flag of biology lessons and to me that is just a tip of an iceberg."

Of course I usually forget such movies the moment they're over.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie kind of confirmed my expectations. It was OK, a bit cheesy, a bit funny, just as I expected. But then, when Amanda converts into her brother, things changed for me. One scene after the other exploded on me. OK, the movie doesn't have much of a meaning, but it sure is a fun ride. I don't remember having laughed so much/loud because of a movie for a long time. I won't tell any specific scenes here, cause they just sound not all that funny when you talk about them. The perfect timing of the good actors in well written scenes is what creates the humor.<br/><br/>OK, even is disguise Amanda doesn't really look very much like a boy. And that everybody confused her with her twin brother was a bit unrealistic, too, they didn't look *that* much alike. But if you take the movie for what it is, namely nothing but a fun ride, you can ignore such little flaws. What surprised me was how taken aback I was when she later converted back into a girl. So seemingly she managed to play the boy role quite well.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you only like movies that have something important to say, do not watch this one. If you only like movies that have no obvious flaws, do not watch this one. If you do not like Amanda's funny faces, don't watch this movie.

The walking isn't too much of a problem, the talking at times she sounds like Steve Martin in ""Bringing down the House"" with her overuse of African American street slang and the spitting she only does that once.<br/><br/>The most important bit of casting was Amanda Bynes as Viola a pretty girl but with a wig and sideburns could pass for a tall prepubescent boy, strange how different a haircut can make somebody. It's certainly an improvement over her previous film ""What a Girl Wants"" though I never saw ""Lovewrecked"" she carries the film though appearing in virtually every scene in some form or another, she has to.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was of mostly of unknowns to me (Channing Tatum, Laura Ramsey, Robert Hoffman) with the exception of the underused Julia Haggerty (the flight attendant in ""Airplane 1 + 2"") and the over rated Vinnie Jones. Though to be fair nobody plays a hard man footballer like Vinnie and he is not too stretched in this role, it would have been nice to have had a quirky football coach. As the principle played by David Cross is beyond quirky he is just annoying.<br/><br/>On the whole I enjoyed the film at times I cringed at some of the scenes but its pace sped us to scenes that were actually very amusing, if you enjoyed ""10 Things"" and ""Legally Blonde"" you will enjoy this though I know it maybe a little sweet for some tastes."

","It would be good if you go with a girl but you wouldn't enjoy it on your own if your a boy. The film is good its based on 12th night by Shakespeare with the same storyline and names.<br/><br/>The film is about a girl who's football team gets cut from her college and as her brother goes to a college where there is a boys team and he is in London, she decides to dress up as a her brother as they are twins and they look alike so that she can get into the boys football team. She then falls in love with her (brothers) room mate (Duke) and tries to get him to go out with her (viola) she gets to kiss him as viola and then at the end everyone finds out that she is a girl and she wins the match for them and her and Duke get together. the end."

","Of course, we just had to watch a movie.<br/><br/>It was late Sunday night and after watching V for Vendetta again with my sister and her boyfriend, Fritz, at Market! Market! I ended up watching yet another movie to please the innate need of my friends to escape themselves from boredom. Checking the movie schedules of our favorite hangout,Greenbelt 3, led to the following results: V for Vendetta: Seen 16 Blocks: Seen Hostel: Seen Date Movie: Seen She's the Man: Not yet seen Guess which one we ended up watching? The movie, like many other's, is quite formulaic. A girl wants to prove herself in a sport dominated by boys, and so, dresses herself and acts as a boy, more specifically, as her brother. This plot is so tried and tested to illicit even just the littlest amount of profitable interest that it has been used too many times. In fact, this plot has been around for ages that William Shakespeare even wrote something similar to this. And guess what? Lo and behold, the movie ""She's the Man"" actually credits this English bastard bard for the storyline.<br/><br/>Like all stupid movies, one should free his mind from rational thinking while viewing. Just let go and be monocellular while processing the contents of this movie and you'll be surprised by how much you'll enjoy this movie. Sure, Amanda Byne's character reminds you a lot of Kris Aquino and Manilyn Reynes, but at the end of it all, you paid money to be entertained this way. And don't even deny the fact that the movie's poster didn't lie to you. They told you all there is to know about ""She's the Man"" and yet you still bought tickets. So if you're like me, don't make such a big fuss about how nobody even protested why Amanda Byne's character, Viola, was allowed to play soccer.<br/><br/>Nevermind the anti-racist stand of the Illyria coach. Viola is not a bonafide student of the school so why does she get to play? But as I mentioned, for around 2 hours, be a dumb behaved person when you watch this movie. Laugh at supposedly funny scenes and quietly dismiss all the loose ends of the plot, which is quite abundant if you ask me. All in all, the movie is quite okay. This is after all, a girl movie.

In many ways, ""She's the Man"" is like ""Tootsie"" for young girls. Lots of the professional reviewers seemed oblivious to the fact that the main joke of the movie is that Viola never really looks or sounds like a man, but she is able to fool everyone in the movie anyway. While the movie is not rolling-in-the-aisles funny, it has a fair share of chuckles and is perfectly unoffensive.<br/><br/>""She's the Man"" has no originality and is perfectly predicable, but if you are looking for some light entertainment, it is probably the best thing in the theaters right now."

"Dimes333","4","2","5","10 April 2006"," She's the Man is Decadent and Depraved
","The tag line for this movie reads, ""Everybody has a secret... Duke wants Olivia who likes Sebastian who is really Viola whose brother is dating Monique so she hates Olivia who's with Duke to make Sebastian jealous who is really Viola who's crushing on Duke who thinks she's a guy..."" Did you get that? Me neither. Basically, this movie is about a soccer star vixen named Olivia who thinks she has what it takes to play along side the boys and defeat her jerk of an ex. In order to do this, she has to take her brother's place, Sebastian, at the rival boarding school, or ""college preparatory"" as they would call it around my neck of the woods. Luckily, Sebastian and his band are going to be touring England for two weeks, which gives Olivia just enough time to pose as her brother, join the soccer team, defeat her ex-boyfriend, find a new man and cause a heap of drama that only rich kids in movies seem to be able to do.<br/><br/>This movie is far from original, but the director (Andy Fickman) does not try to hide this. The film is advertised as being based off of Shakespeare's ""Twelve Night"" only in the original not everybody gets what they want, and David Cross (Principal Gold) is nowhere to be found (darn). Luckily, for all of those Shakespearian 11 year old girls going to see the movie, they are not left with an empty, ripped-off feeling in their bowels after seeing this movie. However, had these 11 year old girls been, lets say, a 20 year-old Webster student who may or may not answer to the name, ""Pat"" the after effects of this movie would be greatly different. Perhaps the director thought that everyone would forget about a little 1985 classic, ""Just One of the Guys"" which involved a cute high school girl going undercover as a boy to prove a point about the sexist society in which she lived and getting a crush on a guy, causing hilarity to ensue. The main difference I see between these two movies is that ""Just One of the Guys"" rules, and ""She's the Man"" blows chunks.<br/><br/>Despite my desires to see Amanda Bynes remain a boy for the remainder of her career (which currently doesn't look too good), she really doesn't do her brother's role justice. Plot holes aside, no one notices that Sebastian isn't really Sebastian, including his girlfriend whom Olivia (as Sebastian, played by Amanda Bynes. This is confusing!) dumps in a pizza parlor. The final product of the sex change is Sebastian looking/acting like a 12 year old boy instead of a senior in high school. Olivia's main love interest, and coincidentally her roommate, Duke, is pretty much what you'd expect from a love interest in one of these movies; Athletic, hot, a hard exterior with a soft caramel center you get the point. The only character in this movie that didn't blend in with the background was Principal Gold, played by David Cross, of Arrested Development/Mr. Show fame. He was the comical relief of this movie. Just when I was getting really sick of everything and everyone in this film, I see David Cross, and I say to myself, ""Ah, maybe I won't walk out on this movie after all."" Unfortunately, Cross' role in this film is minor, and the rest of the characters in this movie are so bland and stereotypical that I kept hoping the film would turn from romantic-comedy to murder-comedy in mid dialogue. That did not happen, and I was left fixating myself on the ""Violent Femmes"" t-shirt the real Sebastian was wearing right before he decided to go jam with the blokes across the pond.<br/><br/>Characters aside, the big idea of this movie really isn't very big at all. It's no Kubrick, Hopper/Fonda or Welles to say the least, but as a movie reviewer, I will dig deep to shed some conceptual light on this teen flick. Director Andy Fickman, AKA voice of a generation, tries to poke at the inner desires and stresses of all teens who attend elite boarding schools with dopey parents and evil girls breathing down their necks. He's basically trying to say that taking advantage of your parents divorce, lying to everyone, cross-dressing and playing mind games with your closest company is perfectly acceptable because in the end you will always get what you want and there will never be any repercussions. Maybe he just meant that for Amanda Bynes, but next time I'm in a jam and need to prove an ex wrong, I will have my wig and skirt ready. The only detail I've yet to work out would be shoving my brother on an airplane bound for Europe, although that may just be a touch of the ole' Hollywood magic. Secondly, and maybe most importantly, Fickman shows us that love really does conquer all, even when you are a straight teenage brute and the one you fall in love with happens to be a quirky testosterone lacking boy for the first 2 weeks of your relationship.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this: If you are over the age of 14 and you don't have an unhealthy/illegal obsession with Amanda Bynes, this movie is not for you. To all the Shakespeare buffs, I'd stick to Leo and Claire for your on-screen re-creations. And for all of you David Cross fanatics (which there are billions of) there really isn't enough Principal Gold time to justify spending $6+ on a ticket. Maybe you could wait until it's in the $1 bin at Wal-Mart. So if you start your cars now, and take the quickest possible route to the store, they should be unloading boxes of this film by the time you get there. And I almost forgot, what about all of you who just love a cheesy teen movie with a white washed cast and a nauseatingly predictable ending? Well, this is the one for you!"

But no, it is as good as the casting shows it, and what the Americans think about it - that football (soccer) and volleyball are beach games - to be played by girls. Well they have their brains lodged in their @%$es if they think so. So if you are a soccer fan and are enjoying the world cup, better stay away from this - or you would wish to strangulate the entire crew - or better torture them slowly, for thats what the movie does yo you. The acting is horrible, and so is the screenplay. And even a great actor like Vinnie Jones is wasted.

I might go on and on like this ... don't even have words to describe its tardiness. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Things to look out / avoid for in the movie: <br/><br/>1. Football shot through the hoop like in Quidditch (showing their utter ignorance of the game) 2. Goalkeeper calling himself a Ninja and jumping around like a monkey 3. People using Tampons to stop their nosebleeds (how sick and not funny can a joke be!) 4. To top it all, In the match throw - in taken while the person does a somersault 5.

Amanda Bynes is delightful, although you must be willing to forgive the fact that she can't really do a male voice, and her masculine mannerisms are sometimes over the top. But not enough to be unforgivable. I was willing to suspend my disbelief. It also helped that Amanda was surrounded by a whole crop of promising young actors, many of whom I'm sure we'll see more of in future films. Even though this movie is targeting the teen market, I think older audiences will enjoy it too. A great date movie."

I also thought the movie very nicely captured the complicated but essential homoerotic vibe between Duke and Viola-as-Sebastian. It ends how it sort of has to end (implausibly), but who cares?

","She's the Man (2006): Dir: Andy Fickson / Cast: Amanda Bynes, Channing Tatum, Laura Ramsey, Vinnie Jones, James Kirk: Tired misfire about gender identities. When the female soccer team is cut, star player Amanda Bynes disguises herself as her twin brother who is off to London for a music presentation. As predicted, she struggles to adapt to her male teammates and we can sense the ending an hour before it has arrived. Director Andy Fickson pulls off fine soccer action but the screenplay offers nothing new and feels content on presenting elements that have been done to death. Bynes is pleasant but she deserves better material to exercise her comic talent. The fact that she looks no more like a male than Barbra Streisand in Yentl also doesn't help. Channing Tatum is featured as the standard love interest football player. It will shock no one that he and Bynes hook up. Other roles are flat including Laura Ramsey who crushes on Bynes's male side, as if that was a surprise. Vinnie Jones plays the standard bad ass coach who feels the need to be loud and forceful. James Kirk plays the twin brother of Bynes and one could say that he was switching places so that he could flee the set. Bynes may be the man here but she wasn't backed by one who could write a decent screenplay or present an idea worth writing about. Instead, this film should be kicked harder than the soccer ball.

"stigli137","8","1","2","30 September 2014"," Gender Confused Norms
","Based on a modern version of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Director Andy Fickman deserves a job well done for She's The Man. Written as a romantic comedy, the main character Viola masquerades as a man, getting herself in some sticky situations that are amusingly comical. Between the actuality of Viola posing as a man and obliviousness of so many of the characters within the movie, one cannot help but find her antics comical. The whole premise of She's The Man is based on Viola (Amanda Bynes) taking her twin brother's place at boarding school in order to get on the guys' soccer team at Illyria since her school would not let her try out. The absurdity of Amanda Bynes acting, or attempting to act like a guy, with the ridiculous getup to look like a guy appeals to the audience in an entertaining manner. Between the fake sideburns, the clothing, and the impersonations, Viola has her work cut out for her, and yet she succeeds in making the audience laugh time and time again. This movie is humorous for people of all ages, especially since the questionable, at times terrible, acting accentuates the written hilarity and brings out the fundamental themes in the movie. The underlying themes in She's The Man concern gender norms in the United States today and how ridiculous they are. This film forces people to question the legitimacy of these gender norms.<br/><br/>She's The Man completely devastated some gender norms (Hiott-Millis), all thanks to Amanda Bynes' humorous spin on the script. For instance, when Viola is attempting to satirize the ""macho slang"" that men use nowadays such as ""Word g-money"" and ""Bro? Brothers? Brethren?"" (She's The Man), accompanied by the facial expressions seen on Bynes' face, the audience cannot help but laugh at the hilarity of the situation. Then there are the times when Viola's personality definitely shows through her ""Sebastian"" façade. Whenever ""Sebastian"" and Duke are alone, it becomes painfully obvious that Viola is just under the surface. Bynes shows Viola perfectly using her quite noticeable facial and verbal expressions. Usually she is drooling over or blatantly ogling Duke, but once she slips up and tells Duke, ""You're hot!"" (She's The Man). In this scene, the movie contradicts the gender norm that women do not objectify men like men tend to objectify women. In reality, women frequently treat men like pieces of meat. The added humor of Viola winning the soccer game completes the story and gives rise to the predictable, somewhat cliché theme of the good guys winning in the end. Being that Viola is a girl though, it breaks tradition by having her be the heroine.<br/><br/>Though She's The Man is meant to be a lighthearted and comedic movie, underlying currents can be found within almost every scene. Every female who watches this movie that will agree that Bynes portrays the image every woman (though it is sometimes exaggerated) would like to have, yet society dictates the proper behavior for women. The most accurate quote of this movie is when Viola, still dressed as Sebastian, claims ""Heels are a male invention designed to make a woman's butt look smaller. And to make it harder for them to run away"" (She's The Man). A common belief is that beauty does not come without pain, but who dictates the standard of beauty? Bynes forces the audience to consider who created the gender norms nowadays. Another example, though this one is over-exaggerated to the extreme, is when Viola is at a débutante luncheon and eats like a man. While this has to do with the environment she has been exposed to during the last couple weeks of her life, she is ""pointing out the complete nonsense of 'ladylike' manners"" (Hiott-Millis). Granted, no one would not want to see food falling out of someone's mouth, but that goes for both genders. Even though all of the humor will not be understood by younger kids and teenagers, adults who watch the movie will understand the innuendos about gender norms and chuckle at the reality that these situations are not all that uncommon.<br/><br/>In the end, the comedic aspects added by Bynes enhances the audience's awareness of the gender norms found currently in the United States. Not many actresses could have pulled off the Viola/Sebastian role while exposing the ridiculousness of gender norms like Bynes did. The plot line flowed nearly seamlessly, so the audience cannot help but feel included in the drama surrounding Viola's unfortunate, yet comical, circumstances. In general, for the teen target audience, this movie exceeds expectations in both the humor and underlying content. It is a family oriented comedy that will be watched and appreciated for years to come."

As misleading as this quote may be, Adam Fickman's charming romantic comedy She's The Man sets out to prove that men and women do in fact have more in common than society gives us credit for. It is a playful and modern twist on William Shakespeare's play, Twelfth Night, and reestablishes the stereotype of ""chick flick"". She's The Man does everything in its power to eliminate socially constructed gender roles with a cohesive mixture of dynamic characters, witty dialogue, and a creative take on one of Shakespeare's classics.<br/><br/>It is virtually impossible to discuss the hilarity of this film without mentioning the stellar performance given by Amanda Bynes. Once a Nickelodeon child star, Bynes sets out to prove she can thrive on the silver screen as well. Bynes's character, Viola, is determined to prove her passion and skill for the game of soccer once her high school team gets cut. In order to do this, Viola makes the valiant decision to impersonate her twin brother on his school's boys soccer team at the cleverly named high school of Illyria, which corresponds with the setting in Twelfth Night. The film follows the lively and complicated journey Viola encounters while posing as a boy, involving everything from being able to shower, to fitting in with the boys, and even Viola's inner struggle as she begins to fall for her roommate, Duke, played by the actor who is undoubtedly the shining star every teenage girl's bedroom walls, Channing Tatum. The film is also filled with phenomenal performances from Laura Ramsey, David Cross, and James Kirk.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is very unconvincing as a male, which is where most of the comedy in this film actually lies. Viola's dialogue with other supporting actors as she impersonates a boy is sure to have everyone rolling on the floor with laughter. She's The Man does an impeccable job of poking fun at stereotypes associated with gender roles. One specific scene in the movie, which takes place in Viola's dream, involves her running down a muddy soccer field in a large ball gown, depicting the inner struggle Viola feels with her mother pressuring her to ""be a proper lady"", and her love for the game of soccer. There is an apparent double standard that women should be independent and go after their wildest dreams, yet still remain a proper lady. This movie, however, proves that a girl can be both the sports-fanatic tomboy and the sophisticated woman that society expects her to be. <br/><br/>This film gets major points for originality as well for its modern twist on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Although this movie obviously isn't identical to the play, it does have corresponding characters names and a complicated love triangle. The plot is very similar in many ways as well, with a girl masquerading as her twin brother, falling in love with a man, and being unable to tell him for fear of revealing her true self. I believe that Adam Fickman did an exceptional job developing the historical Shakespearean plot into an intricate and charming storyline that teenagers will drool over.<br/><br/>Anyone who expects this movie to be a typical, cheesy romantic comedy, will be very surprised to see that She's The Man is in fact an empowering film revolving around equality and perseverance."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","2 January 2013"," So fun and entertaining
","This film is about a teenage girl who poses as her twin brother to attend his school, so that she can play in the boys' soccer team.<br/><br/>""She's the Man"" is unbelievably hilarious! I laughed out loud so many times, and I even curled up into a ball from laughing. The film has no gross humour, which is refreshing for a change.Amanda Bynes is quite convincing in her (admittedly over the top) male mannerisms, there are so many times when I thought her male voice must have been dubbed using a man's voice. Though the sweet ending ventures into the usual chick flick territory, ""She's the Man"" is still a very fun and entertaining film to watch."
"andrew-herbst","Null","1","2","15 September 2011"," Laugh out loud.
","This movie made me laugh out loud in many scenes which is pretty rare for me. Amanda Bynes as Viola is hilarious in this role. I also noted that although it is a romantic comedy with college age kids, there is no profanity, nudity, or even hints of sex. In fact, the obvious gay hair-dresser friend is never officially gay. The movie doesn't rely on any of that sort of thing to generate humour and it is probably a lot funnier without it. The title derives from the basic story where Viola disguises herself as her brother to make the boy's soccer team. She's is hilarious as a boy and as a girl, although probably funniest as a boy.It's hard for me to give a comedy a ten so I am giving it a nine. You're bound to like it."
"jim4551","Null","1","2","27 August 2011"," Amanda Bynes's Coming out Movie.
","From the time I saw Amanda Bynes on shows like All that and Amanda show to movies like Big Fat Liar and Syndey White,I have come to enjoy the ditzy,yet sassiness that seems to be the embodiment of Amanda Bynes. So, I enjoyed it big time in this movie,especially after seeing her Easy A. I liked seeing her play much more mature role and seeing her be more sincere. A certain moment that I saw this was the beginning with the coach explaining how girls couldn't play sports or the intensity you could see her eyes when her boyfriend had taken back that ""She could play soccer as well as any guy."" I thought this scene was well dramatized enough. Now onto the rest of the review, A few other parts I liked were with the girl who wore the eye glasses and headgear by the name of Eunice. I thought she played the kid who tries at getting some and gets nothing part well. She was great at the scene in diner and well towards the toward the ending scene on the field. What I appreciated about this film was they made the parents a little bit more in the know than that of the ones in Easy A. Why I liked this is because in a teen movie,yes, the teen needs to be smart. But, so do the parents. This way the teen is more amazing in comparison and not just getting way with stuff. A few other things I want to mention about the movie are soundtrack and clothing. I enjoyed almost all the songs in this movie. I liked Veronicas the most. Now the clothing, no offense but what was going on with the cheerleading uniforms toward the end of the movie? Anyways ending of review and please, if you are reading this Amanda Bynes, please come back! That is all and good night."
"flutesalad202","8","1","2","3 June 2010"," definitely ""or what you will""
","So because Hollywood cannot come up with anything original anymore, they love to adapt real life stories, books, older movies, or in the case of ""She's the Man,"" Shakespeare's plays. This hilarious teen movie is based on the Bard's play Twelfth Night and stars the perfectly cast Amanda Bynes in the lead role.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that absolutely NOTHING about ""She's the Man"" is believable in any way. Amanda Bynes stars as Viola, a girl whose whole life is soccer, though her mother (played by the amazing Julie Hagerty) would much prefer her to be a debutante. Viola's school team is cut, and her musician twin brother Sebastian is about to sneak off to England to play in a festival behind their divorced parents' backs. Viola decides to teach her school a lesson, and disguises herself as Sebastian and attempts to make his school's soccer team so that she can beat the team that rejected her. So she disguises herself as a boy (with the help of her friend Paul, who oh-so-conveniently owns a beauty salon), and naturally at first everyone thinks there is something amiss. Whatever is amiss with her is somehow passed off as mere social awkwardness, and Viola immediately attracts the attention of the lovely Olivia, on whom Viola's roommate Duke has a huge crush. Olivia, however, is somehow smitten with Viola (whom Olivia thinks is Sebastian), and Viola must somehow get Olivia to go out with Duke, although Viola soon begins to fall for Duke herself. Duke promises to make Viola better at soccer so that she can play against her rival school, and somehow Viola must balance being herself and being Sebastian, and ensuring the right people fall in love with the right people, and practice soccer and attend debutante functions...<br/><br/>Let's begin with the downsides to ""She's the Man."" As penned by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, the team responsible for fellow teen movie Shakespeare adaptation, 1999's ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" this movie has not a shred of believability to it. The actors look like college rather than high school students, except for Amanda Bynes in her Sebastian wig and sideburns, where she looks and sounds like an extremely effeminate twelve-year-old boy. Thus making it all the more unrealistic that someone like Olivia (played by the lovely Laura Ramsey) should even look twice at her, let alone develop a huge crush on her. That being said, ""She's the Man"" is really one huge caricature. Every element of the plot is completely cookie cutter and predictable, and we know each and every plot twist of the movie before it happens.<br/><br/>Yet somehow, this movie is still hugely enjoyable, mostly due to the hilarity of Amanda Bynes' performance. Bynes' facial expressions, physical comedy, and comedic timing and delivery carry this film and make it worth seeing multiple times. Her supporting teen cast also add tremendously to the humor of the movie. Channing Tatum as Duke Orsino is definitely believable as the jock who is only interested in Olivia for her looks, although of course he falls for Viola due to her charming personality and who she really is. Tatum has some hilarious physically comedic moments as well, and does fine in his role. Laura Ramsey is perfect as the sweet and beautiful Olivia. Alex Breckenridge as Sebastian's perpetually-in-a-bad-mood girlfriend, Clifton Murray and Brandon McLaren as soccer jocks Andrew and Toby, Emily Perkins as the geeky Eunice Bates and Jonathan Sadowski as Viola's beauty-salon-owner friend Paul add the perfect elements of fun and comicality to the movie. And the adult cast is also impeccably funny – Julie Hagerty, David Cross and Vinnie Jones are simply delightful in their roles, however much of a caricature their roles may be.<br/><br/>Bottom line for this movie – if you're looking for any surprises or plot twists or a sense of believability, don't see ""She's the Man."" If you're looking for a lot of laughs and immensely enjoyable performances, this movie has them in spades. I give it an 8 out of 10."
"i77310","7","1","2","8 May 2010"," Let's kick some ball!
","I didn't even know this movie exists till I saw the trailer on the advertisement. The trailer is really very funny so I wanted to watch this movie, and the trailer is right, it is really funny.<br/><br/>Viola (Bynes) replaces her twin brother Sebestian to enroll to new school to get into the boys' soccer team by dressing up as boy. A girl develops a crush on her as a boy and she has a crush on a boy who thinks she is a boy. She fights off ex-boyfriend Justin as a girl and her brother's ex-girlfriend as a boy who thinks she is Sebestian.<br/><br/>The movie is funny from start to finish. All the cast did very well. It is a funny comedy. I watched it twice on DVD and loved it."
"eliz_rug","8","1","2","2 May 2010"," Great film, especially for preteens
","I watched this with my 8 year old and we loved it (maybe I did more than her because i remember watching the ""Amanda Show"" with my older daughter). Amanda Bynes is hilarious, and does a great job as a ""guy"". Some of the scenes are really too funny, like with the tampons. I never thought I'd ever see that done by ANYONE, let alone a Hollywood actress. But you can tell Bynes is not the typical Hollywood actress by watching this. You can see how she puts her unique sense of humor into the film, the same sense of humor that made me (as an adult) laugh at the ""Amanda Show"".<br/><br/>It's not a probable scenario in the end, but it doesn't detract from the movie as it's really for kids, and kids want fantasy, not reality. They want a world where everything will be OK, and everyone's happy, and they get that in this movie."
"Cedric_Catsuits","10","1","2","12 April 2010"," Bynes at her best
","Amanda Bynes is far and away the most talented, charming and entertaining actress of her generation, and here at last is a film worthy of her abilities. A light-hearted yet meaningful tale of one girl's struggle to compete on a level playing field with the boys, set against the all-too-familiar backdrop of US school and college life.<br/><br/>Bynes plays the dual role of girl/boy effortlessly, cruising as she always does through scene after scene whilst others can be seen thinking out loud. She is cute, funny, and personable - any film she appears in, instantly becomes watchable. I can even forgive the inclusion of footballer Jones because it really doesn't matter how dim the supporting cast are when you have the brightest star of all out front.<br/><br/>Only a handful of young actresses have this quality - Sarah M.G/P being an obvious example from the next generation up. Unlike SMG, Bynes actually appears to enjoy what she does, and that is very refreshing."
"koolboy_mahendra","10","1","2","22 March 2008"," Amazing!!:-D
","Well what can i say about this movie...Amanda Bynes has completely done a brilliant job in it. Enacting a guy is not that easy and she did an awesome job.<br/><br/>She's the man has a good story and its meant for both the genders and not only females. Guys who like light humour and a witty story can equally enjoy it. A few scenes in the movie will actually make you burst out laughing...all in all its a wonderful movie...a good venture would i say.<br/><br/>I've seen the movie thrice and never got bored of the various comic scenes in it...hats off to Amanda Bynes for her performance.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"avijit_n","8","1","2","13 January 2008"," Nice comedy
","This one is a real nice comedy. It is made in the same way as ""Bend it like Bekham"".<br/><br/>There something you can take from this movie also. Like if you have dedication for something you can get it. It is true for everything; it does not matter if it is football of music.<br/><br/>The girl wants to play football so she acts like a boy. Everybody thinks that she is her brother. Her brother wants to play music so he has flied to London. The girl takes the chance.<br/><br/>The author put the plot very nicely. Nice acting also except once. Nice movie to enjoy with friends and family. This will make your mode in a Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>Only one thing I am not sure why a girl can not play football.Today girls do everything so there is no reason for having restriction. I know we have the same in our society. Hope it will go away soon!!"
"lopes_soccer_15","10","1","2","27 December 2007"," great movie of 2006 and 2007
","this movie is my favorite of all time. i watched last year and forgot about it but bought it and now i watch it everyday.the chemistry with Olivia(laura Ramsey) and Sebastian(Amanda Bynes)is so great its actually like shes flirting with him. the fight with duke and Sebastian(viola) was so real and really good.the actors and actress' are all very funny and hot(Especially laura Ramsey). the movie is a laugh out movie but also touching at other times.so all in all this was the best movie. the soccer scenes could've been a bit better. didn't like the end at the soccer game and how duke and everyone found out thought it would've been better if they didn't know about it. when Olivia kissed real Sebastian thought it would've been better if it was viola, Sebastian would've made a bigger twist."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","1","2","2 September 2007"," Hilarious Comedy
","Amanda Bynes has always been a hilarious, gorgeous young actress. Her last film, What a Girl Wants, was excellent, but never truly as funny as it could have been. She's the Man, however, was perfect in almost every way and hopefully the beginning of ...(read more)several other hilarious Amanda movies. The acting was great, the script was very well-written, and the romantic elements were done with amazing precision. I especially loved Channing Tatum's role, and most of the comedy was rooted between Tatum and Bynes. A great film overall that showcases all of Amanda's greatest qualities and even goes the extra mile with making a great comedy with several laugh-out-loud moments."
"joliefille411","10","1","2","24 August 2007"," Some are Born Great...
","When I saw the first preview for this, I nearly passed out from excitement. I have long been a fan of Twelfth Night- it turned me on to Shakespeare, so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true. My anticipation was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! I don't want to even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. Just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create. I will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is NOT the point of the film.<br/><br/>What it IS, though, is absolutely hilarious. Nearly every scene nails the comedic set-up. Kudos to the writers, director and actors on that count.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully. She's super-cute, not a vixen and can do faultless comedy. I admire her so much for not going full-on tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do. I'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in Hollywood. OK, I'm off my soap-box...<br/><br/>Channing Tatum, yeah he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favourite scenes in the whole movie are when he's trying to converse with Olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimen.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did not fail to perform either, with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane débutante mother and Monique, the classic evil girlfriend.<br/><br/>Overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughs, and a highly attractive cast. Maybe not on par with the original, but it beats out modern versions of other plays, including the much-touted 10 things I Hate About You."
"Pauliinka12","9","1","2","18 March 2007"," Comedy to remember
","I will start of by saying this was definitely one of the best chick flicks I have ever seen. It made me laugh , laugh and laugh some more. Amanda Bynes did a great job playing both ""Viola"" & ""Sebastian"" . She pulled off the guy look, voice and walk oh yes and soccer skills. Channing Tatum as well as the other actors did a great part going along with this hoax.I know that i could sit in front of my television and watch this movie over and over again because of its funny skits. In reality no one would really pull a stunt like pretending to be someones brother in order to try out for the boys soccer team to play her EX's soccer team in the season opener, but its a movie and a darn good one!It is not like any other chick flick there is nothing sad about it because at the end everyone gets what they wanted it has a great ending even though you would not expect it at all. All in all the movie was a success and I would recommend it to any girl out there. You figure things out about what guys ""MOST"" guys think and really want to say to you & you get A lot of laughs out of it."
"jcd_91","10","1","2","22 October 2006"," The Best Movie out there!!
","If you haven't seen this movie than you need to. It rocks and you have to watch it. It is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out!! so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny. so you have to. yes i have memorized the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish. you must see this move. it is also cute because it is half a chick flick. if you don't watch it then you are really missing out.this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus. so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake. did i mention the music is good too. So you should like it if you enjoy music. This is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone."

","I thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was hot, plain and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses--as she is pretending to be a guy! I re-watched this part over and over... to make a long story short, the movie I thought was going to be lame--I now own it."

","The movie was great and everything but, there were a lot of mistakes in the ""soccer"" scenes, i wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match before..? first of all, i don't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team? in soccer boys and girls cant play in the same team and these are the FIFA rules. And don't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually a girl they let her continue to play...!! second of all, players cant paint their faces with colours and play like that, again FIFA rules not mine.<br/><br/>and don't get me started on the way they scored goals its was ridiculous completely unrealistic. and all the players seemed like they didn't know Jack about soccer.<br/><br/>and when duke was training Viola why did they only concentrate on shooting what happened to passing and dribbling. or was shooting her only problem?! and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room were for players from Chelse ?! don't they like any other players from any other teams.? it was like this was the only team they know...! but other than that the movie was good and i enjoyed the rest of it, just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me. they really should have consulted some one a bout them...!"
"jeremyfuller102","4","1","2","11 October 2006"," It was a little hard to watch...
","I just saw this movie and I was mildly entertained. I thought the main girl did a pretty good job at playing a boy. I got some laughs out of this, a little. However, I stopped watching it after a while because it was pretty predictable, and basically Hollywood regurgitation. This isn't all that surprising because it seems like a lot of movies made now a days are like that. I got a little bored with this one because it was basically a remake of ""Just One of the Guys."" I think that one was better though. Maybe because it was more original, I don't know. But I found it painful to sit through this. I mean, doesn't anyone remember the more original movie ""Just One of the Guys."" I guess teens don't remember or something, who knows."
"xpoison","10","1","2","7 October 2006"," Awesome movie!
","I just rented this movie from the video store last night. It being new and not released long ago here, the rent was only overnight. Me, my little sis, and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched. Once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically. Even my brother. This movie is hilarious, I actually laughed. No matter how funny some movies are... even if I think its funny I sometimes can't seem to laugh. But this movie... I laughed. My brother ended up thinking it was the best ""that type of movie"" he had seen. I ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later."
"kyyle7311","10","1","2","20 September 2006"," Great misperception writing
","This was a fantastically written screenplay when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective. The comedy was timely and not overdone, the acting was generally terrific, and the plot line served a greater purpose of generating misconception when we think about people solely based on their external appearance. The plot twists as the brother/sister character of Amanda Bynes tries to play soccer on the boys team finding instead a new love interest along the way. Tatum Channing is where the real misperception lies and he does a fine job of acting disinterested at first, later coming to realize the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude."

Movie is really great. Maybe I liked it for actress,maybe for all the scenery,but i liked it.The whole atmosphere that was created.In one moment I just felt like I was in that university,in that room.It is not another drama movie that is made to win Oscar,it is just nice movie to watch in your free time."
"funnynnaf","10","1","2","18 September 2006"," film that encourages u to find your fairy tale
","this is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance & dream. you may say:' there have been lots of these kind of films already. but just believe me, you'll find this a good one because it's well directed, scripted and played. Amanda Bynes's just crazily amazing! she's humor, cute & charming both inside & outside the screen. she's the MAN indeed!!! the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale. what i mean by'fairy tale' is not the one with prince & princess, but indicates 'faith'. namely, it tells us to hold your faith, dream & things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't do that. one of those movies you can't miss out in your life."
"stephe1605","6","1","2","7 September 2006"," not as good as ""10 Things I Hate About You""
","First, the good stuff: Amanda Bynes is an extremely talented comic actress. I can easily see her making the kind of light comedies in her 20s that Reese Witherspoon made in her 20s. She has a great expressive (and pretty) face, and a way with a line. <br/><br/>And there were a few good one-liners that surprised me. Jokes I never see coming lift any so-so movie.<br/><br/>But...where it should have been subtle like ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" everything was so broad, parts of it stopped making sense. Like when she's called into the principal's office. Why *is* she called into the principal's office? It's never explained, the scene doesn't move the plot, nor is it particularly funny (except when she gets her wrap caught in the drawer.) The scene's only purpose was to introduce the wacky principal...who really isn't all that important.<br/><br/>Why does she speak like Elvis when she's dressed like a man? Her brother doesn't speak like Elvis, wouldn't she imitate him? <br/><br/>There's a fight in the ladies room which is as needless and unfunny as the fight in the ladies room in ""Bringing Down the House."" (Only minutes earlier, Amanda was hilariously eating a chicken leg, then the film stoops to this cliché)<br/><br/>It's also unfortunate the film came out after ""Bend It Like Beckham"" which had these great , dizzying soccer sequences. The soccer in this movie was kind of boring. Furthermore, Keira Knightly was absolutely believable as an ace soccer player, watching Amanda play was kind of like watching some kind of soccer little league.<br/><br/>And the jokes at Eunice's expense were just cheap. Let's make fun of the ugly girl!<br/><br/>The theme of ""Twelfth Night"" and ""Tootsie"" is learning to be a better man by being a woman, (or vice versa), the contrivance of getting a man into a dress, or a woman into soccer gear should always be secondary. Here, Viola learns nothing! Not that every film should have a weepy message, but by skipping the theme, the characters just come off as cardboard cut- outs in a contrived story."

Does any 1 no email me please or add a comment.It Starts Zaga Zow, Ziga Zow something along those lines.

","She's the Man was the funniest movie I have ever seen. I laughed so hard that I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. It sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either. Channing and Amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. When you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene. It was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been funnier. And Channing is going to be a huge star. This is just the first of many for this bright new star."

It was GREAT.<br/><br/>Okay, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but I thought the performances were still overall great. Also, you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie. In other movies, that have surprisingly won awards, where the actors didn't like working on the film, you could tell. All of the actors had chemistry, and that also showed.<br/><br/>A ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have. Yah, so they're not perfect...get over it! They are actors, not soccer players. I have been playing soccer for my whole life, and trust me, it is hard to learn, so stop ripping on the level of skills they have.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny. I found myself laughing a lot in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall..I LOVE IT!"
"tombo19842000","6","1","2","19 August 2006"," Move forwards with your acting career Amanda please!!!!
","Amanda Bynes is one of my favourite actresses to come out of the States recently, i mean she has blatantly got acting talent, but her career really screams out for a role that doesn't result in a waste of her talents as there is in this movie. She really needs to challenge and test her acting skills with something a little more dramatic and serious... I hold Amanda in the same category as Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow / The Phantom of The Opera) but think an actress like Rossum is always going to out-stage an actress like Amanda when she limits herself to these types of movies. OK she's done, She's the Man, What a Girl Wants and several other movies which were never released to DVD. Now i think she should move into the more serious genre... I mean in my opinion in this movie, apart from some very limited humour, she ended up looking embarrassingly alone when it came to her supporting cast. Apart from the excellent comedic performance as always by Vinnie Jones! I really do hope she doesn't end up following the path laid out by Lindsay Lohan, staying with the comedy's and romantic movies, as this is another example of a actress wasting her talents on less worthy movies...<br/><br/>I really do hope she moves on with her acting career, out of romantic comedies..."

Its about a girl named Viola who wants to play soccer, but when her school cuts the girls soccer team she gets upset. Her brother is set to go to a prestigious school and he decides to leave to England. So Viola wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the boarding school. She goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team. She gets in. Meanwhile she meets Duke who is a sensitive guy who plays on the soccer team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian-who is really viola. Sebastian is dating Monique and suspects that Sebastian isn't being himself.<br/><br/>This is certainly NOT a chick flick and I enjoyed it a lot. Its so funny and lovable. I don't think I have seen AManda act better."
"beccad90","7","1","2","8 August 2006"," Amanda Bynes IS the Man...well...sort of...
","This is one of the funniest movies that Amanda Bynes has done...EVER! I mean, it's the first full scale adult humor flick I have seen her in. Everything else has been for a relatively younger audience (Don't get me wrong though. I liked What A Girl Wants).<br/><br/>Okay, here's the plot of the film in a nutshell: Viola Hastings is a soccer loving tomboy who has her hopes up for joining the soccer team, but when the school cuts her team because of gender discrimination and she dumps her idiot boyfriend for agreeing with them, she does the unthinkable...she goes to her out of twin brother, Sebastian's school...as Sebastian! When she falls for her...or his...new roommate, Duke...and he likes Olivia...but she likes Sebastian...er, Viola as Sebastian...and he's dating Monique...an interesting love triangle...er, rectangle, ensues...Confusing, no? It's got an awesome soundtrack, as well! I bought it off of iTunes, primarily for one song, but I wound up liking the other songs.<br/><br/>Favorite Character: Viola, because she is an independent tomboy who's never afraid to do what she wants.<br/><br/>Favorite Moment: When Duke and Viola (As Sebastian) Hug each other, turn around and scream! Classic!<br/><br/>10/10. Absolutely hilarious and adult...not too adult, though...probably for those 15+. See it! It's worth the watch!"
"Luv2Cheer2202","10","1","2","8 August 2006"," My Second Favorite Movie EVER
","I thought She's the Man was a hilarious movie that you can watch over and over again, without it losing any of its funny moments. It was original. I can't say that I can remember seeing a movie quite like it (though I'm sure one has probably been made). It was a light-hearted movie that had a relevant theme. The music is really bouncy and goes with the movie well. If you don't like the movie, you still might like the soundtrack. The fact that it is loosely based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Knight doesn't hurt it's reputation. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone who's okay with a few bad words. In short, if you're in high school, like me, you most likely love this movie unless you're uptight and way to mature. So go see it!! <br/><br/>PS- Channing Tatum (Duke) isn't horrible to look at. :D"
"FurBallsUnite","Null","1","2","2 August 2006"," Just didn't feel right
","I'm a big fan of these types of movies (e.g. - ""Aquamarine,"" ""Mean Girls,"" and other flicks directed to semi-younger crowds), so I naturally rented this movie right away. My friend and I were unimpressed. Overall, the movie was quite average. Amanda Bynes is attractive and has charisma on screen, but everything else felt wrong. her love interest (named Duke) was a complete wigger. This actor's ""wiggerness"" worked like a charm in ""Havoc,"" and I really think it is going to work in ""Step Up."" In ""She's the Man,"" however, it was out-of-place. Aren't these kids supposed to be rich? His voice really annoyed me and made me feel like I was watching ""Malibu's Most Wanted."" Also, Bynes' male voice was a little tedious to listen to at times. The love triangles were also silly and unrealistic. Why would Duke suddenly go from head-over-heels in love with Olivia to crazy about Amanda Bynes' character? It was a little goofy. Plus, the mean girl wasn't given much screen time, and her character pretty much just made cameos. ""Mean Girls,"" on the other hand, was put together perfectly in nearly every way; even the critics raved about that movie. ""She's the Man"" just lacks the appeal and realism of other movies in its genre.<br/><br/>Overall, I would only recommend this movie to pre-teens or serious fans of Amanda Bynes."
"witeSharpie","9","1","2","2 August 2006"," Watching it 3 times just wasn't enough!
","Gosh i haven't seen a funny movie in a while. i rented this one at blockbuster and i was really happy with it. Hmm well this was Amanda Bynes best role yet, I used to watch her growing up back in All That and in The Amanda Show and you get to see a lot of her personality brought up here. I just though Channing Tatum needed a bit more acting classes because he got a real big role for him to handle. Some of deliverance of lines just turned me off. Even though he's really hot, he should know how to recite really well. Over all besides that the movie was great. Hope to see more of Amanda having good roles like this."
"LazySod","7","1","2","1 August 2006"," Fun brainless summer flick
","Each and every summer a number of films gets released that works best when the brain is disconnected from the body. This is one of those. Viola wants to play football (as in, soccer). The girl team gets canned, so it looks like her dreams won't be coming true there. But, there's a chance - a slim one: her brother is out of the country for a while and she might just be able to take his place for a bit.<br/><br/>And presto, you've got the start up for a series of misunderstandings, college jokes, light homophobia, bits of under the belt zone humor, and all in all, enough good stuff to get a light film rolling and keeping it rolling until the end sequence starts.<br/><br/>Bynes is one of the many oncoming actresses and she plays this one nice enough - not that the film thrives on good or bad acting, the storyline is too thin for that. All other characters are done nice enough too (with a plethora of clichés played out), and all in all I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this one.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 girls in the boys football team."
"chigeechickie","10","1","2","31 July 2006"," Awesome Movie
","I really don't see how anybody can hate on this move. It is absolutely awesome. It made me and my family laugh out loud. Just down right funny. Not your average romantic movie cliché. It's not a raunchy teen movie. And it's appropriate for all ages; me and my 11yr old niece watched it every night she was here, which was 2 wks. Then my sister and I went to a friends house, guess what movie we brought She's the Man. We watch it with my friends and all her younger sisters. And we all enjoyed it non-stop laughing and commenting. And yes, It still makes me laugh. I bet they're going to go buy it tomorrow. What are you still sitting here for when you could be watching She's the Man?!"
"nbeale-2","9","1","2","28 July 2006"," The movie's the thing wherein I'll catch the interest of the kids.
","One of the joys of having young daughters is that on occasion they force you to watch super fun movies you'd otherwise never watch. Movies that make arguments in ways concerned parents never can. ""She's the Man"" is one such flick. A great advertisement for the greatest writer in the English language. Yup, it's based on Twelfth Night. Now, they don't have to listen to me drone on about the joys of Shakespeare, they can see for themselves, and say ""I'm so there it's Insane"". The fact that it pumps real 'football' (not NFL) with some great on-the-field action shots (wonder how much FIFA ponied up) is an added bonusI didn't even mind the I-can-do-anything-you-can-do gender equality angle, or the happy American ending.<br/><br/>Next stop: Ethan Hawke's Hamlet. Then, ever so gently, the texts themselves."
"xaengouthichamphone","10","1","2","27 July 2006"," She's the Man...great concept.
","When my friends and I were bored, we decided we wanted to go see She's the Man. We are typical college kids, who didn't think that She's the Man would be entertaining. We just thought, ""we'll go see a cheesy movie to get rid of our boredom."" Well, as it turns out, we went and saw the movie and came out of the theatre with laughter and smiles on our face. It was great. Yes, I'd admit that i love this movie because all the guys were really good looking (I mean all of them). The director was good at casting this movie, he was smart and clever and knew how to attract an audience. She's the Man had a brilliant actress/comedian...Amanda Bynes, whom was hilarious and played her role well. I also love how they incorporated soccer, rather than their original plans of having her pretend to be a guy to play the part of ""Hamlet."" Let's just say I bought the movie now and it's a good ""rainy day movie""."
"gregarces","8","1","2","24 July 2006"," Amanda Bynes, she can do comedy, and that's rare
","There's a jewel in this film, and rarely enough in this type of movies, is the lead. Amanda Bynes is so good playing a man that you forget is her, and really think is a dorky, effeminate man. Weird? you bet, but is also brilliant. Bynes is one of a couple of good promising actors out there, and if she get at least one good role, she will score big time. One other thing about her is her ability to be funny, and believable, and that's so rare, you don't see that anymore. She have this natural comedic ability that is amazing she is 20, look like she's been around for a long time. Maybe she was. Aside that, the fans of the beautiful game will not buy this one. They could have put a little more effort in making the game in the end believable, specially with Vinnie Jones, a former wales international football player, in the role of the coach. I just think that a penalty kick to the bar, back to one's player header and back to the kicker just in time for a flipping' kick and the net, is just too much, but maybe is me. I love football too much to see it like that, a mockery. But then i think, i just saw the best comedic performer in a long time, and i just past that issue, and have fun, because that is the point of the movie, a point that many people have forgotten. The performance of bynes is refreshing, and maybe a mature role (that according to this page, wouldn't happen at least until next year) in a funny mature movie will be the best for her and we will see the promise that this movie brings. This movie have some gaps, that's true, but little Amanda fills them. Just imagine her without the gaps. You see it? i do, in the future."
"wrlang","9","1","2","22 July 2006"," She's definitely not a man, but a good actor
","I've seen a dozen movies like this stretching back to the b/w era, so I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was funny, well acted, and directed very well. Viola is a tom-boy soccer addict who has a twin brother musician named Sebastian who takes off to London for a few weeks to try and be found, while Viola covers for him with their divorced parents. When Viola's soccer team is cut at her school and the boy's team, including her now ex-boyfriend Justin, won't let her play, she takes her brother's place at his school and joins the boy's soccer team  the arch rival to her school's boy's soccer team, to show them all she can play. She has to avoid all the guy stuff that would reveal her gender while falling in love with Duke, and then her brother comes back to help complicate things. All the usually suspects and situations are there, but the fast pace and fresh interactions in the movie keep it from dying a painful death. It's not meant to be believable, it's meant to be good clean fun  and it is."
"cdcolenda","9","1","2","21 July 2006"," Definitely one of the best films of 2006 so far!
","This movie was freaking hilarious from beginning to end. Sure it was based of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night Or What You Will, but no teenager would believe you if you told them that.I would like to point out that this movie connected to every type of person...boy,girl,teenager,adult...everyone. I would love to recommend this movie for everyone out there that is looking for a feel good movie and actually sits back and enjoys movies rather than criticize them. And by the way this is not really a chick-flick. I mean sure...a lot of it is, but I'm a guy and I have unfortunately seen a lot of chick flicks...and they were all boring as hell, but this one keeps you entertained and in the end satisfied.And just a recommendation for guys,this is a great movie to take your girlfriend to see..No doubt in my mind one of the best movies of 2006!!!!10/10."
"trinadw","8","1","2","21 July 2006"," Cute Movie!
","'She's the Man'is a really good movie if your looking for something that will be suitable for the whole family, as are all of the Amanda Bynes movies that I've seen. Younger children may not fully understand or be interested in it and my brother didn't seem to enjoy it that much. The movie is cute and has a lot of humor. It's not really something that you could watch over and over and over, like I did with sixth sense, but something light hearted to make you laugh at the end of the day. The story was well written and the actors/actresses did a great job, although I didn't really see how Amanda could pass as a guy, especially since she kept changing to the girl voice in the middle of conversation. I think my favorite scenes were those when she got hit with a ball, and the spider scene. I hope you enjoy this film."

","I love this movie! It has a wonderful cast and up to beat songs!! Me and my sister could not stop laughing through the whole movie! Amanda Bynes is wonderful in this flick and she really had me convinced she was a man! As for channing tatum, he fit the role so well no one could have came close to playing Duke as good as he had! From the beginning to the end of the movie I was on the floor rolling with the movies inside jokes! as soon as the movie was done me and my sister knew we had to buy the soundtrack because the music in this movie is unbelievable! I would recommended this movie to anyone!! A definite great teen flick!"
"Moodygrl715","10","1","2","19 July 2006"," Frickin Hilarious
","I loved this movie. I am big fan of Amanda Bynes and have loved all of her work so I expected this to be funny. Then all of my friends told me how hilarious it was and I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed. But despite all of this I still wasn't ready for the comedic genius of ""She's the Man"". Even my twelve year old brother enjoyed this movie and we spent the night busting our guts while laughing out loud. Amanda Bynes is cute, smart, and although not a convincing boy, she is just as funny as ever. Channing Tatum is great as Duke and even he makes me laugh.(Also as my friends had told me he looks pretty darn good) The script and cast make this a must see movie for all ages. Something that surprised me was how well the soccer scenes were shot. It made soccer look like a really exciting sport. So kudos to everyone involved with ""She's the Man"" for providing a stunningly funny movie and a new interest(soccer) for myself."
"eXtreme23","7","1","2","18 July 2006"," This is the kind of comedy Amanda Bynes should be doing
","It's hard enough being the nerdy new guy on campus without also being the new girl on campus, who has fallen for the coolest guy on campus, who is totally obsessed with the most beautiful girl on campus, who is ""crushing"" on the nerdy new guy on campus. That's just the beginning in this contemporary comedy inspired by Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night."" The tagline basically explains what this movie is all about. Amanda Byens stars as Viola. A girl with good looks who is indeed a tomboy, and who loves to play soccer. But when the girls team gets cut off, she decides that she wants to prove that she is good enough. After her brother, Sebastian, played by James Kirk wants to go to London and sing his music, Viola decides to move into his school pretending to be him so she could focus on soccer. So Viola dresses up like her brother and obviously pretends to be him. She later meets her 3 roommates. The three of them think he (she) is loser, but later they soon find out that he can seem pretty cool. One of his (her) roommates is played by Channing Tatum and he plays Duke, the guy who likes Viola but really wants a girl named Olivia and thinks that he can get her if only Sebastian can help him get her. So many things happen in this movie which makes it seem like a ""high school comedy"" which they really aren't in high school.<br/><br/>I think that Amanda Bynes is very good. This is the kind of comedy she should be doing. She shouldn't be doing movies like ""What A Girl Wants."" I want to see her do some movies like this because she is really good. I grew up watching the hit TV show, ""All That,"" which aired on Nickelodeon and featured Amanda in it and she always did good. So I feel that she should be doing more comedic roles. She's really good at them.<br/><br/>I felt that this was a funny movie. It may seem predictable because there are so many movies out there in which someone dresses up as the opposite sex and we all know what will happen. There is a girl who falls for a guy who is really a girl. But I liked the way this movie pulled it off. This movie is an underrated movie. I don't why some people missed out on this. It didn't do too well at the box office. A few critics bought it and liked it. I have to agree with them. This was a good movie. So this is why I am recommending it. I give it a 7.5/10."
"nada_87","7","1","2","9 July 2006"," Funny!!
","Amanda Bynes carries this film on her shoulders and the result isn't too bad at all! We all knew she did great impersonations, admittedly I used to watch her show on Nickolodeon from time to time. Her talents have improved further since then and she is a comedic genius in this film. Going into this film I thought 'oh no, why have I agreed to watch this teen film, someone save me!'. By the time Viola dresses up and goes to her brother's school as Sebastian, I forgot what the alternative to watching this even was! Hilarious parts follow one another, the result being the whole theatre laughing out loud continuously for 5 minutes or more at a time, something which I haven't experienced in a while to be honest! It's an idea that has been used so many times, male dresses up as female, female dresses up as male yet there are some true comedic parts in there which are original, fresh! And Bynes' own talent just adds to the fun!! Great comedy, which I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a few laughs."

","If you liked 10 things I hate about you then you'll love this too. It is a classic chick flick but there's plenty for the boys to enjoy as well:plenty of female eye candy and football! The whole hidden identity theme is cleverly done and there are some terrific laugh out loud moments as we observe viola's struggles at trying to convince everyone she's her twin brother. It is quite predictable, as these movies often are, but that's the beauty of it. It is such a great comedy that you don't mind when you're not surprised by the ending. Vinnie Jones turns in a typical performance that you've seen before - shouting and making angry faces but he does it well enough. But the star of the movie is Viola played by Amanda Bynes - she is truly a great comedienne. Just check out her witty one-liners and facial expressions ... Hilarious!"

The acting by Channing Tatum wasn't so good in my opinion, maybe I'm the only one who thinks that but you can just see it, could be more natural. Emily Perkins did her job just perfect, she was in it for like 5 - 10 minutes maybe but i enjoyed it totally. Amanda Bynes did a good job to I guess. I only know her from the TV show ""What I Like About You"" so ya whatever. <br/><br/>Everyone with a good sense of humor should watch it and of course all the Emily Perkins fans!"

I hope that Channing will make more sport movies with romance like this one. Plus I love the fact that this movie has to deal with Shakespeares play Twelfth Night. I love the whole love triangle or square love, the way that Duke likes Olvia who likes Sebastian, who is really Viola who likes Duke, but Monique likes Viola's real twin brother Sebastian. Confusing at some times, but a great movie all in all."

The dialogs are natural and flow well, and the boys' reactions to the girl (Viola) pretending to be a boy is just hilarious to watch. Especially in the tampons scenes.<br/><br/>The script is well written as we see the plot falling into place before the climax scene. So what if we'd already guess what's going to happen in the end? It's fun to watch anyway.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone who wants to have good fun in the cinema because it'll definitely make you laugh."
"johnjacos","8","1","2","30 May 2006"," Not bad at all... pleasantly surprised
","I went into this one with a negative approach. I thought that this one was going to be another one of those teen-comedy movies. But was I wrong...<br/><br/>sure, there were some very predictable parts, and some boring parts, but this one actually stood out despite its weak storyline, and despite the fact that this is another teen movie. This one pleasantly surprised me. It was pretty funny!<br/><br/>I thought this movie was overall pretty funny and well directed. Maybe I haven't seen enough cross gender roles movies, but this one was a pleasant change because most comedies are guys acting as girls, and this one, for a change was a girl acting as a guy. Oh.. and I thought the casting was done well enough that Sebastian and Viola could actually be credible in playing twins. (ok, maybe a stretch of the imagination is needed in some minor places). As for the acting, I think they all did their roles pretty well. So hats off to them.<br/><br/>My thoughts on the movie: this movie is not one of those that will blow your mind or change your life. In all honesty, it's a rather crass idea of a movie, but aren't all teen movies like that? So if you go and watch this movie, I suggest you to go in with an open mind and don't expect any clever or life changing plot. Just watch and enjoy!"

There was a memorable line that she said that I haven't seem to have forgotten in years: ""This girl Amanda will come a long way in her acting."" And she was right, here she is now playing in popular DreamWorks Pictures movies acting. It got straight to the story. It didn't seem to waste time on the chit chat, the idea just seemed to be ""Get on with he story our audience is waiting."" The plot was excellent. I loved the acting (especially from Amanda Bynes). David Cross was funny (as usual). I've always found him to be funny. He had about 20 lines or so, but boy he's funny. The laughs just keep coming. I'm not sure whether to call them childish, offensive, mature or cheesy, but I don't care, I was laughing so hard. I'm sure you will too. It was a full theater where i was and everyone seemed to be loving it. The direction is good too. I recommend to anyone who' a fan on Amanda Bynes or David Cross or perhaps even Vinnie Jones or any actor/actress. 10/10"

","I'm 20, English, male and a bit of a film buff. So not the target audience then? Hayfever was right: the music was horrible. Bynes misses as many times as she hits and the cringe factor is very high. However, as much as there is wrong with this movie, there is also a lot right. Shakespeare's plot still provides interest but the key strength of this movie lies in the wonderful supporting characters and talented cast (with possible exception of Bynes and definite exception of Tatum) providing all the many laughs and heart to the movie. Loved rival/love interest Laura Ramsey, best guy-mate Sadowski and brother Kirk. Julie Haggerty is always a joy to watch and with her role in Just Friends (LOVE Ryan Reynolds!) is cornering funny, nut-job mothers in crap, likable movies. However, the real genius of the piece is Arrested Development's David Cross as the Principal. He and Haggerty provide belly-laughs and Ramsey et al provide heart.<br/><br/>3/5 F"

","The basic plot is she pretends to be her brother, while he's away in England, so that she can get on the boys soccer team to prove she's just as good at soccer as any boy.<br/><br/>The film is a decent adaption of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and Shakepeare is pretty hard to mess up, as long as you stick relatively close to the original script which the film does.<br/><br/>The film does require some suspension of belief but no more so then most films. For instance, she's living in the boys dorms, with a roommate, in a building with communal showers and somehow no one even suspects that she's a girl. But, once you just accept the fact that she can somehow pass as a guy the film ends up being a lot of fun if taken for what it claims to be, a feel good romantic comedy/sports movie."

"american_idol_luva","9","1","2","14 April 2006"," I won't ruin anything, but basically, Viola dresses up as Sebastian and several girls have crushes on him/her.
","This was a GREAT movie, if your looking for a funny chick flick. It had funny moments, and I will probably be adding it to my DVD collection as soon as it comes out. If you don't want to go because it's an Amanda Bynes movie, think again. Amanda does a great job, way better than anything from her Nickelodeon shows or What a Girl Wants. As far as it being appropriate for kids, there is some dialogue and a few iffy things but I'd say it's okay for kids ages 10 and up. OOOOOOOO and there are a couple of REALLY hot guys on the soccer team! I don't know who plays him, but the guy that likes Eunice is really hot! This movie is a must see for teen girls!"
"bensanders","9","1","2","14 April 2006"," as funny as Shakespeare
","This stays very true to the spirit of Twelfth Night (to the extent of it being obvious from the trailer), and was immensely enjoyable to watch, with all the expected romantic confusions from the cross dressing, as in the original Shakespeare. Most of the characters are named for the equivalent characters in Twelfth night with some minor changes; Viola and her brother Sebastian keep their names, although she pretends to be her brother rather than assuming a new male name (Cesario in the original). Amusingly, Orsino, Duke of Illyria, just becomes Duke, one of the players for the Illyrian football team. It was well acted, and I'm still smiling now I'm home from the cinema. Maybe it had a little too much football, in my opinion, but one doesn't need to like football to like this movie."

","What a great comedy. Amanda Bynes once again proves she's a great young talent in this somewhat clichÃ© movie. Most of the cast are great up and comers who will be what I reckon big stars in the near future. The movie itself was a laugh-fest where Bynes gets close to being caught out, but always manages to get out of it.<br/><br/>My favourite scene in the whole movie would be when Viola (Bynes) as Sebastian first meets her roommates in the new school. And when one of them finds tampons in her bag, she says she uses them to stop nose bleeds, then actually puts one in her nose! Hilarious stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 8/10. Bynes fans will be falling of their chairs in laughter. Great comedy!"
"ckcharm","9","1","2","9 April 2006"," Amanda Bynes always comes through with the right dose of comedy.
","All I was expecting out of this film was something light and fun, and I ended up walking out of the theater enjoying it even more than that. Amanda Bynes always does a good job with the comedy - be it physical or otherwise. Her portrayal of a girl masquerading as a boy captured the confusion that each sex has of the other perfectly.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was great, and helped move the film along at an easy pace - it never felt like it was dragging, and more than once the music helped get you into the scene. As this is based upon Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" it was nice to have little details which reminded the audience of that connection. The soccer scenes were excellent as well, and made for more enjoyable viewing.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely worth a watch, and I know that I'll end up buying it on DVD."

It held your attention, from beginning to end. The comedy in it, was made for girls. We both could not stop laughing. What made it so good, was that it was a believable story line. Plus it was so different. It was not just the same old movie made with different people. I wish they would have a better trailer for it. I was not planning on seeing this movie, due to the trailer, and I saw it, because it was the only movie left, I was so surprised. It turn out to be such a good movie. I am so glad I saw it now.

","I happened to enjoy the movie a lot. Usually I'm not into comedy movies<br/><br/>I'm more of a scary movie person, anyways I thought it was good.I mostly enjoyed looking at the guys Channing Tatum & Robert Hoffman. If you want a movie w/ hot guys. This is best for you. Besides the incredibly hot guys, the movie also had something else I enjoy, soccer. If you are into soccer, this movie is for you too. I enjoyed the soccer because I saw the hot guys sweat & play & it was pretty good to watch. Also, soccer is one of my favorite sports to play. Another thing I liked was the fights. There were plenty of action fights in the movie between the girls & the guys. I liked the guys fighting more but thats just me. To end the how the movie was, the comedy made it complete. There were times i was laughing along w/ my friends in the theaters because...duh...it was funny. It's #3 on on my top 10 movies. I say you go see it. It's awesome to watch & I want to go back & see it again."

","I have seen the movie twice, now, and find it a happy experience. The credits, the stars making appearances to plug the movie, the reviews all harp on how the story is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Maybe they are afraid someone with a similar story might sue for copyright violation. Personally I would have preferred to see a bit less of the Shakespeare influence. For one thing, fights were thrown in to entertain Shakespeare's audiences, but the fights were also thrown in here. hey are distracting, drawn out, unappealing, and could have contributed to the story better as a one-line snide comment.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I was impressed with the understated way the movie explores how men can express emotions, that honor, loyalty, and friendship are virtues even today, and that girls that play soccer sweat and need showers. The Illyria coach was superb -- took due note of who practiced extra, kept from getting too close to his players to maintain discipline, and showed a simple code of honor and responsibility to his players and to the world.<br/><br/>I had fun watching 'She's The Man'."

","Shakespeare is cheering! So funny, I laughed out loud--in fact, I fell over laughing (good thing I was with a friend...). The contrast between the character personalities of the hero and heroine (disguised as a hero) is just right: Viola brings out the best in Duke. The physical comedy is handled with finesse, if I may be so bold as to use such a word for such antics, and are terrific for dynamic energy. The supporting cast is as pricelessly funny and enjoyable as the principals--in fact, the movie couldn't do without them! So what if some of the jokes could have been predicted...the acting, which means the characterization, the timing, the delivery, the freshness of personalities, was ""spot on!"" Dig? Go see it!!"

"Legendary_Badass","6","1","2","25 March 2006"," Better than most in the genre, but I had one problem with it.
","Amanda Bynes stars in ""She's The Man"", a teen comedy of gender role reversal. Bynes shines as Viola a girl who pretends to be her brother Sebastian. She does this because her school recently disbanded her all female soccer team, and he plans to take a secret vacation in London. Since his new prep school has never seen the actual Sebastian, Viola assumes her brother's identity and heads to school. There she joins the boy's soccer team and meets her fellow teammates with whom she wants to defeat her former school's boys team. Once at her new school, she makes quiet a splash with the student body. This paves the way for romantic triangles as girls fall for her, and she falls for her teammate Duke.<br/><br/>In a movie like this, the lead will make or break it. Here, Bynes proves that she is a young up and comer that can do comedy. As a boy, she is convincing enough to make the movie work. Her comedic timing, voice, and mannerisms make for an enjoyable viewing. Once seeing his (her) skill with picking up girls, Duke asks of her to set him up with the hottest-girl-in-school Olivia. I particularly liked how as her feelings for Duke develop, she then has to turn away the very likable Olivia. Turns out that the ""guy"" Olivia wants is our protagonist. Oh what is Viola to do? For the most part, this movie succeeds because of the characters. For example, Olivia is a popular girl that isn't shallow. Same goes for Duke, who despite being a stud, is actually shy around girls. The fact that it is based on Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" doesn't hurt. I can't wholeheartedly recommend it because of the poorly handled way a scene below is done, and up till that point I was very much enjoying this picture.<br/><br/>*(Spoilers)* I was really enjoying this movie, until the soccer game exhibitionism. Maybe since Sebastian wants to be a rock star, he's OK with pulling his pants down in front of a stadium full of people. However, I think it was really uncalled for that Viola has to prove that she is a girl in a similar way. It doesn't even make sense. Why would she need to prove that? She is on the guy's soccer team. Flashing everyone wasn't necessary. If she just said that she's a girl, and took off the wig, then it is clear enough. It seems out of character for her to do that, especially since she goes to lengths to take showers very early. Just as strange is the fact that no one even talks about it afterward. Her parents aren't even mad. Duke doesn't strike me as a guy that would go out with a girl that did that. I'm disappointed that the filmmakers decided this was necessary, because it doesn't fit nor seem appropriate for the characters or the genre."

","""She's the Man"" is definitely a chic flick, and well worth watching. I may have to buy this one when it comes out. The movie is loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" and though obviously very different, it does do the original justice...in a ""Bend it Like Beckam"" girls-can-play-soccer kind of way. Set in a modern America campus with soccer as the catalyst, the confusion, humor, and reaction of the characters is quite a show (much like its 200yr old predecessor with a new set of reversed gender-specific stereotypical moments). If you liked either of the movies mentioned above, you will, no doubt, enjoy this flick. Besides, soccer chicks are just cool."

","The acting was one in the long list of many reasons not to see this film. Undoubtabley, every few years, they will and have so far, made a tatty remake of a Shakespeare play and tried to hip it up for the kids etc. I'm fine with that concept, because in the end of the day- kids these days are too stupid to sit down and appreciate Shakespeare (and I'm one of that number) but this film was an insult to even the most illiterate of film goers. It didn't only defecate on the original plot and scripting of twelfth night- Amanda bynes went one step further and danced on Shakespeare's grave, revelling in her own appaulingly egotistical and frankly, unfunny as hell acting abilities. She was dire. She was more dire, as it happens, than the rest of the hideously misguided cast. Vinnie Jones?!?! I'm sorry- why? What possessed a relative English hardman, to do this sort of film- LET ALONE- a poor teen flick like this. Ten things I hate about you was better than this, and that's saying something.

IT was also different kind of comedy movie. It was sort of like the movie Big Mama's House or Mrs. Doutfire except this time it was a girl dressing up as a man instead of a man dressing up like a woman.

","She's the man is based on Shakespearean comedy 'Twelfth Night', the only difference is that the characters are high schoolers! The idea behind it is actually great and the characters' transformation and development is plausible.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes stars as Viola Hastings, a tomboy who is more into soccer than pretty gowns and makeup (much to her mother's dismay), dating Cornwall football captain, Justin (Robert Hoffman). James Kirk plays Viola's brother Sebastian, an aspiring musician, who has recently been kicked out of Cornwall, and has never attended a single day at his new school, Illyria.<br/><br/>The girls soccer team at Cornwall has just been taken out, dampening Viola's soccer ambitions. However, she isn't ready to give up and avails the opportunity when Sebastian ditches his parents to perform with his band up in London, England, to take his space at Illyria.<br/><br/>Thus, with the help of her friends Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), Kia (Amanda Crew) and Yvonne (Jessica Lucas), she not only dresses up as a boy but learns to mimic the male way of walking and talking! Once at Illyria, Viola gets more than she bargained for, with the tough soccer practice Coach Dinklage (Vinnie Jones) is giving them, her itchy wig and the biggest problem of finding the shower room empty to take a bath! However, the upside to being in Illyria for Viola, is her roommate Duke Orsino (played by model-cum-actor Channing Tatum), whom she instantly falls for, only to discover that he is crushing on Olivia Lynnox (Laura Ramsey) Sebastian/Viola's lab partner, who is dating Dorm Director Malcolm Festes (James Snyder).<br/><br/>Due to her childish looks and weak body frame for a guy, Viola-cum-Sebastian doesn't fit right in with the crowd at Illyria, however with a little help from her friends, her social status boosts right up and she even realizes that Olivia Lynnox is actually in love with her being her brother Sebastian! Difficulties arise when Sebastian's snobby girlfriend Monique (Alex Breckendridge) goes on a quest to discover the real reason behind Sebastian's eccentric behavior. But what happens when Sebastian comes back from England a day earlier with a soccer game to play and Malcolm, driven by jealousy for Sebastian tries to find evidence to prove that Sebastian is actually Viola dressed up as a boy? Will Viola be able to play in the game, will she finally prove her point that girls can be as good at the game as boys can? A hilarious storyline and quirky dialogs make this movie good for a laugh. However, the performance by lead actors such as Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum is weak. The direction needs some work and the soundtrack is practically non-existent. Some of the performances are over the top, while some incidents that take place in the movie are quite impractical. However, side roles of Monique and Justin are very well played by their respective actors.<br/><br/>No doubt Amanda Bynes is one of the few ladies of her age who could ever have been able to pull such a role off, but she could have seriously done a better job at it. She lost a lot of cool points due to this one! Whereas, Channing Tatum should have just stuck to modeling and leave acting alone as his stiff motions and poor dialog delivery don't help bring up the overall image of a movie that could have been a lot better if supported by a better cast and direction."
"Canadacatdejected-1","8","1","3","18 December 2006"," A surprisingly mature and touching film that makes a welcome break from the banality of so many teenage movies
","Before this film i had never heard of Amanda Bynes and so didn't think that i would be that interested in her acting abilities or the film. However, after seeing She's the Man i think that she is a genuine talent who has an impressive sense of comedy timing. The film is also much better than i thought it would be. Though the film never quite escapes its teenage urges it does manage to raise itself above most other teenage movies. The section of the film where Bynes becomes Sebastion, her teenage brother,is especially impressive and unlike American pie the film never uses this transformation and the problems it brings as an excuse for just simply gross out comedy. The rest of the cast is fine (even our own Vinny Jones is watchable)and the script is incredibly sharp. However, it is Bynes who inevitably steals the show with her comedy timing and her amazing facial expression's. If she carries on with film's and performances like this then the future is indeed bright."

","I don't know how well she would do a dramatic role, but playing a teenager as she does here and in the older movie 'What A Girl Wants', Amanda Bynes is at the very top of the young actress list. The story was 'inspired by' Shakespeare's 'Twefth Night', but Bynes is what makes a rather inconsequential movie much fun to watch. My wife and I were very entertained.<br/><br/>The basic story, Viola (Bynes) and her tomboy soccer friends find out that their high school is cutting its girls soccer team for lack of student response, and the coach of the boys team doesn't want to give them a chance to try out. Meanwhile Vy's twin brother Sebastian, who writes songs and plays music, gets a chance to sneak over to London for two weeks, with each divorced parent thinking he is with the other.<br/><br/>Vy hatches a plan, with the help of her friends she will get a short wig, some heavier eyelashes, tape her chest, deepen her voice, and go to her twin brother's new school for him, and make it on the soccer team to help beat her own school that will not let her play. The story can work because Vy could look enough like her twin brother, and no one knew him yet. But not all goes smoothly, as Vy only gets second team, and needs to improve drastically to get to play in the first game. She makes a deal with her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum), who is the star of the soccer team. If he will get her good enough to make first team, she will help get him a date with the classiest girl in school.<br/><br/>The fun starts right away as Vy shows up at school, and does her best to 'bond' with her new teammates, while also needing to go undetected as a girl. Lots of funny situations, and Bynes handles them perfectly.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. As Vy is about to get her chance at the big game, her brother shows up a bit early, goes to his dorm room, and the next day is hustled out in uniform and face paint. He has no clue what is going on, and besides is a pretty poor soccer player. Puzzled, the coach pulls him out. Vy tells him what happened, she gets the uniform, a student spy exposes her true identity ( she smiles at them as she pulls up her shirt to prove she is a girl, but the camera is discreet). But the coach lets her play anyway, in the last seconds with the score tied 1 to 1, she gets a deflection and kicks it past her former boyfriend to win the game. Then, she also gets her roommate, Duke, and fixes her twin brother up with the pretty girl, who had actually fallen for Vy when she thought she was Sebastian."

I don't see how you could watch this movie twice let alone three times, even watching it for the first time it was predictable enough. Although i must admit Sebastian coming back from england a day early threw me off a little. If semi-predictable chick flicks are your thing however then you'll probably like this movie. It similar to Shakespears' 12th night. I wouldn't describe it as ""Rolling in the aisles laughing"" either. If you don't like chick flicks, like myself, than this movie(especially the end) will make you cringe and go into withdrawal, forcing you to throw in 'fight club' after the movie finishes.

","When I first rented this out..I wasn't so ecstatic to watch it, I just decided to take a shot at it and see what it was like, but over a short period of time, I quickly changed my mind. There are cute bits of humor in it, along with a good story line inspired by 'Twelfth Night' by William Shakespeare. Of course many people would've preferred Shakespeare's version, but this remake is worth a look.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to see how it turned out, but I was slightly disappointed by the last twenty minutes. It seemed cheesy, and it could've been improved. All in all it's a cute movie with an edge, and it's worth a look...although if you're an adult you might not enjoy it."

"Hick_N_Hixville","8","1","3","21 July 2006"," Channing Tatum and the other men are simply too old for the roles
","Look, this movie is funny, like ""Porky's"" and other movies of its type where men in their mid to late 20s play high school students, but lets face it, runway model Channing Tatum is simply too old and has too much muscle development to be believable as a high school boy. That out of the way, this movie's gender-bending premise is very good at ridiculing American attitudes about soccer. The idea of a girl posing as a teenage boy to play boy's soccer at some elite prep school with buffed up guys in their 20s is a wickedly ironic comment on how Americans view soccer as a sort of upper crust ""semi-gay"" sport. We all know red blooded and clean cut all American boys with any inclination to play the game wise up and move on to real sports like ""football"" by the time they reach the age mom doesn't have to drive them to practice in her minivan anymore. This eccentric and unique American fixation (like universal neonatal circumcision??) is contrasted with the rest of the world where soccer is the definitive and uncut male working class sport. Try going into a pub in Manchester UK and whispering soccer is for gay guys and girls and see if you get out alive. Ha Ha. This is especially ironic when you consider that good old Packers and Steelers bratwurst and beer Chevy pickup tailgate party American football is derived from rugby, a sport born on the playing fields of one of England's most elite prep schools. Cricket anyone? Maybe baseball instead."

Then I skipped class on Friday and i saw it. When I saw it for the first time, I LOVED it so much that I went 4 more times and now that the movies is coming out next week i'm going to buy it. So anybody who reads this, i'm telling y'all: you have to buy this movie or at least rent it. The movie is so good. I think this is Amanda Bynes best movie yet and I think What A Girl Wants is her second best movie. There is a movie called LOVEWRECKED that she stars in but I never saw it and I couldn't find it in any store. And that thing that Robert wrote about James Kirk and Amanda Bynes almost being twins I think he's right because in the movie when she disguise herself into her brother, I couldn't make any difference until that seen where she's in the car.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5","1","3","24 June 2006"," Just tries way too hard
","I wanted to like this film. I really did. Despite loathing soccer, not caring much for 'mixup' comedies and just generally not being terribly nuts about seeing this, I truly tried. The plot is a mess. There are under(and un-)developed subplots all over the place. The mix-ups are too plentiful and overwhelm you to the point of not caring. Furthermore, they're pitifully close to the level of the later years of the show Sabrina, the Teenage Witch... meaning, basically juvenile. Anyone with even a hint of common sense could have seen right through everything that happened, if it were to take place in real life. Every major character is basically a stereotype, and not one of them are even mildly developed. The acting is overplayed, the cinematography uninspired and shoddy and the overall directing is just lackluster. The film doesn't entirely stink, but there is a distinct reek of ""inexperienced director"". Fickman may turn out to be a good (enough) director later on, but he needs practice. Lots of it. The humor is basically that of a sitcom... situational comedy. Take a bunch of characters, put them in an awkward situation and let things go from there. That's all fine and good... the thing is, the jokes never get time to delve in. Any comedian with at least a basic understanding of humor will tell you that you need to pause briefly after a good joke... let people laugh, let the punch-line sink in, let them come over the funny truth you just handed to them before you give them another. Fickman is blissfully unaware of this. The punchlines keep coming, at far too great a speed, and it doesn't take you long to simply tire of this. It tries too hard to make you laugh and comes off thin and weak. Sad, because the film does have some merit. Based on a Shakespeare play, the mix-ups are amusing and the basic idea interesting. The battle of the sexes is seemingly an eternal one... and this method of fighting it is original(well, was, when Master William wrote it). Bynes shows definite potential, and had the script and directing been better, I'm certain she could have carried this well. As it is, the writing is too superficial, the characters too one-note and limited, and the overall movie just... hard to sit through. I laughed some times, and some of it almost succeeding in being moving... but then Fickman tears us away from it with an attempt at humor, making him and his directing seem as shallow and daft as the high school types he seems to make fun of. A fair try, but unsuccessful. I'm not sure I regret watching this... but I'm rather certain I won't be watching it again. 5/10"

","A lot of people think of this movie as some sort of silly fling, but it's really funny and has a good well structured plot. Apart from the ending where the coach tears up the manual and viola gets into absolutely no trouble, there's nothing that is too far-fetched. The storyline gives the watchers the great sense of urgency during all the misunderstanding and of course the great feeling relief is given at the end when everyone worked everything out. The actors were really great besides the geek who played Justin and Amanda Bynes did a particularly good job during the parts where she played pretend Sebastian. There were a lot of really funny moments like when sebastian pulls down his pants and the soccer coach went ""now that we've established that this boy, is a BOY!"" And there are tons more to name. This movie is completely underrated and I'd say this movie is definitely a must see for people who are fond of this genre."

If I were to name the categories of this movie they would be: Movie to See with your Mom (step mom, aunt), Movie to see with your best friend, All out CHICK FLICK,and Movie to see when you are depressed. It is funny, energetic, and very cute. I would not recommend seeing this with your dad or any other guys cause it does apply more to girls. The only reason that I didn't vote it ten out of ten is because 10/10 for me is Oscar Worthy, which this movie is definitely not. Amanda Bynes is her usual charming and funny. It is funny watching her go from Nickelodean to charming chick flicks. Pretty soon she will be in some serious movies, and I will be the first one to get tickets. My advice about She's the Man: See it! It is not a waste of money. I know that the Critics slammed it but that is because it is not the most intellectual movie and does not have any awards shooting at it. This is a must see spring flick."

"kilertron","9","1","3","3 April 2006"," An honestly funny film with the charm that Shakespeare would have been proud of (even though the Football is a bit out - from a British point of view)
","This is a very good film for what (at first glance) seemed to be a ""chic flik"". I took a friend to a pre-release screening in the UK and was impressed by the turnout so early on a Sunday. I was also however pleasantly surprised by the film itself and enjoyed the performances from almost all the cast. Vinnie Jones showed a markedly softer side (yes it really is as soft as he gets) and Amanda Bynes was a cute and subtly sexy leading lady, which made her more believable as a sports enthusiast. Rather than having a drop-dead A-list stunner to pull the punters in with, this film gives us a royal flush of laughs and I will definitely pass on the message to my friends.<br/><br/>On the whole it was a very funny and excellently made film which looked like a Hollywood version of the Brit flik ""Bend It Like Beckham"". It was well produced, and apart from a few flaws in the football side (considered below), it really surpassed my expectations. People were actually laughing out load at the screen (something that rarely happens in a British cinema) and I was actually joining in with them. A great film for all age groups and enough scantily clad bodies for the guys, but mainly for the girls.<br/><br/>My little dampener on this review is that you shouldn't watch this film for the football, as some of the scenes were a bit unrealistic, especially when they had American Football style tackles in one of the practice sessions. Also *spoiler* the fact that Sebastian was benched and then Viola (as Sebastian) managed to come off the bench again seemed to confuse me as this isn't actually possible in a real football game in the UK, although it was glaringly obvious that it was going to happen as it was the only way they could complete the film. *spoiler*"
"starbursts606","6","1","3","3 April 2006"," it was OK
","This is what I call a ""happy"" movie - the setting is bright and colorful and sunny, the music that is played is very ""now"", and everyone is perfectly groomed and dressed (and the guys all happen to be really good looking). Even when there is a fight or a character is unhappy, the movie turns it into a laugh, and it twists the character's problems into an entertaining mess that you watch unravel, reflecting how Shakespeare wrote his comedies. This was a clever remake, although it did not stay very true to Twelfth Night; it used some of the same names, and it used the concept of Viola dressing up as a boy, but that's basically it (in Twelfth Night, Viola dresses up as Cesario, not her brother Sebastian). Nonetheless, the changes that they made in this adaptation were affective in modernizing the story for a 21st century audience. But even though this was an enjoyable movie, it did have some flaws. First of all, who would believe that Viola dressed up as a boy is actually Sebastian? I understand that this was a tough obstacle for them to work around, but it definitely was hard for me to suspend my disbelief when none of the characters in the movie could tell that she was a girl - or even a gay guy. Also, this movie really lacks character development. In the end, the jocks are jocks, the fake girls are still fake. I just felt like this movie was sort of shallow because of that - it just stuck with some basic teen drama, and it didn't delve into any deep issues, and it barely tapped into any of my emotions. If the plot had more meaning, I would be able to take it a little more seriously and it would have been more memorable.<br/><br/>Overall, I did end up enjoying this movie. It definitely is not the movie of the year, and Iprobably will not remember it for long, but it is worth your time if you want to have a good laugh or you just want to have a girls night out."
"jaddison383","6","1","3","31 March 2006"," Another Success
","I have to admit, when my friends first asked me to go see this movie i was a little apprehensive. Amanda Bynes is so gorgeous as a girl the thought of her as a boy was revolting. But then the lights dimmed and the movie began. <br/><br/>And I have to say I was impressed! Once again, the girls that brought you the teen hit ""10 Things I Hate About You"" have pulled of another one! The story was catchy, the laughs were real, and the performances were surprisingly good considering that it's a bunch of teens. The whole audience would roar with laughter over and over again, just proving to me as ""10"" did that Shakespeare knew his stuff.<br/><br/>The success of this show is due largely in part to the excellence of Amanda Bynes. Besides having excellent comedic timing, she also proves herself to have an amazing talent for physical comedy, particularly in a certain girls bathroom fight scene.And who can resist that smile? <br/><br/>So, I have to say congrats to those girls again. They have scored another teen hit with this movie and turned a classic play into a totally hip modern movie. One has to think that if Shakespeare saw these films about his plays, he would be proud."

","The movie began with Amanda Bynes playing soccer with friends on the beach, a little too implausible but it got across the point of the fact that she can play better than her boyfriend(the captain of the school's team . When she and her teammates on the girls soccer team discover their team has been cut, they ask the coach to let them try out for the guy's team,and they are told a statement similar to that of Harvard's previous headmaster, men are better than women in athletics. Viola(Amanda Bynes) goes home upset where she decides to switch places with her twin brother while he's away in England getting his band started. So she goes to his school and is awkward even once she looks like a guy so she makes her roommate and his friends think she/he is a dork. So she along with the girls on her soccer team convince them that she/he is a playboy and wins their respect. So the story goes on and Viola has to go to a carnival as herself because of a promise earlier in the movie to her mother. Sebastian(her brother) also promised to be there but since he's in a distant land, Amanda Bynes is forced to run around changing between her normal self and her ""brother"". Her mother she discovers has signed her up for the kissing booth where her roommate is at. They kiss and her former boyfriend(the one mentioned earlier)gets into a fight with her roommate(whose in ""like"" with another girl). Afterwards she finds out he still likes the girl, Olivia, who pretends to like her roommate to make ""Sebastian"" jealous. So at the game Sebastian, the real one, shows up and is forced into the soccer game Viola was going to play in. So he is accused of pretending to be a guy and flashes(you see nothing) the crowds in response. Then viola and him switch and she tells her roommate and flashes him and the crowds to make him believe her.

"chikphliklvr","9","1","3","20 March 2006"," In my book - one of the top ten favorites.
","I loved She's the Man! I haven't seen another teen movie I've enjoyed more since 10 Things, which was created by the same people. I love the in-depth wit and plot of both films. I'm not big on Shakespeare, but I do enjoy a good twist when I see one, and She's the Man is one of the best I've seen yet. It may give hope to substance in teen movies yet. Amanda Bynes is a true comedian, a Lucy Ball of her time. I've loved seeing her talent since she was on ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Bynes Show"". This is the first time I've seen Channing Tatum, and being a girl I have to say he's hot!!! I may have to start following his film career. He does an excellent job in being the stereo typical jock, and then even better letting his guard down and becoming all sensitive and stuff. I have to say I loved the fight scenes between Tatum and Hoffman(Who is also a hottie!!!). SIGHHH I wish I could have boys fight over me like that. It may be a completely unrealistic wish, but after all, isn't that what movies are about? Taking a trip into someone else's world, Fact or Fiction? This movie is a trip worth taking. I would definitely buy this movie on DVD."

I would say go to this movie if you want to see something that does not require you to think too much...it's one of those movies that you go to if you don't want a serious movie. I don't know if this movie is the best for young kids...there are some dirty lines thrown in once and a while.

I could not count how many times I saw a microphone hanging right above the actors heads. And if that was'nt bad enough they cut off half of the peoples chins when they showed a facial shot of them. I can only hope and pray that when this movie hits DVD that someone will have fixed these minor problems that were a real headache to watch. Overall the acting was OK, but a little overexagerated, and the theme was also a little lame, but otherwise an OK movie, not one of the greatest of the year by any means but better than nothing."

It is hilarious. If you're a girl, you'll think Justin (Robert Hoffman) and Duke (Channing Tatum) and super hot. And if you're a boy, you'll be crushing on Viola (Amanda Bynes) and Olivia (Laura Ramsey), and probably Monique (Alex Breckinridge).<br/><br/>The movie is slightly based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but then again... all the best teen movies are based on Shakespeare -- ""10 Things I Hate About You"" was. Basically, when Viola's school's girls' soccer team gets cut, she dresses as her brother and goes to the rival school. From there, the tagline for the movie will get you up to speed. Although, nothing will make sense till you actually see the movie. You won't regret it!"
"roismand","4","1","4","17 March 2006"," Just one of the guys remake moves closer to Twelvth Night (SPOILER material in fourth paragraph)
","It's important to realize how much like Just One of the Guys this movie is. A girl is miffed that sexism is keeping her from her goal and switches schools to get a fresh start at her original goal, in the process falling in love with her new male friend and spending much time avoiding the girl who wants her.<br/><br/>The writers seem to be trying to hide the similarity to the 1985 movie by bringing the story a little closer the Shakespeare's Twelvth Night. Indeed, it is more like the play. Eg, her brother is absent most of the time, while the heroine takes tips from her brother in Guys. There is even a little reference to Shakespeare in Love during the costuming montage.<br/><br/>The verdict: Guys is better. It is better acted, better directed, has richer characters and Joyce Hyser makes a better guy than does Amanda Byrnes. Also, the '85 movie has a setting advantage. Cross-dressing inconspicuously was easier with post-glam-rock, new wave, androgynous fashions than it is today with fairly revealing 60's and early 70's throwbacks.<br/><br/>The politics of this movie are a little better. In the original, the sexism addressed is in a professional/intellectual setting (newpaper reporting), this movie addresses sexism in sports, which is a more controversial topic. Additionally, in the end of the original, the moral of the story is that the sexism was all in the lead's head. Fortunately, no such problems here. Unfortunately, Bynes' character manages to play up a lot of other gender stereotypes which the writers could have done well to alter in a movie that deals with a politically charged topic. Also, while there are many fantastic female athletes out there, especially in soccer, who could easily outplay a lot of varsity-level high school boys, Bynes isn't one of them. It makes a lot of the soccer scenes disappointing, as the male players perform exceptional physical feats of ball-control and the one female player looks like she's about to trip over the ball. Not what I would call a great way of pushing people's stereotypes about women athletes.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to say, anyone comparing this movie to Mean Girls is a plant. It doesn't come close. Where Mean Girls took a lesson from Heathers with fantastic archetypal characters who were viciously witty, this movie has no such strengths. The best that can be said for it is that gender roles are always topical, as much in the Elizabethan England as today. But for that, just rent Just One of the Guys."
"leo_the_lion_raaaaaa","1","1","5","9 March 2009"," Worst film ever
","I don't normally comment on things like this but had to break my usual stance on this film. It was the Sunday night film on Channel 4 last night and I so regret wasting 2 hours of my life, of course after realising how rubbish it would be after the first 10 mins, the girlfriend was committed and there was no turning back. My eyes and ears bled for the remainder 1 hour 50 minutes of this torture.<br/><br/>The lead girl character was the most irritating actor since that haley joel kid who sees dead people. Her mannerisim and delivery of lines were wooden at best. Maybe she should do a stint of Shakespeare? The other major gripe is the ending, the wining goal comes from a penalty that keeps saves, rebounds to girl's teammate who heads back in, where the girl scissor kicks it in, more absurd than Sean Bean's penalty in When Saturday Comes."

"morphricky","2","0","1","7 December 2015"," Mega meh
","For a movie about a girl pretending to be a guy, there's obviously a big problem when that person looks and sounds nothing like a guy. It was hard to believe that people wouldn't figure it out sooner. Regularly through the movie she does awkward things that would blow her cover, but the guys always turn it into a joke so that they never figure it out. Because stopping nosebleeds with womens tampons is such a ""dude"" thing, right?<br/><br/>The movie is one clichÃ© after another. You already know how the movie will end by the time the characters reveal what they want. Viola wants to win the game? You know she will. Viola wants the hot guy? You know they'll make up in the end despite that she lied to him. Olivia wants Violas Sebastian disguise as a boyfriend? The real Sebastian conveniently falls in love with her.<br/><br/>The movie isn't particularly funny either. I rarely watch comedies, so I was hoping for something to amuse me. The only thing that really had me chuckle was when the bald guy was talking to Violas disguise about hair-loss."

","First of all, do we really need all the names from the Bard's Twelveth Night? When I see a western based on King Arthur's knights, the cowboys aren't named after Knights of the Round Poker Table. Who ever saw a soccer player named Benvolio? The film starts out well but begins to grow stale as Bynes continues to switch places with herself that her roommate on the soccer team is in love with. There is a lot of bullying and fighting where the reasons for it aren't quite clear. One scene has Bynes change back to a boy in a spinning carnival ride, certainly too fast and impossible to do under the seat holding bar. The warm up menu makes a grab line about who likes who, but if you're watching to study for a class about Shakespeare's plays, I recommend you cheat with some cliff notes instead. Film is infantile and immature to the extreme. The story book ending was so sugar- coated watching it could've given me diabetes."

","The funniest part about this movie, is that... I think they people making the movie thought they were being progressive by making a movie about a ""girl who isn't that girl-y""...? The sexism, heteronormativity, and gender binaries displayed in this movie made me cringe all the way though. Shakespeare's version was written 400 years ago, and is far less sexist and offensive. The dialog and interactions are completely unrealistic, and yet the plot is entirely predictable. Watched when it came out when I was in high school, and I remembered being amused at the idea of using tampons for nose bleeds. Somehow, I blocked out the rest of the movie and decided to watch again. Oops."

","This film might be marked as a teen movie or something else, but it's not only a teen movie! it can be enjoyed as a family movie, a soccer movie (I'm a soccer player and enjoyed this very much) or even a normal teen movie. <br/><br/>It has all the right ingredients for different audiences to enjoy. Also the casting is done great and even though the story is very unlikely to happen in real life, you would believe that the characters might even be real. Also about the music choice I should say that it has also all the right music for different scenes, except perhaps one or two.<br/><br/>If you like sports and you're looking for a fun movie you can enjoy with friends and family, watch this!"

All the characters were likable, the cast was perfect (great chemistry), the film was actually funny, it wasn't pathetically crude like most other teen comedies and I now love Amanda Bynes. When watching this film you love Amanda playing both Violet and Sebastien, she is just a great actress! I highly recommend this film, people of all ages can watch it and I just wish I'd seen it on cinema. I am an 18 year old guy and I loved this film, it just go's to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Watch it!"
"mynameisdanch","9","0","1","3 January 2009"," one of the best teen movies of the 00s
","Not a lot of teen movies are good these days. Some are too predictable, some are way over-the-top, and others are just plain stupid. ""She's the Man"" may not be an Oscar worthy-good, but it's so funny and entertaining that even ""teen movie""-snobs may find it engaging.<br/><br/>While the concept of modernizing a Shakespearean comedy is not everyone's cup of tea, the humor catches the audience very well. (The pizza scene in which Viola says to Monique ""...and when I close my eyes, I see you for who you truly are, which is UGLY."" is one of the best scenes in a teen movie.) Even the casting is good, and it is amazing how Amanda Bynes and James Kirk play eccentric brother and sister. They look very much alike, and they should be since it's very difficult to find actors who have almost the same facial structure and one of them has to disguise as the other.<br/><br/>But when the movie is increasingly good, then comes a bad conclusion. It may be a happy ending, but it is just uneasy to watch. Vinnie Jones and his annoying ""British tough guy"" persona is out of place, while the script suddenly becomes too lame and cheesy.<br/><br/>So far, this is Amanda Bynes' best performance and her fans have realized how awfully cute she could be as a boy. Anyone can enjoy this film, even to those who doesn't like ""Mean Girls."""

","This film is so great! I have loved Amanda since her All That days and I was so glad to see her take on a transforming role that shows off not only her acting skills but her amazing comic abilities. As a Shakespeare fan, I was very impressed on how all the elements of the play were still present in this film as well as appealing to a younger audience with some extremely talented cast. Channing Tatum breaks out in this film and this film brings Amanda Bynes up to movie star rank in my book. A really great film! <br/><br/>I give this film 10 stars for clever writing, and pretty much non stop laughs, and great directing."

","**Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>Viola Johnson (Amanda Bynes) had her own good reasons for disguising herself as her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) and enrolling in his place at his new boarding school, Illyria Prep. She was counting on Sebastian being AWOL from school as he tried to break into the music scene in London. What she didn't count on was falling in love with her hot roommate, Duke (Channing Tatum), who in turn only has eyes for the beautiful Olivia (Laura Ramsey). Making matters worse, Olivia is starting to fall for Sebastian, who--for reasons Olivia couldn't'tÂ¿t begin to guess--appears to be the sensitive type of guy she'd always dreamt of meeting. If things weren't complicated enough, the real Sebastian has come back from London two days earlier than expected and arrives on campus having no clue that he's been replaced...by his own twin sister. <br/><br/>What a film.It contained some of the best lines and quotes ever.I like the chemistry that Channing Tatum and Amanda Bynes had.They are both very talented actors.Well Viola as a boy was absolutely hilarious.Its just so funny watching her trying to act like a guy.

","I don't know if there is any Shakespeare buffs out there. But I love Shakespeare. Well the basic plot of this movie is based off of Shakespeares Twelfth Night.

A series of complications begins when Olivia falls in love with the page 'boy'.<br/><br/>They use the same names and fact that they are twins and separated and Viola becomes her brother and the whole love mess.

","I love this movie! This movie is hilarious! Amanda Bynes,Robert Hoffman, and Channing Tatum *sizzle sizzle* did a great job on this movie. I knew it would be funny but it was hilarious! I give this movie a big TEN and two thumbs up! This movie was sweet and very amusing. The fight scenes add more action and are very believable and I liked that about this movie. The funniest scene to me was the spider/hugging/screaming/""I'll act like a girl"" scene. I think they should have used the alternate ending because it's funnier and doesn't really leave the viewers hanging. Give us a little less things to question. I loved the jokes and all of those. They all cracked me up! Amanda did a great job as a boy and the performance was very convincing. It's cool that they were able to find an actor that looked surprisingly like Amanda. I seriously thought they were related!<br/><br/>The only thing I thought was not nessecary was when Viola took off the wig, etc. and Duke did not think she was a girl and she had to flash. Then he goes and says a Shakespearian speech, this coming from the guy who said,""Just because you wear a wig doesn't mean you're a girl(even though you look like one.)"""
"silentlyscream","7","0","1","11 April 2006"," Solid, yet lacking that ""Mean Girls"" pizazz
","an enjoyable film. the demographic this movie is aimed at is quite clear from the beginning: preteen and teenage girls will enjoy the humour and shirtlessness of several male characters. still, though ""she's the man"" delivered solid laughs and engaging characters throughout (across a varied audience in my viewing at least), i was left with a lingering sense that we could have had it so much better - particularly (call me crazy) if someone like tina fey, screenwriter of the wonderful ""mean girls"", had been at the helm. other comments have cited the basic unbelievability of the premise - but that misses the point: the movie aims to provide solid entertainment, not an intellectual workout or a serious interpretation of Shakespeare (that much is clear from the opening credits), and the script is not as quotable or original as ""mean girls"" (my benchmark for teen movies). in most of the reviews i've read, much is made of amanda bynes' and David cross' contributions - personally, i felt that bynes should not have had to resort to face-pulling to substitute for some uninspired moments in the script, and that cross' Principal seemed a carbon-copy of his tobias in ""arrested development"", except tobias is funnier. i found channing tatum, in the role of duke orsino, endearing and convincing as the handsome lad who just can't master speech (obviously not that much of a stretch - he is a former male model). in conclusion: satisfying, easy-on-the-eyes comedy - fluffy fun, perfect date movie or let's-just-get-a-video fare."
