","Live Free or Die Hard (2007) is the last good Action film of 2007 in the Die Hard franchise. An old-fashioned cop emerges to foil a high-tech attack on the country's computer infrastructure as Bruce Willis brings back one of the biggest action franchises in screen history. It is one of my personal favorite action movies, it is a sequel I love to death.<br/><br/>It's been over a decade since audiences last saw New York cop John McClane (Willis), but now, as the world's greatest criminal mastermind (Timothy Olyphant) attempts to cripple the entire country with an innovative act of technological terrorism, only one cop can insure that the integrity of the system stays intact. In this, the fourth installment of the long-running action series, Underworld director Len Wiseman picks up the torch formerly carried by directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin to helm a script penned by Mark Bomback. <br/><br/>Best Action Film Of 2007. Even with ratings PG-13 this film works for me. Those four movies of the franchise are the ones I love. When a criminal plot is in place to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States (and the world), it's up to a decidedly ""old school"" hero, police detective John McClane, to take down the conspiracy, aided by a young hacker.Well, I can't believe I'm saying this but the newest edition to the Die Hard series may rank with the first. It's superb direction, fantastic acting, groundbreaking special effects and clever scenes, will leave you with (almost) nothing to complain about. Die Hard may very well be the best action flick of 2007. It can be beat, but I doubt by a sequel. I am proud to say that Bruce Willis still has some John McClane left in him. Bruce gets to say one of most famous lines in action film history, ""Yippy Ki-ya Motha ******!"", without cuts, he even gets to talk to himself, a scene that is almost identical to the scene in the air vent of the first film. (C'mon, it'll be fun, come out to the coast, have a few laughs.) About all the controversy for the MPAA rating...it was all useless. Die Hard acts just like a rated R film, just because it says PG-13 doesn't mean its not as violent as the others. No, he doesn't say the F word, but it's not as bad as you think. It's more of a character to character type of thing then anything else. John McClane learns to bond with a young hacker. (Justin Long) It's more...I don't know...""cute"" then the other movies, it doesn't need the F word. I don't think there is much else to say. Die Hard is one of my best movie experiences to date. The crowd laughed and screamed and then cheered at the end. The only slightest problem I had with this film was the fact that the realism was quite low. Then again, as I have said before, if everything were realistic we wouldn't have action movies. <br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard is a must-see FOR DIE HARD FANS.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard (also known as Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard or simply Die Hard 4 and released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America) is a 2007 American action film, and the fourth installment in the Die Hard film series. The film was directed by Len Wiseman and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film's name was adapted from New Hampshire's state motto, ""Live Free or Die"".<br/><br/>I loved the fact it's still Die Hard especially in the Unrated cut. the PG-13 didn't bother me he still told jokes, put a smile on my face gave his tagline & killed the bad guy. But my favorite scene is the Car Chase with the Chooper if I had to pick one. An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety. That said, it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn't have to deal with it. Bruce Willis should not be the victim of facile stereotyping. He brings more heart and humor to apocalyptic pulp fiction than any other actor I can think of offhand. <br/><br/>That film is great and the last good Die Hard film, A Good Day To Die Hard sucks horrible. Live Free or Die Hard is my favorite fourth film in the Die Hard franchise and this film, filmed in 2007 was great. 9/10 Score: A+"

","The first Die Hard was probably the best modern action film ever made. The second Die Hard works because the movie has a major sense of humor about how ridiculous it is to put John McClane through such a similar situation again; it practically makes fun of itself for a lot of the movie. The third one works because you have a bad guy that is out for revenge against John McClane. The fourth one though, it just felt like McClane's character was dropped in as an after thought. I don't think you can just drop John McClane into any story and call it Die Hard and this movie felt more like a Tom Clancy political thriller than a Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>While watching this I at least thought I would let it pass as a generic action movie, because I was having fun. However, then I started thinking about it and I'm sorry I need even my action movies to at least make a little bit of sense. There was just too much stuff in this one that didn't work for me. The first problem I had was that the bad guys created a giant traffic jam in DC causing congestion everywhere except of course for the streets they need for the major car chase scene. Also during the part of that car chase that took place in the tunnel, how come when the bad guy started turning the lights off in the tunnel not a single person though to turn their head lights on? However the biggest action scene that bugged me was the scene where John McClane is driving the big rig truck and being chased by the fighter plane. This scene was so laughably over the top that it had no place in a Die Hard movie. I know Die Hard movies are known for their over the top action at some points but I just could not stop laughing at how completely ridiculous this scene was. Oh and seriously, since when does the 695 beltway around Baltimore have palm trees? OK, that is a bit too nitpicky, but it was kind of funny.<br/><br/>The film seemed to me to also be extremely inconsistent about whether or not cell phones were working. The cell phones weren't working, so he reprogrammed the phone to use the old ""satcomm"" satellites instead. Then that stopped working and then a little bit later that is working again. Also I'm still amazed at how Kevin Smith's character is still able to hack into so much stuff even after all the power on the entire eastern seaboard has been shut off. I mean seriously there are a lot of servers out there that have battery backups and stuff, but a lot of the servers he would need to go through to have a good enough connection to do any of the hacking he was doing would have been shut down after the power outage. OK, maybe I am picking at too much of the film, but all this bugged me while watching the film and I wasn't able to just sit back and get sucked in like I would in any other Die Hard film.<br/><br/>The acting in the film for the most part was pretty good, except of course for the main bad guy. He had one facial expression for the entire movie and the tone of his voice never changed. His only way of showing anger was to throw something off his desk. His performance was so wooden; it just paled in comparison to Alan Rickman, William Sadler and Jeremy Irons, who all three just played wonderful bad guys.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the movie didn't feel at all like a Die Hard movie to me either. Sure, John McClane takes a good beating like he does in all the films but all the action seemed to crisp and clean. It didn't feel nearly as gritty as the previous Die Hard films. Also one of the things I noticed was the film seemed to have this predominantly blue color scheme going on. It just felt like there was this blue hue through out the film, where in the previous Die Hard films the predominant colors are very earthy and red. I don't know if anyone else even knows what I am talking about, but that is just something that I noticed that took away from the gritty Die Hard feeling."

","...but literally a quadruple serving of awesome ""Die Hard"" action.<br/><br/>My girlfriend and I saw ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" at a premiere screening last night at Radio City Music Hall. The place holds about 5,000 seats and it was packed. <br/><br/>With an 8:30 start, we got to our seats by 7:30. The movie didn't begin until 9:30!!! Guess who was late?<br/><br/>Julie and I are not particularly big 'Die Hard' fans. And having to catch a train home from Grand Central station at a certain time, we both agreed that if the movie was sub-par, we would split early to get home earlier.<br/><br/>So finally the lights go down around 9:20 and out comes Bruce Willis. He respectfully apologized and then started jazzing up the audience for the film. The excitement was palpable as the crowded theater whooped it up with Bruce shouting ""Are you ready!!!"" <br/><br/>Well, Julie and I were, as we got swept up in the excitement and cheered aloud as if we were at the ball game. Even the couple next to us, I'd say they were about in their late sixties, dressed very 'proper', were just as energized. <br/><br/>The movie starts and a mere few minutes in, the action explodes. By twenty minutes into the film, Julie and I were sold. Who cares what time we're gonna get home!? <br/><br/>I have not had this much fun at the movies since I can't remember when. I have always loved summer movies, but only the ones that deliver the goods. The action sequences are top shelf, 21st century movie making brilliance. These explosive scenes are a seamless composite of fantastic, real world stunt work, and exceptional CGI. Hands down, they make the film. And for an action movie with 'die hard' in the title, I'd say that was the point.<br/><br/>It was awesome watching this film with so many people because it was like riding a gigantic roller coaster, with everybody having a shared, hair raising experience. People were cheering like when Luke blew up the Death Star. The humor throughout was just right. By the end of the film, our senses were stunned as we dizzily made our way out of the theater, thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>Excellent summer movie! Well done Bruno and crew!"

","Just went to the world premiere of Die Hard 4.0, and I was positively surprised. It delivers action in abundance, and the movie has a great visceral feel to it thanks to great stunt work, and the fact that Willis really steps up in the fight scenes. The movie keeps up its pace throughout, and the script works quite well, though the tech-talk gets a little heavy at times. I was particularly worried about Wiseman directing, since both underworld movies were a complete mess in my opinion, but he really keeps it tight and disciplined this time around. Is Die Hard 4.0 the second or third best of the series? I don't know, but it is certainly a worthy successor, and all the other blockbusters should look this way to see how its done efficiently, crisp and above all entertaining."
"pastaproductions","3","134","211","13 July 2007"," What is wrong with everybody???
","8.1? Most of the time I easily accept that many people love movies that I myself totally hate and vice versa. its OK, opinions just vary. But in this case I simply don't get it. How can somebody who is a fan of the first Die Hard possibly give this one such a high rating??- given that not all voters are confused misguided 15 year old who might have dubious judging criteria at times...<br/><br/>A few reasons for being so utterly disappointed<br/><br/>1. Okay, this is just me: I would have liked to see a little more of Mclane's contemporary everyday life ( AA meeting perhaps...) just to get to see the character and how he's changed a while longer before the action kicks in (kind of like in the original)- maybe I'm living in the wrong decade with such wishes... <br/><br/>2. Again I understand if some disagree: The Idea of Willis picking up a kid to take him somewhere and ending up protecting him from killers was already used, and done well, in ""16 Blocks"" and Shouldn't have been used again...<br/><br/>3. The CGI. Most people laud this film, including Willis, for being so real- real images, real stunts (yes, my compliments on the stunt work that WAS real)... however i actually gave up counting the effect shots after a while- no matter how well they're done one can simply tell the difference between real movie and computer game scene. And I'm so sick of watching artificial computer action especially in movies where it is so damn unnecessary.<br/><br/>4. The action. Somewhere along the line in the tunnel this movie stopped being a Die Hard Movie and became a cross between The Matrix, The Transporter 2 and M:Impossible: Mclane and the kid ducking from a falling car that bounces off just inches from their heads. Mclane jumping out of a speeding car- since he's so optimistic about the vehicle taking off and crashing into a helicopter, MClane in a fistfight in a car dangling in an elevator shaft,Mclane taking down a Jet etc... thanks a lot John Hunt! <br/><br/>5. Stupid patriotism ""It's not a system it's a country!""... Uh huh...<br/><br/>You know I could go on and on but I think the biggest problem of this movie is that the creators have simply ignored who John Mclane was in the original: A grumpy Anti-hero who gets into dangerous situations (yes Len Wiseman got that right) but who gets himself out of them in a way that is human and doable- HE WAS NEVER A SUPERHERO. <br/><br/>I don't know what most of you see in this that you find so outstanding, I really just think of it as another pebble added to this landslide of senseless sequels that overshadow this summer."

","I went to see this movie with very high hopes. I loved the first three in the series - they are among my favorite action movies of all time. When I first heard they were making a fourth Die Hard movie I thought - Awesome, what a great way to introduce Die Hard to a whole new generation of fans.<br/><br/>What I saw was a laughable mockery of a Die Hard movie. Let me start by saying the first problem was the rating. Turning a series of R rated gory action flicks into A PG-13 imitation does not work. It was as if Fox was trying to pass it off as some type of family friendly movie. This resulted in the film being minimal in bloody action violence, minimal in language use, and the use of McClane's staple line - ""Yippee Ki Yay Mo ******"" was made to be slightly distorted so the last word (all Die Hard fans know what it is) was more implied than spoken. The rating also had another effect. Since the aspects listed above were downplayed so much, the movie's style didn't come anywhere close to matching the style of the first three. It didn't Feel like Die Hard.<br/><br/>(This is off topic, but it reminds me of another time the same company took two GREAT! R rated series - Alien - and Predator - and combined them to make the PG-13 mockery we now know as AVP)<br/><br/>I didn't like the villain. The whole movie it didn't seem like he himself really did anything. He didn't really torture or shoot or even severely harm McClane's daughter. He was never really a threat. It was always a henchmen up until the end of the movie. (Unless you count the Tunnel-Helicopter sequence) Which bugs me, where did all the henchmen come from? In the first and third movies they were German militants, and the second movie they were military extremists supportive of General Esperanza. It this movie - they were just kind of there. I mean, Gabriel was suppose to be a DoD government employee - and he just pulled a crap load of henchmen out of no where. Were they terrorists? Wow, nice background check on a government employee with links to terrorist organizations if they were.<br/><br/>The use of technology was just awful. Specifically what you saw on the computer screens was unrealistic and felt like some sort of hi tech fairy tale to me (being a networking professional). I mean, I had no idea hacking was so graphical and straightforward.<br/><br/>To close - if the characters weren't making some cheesy quip or not dying after smashing through multiple plains of glass and being hit with SUV at one point - they most defiantly were contributing to what should go down in history as a sorry day indeed for the Die Hard series.<br/><br/>My advice - pull a matrix and pretend the sequel doesn't exist."
"andrewrogergregory","1","73","112","12 August 2007"," Try Hard 3.9
","This film has been getting poor reviews since being released in New Zealand. The 7.9 average rating on IMDb made me think that reviewers were having an off day. <br/><br/>Having seen it, the critics were right. Suggested new title - TRY HARD 3.9<br/><br/>If you thought the original premise was straight from a Tom Clancy novel then you are close to the truth. No doubt Mr Clancy has also read the original Farewell to Arms article by John Carlin.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes were vintage wise-cracking, shoot first-ask questions later Willis. <br/><br/>The remainder of the film had a plot shot full of holes. Were communications down or up ? Was the power on or off ? Was traffic grid-locked or the streets wide open ? Did the FBI have it's own helicopters or had the bad guys stolen them too (sarcasm).If Warlock was so good, why wasn't he one of the original targeted hackers? And then the dumb set action pieces began. Perhaps the lift scene was a wink and nod to the first movie, but the original John McClane would have broken the Asian ninjas neck and moved on.<br/><br/>Speaking of holes. I have seldom seen an action movie where the bullet holes appear, disappear, re-appear and vanish so often between scenes. The director must have found the magic bullet that shot Kennedy.<br/><br/>The truck vs fighter scene was like watching the bad parts of True Lies and the Matrix spliced together. And are we really meant to believe that a cyber terrorist would leave the government GPS tracking unit attached to his getaway van ! My only surprise was that they didn't remove it with a barrel roll ala Transporter 2.<br/><br/>I walked out of Spider Man 3 after 60 minutes. I wish I had walked out of Try Hard 3.9 after 30."
"WriterDave","7","134","215","6 July 2007"," Good Old-Fashioned Shattered Glass Action Flick
","""Live Free or Die Hard"" is quite a refreshing piece of entertainment this summer in the wake of so many effects-driven computer simulated action/fantasy films. With its silly title, smart-alleck lead character (Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis doing John McClane), and loads of old fashioned stunts involving cars, SUV's, elevator shafts, big rigs, helicopters, fighter jets, and collapsing highway bridges, this flick is a great piece of shattered-glass entertainment--a throwback to the late 1980's and early 1990's when movies like the original ""Die Hard"" changed the face of movie action.<br/><br/>There is some frustration to be had when you start to realize how much they toned down to achieve the friendly PG-13 rating. There's far less profanity flying, and while the body count is astronomically high (the collateral damage in this film in terms of human life and damaged property is tres magnifique), there's little blood and guts to be found. Still, die hard ""Die Hard"" action fans should rest assured knowing there will be plenty of funny one-liners, hot chicks (a wonderful Maggie Q as the bad-ass female villain and the scorchingly feisty and cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy McClane), super smart bad guys (a very good Timothy Olyphant), and jaw-dropping death-defying stunts. <br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman orchestrates the complicated stunts very well like a masterful puppeteer, which is a shock considering how god-awful his ""Underworld"" films were. The hand-to-hand human match-ups still bear some of his annoying hallmarks, but he's learned how to blow things up really well and has learned a thing or two about scope and editing in big action set-pieces. The excellent pacing and preposterousness of the stunts (especially the climax involving the fighter jet and the big rig) certainly put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>There's a whole lot of computer hacking related mumbo-jumbo involved in the story, and there's a lot of downtime for male bonding and ""explanation"" of the finer plot points that slows the film down some but is actually nice to see in a world now ruled by Michael Bay-style non-stop action. Plenty dumb, plenty thrilling, and plenty of fun, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is a pleasant surprise considering how unnecessary this sequel seemed from conception."

"ShiggyLucasWenger","9","191","317","4 July 2007"," A film that delivers!
","12 years on; McClane is bald, estranged from his family and feels increasingly like an anachronism. There is a strong 'post-9/11' vibe, a muted color scheme and a strangely sombre tone that permeates proceedings. The film covers more terrain (literally) than it's predecessors and the action is slightly episodic as a result of shoehorning a series of mini-showdowns into a plot about cyber-terrorists and an attempt to shut down the US infrastructure. It's handled more deftly and inventively than you might expect, but it's not an obvious marriage.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the 'hacking' that takes place is also suspect (webcam becomes spy-cam in the basement of a security obsessed computer nerd?) and there is a horribly misjudged piece of casting in Kevin Smith as a stereotypical basement-dwelling, uber-hacker.(he simply doesn't have the acting chops) Having said all of that, the action sequences are top-notch; brutal and old-school. (with a couple of nods to the 'new', in the form of the stoic but sizzling Maqqie Q and 'le parkour' madman Cyril Rafaelli, whose incredible dexterity is captured to dazzling effect by Wiseman and crew) The performances are mainly strong, especially Bruce who immediately reminds you that you're watching McClane despite the (slightly) sanitized language and vanishing hair. Justin Long is surprisingly engaging as McClane's assignment/sidekick in a role which could so easily have been irritating, and Olyphant, as the main bad guy, gives an intense and charismatic performance full of understated humor and implied menace. He makes for an interesting antagonist, reminiscent of Rickman's 'Hans Gruber' in the original; a little less verbose, but a similarly charming sociopath with a formidable, sub-zero stare. Even the inclusion of Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, (another move which, on paper, seemed destined to annoy) works well. She has inherited some of her fathers personality traits to frequently amusing effect, but the film-makers (wisely) avoid the temptation to give her any 'Lara Croft' type abilities in order to appease a wider demographic, a move that would have potentially alienated the core audience - even more than the furore over the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Speaking of the rating, while the film is light on blood and one particular swear-word, the violence hasn't been toned down at all. If anything, McClane is actually more hardened and brutal than before. Enemies are often dispatched with an efficiency and a ruthlessness commensurate with a man who's done this before. There is also a calm resignation in Willis' body language at times. McClane is a man who has found no solace in being a hero; post-divorce and struggling to maintain a relationship with his daughter, (His son is barely mentioned) he feels he has lost the things that matter most to him. This is the single most notable change in the film. Gone is the wild-eyed, heavy-breathing, frantically pacing McClane of the original Die Hard; The man rapping on the windows, desperately trying to signal the fire brigade. Willis communicates this malaise subtly and effectively, prompting the Justin Long character to ask at one point; 'Why are you so calm? Have you done that kinda stuff before?' The direction is astonishingly controlled and confident from the man that bought the world 'Underworld' (He may be one to watch after all.) and, for my money, offers the best spectacle of any film this summer.<br/><br/>There is a weight and an impact to the stunts and the fight scenes that comes from using actual stunt-work; so often eschewed these days in favor of scenes built entirely on disk.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the tone is slightly subdued for a summer actioner (despite a good number of amusing lines and a healthy amount of self-awareness) which differentiates it from the others in the series. There is a world-weariness amongst the chaos. A meditation on being 'that guy' is one of the more inspired exchanges, and the greatest insight into McClane's journey through the missing years. As a result, the audience is not left to enjoy the sense of good triumphing over evil at the end without at least a little remorse about the meaning of it all (It reminded me of one of the great strengths of '24' in that regard.). As the credits roll, all may not be right with the world as would be more typical of the genre, but there are other, more personal triumphs to savor. This gives the film a little more depth than the previous sequels, though it takes some of the edge off the 'octane buzz' that the film injects you with.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this remains significantly the best blockbuster of the Summer Season. It is the first to truly deliver on all it promised (and probably surpasses realistic expectations) It would require a second viewing to determine where it might rank in the series, but it is more than worthy of the name and Die Hard remains, for my money, the undisputed champ amongst action franchises. I humbly request one more installment in which Bruce et al pour heart and soul into creating a worthy send-off and then suggest that Bruce let's McClane retire undefeated. He'll have earned it."
"p_jones92","1","94","150","24 September 2007"," A black spot on the Die Hard name
","I'm amazed at the voting going on for this film - are you all as controlled as the computer systems were in the movie!<br/><br/>Die Hard's 1-3 made a good trilogy, but they have been tainted forever by this poor excuse of a fourth film in the franchise. I should of known from the clichéd opening scene with John Mclane and his daughter (which is just an appalling, badly written scene, like they'd stand there and talk about their problems in front of the is he/isn't he boyfriend) that this movie's intellectual barometer was set on dumb.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie seems to be a cliché of a cliché. Bruce seems to have forgotten what the John McClane character is like, because he doesn't come across the same as he does in the previous 3 films, and is not helped by the poor dialog and cheesy one-liners that are poorly timed. All of the other characters are clichés too - Timothy's ice cold bad guy, Maggie Q's brainy, beautiful, femme fatale, the FBI head who for some unknown reason can't understand what's going on or get anything done, but John McClane can work everything out no problem, even without the resources of the whole FBI to help, all he needs is a phone and a gun! - I mean come on people, this is as lazy a plot as you could get.<br/><br/>Some of the set pieces are OK, but then when the filmmakers go into overdrive and have McClane climb onto a moving jet fighter, it all went out the window - this is NOT a fantasy movie, I didn't expect to see Lord of the Rings - so McClane should not be on top of a moving jet plane for Christ's sake! <br/><br/>Everything about the movie screams of laziness. Poor script, I mean it just has some of the worst dialog and plot points ever. Poor casting, I mean you can see them now ""Hey, let's get the guy from the Mac ads, everyone will relate to him as a computer genius!"" Errr, no, we don't! Poor acting - Bruce is totally by the numbers, like he turned up, was told what to say on the day, does a take and then heads for lunch, and Cliff Curtis also does everything by the numbers too, a shame for a good actor to have clearly given up on his duties this time.<br/><br/>And Len Wiseman, come on people, what an appalling choice for this franchise, he's a knock off Michael Bay - and Michael bay hasn't made a good movie in a long time - don't get me started on Transformers!<br/><br/>This movie is terrible, and the most appalling thing is the rating it's got in IMDb. It's ironic how the movie points towards bringing down a corrupt government and starting again, because everything today is marketing spin, and yet here we are, giving a truly awful film a high score??? Why, because it's Die Hard???? Who are the real suckers at the end of the day huh? Don't believe the hype people, this film is a joke."

","Independence Day Reloaded<br/><br/>A bit of my background. I am regular reader at IMDb for perhaps 5 years, but this was the first movie that forced me to get registered and write a review of it.<br/><br/>*** Warning. Text below may contain spoilers *** Well, not really, there is absolutely no suspense in this movie and it is entirely predictable right from the beginning.<br/><br/>The movie consists of series of chases and shootouts that are not particularly well choreographed. Plot is virtually nonexistent (in other words there are more of the holes that of the plot itself). <br/><br/>Willis with his sidekick are dragged from location to location without any explanation how and why they got there. The scale of McLane's actions increased with each instalment (first saving the staff of a skyscraper, then airport, then a city and this time the whole country), unfortunately there are 2 issues now. First the whole premise hacking and controlling so many different computer systems is ridiculous, second the threat of terrorists does work at all. They are simply not menacing enough. <br/><br/>They are led by ""guy who shut down NORAD just with his laptop"", but when they shut down traffic in a big city, all they create is few car accidents (of the kind that can only happen when people are driving with their minds shut down). Other than police department being swamped by citizens (what the hell are they doing there?), not much happens. Cellphones work, it is possible to move around in a car, no real panic visible, no police presence on streets. Especially response to events from both citizens and government is not depicted at all. I would like to know where the hell was the mighty US Army for entire duration of the movie (apparently still tied down killing civilians in Iraq).<br/><br/>There are all sorts of clichés you can imagine: * Computer genius, who is at the same time exceedingly naive at the same time, a bit paranoid, uttering nonsense all the time and absolutely useless (except he miraculously saves the world in the end). * Another overweight computer genius, who is a bit paranoid, uttering nonsense all the time and absolutely useless. * Supermodel/kung-fu bitch crossover female terrorist * Girly main terrorist, who fails to be intimidating at all, he seems he can start crying any minute (I really miss calibre of Grubers or Colonel Stuart). * Terrorist masterminds who personally involve themselves dirty jobs, instead of employing their minions. * Generic industrial locations, which seem completely out of place. * 1960s sci-fi meets Matrix style computer rooms (I recommend sets designer to visit real server room next time, reality may look more menacing than this uneducated fantasy). * Cop chief who always seem to be genuinely busy, but he really does nothing in the movie. * Terrorists have resources to hack stock exchanges, traffic systems and utilities all over U.S. But still, the only thing they can afford to stop a poor cop is a chopper and few not particularly well trained guys with assault rifles.<br/><br/>Cast There are really only two characters in the movie, all other people appearing in the movie are just faceless bystanders (including main foes) and their performance is not any better than of any random bystander watching making of a movie.<br/><br/>Willis' performance is pretty generic, he tries to utter the same kind of one liners as in previous instalments, sadly most of the time they are out of place, badly timed or complete non sense. As the scale has been upgraded so is the McClane's self confidence who became true superhero with some supernatural abilities. Expect projecting speeding cars into helicopters, walking on a wing of a jet etc. This is in contrast with previous instalments where McClane had been smart guy, but still realistic police officer who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Long is genuinely B movie actor. His performance is at best bearable. He might be OK, mindless script does not give much space for his character.<br/><br/>Bottom line: No doubt it is the worst of all 4 Die Hards. I compared it to Independence Day it resembles a bit, but in many aspects ID is much better working. If you like mindless movies filled with explosions, but can do without any coolness factor, then you can try this, everyone else avoid it!<br/><br/>disaster (0 out of 5)"
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","8","156","263","27 June 2007"," Summer blockbuster with no overkill. Terrific action packed entertainment!
","John McClane back on duty and back in action.<br/><br/>This time around he is assigned to bring Matt Ferrell, a known hacker, to the FBI after some top security government mainframes are hacked. McClane and Ferrell barely get away with their lives and the US begins to crumble as a nationwide cyberspace takeover is engineered by some clever terrorists.<br/><br/>It has been 12 years and several weeks of controversy here on IMDb about this much anticipated release, but here it is, finally. And it doesn't disappoint. From the first scene to the last there is lightning fast pacing and many jaw droppingly spectacular stunt pieces. Much like the previous Die Hard entries logic isn't exactly a part of the game, but sheer adrenaline packed excitement sure is. John McClane is faced with many outrageous challenges and like before he doesn't back down even after seriously getting his ass whooped. But that's McClane you. Also, McClane isn't just as tough and resourceful as ever, he is a wise ass at the top of his game. Much of the ""controversy"" on the forums here was about the PG-13 rating's limited profanity (I know, I participated in the discussion), but guess what? There is profanity! But it is not really that that matters, it is John McClane's wise ass no fear attitude that fans want and that is just what they get. The profanity is obviously less than in the previous films but it still has plenty of funny moments and the famous 'yippy kah yay' quote is here in full glory.<br/><br/>Also, the stunt work is in full glory with several amazing set pieces, especially a dual with a super fighter jet near the end. Grade-A Hollywood mayhem and destruction and very little apparent CGI. As far as summer entertainment goes - forget Pirates 3 or Spider Man 3 - this is an action movie that knows when it is getting over the top ridiculous and spares the viewer overkill, but still manages to be ridiculous and entertaining. There are also subtle references to previous Die Hard movies that fans will undoubtedly smile at. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence/intense action and profanity. Ages 13+."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","1","61","97","12 October 2007"," One of the worst sequels in the history of film
","die hard 4 is a PG rated kiddie movie with a bored, middle aged superhero sleepwalking through uninspired vignettes while tackling an internet hacker with all the charisma of pancake batter. Its plot was seemingly written by a grade schooler with a box of crayons. The CGI ""action"" sequences were uninspired and badly staged, to the point of almost being slapstick or satirical, the only scene that had even a modicum of excitement to it was the opening shootout in Long's apartment. The real Die Hard trilogy may have one or two scenes in each movie which pushed credibility, but they were well directed and photographed and had a musical score to add to the tension, and the earlier stories were so strong that we could overlook a couple of lapses in logic. This movie was so outlandish, and the plot was so badly written it was insulting. We're actually expected to believe that McClane can drive an 18 wheeler and outrun a fighter plane, jump out of the 18 wheeler as it rolls over and fall 20 feet onto the wing of a jet, then hang onto the wing of this spinning out of control fighter plane, jump off the jet and survive a 40 foot drop onto a concrete embankment and survive sliding on his back down another 30 feet or so. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! <br/><br/>There were several lengthy scenes of Willis and Long driving and talking endlessly- attempts at ""human drama"" which amounted to nothing more than Bruce Willis' character complaining about how his life had turned out. The character of his daughter is seemingly about four different characters throughout the movie: she's a bitch for no reason in the first scene, but then when she gets into a jam (in the elevator) the first thing she does is ask to talk to daddy so that he can help her out, then later she wants to kick the bad guy's ass herself, then at the end she wants McClane to set her up with Long's computer hacker character like a schoolgirl. Apparently the writers couldn't make up their minds over her. The dialogue is uninspired and blandly delivered: it's clichés about McClane not being able to understand computers (already done better in Die Hard 2) and Long's character being unable to deal with McClane's being out of date and not being able to understand computers; none of the other characters were memorable, they just seemed to drift in and out of their scenes.<br/><br/>The entire movie (except for the insultingly stupid jet fighter sequence) was filmed through a horrible blue/ grey filter, trying to give the movie a ""sleek"" look, but only making it look drab and dull. For the first time in the series they did not film this movie in widescreen format, this was another attempt to cut corners and lowering the cost of the movie- and lowering the amount of money this movie would have to make to be commercially successful. The elevator shaft sequence, the falling down the stairs bit, McClane's family not using his own last name, were all done in the first three- but the producers claim that they're ""referencing"" the earlier films, not ripping them off and copying them. Riiight. The reference to the two Agents Johnson from the first Die Hard makes no sense, seeing as McClane never met or spoke to either of them in the first movie, so how the hell would he remember them after 20 years? Let's go back to the elevator sequence: in DHWaV, the elevator sequence had the same claustrophobic feeling of the first movie. It was just as well photographed as the original movie, had a convincing and memorable score to it, full, rich, vivid colours, and was violent without being too over the top, and it was short- less than 60 seconds. Short but memorable. But the elevator scene in dh4 is a silly vignette, badly photographed through that obnoxious blue/ grey filter, and it just lumbers about for the entire lengthy sequence. And the music score? What score? I remember absolutely NOTHING about the musical score in any scene in this crapfest. <br/><br/>You can NOT tell me that McClane would remember that catchphrase after 20 years and would think of it to say it at the end of this movie, and even if he did, it would mean NOTHING to the villain in this movie. What made the line amusing in the first movie was the terrorists' reaction to the line, NOT the line itself. (And the people who made such a big deal about ""Does he say his catchphrase or doesn't he?"" are genuinely pathetic, are you *that* desperate to hear profanity?) And we even got to see that moronic catchphrase used in an Arby's commercial- or at least as much of it as they could say on television. It's almost like this movie was just an excuse to say that moronic catchphrase yet again. Then, in one of the most anti climactic endings ever: McClane shoots through his own shoulder and hits the bad guy in *his* shoulder and kills him instantly? Again, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! This movie was an insult to the real Die Hard series, as well as the fans. In one hundred years people will look back on Die Hard as being one of the best action movies ever made. die hard 4/ live free or die hard is one of the worst sequels in the history of film, it took a dump on one of the best action film trilogies ever made. It's the only ""Die Hard"" movie (notice the quotation marks) that I'll never watch again. If it was meant to be a straight sequel, they failed. If it was intended to be a satire, they failed.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a trilogy. There never was a fourth Die Hard movie. <br/><br/>Die Hard ended With A Vengeance."

","All good things... Except in Hollywood, of course, they frequently don't come to an end, do they? With the cameras now rolling on the fourth addition to the Indiana Jones chronicles (which, begrudgingly, even this reviewer must acknowledge as being a fairly exciting prospect), the time seems wearily appropriate for catching up with John McLane (and, this time around, his grown-up daughter) and booing and hissing at the latest evil villain, with whom he must match wits.<br/><br/>Willis's charming grin is, of course, still firmly in place as, to be fair, is the franchise's emphasis on mostly exciting action set-pieces. What, unfortunately, seems now to be entirely absent is any sense of coherent narrative structure or the lip-smackingly evil but villainously intelligent characterizations of an Alan Rickman in the original Die Hard (1988) or Jeremy Irons in ...with a vengeance (1995). In their place, a perfunctory Dr Evil-esquire plan that inevitably involves McLane and which, with weary predictability, puts his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in mortal peril. Oh, and McLane isn't really getting on with his offspring at the film's outset...<br/><br/>In a nutshell, McLane is asked to escort hyper-hacker Matt Farell (Justin Long) into FBI custody - Farell is among a number of computer geniuses that have got the feds twitchy since their HQ computers were (temporarily) hacked. When Farell's apartment is converted into Swiss Cheese by certain terrorist types just after McLane comes a-knocking, everyone's favourite NYPD detective smells one of his famous rats, and the pair come into the orbit of Thomas Gabriel (a very overplayed, would-be psychotic Timothy Olyphant), a very bitter former NSA computer expert, who's out to teach Uncle Sam a thing or two by systematically shutting America down, via the internet. A so-called Fire Sale - everything must go...<br/><br/>All well and good - these days, it doesn't sound any more unlikely a plan than, say, flying jet airliners into tall buildings or blowing yourself up on the Metro. Unfortunately, whether due to budget restrictions or simple laziness on the parts of director Len Wiseman and writer Mark Bomback, we never really get to see what the awe-inspiring and terrifying consequences of such action might be, short of a few nasty traffic pile-ups and lots of lights going out. To wit, McLane isn't really put through much hell before, inevitably, he starts getting well-'ard with the terrorists.<br/><br/>Much praise has been heaped on the stunts which are, in keeping with the 'Timex hero in a digital age' theme, nearly all genuine rather than CGI- based but, whether they're blue-screened or for real, things exploding are still just loud bangs if there's little or no suspense. Let's face it, charming though Willis still is (and this installment's buddy-buddy factor works pretty well, thanks to an intelligent, twitchy turn from Long), there is never any doubt that it's going to be McLane victorious and, once again, entirely at ease with having just killed some 15-20 terrorists.<br/><br/>Credibility was there in spades in Die Hard, despite its 'high concept' narrative - by part four, rhyme and reason seem to have been finally sacrificed for box-office certainties. A shame."

","Wow, I can't believe I finally saw a blah Die Hard movie. This movie was totally ruined by the PG-13 rating. Bruce Willis felt like he was holding back every scene. He kept using the word Dickhead at the end of every sentence, he need to drop about 30-40 F-Bombs. Justin Long was such a horrible sidekick. He needed a black wise-cracking sidekick. He showed no emotion. Timothy Olyphant was such a boring villain. The whole world is breaking down but McClane looked like he was never gonna lose. He wasn't vulnerable like all the other Die Hard movies. He gets smacked around then he gets back up. I don't know what movie critics saw, but this is such a fair movie. Definitely the worst of the series. Even the 2nd one was far superior to this crap. It was just another studio controlled watered down movie.<br/><br/>P.S.

","Yet another dreadful summer sequel So far this summer, I have seen Evan Almighty, Spiderman 3, Fantastic 4:2 and Harry Potter, all have been awful. I am going to stop going to the cinema and just watch DVD's from now on.<br/><br/>I often wonder if directors, writers or producers even watch the originals of movies to see what ingredients actually made it successful. Die Hard worked because it stretched the truth a little, but ultimately was realistic. McClane was a just a normal cop, he wasn't a karate master, ex-green beret or body builder, just a normal New York cop. He suffered and struggled his way to get through his ordeal.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 was were it all went wrong. Instead of continuing on the same theme, McClane, now became Superman, impervious from bullets, fear or making mistakes. He could not fail.<br/><br/>Die Hard 3 continued in this comical theme, but for some unknown reason I thought I would give 4 a go. For the first 20 minutes, actually it was pretty good, and then came the first stupid thing, the fire hydrant on the helicopter, stupid. OK I can overlook that one, lets get back on track, oh dear ramming a car into a concrete barrier, somehow magically causing it to hit a helicopter with pin point accuracy. At this point I wondered if I had accidentally wondered into the Harry Potter movie.<br/><br/>I guess the overall problem is that John is part of the Heroes cast and has the same abilities as the cheerleader, somehow whatever injury he has, a couple of minutes he has made a full recovery. Needless to say the film did not improve from this moment onwards and descended into a farce. The only positive was that I thought Justin Long was pretty good as the geek, sidekick, he at least played the stereotyped role well.<br/><br/>I gave this a 1/10, it should have been a 3, but as so many people had voted 10 !!!, I assume company executives and people connected with the movie, I think it's important to re-address the balance.<br/><br/>Awful, please Hollywood wake up and make a good, realistic action movie.

"adlion944","6","31","50","29 July 2007"," Die Hard 4 - Here's Why It Sucked...
","First off, I'm a Die Hard 1 lover. The second and third weren't very good. Die Hard 1 was a textbook on how to make a thriller and was the first ""high tech"" heist/terrorist blockbuster thrillers I can recall.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 (which would've been clever in 1998, not so much now) is a loud, expensive, frenetic modern take on Die Hard 1. It's too much of everything. Here are the ingredients, see if you haven't seen these 100 times before (5 seasons of 24, MI:3, Bourne, Matrix, etc.):<br/><br/>1. Indestructible hero 2. Art-directed government computer centers that look like Dr. Evil's lair with plasmas all over the walls. 3. Computers doing high tech things with beautiful unknown operating systems that can pull up 3D wire frame schematics of anything imaginable in 1.5 seconds flat, and make high tech noises and beeps. 4. An aerial establishing shot of Washington D.C. that ""types"" in courier font the name of XXXXXX government institution (ticka ticka ticka ticka...). 5. Bossy government officials who say ""get me XXXX on a secure channel"" or addresses everyone as ""people, you better get me some answers"" and dislikes the hero and ignores his sage advice. 5. Beautiful computer technicians who know kung fu. Also, who wear 9 inch heels to conduct military operations because we all know how easy heels are to maneuver in. 6. Bad guys who take out 3rd tier characters with one shot but empty clip after clip in futility to hit the good guy. 7. Good guys who can launch a car into the air to hit a helicopter or knock open a fire hydrant to get a killer to fall out of his helicopter. First, fire hydrants lose their high pressure once the water has traveled about 3 feet. And the pressure comes from the narrow hydrant nozzle, not the water supply in the ground. If you knock the hydrant over, it won't spray upward more than a few feet and certainly wouldn't knock a guy out of a helicopter (who would've been clipped into a safety harness for rifle sniping anyway). Idiotic.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is terrible. We walked out. How can chase set pieces be boring? Die Hard 4.0 will show how. Lousy movie."

","In a summer filled with disappointment its nice to see John McClane back even if it is a pg-13 version it still takes my spot as the best summer movie thus far (and with it competition who can argue that). Non stop action grabs you in the first ten minutes and doesn't let go till the credits. Mclane is back rugged and raw, Willis gives a great performance as he reprises his role. There's one scene in particular that i loved, When hes driving the computer nerd that hes protecting after he has several run ins with Assasians and Johns a little banged up. He's asked ""Why are you doing this?"" (or something like that) and McClane says ""If there was someone else I would be glad to let them do it."" then the kid asks ""So why do it"" then McClane responds ""Because there is no one else."" I don't know maybe I'm reading to deep in but i thought that really shows who and what McClane is, hes the guy who is willing to put his own neck out to protect us because thats what he needs to do, not what he wants to do. He didn't ask to be a hero just that no one else stepped up that was willing to take the hits. Live Free Or Die Hard is a great action movie that even thou it may not rank with the original nor the third installments, i would definitely say its better than the second. And it sure is nice to see McClane back in action.......Yippie Kayay M*therF*cker"
"Drooch","1","23","37","13 July 2007"," Not bad but not Die Hard
","As a stand-alone film it was far better than I initially feared, and the action was very well handled with occasional flashes of Die Hard-quality genius - inventive setups with ultra-tense close-shaves (the lift shaft being the best). They were nothing like the over-stylised MTV mush sequences I feared, so I apologise to Wiseman for my nasty words about his action choreography over the last year.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the same can't be said for his story and character work. The plot was riddled with holes and the 'characters' rarely behaved like human beings. That's fine in itself but this film carried the 'Die Hard' tag and that means it needs to respect an intelligent, mature audience.<br/><br/>McClane was uneven, one minute he's a cuddly wisdom-dispensing Dad and the next he's brutalising a woman to death then repeatedly teasing her boyfriend for his loss who, despite being a psychopath, doesn't immediately kill McClane's daughter out of revenge.<br/><br/>Ironically, the chain smoking alcoholic drenched in blood from With A Vengeance was far more humane and, despite his potty mouth, a much better role model for the PG-13 kids this film was clearly targeting from the get-go.<br/><br/>Bruce, however, does what he can with the material and, between the corny dialogue which tried to probe the hero's psychology in the same cack-handed way that the Brosnan Bond scripts did, there were real McClane moments (his chuckles after killing difficult terrorists, his thuggish fighting techniques), but he was far more fascinating in the earlier films where we watched his genius rather than listen to him talk about it.<br/><br/>Justin Long was surprisingly good and non-annoying despite his presence reeking of the studio's insistence on a heavy teen presence for maximum market appeal. He cracked me up a few times, especially his comment when the bad-guys brought him out of the lift. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was also good as Lucy but was clearly shoehorned into the script at the last minute and was underused. She also suffered from Wiseman and Bomback's insensitivity for internal human logic - she's clearly feisty and punchy yet doesn't make a sound when Gabriel orders the jet to target her dad in the truck.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Timothy Olyphant. The guy's a good actor and was superb as the villains in Go, Scream 2 and The Girl Next Door but here he's totally nonthreatening. One almost feels sorry for him as McClane, now a terminator relishing the capacity for murder his total invulnerability affords him, marches unstoppably to kill Gabriel while, as mentioned before, teasing him about his dead partner.<br/><br/>The climax was pumped and tense and I quite liked McClane shooting through himself but the censoring of 'mother *beep* with a gunshot was as insulting as all the obvious re-dubbing I noticed throughout the film. There'll be an unrated DVD with the original language and GCI blood but you can't polish a turd.<br/><br/>A hollow collection of 'good-bits', some of them good enough to be worthy of Die Hard but ultimately there were too many jumps in logic, internal and external, for me to suspend disbelief. As I said before, I don't have problems with such films and this was an undeniably enjoyable 2 hours, but the Die Hard banner is reserved for superior quality adult entertainment and this fell short. Congratulations to Wiseman for upgrading from a Paul W S Anderson to a Jonathan Mostow but please hone your craft somewhere other than on the Die Hard pitch. Get McTiernan out of prison, get a good screenwriter (eg Shane Black) and give McClane his brain and balls back for Die Hard 5."
"kgthdc2468","10","154","306","27 June 2007"," The best Die Hard yet
","Bruce Willis reprises his 19-year-old role as super-cop John McClane in what is easily the best sequel this year. The film has been high on itself for staying away from CGI stunts in favor of old fashioned stunt men and women. Willis continues to prove that he is one of the biggest badasses in movie history by delivering another incredibly strong performance in Live Free or Die Hard, directed by Len Wiseman(director of the Underworld movies).<br/><br/>The series is now fully accessible to any audience with this modernizing chapter of the epic set of movies. The story takes place in modern time, where computers run everything, and the villain in this movie, Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olyphant from HBO's Deadwood) is a computer guru hellbent on revenge against the government that shunned him. His main mission in the movie is to show how vulnerable the United States' security system is by systematically taking down major parts of the system. Enter John McClane, who is called in to do a ""favor"" by picking up a college student who happens to be a computer hacker. When the student, Matt Farrell(Justin Long, Accepted) becomes a target for the terrorist group under Gabriel, McClane is drawn into the same old same old once again. McClane and Farrell have to work together to stop Gabriel from basically ""resetting"" the entire country. Add in McClane's daughter being kidnapped by Gabriel to keep John in line, and the conflict gets much more personal.<br/><br/>The movie may come as a bit tamer with the PG-13 rating, but make no mistake-this is a Die Hard movie through and through, and in my opinion, it's the best one yet. The film is the most spread out of the series, taking place across the entire eastern coast, as opposed to a building(Die Hard), an airport(Die Harder), or a single city(Die Hard: With A Vengeance). The movie trades in the claustrophobic environment of the original to make the entire eastern coast John McClane's personal playground, and it does a great job at that. The movie has some of the greatest action scenes of any movie, the pot, while a bit complicated, is still easy to follow and comprehend, and the dialogue is excellent, giving McClane a deluge of one-liners in his back pocket, per usual. The cheesiness of the original movies has also been traded in for a more serious, straight-to-the-point action flick that is on par with any great ones that have been released as of late, and surpassing many of those.<br/><br/>Looking at the Die Hard checklist, this movie has all the essentials. John McClane beats up on supposedly superior-armed terrorists: check. Sidekick that adds comic relief and keeps the story going: check. Well-played ""bad guy"" that pushes McClane to his limits: check. John McClane soaked in blood by the end of the movie: check. Tons of explosions, deaths, and ""yippie kay aye motherf***er"": check, check and check.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the Die Hard movies, this movie will blow you away. It is excellently done and easily the best action movie thus far this year. A great modern-day entry into the classic franchise."

","In the Die Hard family, Live Free or Die Hard is the dense but rebellious delinquent cousin who everyone dreads coming to Thanksgiving because he's going to ask somebody to borrow more money. The first three Die Hards had an idea of what they were. They were bloody thrillers about a cop from New York who you wouldn't have to be told is from New York judging by his complete confidence, readiness, and detachment when it comes to any confrontation, even terrorists on walkie-talkies threatening to blow up a building. This cop confronts incredibly smart villains who, William Sadler from Die Hard 2 excluded, are suave, brilliant, and match New York cop John McClaine on a personal level and inevitably share a laugh with him. They also have exciting, blood-spattered yeah-take-that gunfights and mortal physical combat. Live Free or Die Hard is so drunk on Hollywood's shallow mentality wherein they want to have their cake, which would be an attempt at an entertaining movie, and eat it too, eating it being compromising most things that make it a good movie in a bad salesman's attempt at expanding the audience.<br/><br/>You will not get a good shoot-em-up, for all you Die Hard fans out there. Instead, you will get a sequence wherein Bruce Willis is driving a semi truck and being attacked by a stealth fighter plane, which only fires missiles when it doesn't have a clear shot, so we can see more highway columns crumble, and only fires its machine guns when it has a clear shot for a missile, so that we can see the truck get ripped up. This is an example of the action sequences in this sudden cash-in idea by a Hollywood exec going to sleep one night and suddenly stricken by the revelation causing a light bulb to appear above his head. Aside from a fun fight between Bruce Willis and Maggie Q that leads to a car tangled in the cables of an elevator shaft, there's no grit, and hardly any real tension, because not only are these million-dollar sequences much more suited for Transformers than a cop movie, but they are so convenient in their improbability that we are hardly worried about McClaine not making it out alright. Everything else in the film is tailored unreasonably for the lazy satisfaction of a shallow audience anyway.<br/><br/>Take for instance the goofy subplot involving McClaine's daughter, who is now a teenager. You must remember his hot-and-cold relationship with his wife in the earlier films. (The film doesn't seem to want you to recall much from them, but it doubles back on itself at this point.) His daughter hates him, refuses to acknowledge his existence, refuses to call him, and calls herself Lucy Ginero, Ginero being her mother's maiden name, just to hurt her father. Why? Because. Because why? Ask the screenwriters this and they may think you're speaking in Greek, because there really isn't a credible reason given for such an intense hatred on her part. I'm not excusing McClaine's behavior in his daughter's first scene, because McClaine barges in on her and her date like an overly jealous, bombastic Southern husband. Why he acts this way in this scene is beyond me, but we're supposed to think it's cool, so unfortunately, this sort of forceful way that he acts in this one scene cannot be relievedly written off as the reason his daughter hates him so much.<br/><br/>Then, suddenly, when she's in trouble---and you know she's going to be in trouble because this is made clear in the movie's trailer, so don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything---she suddenly starts calling herself Lucy McClaine and telling her dad she loves him and showing him affection and things like that. Oh OK, so as soon as she needs him, she loves him. When he needs her affection and love as his daughter in everyday life after a day of avoiding bullets and explosions, she not only doesn't give it to him, but shows him great hate. What a cold, selfish, extremely fickle little brat she's portrayed as.<br/><br/>As for the film's villain, if you're expecting the riveting suavity and calculating control of Alan Rickman or the intimidating cold and German soldier's latent but powerful menace of Jeremy Irons, you'll be disappointed. Instead, you get Timothy Olyphant, who plays another power-hungry computer genius who is frankly weak without his technological prowess, and in essence simply a college-age prep whose heart races and eyes widen when he feels in control, which is in essence an insecurity. Who wants a weak villain after three extremely powerful ones? Olyphant opens his mouth in this odd teeth-showing grimace and his eyes are also squinty but bulging at the same time like a mad scientist's.<br/><br/>Also, just on a note of personal preference, I don't often really care for action movies and thrillers where everything is controlled by computers, keyboards, the internet, discs, and chips. I like actioners and thrillers, frankly, like the first three Die Hards, where we're trapped in a skyscraper and have to fight our way down, or the characters are forced to run around a big, endless panicky, rushing city like New York in a race against time. Those are exciting. High-tech thrillers just strike me as show-offy. Perhaps if Bruce Willis brought back John McTiernan, they would've made a Die Hard 4 where we maybe get to see some blood on someone's shirt and a script that works."

And do not expect the quality we have seen from the previous die hard movies - expect something in the Dolph Lundgren, later Steven Seagal style. (The problem is that this movie insists om calling it self a die hard movie, and the lead character has a name similar to the lead character from the die hard movies (he has less hair though).) --- Oh I'm sorry, this was a die hard movie? I must have missed that, because Im used to those movies i) ...having a script with logic and realism ii) ...having a bad guy that is NOT an idealist, but a criminal - period. iii) ...having at least an attempt at realistic action iv) ...NOT being a two hour excuse for the ""yippie kayee MF"" tag line.<br/><br/>This attempt at a movie is so riddled with unrealism and plot holes that it's not even funny. What exactly is the point of a (so called) serious action movie where the protagonist is not subject to common laws of physics? Where is the excitement? I mean, did I just watch the matrix or what? If so, where is agent Smith - or Morpheus?<br/><br/>Len Wiseman has directed too many vampire movies - seeing that the action and physics of this movie seemed more attuned to vampiric characters (they are neigh invulnerable) than human.<br/><br/>Although the french Parkour actors where really good - not as good as in the bond movie, but hey.<br/><br/>You have been warned my friends."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie by the time the credits started rolling! I was like the other skeptics. ""PG-13??? YIPPIE KAY AYE MOTHER-FATHER?"" If you go into this movie knowing it's not going to be Nakatomi Tower, or With a Vengeance, you can save yourself a lot of whining. Die Hard 2, to the fans, was not a very good movie. THIS ONE makes up for it! There's wasn't much potty language, but realistically, I don't think anybody had any time to drop any F-bombs on account of them having to constantly dodge the real ones. At first the dynamic between McClane and the Mac Geek seems a little ""ah here we go again, clash of the generations"", and it doesn't seem like a real Die Hard movie until about 30 minutes into it, but once we start recognizing Shoe-less John, a lot of that goes away! The hacker stuff seems to get sort of hokey, at times, but a lot of Die Hard fans won't have trouble letting that slide since John couldn't be bothered with it; he's too busy kickin' ass and takin' names! The action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. This is definitely the next level of action flicks (best since Casino Royale). Some of the blows McClane delivers are so intense, even Chester A. Arthur felt them.<br/><br/>There's no rehashing of old characters to forcefully remind you it's a Die Hard flick. That means no Sgt. Al Powell, no Zeus, no Holly Gennero side story, no Inspector Cobb, hell, not even a Gruber family member! Also, there's no jurisdictional cliché argument he had with the LA cop or Airport Cop from the sequel we all like to pretend never happened.<br/><br/>Trust me, by the time he says ""Yippie Kay Aye..."" your jaw will drop! A MUST SEE for Die Hard fans!"

","This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. A tired, lazy procession of clichés which lacks even a fraction of the flair or imagination of any of its predecessors. What Bruce Willis was thinking when he signed up for this God only knows; next time an A-list action movie star announces that he only signed up to revive a well-worn franchise ""because the script was right"", you should go ahead and assume they got the word ""script"" confused with the word ""money"". I just wish for once they would be honest about it and save everybody's time.<br/><br/>The film itself is merely a succession of highly improbable action set pieces joined together by clunky expositional dialogue and interrupted by moments of abject boredom. The sequence where Bruce engages in hand-to-hand combat with a fighter jet (yes, really) is just plain ludicrous. Maggie Q's henchwoman(she's Asian, so of course she is an expert martial artist) must have been a terminator, it's the only way to explain why she took so long to die. Timothy Olyphant's villain must rank as the dullest screen villain in living memory; he was given literally NOTHING interesting to say or do. Oh, wait, I think he kicked a chair once. He was angry, you see. Not as angry as I was at the thought that the two hours of my life I wasted watching this drivel are now lost forever. And if I see one more pretty estranged daughter in peril/daddy's coming to save the day/I love you daddy subplot I will puke. Can whoever thinks this is an interesting dramatic device please just STOP ALREADY.<br/><br/>In summary, if I wanted to spend two hours watching things get smashed up I'd visit my local junkyard on crushing day.

"shalabodov-32997","8","6","8","14 June 2018"," Live Free Or Stop Hating On This Movie
","The fourth installment of the infamous Die Hard franchise caused quite a split between the fans in terms of opinion. Many liked it, others loathed it. Here's why Live Free or Die Hard is actually a good action flick - <br/><br/>1. It's shot and edited very well. The man behind the camera did a great job and the film is entertaining as hell to watch because it's relentless. 
2. The action. Now, many complained heavily that this movie turns John McLane into a superhero. Even though the degree of realism gets close to crossing the line sometimes, it's nothing short of pure entertainment. Every Die Hard movie broke certain conventionalities for the purpose of making a fun scene. All Die Hard movies twisted reality a little bit to spice up the action a bit. This one does have more of it, but at least for me it was awesome. Also, the stunts are amazing! Very impressive stuff!
3. Plot. Everyone runs out of ideas. Eventually, even the die hard audience of Die Hard would get tired of John McLane trying to stop baddies from breaking into a vault and stealing money. I like the idea of an old McLane being surrounded by all the technology that he doesn't understand. It also creates another difference between him and the bad guy, which adds more meaning to their rivalry.
4. The character of John McLane. Just as always, Bruce Willis is great as John McLane, it's obviously a signature role. He is just as great in this one as he was in the previous three. His witty remarks about the current situation always make you chuckle and his sarcastic attitude is always relevant.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this an 8, not a 10, is the continuity errors that were painfully noticeable and lack of the bad guy on screen. Otherwise, this is the definition of an action movie done right. To me, it's not as good as 1 or 3 but better than 2."
"arcam_nine","1","21","37","11 August 2007"," Die already - useless.
","No respect. That's the problem with Hollywood these days. It's imagination has completely fizzled out. In the eighties, in the heyday of classic action movies such as Die Hard, a director had the opportunity to really make the film he wanted to make. Nowadays, we have a business production line, unconcerned with anything except the speed of the turnover.<br/><br/>Let me be blunt: Die Hard 4 is not a Die Hard movie. It's a retarded excuse for the movie it should have been. When the lights fell I waited in anticipation for the hallmark slamming title, the hype-builder that rockets onto the screen as it had done in all previous iterations. But blink and you'll miss it folks - Die Hard 4 introduces itself like a wet paper bag. And from this point on, I knew Len Wisemen didn't have the goods. He's just not a good enough director. So what happens when you dumb-down Die Hard from being an 18 rated action movie for adults, and turn into a 12 rated movie for kids? You get the worst enemy of all time. A bad guy so weak (in character and in performance) he doesn't actually kill a single person in the entire film...except himself. There's no trace of the venom left behind by Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons - this bad-guy is a 'high-tech' nerdy bad-guy, one with the acting calibur of a grape. He can't deliver a line to save his life. John McClane suffers equally, losing his identity as a put-upon cop. He spends the movie tromping about from location to location, putting people out like the terminator, and all with such dismissable ease. Gone are the days when he was holed up, covered in blood and bruises and looking like he might not make it. This time, he manages to whoop and holler through all the gaps where the one-liners were supposed to be (because the script writer couldn't be bothered to think of any)and behave like a total idiot. Yes, Len Wiseman's McClane has gone from being street smart, and having cop logic, to being a total techno-moron. The joke wears thin quick. McClane's irritating cyber-geek sidekick spends the entire movie reminding the audience of just how out-of-date our beloved hero is. He's so out of touch with modern music and, god-forbid, 'technology' - that most of the jokes revolve around John McClane not being able to get to grips with a webcam. Great. I wonder if the same hero, who single-handedly foiled three terrorist threats, who landed planes, who wrapped some C4 to a PC monitor and pushed it down a lift shaft to blow up the basement of the Nakatomi Plaza, could actually operate an electric tin-opener in his old age? Why is his age even a factor - he still looks fighting fit. Did the script writers really think this angle was a great idea? Making the Macho man a complete ditz? Obviously, yes - only to serve as a dampener on the film as a whole. To make matters worse, Wiseman has given the audience a generic 'save-the-daughter' plot line, in which the kidnapped girl ridiculously dodges being shot dead by the worlds wettest super villain (despite spitting in his face and generally antagonising the situation). Why, when McClane is putting down his forces like bowling pins, does he feel the need to never pull the trigger? Because, as he states, he needs a 'bargaining chip.' It's at this point (if you haven't already) you really begin to wonder who writes this garbage. The film is blue. Not 'blue' like sexually explicit, but blue like someone forgot to take the lens filter off. Yes, in Wisemans classic Underworld tinting style, we're treated to a slick blue cityscape for the duration of the flick. Modern like a music video. Was waiting for a rapper who couldn't act to turn up, but thankfully the kiddies could go without the cameo this time. Obviously watching films in colour just isn't cool anymore. If only John McTeirnan had made Vengeance in green, we would have been able to see New York City without the heat, without the sweat, and without the emotion. Die Hard is about urgency - a tight situation. If any of the previous films took three days to resolve a situation, would they have been as fun? In Live Free or Die Hard, it takes three days. The sun goes up, it goes down, it comes up again. Why? Because there's no actual plot line. The movement of the characters feels forced, each action scenario an excuse to 'get one in' rather than a result of the environment.<br/><br/>What really gets my goat is this:<br/><br/>I knew it was going to be rubbish before I went in. Yes, I'm a child of the eighties, and yes, I have an affinity with the era. But I'm not so old I can't tell when there's a remarkable lack of effort in Hollywood these days. The film is as half-baked as Aliens vs Predator - there is not enough respect for the franchise to do it any justice, and that really ticks me off.<br/><br/>Willis should have said no, and he should say no to the next one. Don't buy the four disc box set, run out and buy the three disc one now - and do it quick, because this isn't a Die Hard movie at all. It's a poor action movie starring Bruce Wills - and who really cares about another one of those?<br/><br/>Skykid"
"blackaugust79","1","20","35","31 October 2009"," Live Free of this Die Hard movie
","Thanks To IMDb's silly rule about lengthy reviews I will get straight to the point of this review of why I believe this is a pathetic attempt at a Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>1. Claustrophobia is a staple of Die Hard movies. This movie has no claustrophobia, no time restraint so you could easily tire of watching it. The thing last three days for goodness sakes. Contradictory to Die Hard plots.<br/><br/>2. No Profanity. I don't care if a movie has no cursing or not but this is a DIE HARD movie. There should have been some profanity because that is the Die Hard's character.<br/><br/>3. Lack of suspense. The previous Die Hard movies were great at this but this movie seemed to be created for people that suffer from ADD. It moves from clumsy action set piece to clumsy action set piece to the point where it begins to feel as if Michael Bay directed this movie.<br/><br/>4. Lousy villain. The previous entries had great villains that still hold up well after these years. Hans Gruber, Simon Peter Gruber and Col Stuart are all excellent villains but Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olyphant) is a sissified wimp(who looks like a reject model from Abercrombie & Fitch) that spends most of the movie avoiding confrontation with McClane. Steve Buscemi's front teeth are more intimidating than this guy.<br/><br/>5. Action sequences are obscenely over the top. Over the top action sequences are a staple of Die Hard movie also but they were never this over the top. McClane jumping on top of a fighter jet? McClane sliding down a concrete embankment without getting hurt? Who writes this stuff? Akiva Goldsman? <br/><br/>6. McClane never felt like McClane. Bruce Willis spent the whole movie looking like he's doing improv instead of playing a real character. There is no trace of the grumpy anti-hero cop we all fell in love with in 1988 in this movie. Turning him into some ignorant ape that is anti-technology was insulting to a fault.<br/><br/>7. No chemistry with the co-star Justin Long. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson were great in Die Hard With A Vengeance(the best sequel in the Die Hard series hands down). Plus knowing the character of Zeus Carver made that movie all the more intriguing. Zeus also helped McClane solved those riddles and helped him in finding Simon's whereabouts. There is nothing to that effect here with Justin Long. He never really helps Mclane, he is annoying and Bruce seems like he's about ready to slap the guy senseless at any moment. Think Rob Schnieder and Sly Stallone in Judge Dredd for a perfect comparison of Bruce Willis and Justin Long in this movie.<br/><br/>8. No great lines. Die Hard 1-3 had the most memorable lines in action movie history. The lines in this movie sound as if they written by fan film making geeks with waaaay too much time on their hands. ""I'm gonna kill this guy and get my daughter back"".""My name is Daisy Duke, I got a lot s--- for it in school so please don't add to it"" Lame! <br/><br/>9. This Film is blue. No I don't mean depressing. I mean you forgot to take off the lens filter you idiot blue. Die Hard works well in earthy colors not in blue screen. Felt like a was watching a fan film that thought it was really cooler than what it really was. <br/><br/>There you have it. The reasons why this movie sucks. Weak action sequences , wimpy metrosexual villain, lousy henchmen and Bruce has no chemistry with co-star. Plus what chucklehead actually thought Len Wiseman(or Len Dumbkid) was good enough to direct a Die Hard movie anyway? This movie is tailor-made for the MTV generation(The ADD generation). If you have the original 3 Die Hard movies you're all set. The fact that this monstrosity is so highly rated on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes is proof that both of these sites lost their credibility a long time ago. Thumbs down."

","Live Free or Die Hard (2007)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>The fourth film in the franchise has John McClane (Bruce Willis) asked to pick up a hacker (Justin Long) for questioning by the two of them are soon under attack from an unknown group of men. Soon it becomes clear that a madman (Timothy Olyphant) plans on hacking into every U.S. system to bring the country down. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD sounds like it would be a complete loser. I mean, after all who thought it would be a good idea to put McClane up against internet hackers? As silly as the story might sound, it actually works extremely well thanks in large part to a pretty nail-biting and tense story that fits into the post 9/11 world of fear where we could be hit hard at anytime. Now, I will freely admit that you've really got to suspend your disbelief because not for a single second did I buy McClane being able to pull off what he does here. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I'd buy the events in the first three films a lot more than I do this one but director Len Wiseman handles everything so well that you can overlook the unbelievable nature of the picture. What works best is the direction actually because he at least makes you believe that this terrorist group could pull off what they're doing and pretty much attack America on three different levels. I'm really not sure if would be as easy as the bad guys do it but this is just a minor problem. There are some really terrific action scenes scattered along the way including a real nail-bitter on a highway where all lanes are opened and this leads to an amazing crash. Another terrific sequence happens with Willis driving a semi and a fighter jet comes to attack. Willis, as you'd expect, is in fine form as he has no problem fitting into this character. The one-liners and his smart mouth are right on the mark and he manages to also play the more dramatic moments. I thought Long was okay in his role but there's no question that it's rather underwritten. Olyphant makes for a good villain as does Maggie Q in her brief scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also good in her scenes as the daughter. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD manages to deliver in the entertainment value, the drama and there's no question that the action is fun. The film has a few flaws along the way but it's still another good entry in a very good series that manages to be different yet keep the same type of fun."
"SozeTheKeyser","7","36","72","1 July 2007"," As a generic action flick it passes, as the Die Hard 4 it fails
","The Die Hard dynasty is the definition of the heroic anti-hero. John McClane is a hero by accident. He is forced to be a hero, not because he is inclined to be one.<br/><br/>This is why I, and others, distinguish between Die Har 1&3 and Die Hard 2. And without telling to much, I now put number 4 in the series in the latter category.<br/><br/>I'll tell you why.... John McTiernan had the right take on it, and you see it in both the 1 and 3. He doesn't treat John McClane as a hero, he treats him as an ordinary guy, albeit a bad-ass type of ordinary guy. This is what makes Die Hard ultra cool. - Bruce Willis kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you hit him he falls over, bleeds, but gets up again, retaliates ending in fatality, and a snide remark.<br/><br/>Number 2 made him too much of a generic hero, and Live Free or Die Hard aka Die Hard 4.0 has a bit of the same problem. John McTiernan made a balanced gourmet (action)meal, in the proper serving size. 4.0 struggles with the same as you do, when you try to recreate the meal you just had. You liked it, so you make a double portion, and because you liked certain elements, you add extra of that. And the result of that is always the same, it's OK, but not as good as you had, because it's out of proportion and after gorging on it, you suddenly feel you've had too much, spoiling it all a bit.<br/><br/>Although John McClane in 4.0, is very vocally underlined as not being the heroes hero. The rest of the movie portrays him as such. Everything is a little bit extra, and little big bigger, and a bit more explosive. Sometimes you wonder if the director was thinking, ""and then here it would be nice with another explosion, maybe John bleeding a bit more"".<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard goes a long way with the template and the pedigree, but because of it's eager to give a little bit more of everything, it stops short of giving the same cool feel as the John McTiernans.<br/><br/>As an action flick though, it's exciting and keeps you entertained most of the time. It does get a little long towards the end, and some of the mushy elements, gets well... a little too mushy<br/><br/>All in all, it's worth seeing, and you should take a hide during the summer to do just that. Because Bruce Willis is good company. Even if you do miss the John McClane of the past millennium."
"rmax304823","3","12","20","23 October 2008"," The DNA is degraded.
","The original ""Die Hard"" was a crudely entertaining action movie with comic villains and a couple of humorous exchanges in addition to the usual violent sequences that had Bruce Willis as Officer John McClane running barefoot through a sea of broken glass. The next episode in the franchise, ""Die Harder,"" switched the locale from the Nakatomi Building to Dulles and was essentially a repeat, duller than the first despite the enhanced special f/x. The third installment, ""Die Hardest of All,"" or was it, ""Die, Whether You Like It Or not""?, put Willis back in New York with Samuel Jackson as his unwilling sidekick and Jeremy Irons as the least believable German heavy imaginable. It wasn't up to the standard of the original -- so few copies are -- but it was more entertaining than the second installment. I know. I got the titles all mixed up but these sequels come thick and fast and seem to pile atop one another like cow flops.<br/><br/>This one keeps nothing more than the character of John McLaine and the acing of Bruce Willin in the part. He has devolved into a routine action hero. He has no vices. He doesn't smoke. He doesn't say anything that is politically incorrect. He doesn't use cuss words. He doesn't suffer from a hangover. He has no humanity to speak off. It could be Arnold Schwarzenegger in the part, or Sylvester Stallone, back in the 80s, or Dolph Lundgren or Jacques van Damm a decade ago. Interchangeable. In the next installment, may we look forward to a silver-haired Willis, his hair grown back, who is a vegetarian and is serenely awaiting The Rapture, the satisfaction of his utter boredom tempered by the saddening realization that the Jews, Moslems, Zoroastrians, Coptic Christians, and Animists of all stripes will not ascend into heaven to sittith in Paradise? Well, why not? This fourth outing has drained the character and plot of any blood the original had. The thing's been almost completely eviscerated. Nothing is left but the gall. <br/><br/>The story involves the takeover and the threatened demolishing of the entire computer system that now permits the United States to function. But if you think you're going to learn anything about how this might be done, or if there will be suspenseful scenes in which we follow some hacker through the system, you'd be wrong.<br/><br/>It's action, period, 24/7. That's all it's really about. There's little time left for humor or character development. Instead of Officer McClane hanging on the edge of an endless elevator shaft in the Nakatomi Building, there's an entire SUV dangling at the end of a cable in an elevator shaft. Not enough? Okay, there are two people having a vicious fight within the precariously suspended vehicle. Need still more? There's a guy a few floors up with an automatic weapon, shooting the SUV full of holes. And there is, trust me, nothing funny about the villains. The only wisecracks come from Willis and a young computer geek he drags around by the hair, and they're not very funny. What really makes me gag is that conversations now use a telegraphic style. Nobody says, ""Let's launch the rockets."" It's, ""Launch rockets,"" even though the addressee is standing next to the speakers. <br/><br/>Would you like to see one car smash into another in the Holland Tunnel, leap up, and spin over and over eight or nine times in mid-air? If so, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for anything in the way of comedy or human interest to balance the action, don't look here."
"lspijker","6","33","66","5 January 2008"," Unbelievable plot, action packed, but certainly no Die Hard
","This movie for me was disappointing. I had three main expectations: 1) a continuous 'grabbing' plot, that could be 'movie' believable. 2) a human John (Bruce Willis) who rescues us from evil and we can relate to. 3) a good sidekick that has his/her own place in the plot<br/><br/>None of these expectations were met. 1) The story was really too fantastic to be believable, too far reached. 2) John wasn't John anymore, he was turned into superman, which made it hard to relate to him. This is the main reason why I rated this movie low. Die Hard has the charm that, all be it in fantasy, that you could be John Mc Clane, you can identify and live with him, and so together rescue the world from evil. That concept has been killed by this new Die Hard 4. 3) the sidekick in the form of the hacker, Matt Farell. His performance was good, but he was too closely tight into action with John and was too weak to stand out. He is no Samuel Jackson, who stands out as strong as Bruce Willis and forms a tag team with him. Here, both in the plot and in acting, Matt Farell was more a drag then a tag team player. <br/><br/>Conclusion: The movie was certainly action packed. The acting was good (except for the bad guys, that was really weak in my opinion. Though Maggie Q played a deliciously evil tough woman that performed a Die Hard worthy fight with John). The plot really out of reality and too fantastic. It was definitely no Die Hard, that was severely disappointing."
"BA_Harrison","6","27","53","21 September 2007"," It's a bird... it's a plane.... no, it's John McClane!!!
","About 40 minutes into Live Free or Die Hard (the fourth film in the popular Die Hard series), Bruce Willis stops playing tough cop John McClane and becomes his indestructible character from M. Night Shyalaman's Unbreakable. It's the only answer that makes sense.<br/><br/>How else could he jump from a speeding car onto blacktop and live to tell the tale? Or fall several stories out of a window, only to get up, dust himself off and continue fighting? Or crash a vehicle through solid walls and into a lift shaft without killing himself? Or leap from a wrecked juggernaut, onto the tail of a soon-to-explode jet plane, and then onto a collapsed freeway (I'm not making this uphonest!) without being reduced to a red smear? In the first Die Hard, McClane was vulnerable; in this one, he wouldn't look out of place wearing a fancy spandex costume with a fluttering cape.<br/><br/>Part 4 sees our grizzled hero back in action after he is sent to pick up Matthew Farrell, a computer hacker who is suspected of being involved with a high-tech terrorist organisation (who are attempting to shut down the U.S.A. in order to get their grubby paws on it's entire wealth). However, it transpires that the young geek was duped into helping the bad-guys and is now surplus to requirements; the villains try to kill the net-nerd (I know, I know... look who's talking!) to cover their tracks, but they don't count on the hero of the Nakatomi Tower incident being on bodyguard duty.<br/><br/>McClane rescues Matthew (after engaging in an exciting shootout with some nameless henchmen, who all dienatch!) and takes off in his car, with a helicopter full of gun-toting baddies in hot pursuit. Eventually, trapped in a tunnel, having narrowly escaped death in a multiple pile-up, John McClane makes his transformation into a superhero. Now, impervious to damage, he gets in his car, hurtles at high speed down the tunnel and launches the vehicle into the waiting helicopter, leaping to safety at the last moment.<br/><br/>And so it continues, with each successive action set-piece more ridiculous than the one before, until the aforementioned freeway/fighter jet scene which takes my award for daftest cinematic moment of this millennium.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the silliness doesn't stop with the action scenes... the characters that populate this film are equally ill-conceived: Luscious Maggie Q plays Mai Lihn, a kung fu fighting villainess who is almost as indestructible as Willis''s cop; Long's cyber-dork is one of those people that only seem to exist in modern day action/thrillersa twenty something with the ability to outsmart the government's top computer operatives; tasty Mary Elizabeth Winstead is John's ballsy daughter Lucy, who goes from hating her dad to loving him (when he rescues her from danger); and Timothy Olyphant is the supreme bad-guy, a miffed ex-government computer boffin who (inexplicably) manages to gather together a team of henchmen willing to do his bidding, whatever the risks.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard is glossy, popcorn entertainment for those who don't worry too much about logic. It's entertaining fluff that is technically flawless, easy to follow and reasonably exciting, and, for many, that will be enough. But for those who, nearly twenty years ago, thrilled at the sight of a vest-wearing Willis dangling over the edge of a skyscraper, it can only be something of a disappointment."

After the overlong 2 hours 10 minutes were over I had the impression the producer, ""director"", scriptwriter and whoever else, set out to make the most unbelievable, ridiculous, unrealistic movie imaginable.<br/><br/>The whole storyline is laughably unrealistic (even AFTER 9/11 !) and utterly implausible. It doesn't do the picture any harm, but speaks volumes about the script that even at the end it is NOT clear, what the bad guys actually wanted: money, destabilize the USA, bring down the financial system, revenge, destroy capitalism, ... whatever ? Sure, the motives are unnecessary, it's just an overproduced multi-million dollar star-vehicle anyway, but still, it shows how little care was given to any ""character development"".<br/><br/>But that's the least problem this movie has.<br/><br/>It's plain simply boring, too! The first 10, 20 minutes have some nice scenes, but when the action starts its just run-of-the mill stuff, and most action scenes are just computer-animated cartoons: unrealistic looking and completely implausible. That does not create any tension (at least not for me).<br/><br/>Besides, its direction is completely uninspired. Who is Len Wiseman ? After this picture I don't care. Tiernan and Harlin, who made 1 & 3, respectively 2, are directors, who know their craft. Especially Tiernan knows his job and has done some brilliant work: DH I, Predator, Hunt for Red October, but obviously he didn't want to do # 4. I understand why, with this script. Renny Harlin is no match to Tiernan but still did a lot better job than Wiseman. Wisemans direction is plain simply uninspired.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4 tries ""hard"" for humor, but it all comes over very forced. The dialog is even bad for a silly action flick, all this stupid blabla about heroes, it just does not fit (it fits into a John Wayne flick, but not into a DIE HARD-movie, it's simply uncool there - Willis looks bored in these scenes anyway, I guess he would have thrown out this dialogue, if it would have been his decision).<br/><br/>The MUSIC by Beltrami is nothing short of lacking ANY compository skill, it's just VERY loud and pounding noise, impossible to listen to.<br/><br/>A real let-down, depressing to see this last entry. Now I know why Willis did not want to do a # 4 and am sure no # 5 will ever be made (unless he would need a lot of money). Still, even in this mess of a movie, Willis does come off best, which speaks for him.<br/><br/>Nothing anybody has to see, just skip it and remember # 1 (to # 3, which I consider the second best entry)."

"dee.reid","9","15","28","20 November 2007"," Die Hard 4.0 - Cyber-terrorism
","The ""Die Hard"" movies, which have starred Bruce Willis spanning through an illustrious 19-year career, have always been about action and excitement, much like any action movie. However, unlike most action movies, the hero in each, Detective John McClane, was an Everyman. This allowed Average Joes to connect with a genuine human being who got hurt and was often caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. McClane was sort of like an urban Indiana Jones and likewise, this is what allowed us to forge real connections with him, much rather than your typical Chuck Norris's, Sylvester Stallone's, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's.<br/><br/>2007's ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (or ""Die Hard 4.0""), is the first ""Die Hard"" film Willis has appeared in since 1995's ""Die Hard With a Vengeance."" Just to get pretenses out of the way: ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the best film since the original. While being more technically brilliant and showing off a kind of chic flashiness all too apparent in today's action films, it doesn't mean that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is even remotely a bad film, it's just more technically sophisticated than its predecessors. But that's very good; it just shows that all concerned here are getting with the times, while not sacrificing a potent action movie legacy that's been built on believable characters and suspense. More to the point, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" proves that even dinosaurs like the 52-year-old Bruce Willis, still have a punch or two left in them.<br/><br/>The film is a technical marvel, to say the least. It has a number of breathtaking action scenes, thus making ""Live Free or Die Hard"" the most action-packed and exciting entry in the series since ""Die Hard"" back in 1988. Watching these action scenes, I got the feeling of expert craftsmanship, almost a nostalgic feeling for the action blockbusters of yesteryear. There are action scenes and then there are action scenes, which are not overblown by today's standards. I got the feeling of watching real human beings doing real human stunt-work, including watching Willis handle himself capably even while chaos is erupting around him.<br/><br/>The series has been handled by two skilled and capable directors so far - John McTiernan and Renny Harlin. In the director's seat this time is Len Wiseman, who is obviously hoping this big jump into the Hollywood limelight is his ticket out of cult ""B""-movie fanfare like the ""Underworld"" films. To this critic's surprise, he, like the aged Willis, is able to handle himself capably and admirably. He's earned his spot in the ""Die Hard"" legacy.<br/><br/>This time around, McClane's task seems simple: escort a lowly computer hacker, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), from New York City to Washington, D.C., for questioning by the F.B.I. after several of his hacker pals have bitten the dust. But because it seems that Farrell has been involved in some shady Internet dealings with a particularly cold-blooded Web-based terrorist named Thomas Gabriel (the effective Timothy Olyphant), things are going to get hectic real fast.<br/><br/>It isn't long before assassins come after McClane and Farrell and they stumble onto Gabriel's plot: he's going to use his legion of hackers and infinite computer resources to systematically shut down the entire United States (Farrell explains this three-step process as a ""Fire Sale""). So it's up to McClane and the computer-savvy Farrell to use what technological resources they have left to foil Gabriel's plans before he puts us back into the Stone Age (oh, my, a world without computers and the Internet). However, when Gabriel is pushed into a corner, he's forced to take drastic measures and take McClane's feisty daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hostage.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is really the first ""Die Hard"" film to take a slice of modern-day paranoia - cyber-terrorism - and work it into a feasible action film that at times is a little scary. We've come to be so reliant on technology that it's only a matter of time before a computer-savvy psycho like Thomas Gabriel comes along and exploits that fact. So, the smart-alecky script by Mark Bomback, taking inspiration from a news article titled ""A Farewell to Arms"" by John Carlin, really doesn't seem all that far-fetched when you think about it.<br/><br/>At center stage, of course, is Bruce Willis, sharing screen time with the youngster Justin Long. Bomback's screenplay, under Wiseman's skilled direction, provides the two with a believable amount of running dialogue, rapport and teamwork, giving them time to develop, and exchange humorous and wily insults back and forth to one another while running for their lives. (It's a generational buddy-trip that works.) Their first meeting, in Farrell's apartment, followed by a shootout, really sets the pace for the rest of the film, and guarantees that no one will be snoozing during this hardcore action-fest. Surely one of the best of these sequences has to be McClane's showdown with a Harrier Jet on a collapsing freeway. And then there are also McClane's potentially lethal encounters with Gabriel's chief baddies Mai (Maggie Q) and Rand (rising French action star Cyril Raffaelli). In a not-so-surprising cameo, filmmaker Kevin Smith also appears as an Armageddon-prepared hacker named ""Warlock.""<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the best film the series has to offer since the original 1988 ""Die Hard."" It proves to us that the days of real action movie heroism are not yet gone, and that action-hero dinosaurs like Bruce Willis can still roll with the new.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Die Hard 4.0 or if you rather call it by its name modeled after the New Hampshire license plate ""live Free or Die(Hard)"", I think Idaho's license plate would have been much more appropriate for this dribble,""Die Hard: Famous Potato's?"". Being all this movie is, is a pathetic way attempt to fill movie seats with good ol John Mclane and the Die Hard franchise, while retaining nothing of which made the original movie or sequels appealing, outside of Bruce Willis (very) seldom charm. All the gritty action, and excitement that arose from a down to earth cop whose in over his head has been replaced by a bald superhero engaging in loony tunes type adventure. At one point while driving being chased by a helicopter John intentionally runs over a fire hydrant causing water to fire up from the sidewalk knocking the gunner clean out of the side of the helicopter, it only gets worse from there. Did i mention there's a white super ninja in it too!!! Who runs up walls and jumps across entire streets from rooftop to rooftop are we excited yet!!!! Lastly i'd just like to point out a scene where John is fighting this 90lb karate chick and and getting his ass kicked (dont you love in these cliché movies when 200lb guys who are unstoppable always get beat up by little girls), the girl is all disheveled hair a mess and bruised, BUT right after John gets kicked out a window, they edited in a shot of her from a totally different scene, with her hair neatly tied back and perfect make up, i'm not kidding look for it will probably be the most amusing thing you see in this train wreck of a movie. Which is a good example of what a mess this movie is, and just inexcusable in a big budget movie like this. Do yourself a favor and just go watch the original again."
"crazykc1980","5","8","13","15 July 2007"," This movie is awarded an 8??
","I know the storyline isn't the most important part of a good actionmovie, but Die hard 4.0 really showed that even these movies need at least some element of surprise. The storyline was about the corniest I've ever had to endure; An evil hackermastermind tries to collapse the computerized American system, to get very very rich in the process. This already wonderfully original storyline (yes, I'm being ironic here) gets even better with the kidnapping of McClane's daughter. I couldn't believe that even a Die Hard movie would treat it's viewers to such a lame storyline, so I kept waiting hopefully for a twist in the plot, needless to say, in vain. <br/><br/>The biggest problem however was that the rest of the movie didn't manage to make up for any of these flaws, like sometimes is the case with other mindless actionmovies. The overabundance of computer animated actionscenes, often stretched far beyond any acceptable point of unrealism, made Die Hard 4.0 feel ""plastic"" and fake. This is not to say that the whole movie didn't have it's moments, but from movies like Die Hard, I expect to be taken for a roller-coaster ride of excitement that makes me forget that any time is passing at all while watching it. Instead I kept looking at my watch..."
"MichaelM24","10","6","9","23 March 2010"," Top-notch action!!
","It's been a long twelve years, but John McClane is back and better than ever. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is now divorced from his wife and dealing with a broken relationship with his daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The FBI requests that he pick up a known computer hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long), and bring him in for questioning regarding a recent security breach of the FBI computer system. McClane arrives just in time to save Farrell's life from a team of assassins. Meanwhile, more computer attacks are being carried out by a terrorist mastermind named Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) who is systematically shutting down a variety of utilities, bringing Washington, D.C. to a virtual halt. Farrell recognizes the pattern of events as a ""fire sale,"" a plan to destroy the country's infrastructure. Taking Farrell into protective custody, McClane has to keep him alive as they avoid continued attempts on their lives and race against time to stop the terrorists from plunging the nation into a new stone age.<br/><br/>I've loved the ""Die Hard"" movies since I was a kid, and I knew this one would not disappoint. While I don't mind CGI in movies, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is a terrific throwback to '80s action movies, and while there are a fair share of digital effects, a lot of stuff is done live and even with models, giving it something of an old school feel that elevates it above a lot of stuff that's come out in recent years. A little over 50 years old, Bruce Willis easily slips back into the role of John McClane and shows he can still kick ass. The rest of the cast is good. I particularly like Olyphant as the villain. At first I was worried how the film was going to handle the fractured relationship between McClane and his daughter, but it was thankfully done very well and did not distract from the story in the way many other parent-child relationships like this have done in other movies. Winstead plays Lucy McClane as a feisty girl who can take care of herself, and she gets some nice moments during the later half of the film.<br/><br/>The story is tight, has a great pace and some nice developments along the way, and the action is top notch. Director Len Wisemen brings back some of the closed-in, claustrophobic feelings that were present in the first two films. This is probably best recreated during an excellent sequence that involves McClane fighting Gabriel's second hand, Mai Linh (Maggie Q), in and around an SUV that finds its way into an elevator shaft, dangling precariously several stories about the ground. Their preceding fight ranks right up there with the fight in ""Die Hard"" between McClane and the terrorist Karl. And the climactic sequence in which McClane, having commandeered the terrorist's high-tech big rig, is pursued by an F-35 Lightning jet is one hell of an action set piece. Many fans complained about the film's PG-13 rating, since the previous three films were all rated R. But it didn't bother me at all. I've now seen it three times. This is a top notch action film, one of the best in the last ten years, in the finest ""Die Hard"" tradition, and nothing delivers action quite like a ""Die Hard"" movie."

","When the FBI computer system is invaded in the weekend of July 4th, the Director of the Cybercrime Division Bowman (Cliff Curtis) requests that all the available agent and policeman bring the known hackers for a conversation about the breech in the system. NYPD Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is assigned to bring a New Jersey's hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long). While with Matt in his apartment, they are attacked by hit-men of a terrorist organization and sooner they find that seven other hackers have been killed. Matt identifies the beginning of the chaotic ""fire sale"" when all the computer systems are shutdown by a terrorist organization leaded by the former government analyst Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) bringing a digital Armageddon to United States of America. McClane chases Thomas with Matt, but when his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is kidnapped by the criminal, his pursuit becomes a personal issue.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 4.0"" is an entertaining non-stop action movie. The story is absurd, but works in this type of film. Bruce Willis is tailored to perform John McClane, a man that survives to the toughest and most incredible situations. If the viewer likes action movies, he or she will certainly like this one very much. Otherwise, why spending time watching a ""Die Hard"" franchise film? Just to say or write that have hated the film etc.? I saw exactly what I expected to see and I liked it. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Duro de Matar 4.0"" (""Die Hard 4.0"")"

Bruce Willis only gets sexier with age. Justin Long only gets more polite and wide-eyed at the wonder of it all. Together, they make a great pair. <br/><br/>The viewer is taken on a wild ride that really centers on one area: Washington, D.C. But within that area, there are trips up and down so many shafts (elevator and other), across airplanes in flight, hanging and climbing various ropes and cables, sliding away from numerous explosions, the action has to be quite inventive to keep the viewer from saying, 'Really? Weren't we just almost blown up 2 minutes ago?'<br/><br/>It works somehow - proving that editing, writing, direction, choreography, and camera angles can make you feel dizzy but not sick. Only the fiercest 'Die Hard' fans will love this (I do); it's too stimulating for the viewer who watches more rom-coms than thrill-packed action flicks. So good, though - like a strong cocktail. If you only ever sip wine, that will knock you on your a**."

"zkonedog","7","2","2","11 March 2017"," A Crisis Worthy Of John McClane
","Bruce Willis (and the Die Hard franchise he perpetuated) will always be judged next to the other famous action franchises of the 1980s, such as ""Rocky"", ""Rambo"", & ""The Terminator"". While all those series got re-booted in the 2000s, they also contained a heavy dose of nostalgia for the past. In ""Live Free or Die Hard"", however, it is ""full steam ahead"" with little time for remembrance.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Live Free"" sees John McClane (Willis) pulled into another tense criminal situation when villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) executes an event of cyber- terrorism severe enough to bring Washington to its knees. Along with ""hack-boy"" Matt Farrell (Justin Long), McClane sets out to find the perpetrators and bring them some 1980s-style justice.<br/><br/>This film really works primarily due to airtight direction & pacing. Director Len Wiseman never lets the pace flag whatsoever. When the action dies down, the wisecracks & humor ramps up. Suffice it to say that there is never a boring moment what with all the action, chases, explosions, technology, & typical Willis humor.<br/><br/>The main plot (""cyber-terrorism"") also serves to usher McClane into the 21st century. McClane's old-school justice provides a nice counterpoint to the tech-nerd played by Long (who is actually, on a rare occasion, watchable in this effort).<br/><br/>Actually, the only negative thing I can say about this movie is that I almost wished it would have harkened back to the themes of the original even perhaps a bit more. There is a subplot involving the daughter of McClane, but little more is mentioned (besides a few ""easter egg moments"") regarding the original Die Hard trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Live Free"" is a great addition to the Die Hard cannon (already better than parts two & three). For an action-oriented film, it really holds its weight."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","19","39","10 July 2007"," Live PG-13 or Die Soft
","A Die Hard 4 was discussed and thrown around for years. There was a point when Tears of the Sun was supposed to be Die Hard 4, with John McClane crashing a plane in the jungle and leading the survivors to safety through a war-zone. In my opinion, the series ended perfectly with the brilliant Die Hard With A Vengeance. After so many false starts it's been 12 years since we last saw John McClane. He was in his late 30s then, now he's in his early 50s. A lot has happened to Hollywood action films in that space of time. By that I mean they have lost their nerve and all of their edge.<br/><br/>Too often our summer movies are nothing but PG-13 crap, designed for the kiddies. Die Hard has always been a hardcore action series, it is a slap in the face and an insult to fans that this unnecessary fourth installment be aimed at an audience that was only 1-year old when the DHWAV was released and an audience that is STILL not old enough to see any of those movies in the first place.<br/><br/>But asides from that, LFODH has it's own problems that not even an R-rating could fix. First of all...Len Wiseman! Why the hell did Fox give this precious franchise to a man who has only directed two awful Underworld movies? Did they learn nothing from AVP when they gave hack Paul Anderson control? We all know what garbage that ended up being. Ironically surnamed Wiseman's style of direction just does NOT suit Die Hard. Gone is the naturalized cinematography of McTiernan and even Harlin. In it's place is a horrid low brightness/high contrast look that has been popular in this post-Michael Bay world. It makes the action and locations quite blurred and incoherent and it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the other movies. And what's with that silly font in the opening credits? DH2 and DHWAV didn't even have opening credits. Bruce Willis is the only alumni here. Not even any of the original producers are involved. This is not a Die Hard film. Aesthetically and spiritually, this is something completely different, and vastly inferior.<br/><br/>McClane, still a NYPD Detective, despite the ending of DHWAV (hints at alcoholism and being a suspect in the Federal Reserve raid) is sent to pick up computer wiz-kid Matt Farrell (Justin Long, who doesn't appear to be ageing) to help the NSA figure out why computer networks across the country are malfunctioning. Right away nameless baddies are onto them but McClane offs them no sweat. But not all of them, he foolishly leaves the main henchmen alive for some reason (to make more movie).<br/><br/>It turns out that shockingly unscary 'terrorist' Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Elephant) is behind the computer villainy and is out for revenge against the government for firing him after all the hard work he put in for them (just like Travis Dane in Under Siege 2). He's got the brains and the manpower to take the entire US network in to his vice-like grip and send the country back to the stone age. No one can find him since all of his equipment is packed onto a large moving vehicle to keep the signal's transparent and untraceable (just like Travis Dane in Under Siege 2).<br/><br/>Oh God...why did they not get someone else to play this character? Timothy Elephant clearly has no clue how to play a baddie. His idea of sounding threatening is to to move his lips around while talking but never actually opening his mouth. Ooooh...gee don't hurt me! And why Kevin Smith? This really was a step too far. This man doesn't belong in a Die Hard film, plain and simple. All this was was a wink at the audience and another excuse for him to plug Star Wars for the 86 millionth time. Wrong, just wrong! <br/><br/>The action scenes are mildly entertaining, but they are shot and cut with the usual post-Michael Bay confusion. You never really feel like your part of it or feel McClane's danger. And I am sick of Willis and Co. promoting this as 'old-school' with 'real stunts'. You can clearly tell that the majority of it is still crappy CGI. And the cop car/helicopter explosion is just too far-fetched, regardless of how much you can suspend your disbelief. Did a five-year-old write this? That kind of stunt may work fine when you're playing with your Matchbox cars but not in a Die Hard movie. <br/><br/>The lack of swearing didn't bother me too much. You can tell that they did have a lot of cussing in the original cut but were forced to loop some ADR over the top of it after studio pressure. This clearly means that there will be uncut DVD with some perverse title like 'The YipeeKayay Unrated Edition with hardcore footage THEY wouldn't let you see in cinemas'.<br/><br/>Marco Beltrami's score is also a total letdown. After his autopilot hack-job of Terminator 3, why did they let him have control of someone else's themes? The late Michael Kamen did some great stuff on the Die Hard movies but Beltrami only uses his fourth most reoccurring cue and ditches the rest, save for a cue from Die Hard 2.<br/><br/>To me, Die Hard finished in 1995. This film, which was only made to spark some life into a flopping career, is just a tame action film starring Bruce Willis. It's not Die Hard. This one definitely will NOT 'blow you through the back wall of the theatre'.<br/><br/>Oh...and Mr. Writer, if you paid any attention to the other movies you'd know that McClane's son is called John Jnr, not Jack. It seems like you don't know Jack actually."

This was consumerist America rearing its ugly head and saying ""thank you sir, may I have another"" to corporate Hollywood. This was not a film that should have been made. This was a banal cash-in by some studio execs counting on the national nostalgia about everything that happened in the 80's to come through for them, and like every other sad 80's exhumation, it seems to have paid off. I have lots of friends who still don't get why this is so bad. I rarely pay attention to movies this utterly horrible, but this one I did. Because I loved Die Hard and Die Hard with a Vengeance when I was a teenager. But this piece of trash was absolutely nothing like those movies. It had no plot, no backstory to any of the characters, including the main character, nothing whatsoever to link it to the other movies even for a desperate stab at borrowed value. It was, as the person who slept through most of the movie next to me said ""porn for action junkies"". And not even that good for porn."

The original Die Hard movies were great (not so much 2) because they were character driven action movies which were intense, over the top, and fun.<br/><br/>LFODH is flat out boring.

LFODH was obviously designed to be PG-13 from day 1 as John McClane is not John McClane. He is just an old guy that seems bored and doesn't cuss, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, etc.<br/><br/>However, I was hoping that besides the PC kid friendly rating that LFODH would be exciting and dumb popcorn fun. It was no where close. It was just PC and designed for complete morons.<br/><br/>As a standalone movie, LFOD would get an 4. As a Die Hard Sequel, the movie gets an 1.<br/><br/>My best advice is to rent or purchase Die Hard or Die Hard 3 and skip this one.

"bob the moo","Null","9","16","12 July 2007"," Great fun as a noisy summer blockbuster but perhaps too limited to stand the test of time outside of home court advantage
","Halfway through the summer of 2007 and I had still to see a blockbuster I really enjoyed. Fantastic Four 2, Ocean's 13, Shrek 3, Spiderman 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and others were OK at best and rubbish at worst and I had high hopes that Die Hard 4.0 (as it was called in the UK) would be the film that just remembered the fun and action that a solid summer blockbuster can deliver. Mostly, I'm happy to report, this is just what it delivers. Although it gets a bit bogged down as it moves forward, the narrative throws up loads of action and excitement, with noise and spectacle being the name of the game. Praising the film for being ""old school"" perhaps ignores the amount of CGI that it uses but it is true to say that the action feels remarkably ""real"" with stuntmen and real objects used to good effect.<br/><br/>The delivery is mixed but the first half of the film has some great moments of action that gets the blend of action, comedy and tension just right  the highpoint for me being the build-up and execution of the traffic being sent into the tunnel (the lights going out being a great trigger). After this (particularly from the scene in the powerplant onwards) the action remains overblown but it tends to lose a certain amount of tension due to the overblown nature of the action and narrative. This was to be expected because we are not given the control surroundings of the first two films or the focused action of the third but it is still a little disappointing to be sitting back watching the scale of the action, rather than really being into it.<br/><br/>For this reason I do feel that the film is unlikely to be viewed as kindly as it is being at present (time of release) and that the flaws across it will be exposed when it moved out of the summer period and into the homes of the audience. The narrative is one of the problems and I do agree with those that ask if this couldn't have been improved in the decade since the third film. The concept is good but it isn't really as smart as in other films where the robbery is a clever twist  here it doesn't quite work and really we are left with a chase movie. This is also why the first half of the film was more enjoyable for me, because McClane was the hunted  just like he was in the other films, albeit the hunted turning the tables. However in the second half he becomes the Terminator  an unstoppable pursuer. Yes, he hurts himself like McClane and spits blood, but it is hard to avoid the fact that he is the hunter and that he is essentially swatting aside anything that is put in his path to stop him. In this regard McClane becomes less relevant within his own film and I think it is understandable that some fans of the series are a bit let down by this.<br/><br/>The move away from this part of the series is minor though and is minor compared to the more obvious shift which saw Fox chasing a bigger audience and sacrificing content for it. With a PG-13 we are treated to a swear-free experience that even sees the catchphrase essentially dropped. Swearing itself is not something I miss but when it is replaced by bad lip-synching then it is annoying and it does make the whole film feel cheap. Again I am totally with the fans who wonder why the series they love was cheapened in an attempt to be marketable for the kiddie audience. Gabriel is not a great villain  he is a bit too one-dimensional and he is more Colonel Sanders than he is Hans Gruber.<br/><br/>Wiseman directs the action pretty well even if he loses it a little as the film goes on. The use of the score to link with the first film is always appreciated by me and the odd injoke was amusing even they were a bit clunky at times (we got the Agent Johnson bit  we didn't need it emphasised). Willis needed more material to work with because at times he does seem like he is asleep. I enjoyed his McClane performance with all that I expected from it, but he cannot find the urgency that he brought to the other films, perhaps because of his role as hunter. Long is a nice sidekick  he's no Jackson but he is enjoyable. Olyphant does his menacing stare well enough but offers little else. Q is a physical presence but she cannot bring much to the party beyond this. Winstead is an unwelcome addition to the film in my opinion. Her introduction makes for a slow start and her involvement in the action is unnecessary  McClane was already going after Gabriel, the additional motivation was not needed by him or by the audience, making her weak performance a distraction more than a bonus.<br/><br/>I have been negative here but I am just trying to think beyond the summer. However not all of what I applies at this time because, in the context of a summer of overly serious threequels and misfiring superheroes, Die Hard delivered just what I was looking for  noisy, enjoyable action spectacle. Yes, I found it disappointing in some regards but for what it does, it is noisy summer fun that should be seen for what it is."
"insidious420","6","17","35","30 June 2007"," Decent action movie, but not Die Hard
","""Live Free or Die Hard"" should've dropped the Die Hard name altogether and maybe gone with ""Live Free or Die Trying"". It's a pretty good action movie, with a few completely unbelievable scenes (literally), but it doesn't have the same feel to the characters or the action that every other Die Hard has. The action feels like something more out of a James Bond movie than Die Hard. This is just a quick summer movie sequel cash-in, further evidenced by the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>The villain's plan is interesting, but rendered laughable because of certain ways it is talked about and described in the movie. It feels like a toned-down, crazy, inferior alternate version of ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"". Honestly, 12 years should have been more than enough time to come up with a better sequel than this.<br/><br/>My biggest gripes with the movie, and things that would've made this feel like ""Die Hard"" if they were changed: * Weak villain, almost beats out the villain in DH2 in terms of lameness. * John McClane is only in the movie by name. Bruce Willis/Len Wiseman do nothing to bring the character back, other than including his daughter and: * Including, yet muddling the classic line, ""Yippee-kay-aye-mutha..."" * Completely ridiculous and implausible action scenes, especially the sequence with the F35. All other Die Hards had crazy action scenes, but all were plausible within the context of the film. This one requires complete suspension of disbelief."

"artfuldodger9","2","17","36","8 July 2008"," This wasn't a ""Die Hard"" film
","""Yippie Kai yay mother******"" doesn't make a movie ""Die Hard"". And certainly the character portrayed by Bruce Willis this time wasn't quite the same as Lt. John McClane. No, what we saw this time around - without the smart assing, without the wittiness, with the meandering plot and with the energizer-bunny-never-show-pain antics of Bruce Willis' character was a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. It's an ironic twist for a movie franchise that was created originally with the intention of the film being a sequel to Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"".<br/><br/>Indeed, this is a long way from Die Hard or it's other two sequels. The ""wrong place at the wrong time"" motif doesn't fit, nor does the new action standard ""Die Hard on a..."" In a skyscraper, in an airport, in New York, and now this is what? Stuck in traffic? ""In cyberspace"" doesn't apply as McClane isn't involved online. No, that's the villain's area of expertise. John's an analog guy in a digital world (evidence proved in his out-of-touchness during Die Hard 2). He's also a smart ass, a jerk, a sarcastic and scathing SOB as well as human. The character Bruce Willis portrays in this film is none of this. Even if this is supposed to be ""older"" John McClane, some things don't change as we age. <br/><br/>And yet, McClane changes greatly. A man who was shown to be human, who has been shown to suffer, a man who's shown frustration and anger and despair now shows none of these emotions. He bounces off blunt objects and never seems hurt. That's not John McClane and that's not even Bruce Willis. That's not even a caricature of the McClane character. That's Schwarzenegger. Watch John wheel around Matt Farrell (Justin Long's character) and tell me you don't have ""Terminator 2"" visions dance before your eyes as Ah-nold wheeled around Eddie Furlong.<br/><br/>And that's why I hate this film: Everything I was made to love about the character and the concept was stripped away. If it was a stand-alone movie with Bruce Willis in the lead, it would work... But this isn't Die Hard to me and the character isn't anything like John McClane. Die Hard set a new standard in action films -- while this one seems to go back to the previous standard and embrace what the 1980's pre-Die Hard action movies set out to accomplish.<br/><br/>""Yippie Kai yay mother..."" doesn't make John McClane, nor does flashing a wife beater t-shirt, bringing back a character missing since the original (Lucy McClane), or mentioning Holly. I wanted to see the grumpy bastard that is John McClane and instead, i got to see Len Wiseman and Bruce Willis bringing Ah-nuld's movie standard back to life."

"The_Void","8","6","10","9 July 2007"," A belated sequel that certainly doesn't disappoint!
","I have to say, I'm not usually a big fan of belated sequels to films made years ago - but I have to make an exception here as Die Hard 4 offers an amazingly good time and is surely the best of the sequels - possibly even the best Die Hard film period! The film is almost completely made up of relentless and heart pumping action sequences, and while it might not be life-affirming stuff, you wont care about much else while you're watching it - so it's safe to say that the third Die Hard sequel more than does it's job! As you would probably expect since this is the first Die Hard movie of this millennium, the plot this time round focuses on the internet. Most of the USA is controlled by computers, so naturally they find themselves with a big problem when someone hacks into the system and begins a 'fire sale' - in which all the essential elements of the USA (transport, communication, power etc) are systematically shut down to create confusion and chaos. Detective John McClane is dragged into this plot when he's sent to pick up a computer hacker wanted by the police.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved most about this film is the fact that it's just a straight action thriller and doesn't ever pretend to be anything that it isn't. There's no false patriotism or sentiment - it's all very straight up, just the way it should be! The film is directed by Underworld director Len Wiseman and it's clear that the man knows his way around an action sequence, as this film features plenty! The stunts involve all sorts from the standard trucks and cars to helicopters and fighter jets! It's not just the vehicles involved either that makes these scenes great to watch; someone has actually put some thoughts into them so they're not just merely the same old stuff. You've really got to hand it Bruce Willis too; he's 52 but fit as a fiddle and never looks out of place running round and fighting bad guys. He is joined by Justin Long, who is likable as the computer hacker who spends most of the movie running around with Willis, and Timothy Olyphant who is a surprisingly effective lead villain. Overall, so long as you don't go into Die Hard 4 expecting substance, there's no reason why this movie can't be enjoyed by all. Its pure action and entertaining throughout, and you really can't ask for any more than that! Just make sure that you see it in cinema."
"digitalbath_deftones","2","15","32","28 June 2007"," R.I.P. Die Hard
","I'm in no way a fan of summer blockbusters, but as something of an enthusiast of the Die Hard franchise, I was unable to resist Live Free or Die Hard. Suffice it to say, I was quite disappointed. The direction and screen writing were horrible; I'd be able to understand if this film was, say, a new xXx sequel (which I wouldn't have wasted my time with), but they were really out of place here. The stunts were alright, but simply weren't ""McClane"" enough to leave a lasting impression. The movie's one-liners, if that's what you would call them, were lame and transparent (this, however, didn't stop an unimaginative middle-aged man seated near me from gut-laughing at every remotely smart-ass remark that came out of Bruce Willis' mouth). Timothy Olyphant, whom I admired for his sociopathic enthusiasm in films like Go and Scream 2, played the film's antagonist as if he were a sheet of drywall. And while it could be said that Die Hard villains are known for their stale personalities, I was never convinced that Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel could be considered a serious threat to McClane. I also found it rather annoying to note that, in approximately every fourth or fifth scene, a character's lines would be overdubbed, most likely to save the movie from an R rating. This was an odd choice, considering how gratuitously violent and foul-mouthed the first three films of the series were. The most gratuitous this film gets is a bit part from Kevin Smith (whom I admire less and less with every passing year). Essentially all the excitement and suspense was given away in the trailer; what I was surprised at most was the fact that other members of the audience were audibly surprised that McClane blew up a helicopter with a car by using a toll booth as a ramp. Here's my bottom line: If you're a good, docile American, or if something as cerebral as V For Vendetta was outside your realm of understanding, you'll absolutely love this movie.<br/><br/>P.S. It would be silly to defend Len Wiseman by claiming that it would be unfair to compare Live Free or Die Hard with the first three Die Hard movies. If we weren't supposed to make that comparison, it would've been wise to leave the name John McClane out of this picture, don't you think?"

","I'm not particularly fond of action flicks but I really enjoyed the first Die Hard movie which has become a true classic and made John McClane an iconic character. I found the second one dumb and a real snoozer, and I thought the third one was okay (not as good as the first one, but still entertaining and rewatchable). I didn't have high expectations for the fourth instalment so it came as a genuine surprise to me how good Die Hard 4 turned out to be.<br/><br/>It basically follows the same tried-and-true formula, and yet it manages to bring in promising new characters (like Matt, the hacker or McClane's feisty daughter), clever twists, intense, original and amusingly over-the-top action, and expand on McClane's family story, as well. It is a smartly written, fast-paced fun ride from start to finish and the amount of money spent on it clearly shows on the screen. This time it's not only McClane who becomes utterly bruised and battered by the end, but a whole city. Bruce Willis is in top form, proving again McClane's role was tailor-made for him.<br/><br/>After the first viewing I ranked Die Hard 4 a close second in the series, and I enjoyed it just as much the second time, maybe even more. Good story, great thrills, great stunts, great visuals – a perfect popcorn action movie. Now that I think of it, it might be better than the first one. A rare achievement."

","At times one must look past the first installment to see the positives of a franchise, especially if there is a nineteen year gap. One must look past the old positives and negatives and form a new opinion based on the material presented. With that said, the fourth installment of the Die Hard franchise is a very decent film taking the viewer on a crazy action ride. Bruce Willis is still going at it, and for some reason he can never avoid terrorists, ever. This time the villain is a computer genius who wants revenge against the United States after being ignored. No, it is not the best plot of all time, but it makes up for that by having nonstop action and likable characters, which includes Justin Long, who fits his part well as the not very sharp computer kid. All in all it is an enjoyable flick with positives and negatives. It is worth a watch if you still enjoy extreme action and the computer subject matter that is involved."

","It's been 12 years since the last installment Die Hard With a Vengeance, and many would seriously doubt the validity of another John Mclane adventure. I was one of those who had serious reservations about Bruce Willis once again saving the day. Don't get me wrong though, I LOVE the Die Hard movies, but with new action characters popping up in the last few years (eg. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible trilogy and Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in the Bourne trilogy), I was under the impression that the 90's style action movie was a dying breed.<br/><br/>But trust Bruce Willis to bring that style into a new era along with the help of director Len Wiseman (director of the stylistic Underworld movies). Firstly, there are very few CGI shots, and that's kind of a Die Hard tradition. To make everything as real as possible. And it works. Secondly, the acting. Well, mr. Willis still has it. John Mclane is definitely his most recognizable character. And watching this movie, one gets the feeling of catching up with an old friend again. A friend though, who is constantly getting beat up yet always manages to put a smile on your face with his trademark one-liners.The rest of the cast are uniformly above average for an action movie spectacle of this nature, unfortunately my only real problem I had in this area (actually my only real problem with the movie as a whole) was the villain. Timothy Olyphant just doesn't have the menace and maniacal glee of Alan Rickman (Die Hard) or Jeremy Irons (Die Hard With a Vengeance).<br/><br/>That being said though, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's never going to be up for any Academy Awards, but you should know that when you watch a movie like this, you're looking for an action-packed thrill ride. So, think fast, look alive, Die Hard."
"neil-476","6","5","8","9 November 2007"," It all depends...
","See, I'm easily pleased. The old suspension of disbelief thing - I'll suspend mine at the drop of a hat. I'll go more than halfway to meet the filmmakers, they must love people like me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Die Hard 4.0. Quite a bit. Watched the UK DVD version with my wife, expanded to include more action and bad language.<br/><br/>It's only afterwards that I started to think, ""Hang on a bit..."" I guess there are some spoilery bits in what follows.<br/><br/>You expect some action sequences which step gingerly over the line of plausibility - the lift shaft in DH1, the 747 wing fight in DH2, the cable slide, outracing the flood etc. in DH3. So I could deal with launching a police car at a helicopter (although I, too, wondered whey none of the cars in the tunnel put their lights on - no Volvos?). But outracing the collapsing overpass in the articulated lorry, and dancing about on the Harrier, took such flying leaps over that line of implausibility that my wife and I sat there howling with laughter.<br/><br/>And I've got to say, I don't need swathes of foul language in order to enjoy a film. It doesn't upset or offend me especially, I just find it irritating that filmmakers think it's necessary when it isn't.<br/><br/>Good bits - I really liked Justin Long. Played nicely away from his customary nerd persona, had some edge, hit a note of credibility throughout. Good job. The attack on Justin Long's apartment was a good sequence. I liked the young Miss McClane, too, and I could envisage a Die Hard spin off franchise with these two in it. I thought the cyberplot was credible (and I recall the traffic chaos taking place in Turin in the original Italian Job many years ago, so I was quite prepared to believe that) although I too would have liked to know what the end purpose was - that kind of got overlooked. And I liked Maggie Q - I thought her fight scenes were very good, and she had an element of hard-faced relentlessness to her which was a strong plus.<br/><br/>Not-so-good bits? Maybe the character Willis played in Unbreakable was John McClane in disguise - you can bruise him, cut him, make his vest dirty, but you can't kill him. This is OK up to a point, but there were some ordeals he went through which were so outrageous that they didn't convince. And when he fired that shot - through his collarbone, it appeared to me - which then killed Timothy Olyphant, I was a little surprised to find him up and quipping about 10 minutes later.<br/><br/>Why did the gas in the gaspipes explode? I can understand Timothy Olyphant killing the hackers who'd freelanced the work which hacked into the national infrastructure - stops the powers that be tracing him - but why did he kill the ones who were still working for him? Lots of plot holes which needed filling.<br/><br/>So it's a romp if you're not terribly demanding, but it shortchanges you fairly comprehensively if you're at all inclined towards being critical."

The story, muddle-headed as it is, just makes you shake your head mostly.<br/><br/>As for the action, it's reasonable enough, but hampered by a 13 rating it was never going to have the grit and gore of the earlier films. That said, there are some original scenes (the car into helicopter one, for example) but mostly its tired old stuff we've seen before (and done better) in other movies. The jet attacking vehicles on the freeway seems to have been lifted mostly from True Lies. Our hero even ends up on top of the jet just like Arnie did in True Lies.<br/><br/>Later there was the scene where nobody driving in a suddenly darkened tunnel remembered that their cars had lights..nonsensical junk, but again, I gritted my teeth and, like McClaine, soldiered on. Sadly, thence came the jet scene and my heart sank, accompanied by an uncontrollable rise in my indignation.<br/><br/>And whilst I mention the jet/freeway scene it is with continuing regret that I have to inform you that scriptwriters continue to ignore anything remotely like common sense when writing scenes. Just like with MI:3, here they put a high-tech warmachine into a situation it blatantly doesn't have to be in to accomplish its task. At one point the jet (is the F35 even in service yet?) hovers down and under the freeway to get at its target. Who would have thought a semi-trailer rig would be so difficult to hit? I'd detected the seeds of ""Hollywoodism"" much earlier on in the movie, what with the standard portrayal of anything to do with hacking being colourful 3D graphics and more screens than a Benidorm beach in high summer. But I'd gritted my teeth, snorted in derision and continued to watch anyway, hoping that was the worst of it.<br/><br/>A great franchise was ruined by this movie because of the idiocy of scene-writers and the greed of the studios.<br/><br/>Luckily for me however, the movie is already fading to a dim memory. It wasn't really that memorable anyhow.<br/><br/>RIP...Die Hard."

","I was seriously looking forward to this fourth instalment of the Die Hard movies as the previous three had always lived up to, and in many cases exceeded my expectations. How could this long awaited sequel ever fail to impress? Well, in the first instance I didn't believe the threat. The main bad guy was no Hans Gruber and, unlike Rickman and Irons, he in no way managed to portray the menacing, twisted, psychopath required to perpetrate such an evil deed. Secondly, I didn't believe the action. Despite his ageing physique, John McClane has gone from ""hard as nails"" tough guy to indestructible superhero. However, in the context of this film he would need to as most of his adversaries seem pretty indestructible too. Ninja moves might make you an excellent opponent in hand to hand combat but I'm not sure they would protect you from being driven through several brick and glass walls on the bonnet of a car. Yes, by the nature of the genre, the stunts are inevitably far fetched but on this occasion they take suspension of disbelief to the doorstep of children's fantasy fiction.<br/><br/>This is a movie on par with Terminator 3. Definitely watchable, with a half decent story and plenty of over the top action that would justify a weekend rental. Unfortunately, it is paled by its predecessors."
"astrocalder","2","41","105","1 July 2007"," Don't be fooled, it was a crap movie
","How did this ever get an 8.3? My guess is they paid off people to write a good review, as many people (such as myself) check the IMDb review before they see it. It was really, really bad. On many levels. Let me explain. Action movies are like fast food. If you take them for what they are, and you're in the right mood, it can be kind of good. Really hit the spot. You leave feeling satisfied. You wouldn't want it every night, but now and then it can be better than some meals. Die Hard 4 was like... a microwave burrito, that comes in a fancy package. You pay extra for what you think will be the best burrito ever, and in the end it's frozen, bland, and makes you regret eating it. Here's why - 1. Story - bad. Just bad. They tried to be serious with some post 9-11 themes, then tried to go over the top with the action. That never works. 2. Dubbing - for whatever reason, it seems like 40% of the dialogue was not synced. This means 1 of 2 things - either they had to change a lot of the dialogue to keep a PG-13 rating, or they realized it wasn't working, and made some drastic cuts, then dubbed it later to link it all together. Or both. It felt disjointed and half-assed. 3. Action - I heard they didn't use CG. There was more CG in this one than all of the others combined. It was so over the top. I don't mind over the top action, but you need to establish early on that it'll be that kind of movie. Hovering jet vs. truck. A room with a random meat grinder in the floor (I swear to god - what is this, a Nintendo game?) A movie like ""True Lies"", which is kind of tongue-in-cheek works - this didn't work at all. I've seen better action in a Chuck Norris movie. 4. - Locations - look at the earlier ones - skyscraper, airport/old church, NYC/freighter. This one was all over the place. They drove to Viriginia, DC, Baltimore (I think), and it was all random gas factories, some underground Social Security Administration building (with aforementioned meat grinders), other drab and meaningless places. They drive here and there. ""Oh, we need to talk to... he's near here in Baltimore, let's go!"" etc. <br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities were some hard hits you expect from a Die Hard movie. When Mclane kills the bad guys, he really kills them. He does kick some ass in this one. But in the end, without a story to make it work in, even that won't cut it. I was totally bored and considered walking out halfway through. It's the kind of movie that leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth, making you realize you just spent 2 hours and $12.75 for what amounts to... a microwave burrito."
"tedg","Null","8","15","29 June 2007"," Back to Come Forward
","I think there must be a craft in Hollywood, a guild of stunt designers. Presumably they used to be stuntmen and explosives gurus. But now they must be more like writers and production designers. Half of this movie has nothing to do with Willis or the story, That half is the stunts, and they are designed to be overtly retro, both in what they actually are and the tone of how we see them. This has to be enough, and for me it marginally was. <br/><br/>That's not because they were good  they were typical in wow factor. But that they were designed with reference in mind. Those first scenes in the Bond films were this way too: the stance, the historical placement was as well considered as normal dramatic qualities. Stunts had arrived; now they can have irony, self-reference, temporal semiotics. <br/><br/>But there's a second half of this movie too. The Willis character isn't in either half; he's irrelevant. In previous films we see him as haunted. Its a cartoonish haunting of family and self-worth. Here, there's none of that, no ""everyman."" <br/><br/>The second half is the computer assault. (You should know that I know how much of this computer infrastructure really is put together.)<br/><br/>What we have here is something that (except for cell phones) uses notions and even devices at the ""data center,"" that come from 1988. Its incredibly dated, even more unsophisticated than that Sandra Bullock thing, ""The Net."" Its retro, just like the stunts. Its a risky decision; I think it works. More important to me is that they can design something like this. Horror movies do it all the time, but they don't do it with double-skips: Skipping back to see how they would have skipped forward.<br/><br/>Its just the sort of design ethic that the Willis character had in the first one, which also was the first summer action blockbuster. Its that work at the action, then wink bit.<br/><br/>Fitting into that skip forward is casting of the ""I'm a Mac"" guy as the main hacker, and the skip back of Kevin Smith as the secondary one.<br/><br/>This might mean something important when we see it in a real movie, this engineering of time stance.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","3","4","29 December 2019"," Defending Die Hard 4.0 a modern solid perfect underrated action packed flick
","Me defending this flick, Die Hard 4.0 in my country or Live Free or Die Hard in US come out in 2007. There is an unrated version of this film, but I have never seen it before. I saw only theatrical version on my Blu-ray disc I don't have both of the cuts in my country. This is the fourth sequel in a ""Die Hard"" franchise. It is a sequel to Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995). Directed by Len Wiseman and returns Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane. This film did had some problems than the first three Die Hard films had, but still it does feel to me like a Die Hard film!<br/><br/>Is it better than Die Hard (1988) or Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)? No! it is not better than those two masterpieces. But to me it is better than Die Hard 2 (1990) I put this film above Die Harder, this is my opinion. I love this film to death! It is my third favorite Die Hard film and my personal favorite action film in my top 15 favorite action films. I am huge, big fan of Die Hard and Die Hard: With a Vengeance after Die Hard 3 ended it was my wish to get another Die Hard movie another great sequel like Die Hard 4.0. It has been talked in many years. Before this movie come out, I know a lot of facts and no I did not take this facts from IMDb trivia. Bruce Willis hated returning to his iconic role John McClane. I read it online in 2004 that Willis stated that his character John McClane should be killed off and been dead forever. In other interview Willis claimed that his character is a retired cop. Bruce Willis did not want to make the fourth Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>The plot: For the fourth film, It was for years in talk that McClane would be on a holiday with his estranged daughter or son in some hotel and terrorist would take over the hotel and his daughter or son would be a hostage again. Britney Spears really wanted the role of Lucy McClane because she was a fan of Bruce Willis, but she was rejected. I was disappointed when I found out that US actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead was cast instead Britney Spears. Originaly 20 Country Fox wanted John McTiernan back as the director for this film, but at the time McTiernan was in prison so they had to find a replacement and director that know his job well was hired Len Wiseman who come on board. This was the third film that Len Wiseman directed and he did a solid job. Before this movie, he only directed Underworld (2003) and Underworld: Evolution (2006) with Kate Beckinsale in the lead role.<br/><br/>To me this is a best action film from 2007 it is a modern action film, my personal favorite action film of all time, it works it is a bad-ass fourth sequel. Bruce Willis is still John McClane fighting cyber internet terrorists in a old school fashion. Die Hard 4.0 is more basic Die Hard movie by the book beacuse in the book his daughter was the hostage not his wife. This movie completely goes by the book, the way it was written by Roderick Thorp's novel Nothing Lasts Forever (1979). Die Hard 4.0 is based on a different novel ""A Farewell to Arms"" by John Carlin. I enjoy this movie much more than Die Hard 2, the pacing is much better, the action is great, is much better to me and even the plot is better than in Die Hard 2, it is perfectly executed. I know Len Wiseman hates the color, he was forced to shoot with digitally camera the colors and the scens, to me the colors look fine and I don't mind it. Maggie Q is a bad-ass as Mai Linh second henchman and girlfriend to Thomas Gabriel. She is not better than Karl (Alexander Godunov) but she was better than Sam Phillips as Katya. Because Mai Linh kicked McClane's ass. She was sexy, hot and gorgeous babe. I really love her. Bruce Willis is great again as always as Detective John McClane he fits his role perfectly and reprise his iconic role great. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy Gennero-McClane did a fine job, I like her. I love the Pictures and the actions. Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel the villan did a good job I love his villain. Timothy Olyphant was excellent I buy him as a bad-guy. Cliff Curtis as FBI Deputy Director Miguel Bowman was great I love his character. Cliff Curtis was 5 years earlier the villain bad-guy in Collateral Damage (2002) Schwarzenegger movie, it is good to see him a good guy in here. Justin Long as Matthew 'Matt' Farrell was great as Young hacker helping McClane out. I love his character he was decent. When McClane told him that he doesn't need him anymore, Farrel insist to help him out. I love the bond between McClane and Farrel. Kevin Smith is in this movie as Frederick ""Warlock"" Kaludis and he is decent in this movie, I love him. Christina Chang as Taylor FBI agent is great I love her! I wish Christina Chang would be more in the movie and she would have much more to do. Mark Bomback and David Marconi wrote a solid decent script for the movie that really worked kudos to them. I love the music score by Marco Beltrami who replaced Michael Kamen who did a music score for the first three Die Hard movies. Sadly Michael Kamen past away and he couldn't come back for making the music score for the fourth installment of Die Hard film. Even with PG-13 this movie works as an action film, it has tones of action in it.<br/><br/>The movie is about a cyber- internet terrorists killing hackers. Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) gets a job to pick up a Young hacker name Matthew ""Matt"" Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to FBI headquarters to Washington D.C. after McClane does his job, a team of professional mercenaries attacks McClane and Farrell. McClane soon finds out his new witness is a target and whole US country is now a target. A team of cyber-terrorists are shutting down the United States government. Now McClane has to become one-man army once again against a team of terrorists with the help of his Young hacker friend Matthew Farrell, McClane has to fight these terrorists. While dealing the facts that his estranged daughter is one of the hostages again.<br/><br/>My favorite scene would be in the tunnel McClane drives a police car, jumps off the car and crashes the car in to the chopper of the bad-guys. Insanly but seriously great action scene practical done, I have seen in the film. Practical explosive, Willis still acts as McClane. The finale is better when McClane kills 2 bad-guys saves his daughter and says his famous lines. Die Hard 4.0 is to me much better fast paced, entertaining modern action flik miles way better than Seagal's Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995). Live Free or Die Hard should have ended the franchise, it perfectly ended. We did not need A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) with John Moore as the director and we don't need another prequel this sequel ened the Die Hard Franchise perfectly! I love this film to death, I love the songs played in this film. It is a perfect action film, does not deserve the hate! This is my review and I defended a solid modern perfect action film from 2007 everyone was great in here!"
"darthgeekhi","7","3","4","11 August 2017"," Best Die Hard Sequel
","It's Independence Day weekend. Flags are waving, National Anthems are being sung. It's a country-wide holiday. And ex-Department of Defense programmer Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) plans on cutting the celebration short by cutting off America, electronically. Hackers nationwide are being taken in by the FBI to find connections to this breakdown. One hacker in particular, Matthew Ferrell (Justin Long) gets a knock on his door, and it's none other than New York police detective John McClane (Bruce Willis). Ferrell tries to lead McClane astray from his apartment, when suddenly, hit men strike, and McClane is forced to kick some ass yet again. McClane and Ferrell eventually escape, and begin a national journey to find Thomas Gabriel, take him down, and end his hacker regime.<br/><br/>Live Free Or Die Hard has taken the series to the largest scale than ever before. The first took place in a singular building, the second an airport, the third a city, and the fourth, an entire nation. At this point, I don't know if Die Hard could dial back the scale again without it seeming weaker in its spectacle, though the original movie did have the smallest scale. I appreciate the scale, though it makes it seem unlike a Die Hard movie, as the others have taken place over the course of a single day. However, I won't say I don't appreciate the scale it brings to Die Hard. It's fresh, and finally decides to take Die Hard in another direction.<br/><br/>The villain is certainly a good threat, but I don't think he's as memorable as, say Hans Gruber from the first film or Simon Gruber from the third film. He is a passable villain. In terms of the concept, I really like it. John McClane, unfortunately, would be useless now due to his lack of knowledge for computers or technology in general. This film proposes that if tech did fail, modern cowboy McClane would be the only one to save the day. The plot is certainly not the most intelligent, and has many lapses in logic, but I forgive it because of it's popcorn movie feel, which was not (At least I would argue) as potent in Die Hard With A Vengeance, save for a few select scenes. I appreciate the third installment trying to be fresh and new, but I don't think entertainment in an action movie franchise such as Die Hard should be sacrificed for a hard-hitting plot. I could even argue that the plot of the first film isn't the greatest an action movie can do. This movie knows it's not very witty or smart, so it makes up for it in being a fun popcorn movie. The messages in this movie are important, but not in the context of the film. In fact, the movie is based on an article, which, unless you use Die Hard for your daily source of social commentary, you should read, because it explains it better than this movie. It's ultimately a dumb action movie, so sub textual stuff like that doesn't land.<br/><br/>John McClane is great in this movie. He feels fresh off where the series left off, even within a twelve year difference, ready to quip, kick ass, and save the day. And he delivers the lines and action with conviction, which most older action stars fail to do. I feel the character of Matthew Ferrell is bashed too much. He's a nice, fun, modern character who actually brings something to the duo dynamic with John McClane, unlike Zeus from With A Vengeance, who was just another tough dude. The interplay between McClane and Ferrell is fun, and I enjoy Long in the role. The side characters are pretty forgettable, save for the ninja girl or Kevin Smith. The acting is good, passable for an action movie.<br/><br/>The movie is quickly paced, and doesn't stay in one place for long, which keeps the movie within the Die Hard pace. Though it takes place over more than one day, the pacing is quick so it almost feels like a day. It's a quick, fun watch.<br/><br/>Addressing its PG-13 rating, it is a shame for a Die Hard movie to stoop low enough to give itself a PG-13 just for the market. I think people would've seen it if it was R anyway. This sequel had a long time coming, and Die Hard is pretty much a big franchise in Hollywood. I don't like the fact that they cut off the latter part of the infamous ""Yippie - Ki - Ya"" line. I feel like Fox should've given some leeway, because that line is almost a centerpiece of the movies, something you wait for. But, the action feels R-rated, and I don't dislike the movie because of its softening.<br/><br/>Live Free Or Die Hard, whether bashed for its unfaithfulness or differences from the rest of the movies, I don't feel can be denied as a good Die Hard movie, or a good movie in general. Lest we forget that the first 30 minutes of With A Vengeance wasn't even a Die Hard movie. It was ripped from a script called Simon Says, and those first 30 minutes of the movie are better than the rest. Live Free Or Die Hard is a fun return to form for the franchise, and the best sequel."

","When the FBI Cyber Crimes Division is hacked its director orders the arrest of a large number of hackers; New York detective John McClane is ordered to pick up one, Matt Farrell, and drive him to Washington DC. The action starts almost as soon as McClane gets to Farrell's flat somebody wants Farrell dead. They manage to get away and drive the Washington but that isn't the end of the problems; the people who hacked the FBI have now hacked the nation's transport systems and it is clear they have further plans. Farrell claims that these actions are part of a 'fire sale'; a scheme to attack all aspects of the country's infrastructure prior to deleting all financial records an action that would inevitably cause chaos. McClane and Farrell set off to hunt down the cyber-terrorists before they can fully execute their plan a plan that is complicated when the terrorists capture McClane's daughter.<br/><br/>I had heard this film referred to as 'Die Hard Four point Less' which is rather cruel as it is actually a solid action movie; I suspect it would have had a better reception if it hadn't been part of the 'Die Hard' franchise it works as a stand-alone film. The action starts early and is fairly relentless until a couple of minutes before end. There are numerous shootouts, car crashes, a helicopter crash, an F-35 attacking a lorry and destroying a highway bridge before crashing and even a fight in a car which is dangling in a lift shaft! Of course it isn't very believable but there isn't time to worry about such details as there is so much going on. Bruce Willis still has what it takes to be believable as McClane and Maggie Q impresses as one of the terrorists; it is just a pity she is killed of half way through leaving Timothy Olyphant as the main villain; he isn't bad but isn't memorable in the way Alan Rickman was in the first film. Overall I'd say this wasn't a classic but it was a good solid 'brain in neutral' action movie which I enjoyed more than I expected."

Well Die Hard 4 out does all of them many, many, many times over. It is the single dumbest film in the history of cinema. I even include all future films in that statement, as it simply isn't possible that anything this monumentally stupid could ever be made again. I'm still a bit slack-jawed in amazement as to quite how insanely silly it is, with the various things he does with ""computers"" it would have made more sense if they'd made the villain a magician, like an evil-Gandalf."

","And who could have thought of seeing the ""Die Hard"" franchise entering in the 21st Century. It took some time (12 years to be exact) to create a good and relevant plot destined to make a good follow up to one of the most beloved action films and characters of all time, John McClane, greatly played by Bruce Willis. With three outstanding films behind it, the fourth installment doesn't disappoint. However, it's quite soft if put along with the trilogy, this got an PG-13 rating rather than the usual R, so this might upset the hardcore fans of this great franchise.<br/><br/>McClane's challenge here involves technology, to use it in his favor or to be used by it as his antagonist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) uses it to shut down the whole operative system of the United States, in what hackers call as ""fire sale"". As his sidekick McClane protects a young and rebel hacker (Justin Long) who might be of help in trying to figure what's going on with those attacks.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is very fun to watch. One can respect and admire Len Wiseman's style of direction and his ability to coordinate impressive action sequences like rare films tend to present these days. But he's not John McTiernan, responsible for the two best ""Die Hard"" films, combining violent and thrilling moments with powerful loads of humor. As said earlier, this ""Die Hard"" is too soft for its own sake, too CGI oriented. Even so, Wiseman is best while moving this then directing the blasé ""Underworld"" series.<br/><br/>Is this a good return for McClane/Willis? Yes, it is! The perfect hero for this kind of plot. Old-fashioned. troublemaker and with his powers reduced in the strict sense of his job (then an detective; now he's an street police officer), McClane finds himself once again in the chaos, this time provoked by Gabriel, who took down the country's energy and all the systems that moves everything, controlling all the communication along with his team of experts that includes an deadly fighter (Maggie Q), and their plan to steal billions of dollars. The task is huge; it's no longer present on a building or an airport or a city; it's a whole nation to look after and a bad guy hidden somewhere, behind powerful technologies and machinery McClane does not know. To John, it's a good way to prove he's not too old for the job; to Willis is an interesting way to explore new boundaries, to show the great hero getting a little tired of his function, questioning what being a hero truly means. He loses in humor but gains plenty in drama. An admirable trade. <br/><br/>The action? Breathtaking as usual such as McClane taking down a helicopter by using a car; the chase with a military plane trying to hit a truck conducted by the hero; the shootout at the hacker's house; and the ending (oh that memorable ending!) among others.<br/><br/>If compared with the others ""Die Hard"" this is a little weak; let alone it's an exciting and fun movie. Who can resist to this franchise and the unforgettable ""Yippie-Kay-Yay, Mother(beep)? 10/10"

","The news that another Die Hard movie was on the way was met with the usual howls of derision that greets such developments. Coming almost twenty years after Die Hard had bench-marked the action genre, and twelve years after Die Hard With A Vengeance divided the critics, it smacked of being a money making cash cow. Upon release, Die Hard 4 (lets keep it simple eh?) not only had the critics unsure as to its worth, but also the franchise's fans. Many felt it was a pointless exercise that saw Bruce Willis' John McClane watered down for the new millennium. Embracing an internet driven plot (based on John Carlin's digital warfare based ""A Farewell To Arms"") it was clear the makers were indeed updating McClane's tough as nails cop, but Die hard 4 is far from being the embarrassment many thought it would be. With subsequent revisits, now the dust has settled, showing it to be an explosive and hugely entertaining piece of action fluff. <br/><br/>The plot basically sees terrorist types attempt to bring the U.S. to its knees by way of cyber war, yep it's hacker warfare folks. Enter McClane who is around the area trying to rebuild a relationship with his estranged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Asked to go and collect an under threat good guy hacker (Justin Long as Matt Farrell) McClaine and his unwitting sidekick soon come under attack from the nasty baddies led by Timothy Olypahant's smarmy Gabriel. On the run they go, the tough no nonsense cop and the computer-literate geek (see what they did there?) and then things get personal, very personal. <br/><br/>Len Wiseman directs and fills out the picture with truly fantastic stunts and set pieces. Most modes of transport are given an explosive part in proceedings. Be it a chopper, a truck, a jet, cars or an elevator, they are either aiding our intrepid heroes or naturally hindering them. And in some cases even being used as weapons of mass destruction! Willis quips away with the usual McClane cheekiness and with the affable and wise-cracking Long playing off him to good effect, it makes for over two hours of unadulterated popcorn fun. All of which of course is played out amongst the rather scary concept of Virtual Terrorism. You have to believe that John McClane is the hardest man on the planet, but really he is you know! So although the vest may be absent, McClane is still someone not to be messed with, and that can never be a bad thing really. 7.5/10"

","Yeah I know it's a Die Hard movie but there was nothing that interesting about the plot and the action sequences were pedantic, and even for a Die Hard film bloody, foolishly, do you think audiences are thick? Impossible. <br/><br/>The characters were underdeveloped and some of them thrown in for no good reason. The ending was a let down (I will not spoil it but needless to say for a Die Hard film WTF?}<br/><br/>It seems that Bruce Willis did not have his heart in the character of John Mclane. His performance was ho hum compared to the rest of the series. Many other characters were similarly one dimensional. <br/><br/>Easily the worst in the series. I gave it a five because Die Hard action fans might like it but there are better films of the genre."
"colinbarnard-1","6","10","20","28 June 2007"," A Good Film for the Times, But a Disappointment for the Ages
","I so wanted to be entertained by the return of John McLean. Die Hard, the original, has recently been named as the best action film of all time. There are many reasons why this seminal film from 1987 is so well regarded. The humour, the sociopolitical subtext, the characters across a broad range of bit parts, Bruce Willis, non-digital special effects, and Alan Rickman as one of the best villains in cinematic history.<br/><br/>I can't say the same for this Michael Bey-ish, blow-em-up opus. I should have been warned when I read that McLean's trade-mark scatology had been looped out to attract the teen-aged, Transformers set. That was the source for much of the original's humour. What we are left with is the ""action"" scenes.<br/><br/>The plot has the potential to be something topical, but again, it exists to set up the action sequences, rather than the other way around. We get some up-close-and-personal gun and fist fights, but by and large, the focus is on the big boom, whether it is a car flying through the air to take down an in-flight helicopter, a gas line feeding back to blow up most of the eastern seaboard, or, most incredulously, an F-35 strafing a tractor-trailer as the plane simultaneously destroys an above-ground expressway. Preposterous.<br/><br/>The original understood that successful action films use the believable mayhem to ratchet up the tension, the anticipation for what is to come. So, the action serves the plot, rather than being purely gratuitous. In ""Live Free"", it is almost purely gratuitous.<br/><br/>""Live Free"" is most definitely a film for the times: a calculated effort cynically devoid of artistry designed to make money for a studio (Fox? Cheyanne?) that cares about nothing else. Go see ""Smokin' Aces"" for an example of a low-budget film that does what the original ""Die Hard"" did nearly 20 years ago. Your heart and your pocketbook will feel better for the effort."
"SuperUsher","8","10","20","26 June 2007"," Live Free or Die Hard
","First of all, let me just say I've only seen the first and third Die Hard movies. I thought the first one was great. With a Vengeance was pretty good. I never have gotten around to seeing the second one, but I'm pretty sure I've not heard anything great about it. So, where does that put me with Live Free or Die Hard? I'll say that it's on par with the first one. Not as good, but not very far behind.<br/><br/>For anyone who is concerned about the PG-13 rating, don't be. This movie is just as brutal if not more brutal than the past Die Hard films. There's plenty of violence, and I'm frankly kind of shocked that this didn't receive an R rating. Bottom line, the only thing that you're missing because of the PG-13 is a bunch of F bombs from John McClane. To me, that's not a big deal.<br/><br/>The action is just crazy. Though some of the stunts are silly and unrealistic, keep in mind that this is a summer action movie. The fight scene between McClane and Mai, played by the sexy Maggie Q, is just awesome and had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Now, I think Timothy Olyphant is awesome and I've enjoyed him in the movies I've seen him in, but he doesn't do anything spectacular in this. He's just a dry, boring villain by the name of Thomas Gabriel in my opinion. I was disappointed with him because he's one of my favorite actors and he wasn't that great in this.<br/><br/>Then again, eating my own words, this is a summer action movie and the villain is not meant to be spectacular. He's just a villain.<br/><br/>Kudos go to Justin Long. I like this guy, and I think he has tremendous potential. He really holds his own next to Willis as Matt Farrell, a computer hacker who may have played a part in a cyber-terrorist attack.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lucy McClane. And of course she gets kidnapped by Gabriel. I was disappointed that she didn't have much to do in this, because she is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a fun movie to watch without having to use too much brain power. A nice way to bring John McClane back."
"Tobbes","7","9","18","2 July 2007"," John McClane is there, but does he die hard?
","In short, not really. This however is absolutely not Bruce Willis' fault. He is working really hard to show that John McClane is very much alive and kickin', but his surroundings fail in so many ways you almost feel sorry for the effort Willis puts in. The story is quite alright with not too many plot holes for this kind of movie, so not much to complain in that department. The supporting cast however give more than enough reason to complain. Timothy Olyphant delivers a really weak performance as the main bad guy. Though it may be not his fault, because he's really got not much to work with. Most of the time he's making faces while talking angrily into a web cam. Oooh, scary. Then there is his main henchman, who is supposedly a french guy, and, to fill the current cliché, is quite adept in parcours. This one was really annoying, because during the run of the story he survives explosions, car crashes, falls from high buildings and being smashed into rigid objects at 50 mph. So McClane's fighting superman this time, huh? It's obvious that they tried to fill Karl's shoes from the first movie, but they failed. All the other characters look really pale and weakly developed in comparison to previous installments of the franchise, sidekicks included. The last thing that I did not like in this movie is are some of the action scenes. Sure, they are huge and they had to do something with the budget they had. But does it look like a ""Die Hard"" movie? Most of the time not. The action in many scenes is so far over the top, that it evokes more of a ""yeah, right"" than a ""wow"" feeling. Especially the fighter plane sequence comes to mind here.<br/><br/>So, what's the verdict? Is it unwatchable? No, certainly not. There were times when I had a lot of fun watching the movie. Is it a good movie? No, there are too many flaws for that. But it's not horrible either. And most importantly: is it a die hard movie? Sometimes. Willis IS McClane, which makes up for a good part of mediocre things in this movie, but the ""Die Hard"" feeling has faded a lot since parts 1 & 2 (and 3 for that matter, which was not so great also).<br/><br/>I give 6 out of 10."
"rajdoctor","5","9","18","30 June 2007"," Live Free or Die Hard 4.0
","I loved Die Hard  Part 1, and then came part 2 and 3; which I think were not as good as part one. After 12 years this is Die Hard  Part 4, most probably the last one! Before I outline the story let me tell you that the movie is not in the usual cinema print format. It is in computer  high graphics digital format. And it shows in high contrasts and sharper lines, which is not so good visually. <br/><br/>The story is - BruceWillis as John McClane has aged with a grown up daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth) who hates her dad. A former FBI guy Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) strikes terror on USA through his computer / IT skills  and brings USA to standstill by attacking all major computer operated networks. The main aim is to get access to the Social Database so that he can bankrupt USA by then transferring all bank savings. There is one wiz kid Matt Farrell (Justin Long) who, after being part of the hacking team, survives (Thomas kills all the other geeks). Now it is the responsibility of John McClane to bring Matt to FBI office. Thomas captures Lucy and John goes behind him with his dare devil stunts and one liners to rescue his daughter and USA.<br/><br/>The movie is full of mind-less action from beginning till end. The actions have become bigger. The settings from Die Hard 1 (which were indoors) have grown to outdoors. Bruce Willis has more deadly falls and beatings than before. Justin Long has overacted throughout as computer geek (may be some of them are like that in real life too!) The bad guy Timothy suddenly (as all bad guys in movies do) become morons in the end, the ones who no longer remain deadly and can not think straight.<br/><br/>I was reminded of 1970s Bollywood movies, where the villain would always capture a family member / friend of the hero (in this movie both are captured) but does not kill anyone of them, instead talks with them till the villains are killed by our hero.<br/><br/>The action is visually great to see  it is just mayhem. Throughout the movie, the face of Bruce Willis often becomes clean of blood stains and the stains re-appear and disappear now and then.<br/><br/>The young Director Len Wiseman has handled the huge responsibility quite aptly in taking such a big project  with just a little experience in Directing (2 movies). His former experience of art department (Independence day, Godzilla, Men in Black) shows in the sets and scale.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good action film. Great viewing for the Die Hard fans! (Stars 5.5 out of 10)"
"burnett33160","4","9","18","27 June 2007"," No character (no spoilers)
","One of the things that made the original Die Hard so great was, in addition to exceptionally intense action scenes, the character arc, John Mcclane was (as opposed to the typical action hero) a man with low self-regard, he feels emasculated by his wife's career, his kids now live three thousand miles away.He finds himself trapped in a situation way beyond what he feels he can handle alone, but in being forced to deal with it he redeems himself in his own eyes and matures to the point where he no longer feels threatened by his wife's independence. This character arc is part of what makes Die hard a successful story. <br/><br/>Live free or die hard has none of this, there are a few throwaway lines that pass for an attempt at character, but mostly all you get is action ( granted some of the action scenes are very visceral as in the first film, others are generic and have been seen in many other films) without a human story. <br/><br/>So why go to all the trouble of making another entry into the series after twelve years without telling a story about people? The answer is i don't know. If you're looking for a worthy sequel to Die Hard, the third entry was far stronger."

","This was an excellent film. I had the pleasure to see it on its release night in Jacksonville, Florida. The whole audience loved it, and no one went away angry or disillusioned.

Along the way, John's daughter is kidnapped and Matthew falls for her.<br/><br/>I especially liked seeing Kevin Smith as the head computer geek, Warlock, a fat lazy guy (which Smith seems to play in films). In all, it was an awesome movie that just well may surpass ""Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995)"" in popularity.<br/><br/>It may not connect that much at all with the first three, but thats what makes this a great film.

What interests the filmmakers nowadays is the use of spectacular special effects rather than simply narrating a cool story.

","I can't believe the scores this film is getting.<br/><br/>The whole film felt like it was hacked apart in the edit suite - conversations ended abruptly, scenes seemingly spliced together so that one minute the geek hacker is freaking out, the next the two heroes are chewing the fat as if nothing extraordinary had happened that day. Scenes didn't flow. They just happened.<br/><br/>Some of the greenscreen work was really bad. Especially all the stuff in the car interiors - you could anticipate the lorry hitting the protagonists car as the shot was so obviously a green screen shot and the lighting changed.<br/><br/>Dialogue was clunky, and I found it hard to comprehend much it. The two leads just seem to mumble to each other.<br/><br/>Somehow all the charm and wit of the Mclane character has been surgically removed by scriptwriter(s), director and by Bruce Willis. So now he's supposed to be a dinosaur, overtaken by the modern age. OK that could work, at least in recognises Bruce's advancing years, but then conversely he's now become superhuman, able to withstand multiple bullet wounds, karate kicks to the head and impossible drops and so on. That just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>The whole subplot with his daughter seemed somewhat tacked on, like halfway through production someone in a committee meeting burst into the room with a box set of 24 and said ""hang on guys, I've got an idea"".<br/><br/>And why does Hollywood insist on pretending no-one uses a mouse? That get me every time with techno thrillers. All that one-handed keyboard wizardry. It just looks stupid.<br/><br/>All in all, pretty ropey. Must be nostalgia fuelling all those 9 star reviews."

My biggest gripe about this flick is that it isn't a Die Hard movie, it's just another summer blockbuster with an overblown effects budget. You could replace John McClane with another smart-ass bald guy and get the exact same picture. The only reason this is a ""Die Hard"" movie is to sell tickets, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4 is the Hollywood Action-Film-o-Matic machine at work, creating what is essentially formulaic action porn - everything that happens in between the action sequences and explosions is filler, and if you had this on DVD, you'd skip to the ""good parts"" and forget the rest. This flick shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the original. A lot of people are telling me that I'm expecting too much from what is a great ""popcorn flick"".

Bad Boys 2).<br/><br/>The plot was decent, but what made the first two movies great was the confined space of which John McClane had to survive in and how he dealt with that situation. The third installment was all over NYC and the new installment seemed to take place all over the upper east coast.<br/><br/>And I'm not a big fan of the whole sidekick idea. Sam Jackson is a great actor but he was unnecessary in with a Vengenace as was Justin Long. His character was useful but could have been written out or at least not played such a major role.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the PG-13 rating. How can McClane not finish his patented line, ""Yippie Ki Aye Motha ...."" Disgraceful.

Not only is Die Hard 4.0 quite humorless, it doesn't have any new ideas, although a couple of action scenes are impressive. It's completely laughable how clichéd some of the characters are: McClanes daughter for example. The villains are another problem; the main one is just boring and the tougher sidekick gets killed WAY too early.<br/><br/>4.0 has a lot in common with the first film. McClane talks with the villains over radio, there is a family member to rescue and even that certain famous line from the first film gets recycled. But it's the script and dialogue which really are terrible. I don't know why Hollywood's action writers still have a strange perversion for satellite phones. And helicopters. And why in the year 2007 do we still have stupid, huge control centers with a lot of blinking lights? <br/><br/>All that stuff aside, as I said some action scenes are good, but in the end Die Hard 4.0 is just a hollow and tired rewarming of an old franchise that should have been left in the 1980s and 90s."

In the beginning, John is spying on his daughter who is on a date with your typical, ""I gotta make a move"" type of guy. And of course, John saves the day. Well, sort of. His daughter doesn't apparently want anything to do with him, but this is never explained.<br/><br/>From there he's called to pick up Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) and take him to the FBI in D.C. because Homeland Security networks have been hacked and the Feds want to talk to the top US hackers on their list. Well, everyone of the hackers, including Farrell, have all written network codes that they unknowingly supply to the terrorists, in turn, are all sent a virus to their home computers. The moment the computer goes on the fritz, each hacker hits their ""Delete"" button and BOOM! Everyone blows up.(yeah, they send a bomb via the internet). Everyone, that is, except Matt, who is saved just in the nick of time, by John McClane, of course. So from there the action ensues.<br/><br/>What plays out, action wise, is fun, explosive, not-so-digital action sequences that are pure eye candy. The beginning sequences are a bit easier to believe, but the bigger they get, the more the film makers push the willing suspension of disbelief a might to far. But, hey... this is ""Die Hard"" and they are all guilty of this. That's why I'm not taking any points away... necessarily. It gets a little hooky, but what can you do??<br/><br/>To replace the f-bombs, they use words like ""dickhead"" and ""jerk-off"" twice a piece.

John had just been previously shot in the shoulder, so while Gabriel is holding him, he takes the barrel of the gun, presses the barrel against John's shoulder wound and asks John a question. John answers, by taking the pistol and pushing it into the wound even more, ""yippie-ki-yay""-BANG (yeah, he shoots himself)and in shooting himself, he shoots Gabriel. Where he was shot, wasn't clear. He falls back on the hood of a car and that's it. Trust me, I've left nothing out of the. And as interesting as it sounds above, it was even less on screen. <br/><br/>All in all... fun, pop corn explosions and action. Bad writing, direction, and damn the man who came up with ""Live Free or Die Hard"" rated PG-13... Yes, there are plenty of DUBBING over of lines. If you watch, you'll notice it. It'll be interesting to see what the ""R"" or ""UNRATED"" version turns out. In fact, in the trailer, we see John begin his famous line, and when that shot comes up in the movie, (which is the end), he doesn't say it. It's a completely different shot and circumstances than what you actually see. So... BE WARNED. If ""Die Hard"" is what you want, then watch the 1st ""Die Hard"", ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" and yeah.. even sit and take a gander at ""Die Hard 2: Die Harded.""

"matjusm","6","7","14","27 June 2007"," Mixed feelings
","The fourth part of the Die Hard franchise brings up mixed feelings in a longtime fan. In short it can be summed up in the words that this is a pretty good action film but not a very good Die Hard film.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a group of terrorists (or whatever you want to call them) taking down the computer infrastructure of the United States. A well chosen plot line, considering how much is run by computers these days. The attack starts off small but grows exponentially in its destructive power as the story flows along. Its a good premise but I don't think it was executed to the maximum of its potential. The sense of danger and Armageddon that such a thing would cause isn't reflected too much in the film. This would have added a lot to the film and from Die Hard 3, one can see that a strong plot and storyline carry a film very well.<br/><br/>All the classic Die Hard characters are there but it isn't McClane who stands out the most. Justin Long plays a hacker who by coincidence happens to be with McClane when the attack happens and he stands out. His witty lines even rival those of the main character himself and overall it is a joy to see him on screen. McClane however is only a shadow of his former self which we saw in the first three films. The PG-13 rating (instead of an R like the first three) has really watered down McClane's vocabulary and if you're a fan of the franchise, you'll know exactly what I mean. He does have some occasional witty dialog but nothing like what it was in the first three. It seems like its just thrown in there to make this film more of a Die Hard film but unfortunately it doesn't work well. Bruce Willis doesn't feel like McClane at all anymore. The villain, played by Timothy Olyphant is exceptionally weak. The Gruber brothers are on a whole different level and even the somewhat lackluster main bad guy of part 2 towers over this guy. He doesn't come off as menacing or threatening at all. He is given some witty dialog but it just falls flat. The police chief, the guy who helps McClane all the time, is rather forgettable, something I can't say for the guys who played the corresponding character in the first three films.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Len Wiseman of Underworld fame. He also has a background in TV commercial and music video production and it really shows here. Heavy color correction with the addition of heavy blue hues and the dimming out of colors gives the film a somewhat alienating look while as the first three kept things simple and thereby made you feel as if you were there. The camera-work, accompanied by the editing, is the usual quick cut, constantly move the camera type that has become so common these days. Not that it looks bad- its quite sleek looking actually, but its simply not Die Hard. Due to this and the slightly overly fast pacing, the film never manages to make good use of the surrounding settings, a very key part to the first three films. The pacing is like in too many modern films- things for some reason need to happen fast and be rushed.<br/><br/>The action is OK I suppose. Although the previous films also had some pretty over the top stuff, this film takes it even further, all the way to the point where it just isn't that fun anymore since too much suspension of disbelief is required. But aside from that, I found the action quite enjoyable. The special effects were of course top notch and I was glad to see that many things were done for real and not just via CGI. And the score, by Marco Beltrami, was also excellent with some great tunes very fitting for an old school action film.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad action film but it pales in comparison to the first three."
"MrRockatansky","6","5","9","16 March 2012"," This is not Die Hard!!
","Wow, what a kick in the nuts to the fans. Simply put, this movie is not a Die Hard movie. It's a second rate Bruce Willis action movie that they gave the ""Die Hard"" title in order to cash in on the fan base. Shameful. Bruce Willis, you should hang your bald head in shame, you sellout.<br/><br/>So where do I start with this mess.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" is about some super nerds having a tantrum and trying to destroy America with computers...or where they trying to steal something? Who cares. It was so uninteresting I tuned out when they started talking in their highly improbable computer jargon. Unlike the first 3 which take place over the course of several hours, this movie is set over several days which completely kills the adrenaline fuelled feel of the original films. And while the first three movies(Especially 1 &3) where clever, witty action thrillers, this movie is basically a bunch of mildly amusing action sequences strung together by bad dialogue and forgettable characters. Oh and the writers decided to throw in every cliché they could think of, just for good measure. They have the ""Daddy saves kidnapped daughter"" cliché. The ""Tough guy with a nerdy sidekick"" cliché which makes for totally hilarious comedy *yawn*. The ""Tough kung fu Asian chick"" cliché. They even threw in the old ""35 year old computer nerd living in his parents basement"" cliché. Where do they come up with this stuff!!<br/><br/>The main villain is dreadful. He looks like he's about to burst into tears any moment and you get the feeling he's more likely wet himself than harm anyone, which is exactly what you want in a villain, right? McClanes daughter is a total bitch who hates her dad for some reason which isn't explained. Bruce Willis drags his sorry ass through the film looking as though he wants to pick up his pay cheque and go home. And McClane is a completely different character from the McClane we know and love from the previous films. Get this. He even taunts the bad guys who are holding his daughter hostage. Seriously? The writers didn't even give McClane any good one liners, so instead he just whoops and cheers when he destroys something with total ease. Horah!<br/><br/>One of the worst things about this crap is the obvious teen and child pandering. When watching this film you can just picture the studio execs planning on ways to make it child friendly. Checklist...<br/><br/>* PG13.....(More money) * Plot about computers......(Kids and teens love that stuff) * Justin Long as sidekick......(Teens can relate) * Hot girl playing McClanes daughter......(For the teenage boys) * Silent Bob cameo.......(Bring in the stoner comedy crowd)<br/><br/>To sum up, this is a movie which should not have been made and is a Die Hard film by name only. It has been stripped of everything that made the original trilogy so good, and Its a dark cloud over a brilliant franchise."

","Hollywood isn't a place famous for its imagination and why should it be ? Movies are made to make money for the studios and if the start hemorrhaging money that means , producers , writer , directors and stars sitting around their swimming pools crying in to their cocktails knowing that they're condemned to live life topping up their suntan and no longer seeing their name appear on movie credit sequences . In other words Hollywood and its cronies like to play things safe hence studios churning out sequels and films that feel entirely similar to films you saw last year . DIE HARD 4 is a good example of this type of movie . Unfortunately you're left with the feeling you saw it over a decade a go not last year <br/><br/>The plot takes much of the blame . A computer genius hacks in to the government's system and creates a small taste of hell and if he doesn't get a large amount of loot from the authorities he's going to arrange it that America has the same technological level as Neanderthal man . The problem with this scenario is that it we've seen it all before in films like THE NET and GOLDENEYE . The plot is far better suited to a film released in 1997 rather than 2007 . Even then the action blockbuster was becoming rather stale and over saturated with such "" stars "" as Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme carving out a niche for themselves . Having a big name like Bruce Willis playing a wise cracking violent good gu<br/><br/>y in a film full of explosions and stunts doesn't seal success anymore That said DIE HARD 4 has a certain nostalgia to it . Bruce Willis after showing his acting credentials in the likes of THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE returns as John Mclane to remind us why he used to be a famous action star . There might be some slight cynicism he's just returning to pick up a bumper pay cheque since his career had been floundering for a few years but despite this McLane is a much more human superman compared to say Arnie in TERMINATOR 3 a film that shows just how anachronistic late 1980s blockbusters are transplanted in to the early 21st Century"

","I can't believe the current rating of this film here on IMDb. 8/10??? No, this is NOT the best sequel this year. No, this is NOT the best Die Hard. Probably the worst along with Die Hard 3.<br/><br/>The film basically consists of larger-than-life action scenes, one after another. Great action films make use of the scenes in between the action scenes, the viewer has to be able to catch his/her breath and maybe even get to know the characters a little bit. Die Hard 4.0 (as it's called here in Europe) does not bother about this at all, the motto seems to be: ""The more explosions and dead people, the better"".<br/><br/>The Die Hard films were never realistic, but this is silly. The film actually develops into a comedy.<br/><br/>The dialogue is not excellent, the dialogue is stupid and boring.<br/><br/>And Timothy Oliphant is feeble as the villain, he probably got the part because of his cold glance.<br/><br/>The first two Die Hard films are great action flicks, but this one is just an over the top collection of action scenes. It gets ridiculous after a while, and you end up yawning. Furthermore, the film is too long. With better dialogue and more sensitive use of action scenes this could be good. But unfortunately it isn't."

","I love the Die Hard series and Bruce Willis. He is THE action hero of the golden age of action that was the decade from mid 80's to mid-late 90's. And myself, being a film person/major, i come into to a movie with the same expectation... to see a good movie. This movie however disappointed me in every sense of the word. <br/><br/>I never thought i'd watch a movie and never be drawn into it. I don't know where ""Not-Wiseman"" went to film school at, but apparently it didn't teach him structure and how to bring people in the story through camera, pacing, timing, or rhythm. None were evident. The film dragged from the start. I was dosing off at the beginning. <br/><br/>The plot was extremely... boring. Cyber-terrorism? That's a thing people were skeptical about since the 90's and is hardly something to make an action movie out of. ""NO! Stop him! he's hacking something!"" I'd rather worry about terrorists who kill people or get down and dirty. Every movie starts with the script, so the downfall of the movie started there. I don't even know why Willis agreed to that. None of the dialogue catched the charm that Bruce Willis can bring to the screen, the sassy sarcasm, the witty punchlines, or over-the-top humor in the most ironic situations. <br/><br/>Now, there were some here and there, but, Bruce Willis is getting old, and it's shown on screen unfortunately. Almost all his lines come out a whisper, which doesn't give any of his lines much impact, and the John McClane's character suffers from it. Instead of having a look on his face that he's fighting for his life and is gonna make whomever put him in these situations suffer, he just looks tired. He looks as if he's just doing things because, ""i'm in the situation"", thats it. <br/><br/>The director gave us no insight into any of the characters. The dialogue comes out flat, and the manifestation of the situations of each character dims under the shadow of shallow/stale directing. But i think it's also the fault of poor casting. Willis' hacker sidekick that he's suppose to escort, bad actor IMO, and is contradictory as he is super smart and slow at the same time. The bad guy, i can kick him in the balls and and get away with it. No intensity whatsoever, which was pretty annoying... you're suppose to hate the guy, and like it! <br/><br/>By the time that McClane says the famous lines at the end, it's done in such a way that you don't care anymore, by that time, it doesn't even feel like Die HArd. I didn't even like the film stock they used. The dark and grainy look doesn't bring to light that John McClane is just a normal guy caught up in the wrong situation. <br/><br/>No character development, no build up of action, random elements, and lack of vision. <br/><br/>I say you enjoy the first 3 of the Die HArd series and leave this one to the general teenager population, for which this movie is obviously for (i.e. stereotypical Asian karate-girl anyone?). If you think that the PG-13 rating won't water down this movie, you're wrong. It seems McClane wants to say something but can't for fear of the ratings board. <br/><br/>Hope this review has been helpful in saving your money. Go see 1408 for some real suspense."

"tennis7590","4","6","12","20 July 2007"," Worst Die Hard Yet
","A very far fetched story, as are most of the Die Hards but just way over top. It was for the most part entertaining with nonstop action but the plot was weak and the acting dismal. It was a reflection of the real world today, since the plot is based around computers and hacking and computer technology. Outside of Bruce Willis the acting was horrible. The bad guy held the same expression most of the time and the reason for what he was doing was just plain stupid. But the worst was Bowman the head of the cyber agency or whatever it was. The dialogue the came form his mouth and his expressions were pathetic and his character did nothing the whole movie. The plot and motives of the bad guy was lame as well. This has insane over the top action which makes it entertaining but the plot and acting was pretty bad."
"Doylenf","7","6","12","9 July 2007"," A rolllercoaster thrill ride from beginning to end...the franchise is alive and kicking...
","Once again BRUCE WILLIS in the guise of John McClane saves the world from professional hackers out to disrupt the U.S. government and shut down the financial structure completely--an act of revenge by a former insider (TIMOTHY OLYPHANT) whose warnings went unheeded by those in charge.<br/><br/>And the action is practically non-stop, with one big stunt sequence after another. Midway through the film I was wondering how they would top the last big explosion, but the screenwriter never ran out of even more dangerous stunts to come. This has got to be one of the most physically demanding roles Willis (and his stuntman) ever played.<br/><br/>Amid all the tension there's a nice sense of humor going on between Willis and his young Hacker friend (JUSTIN LONG), with the banter never missing a clever exchange of lines as they join forces to fight the villain out to destroy America. At the end, of course, there's plenty of guts and glory for both of them who manage to survive all the attempts to destroy them at terrific odds.<br/><br/>While preposterous, the screenplay does make you think twice about what might happen if our dependence on computers went totally haywire. It's this aspect of the story that gives it that much needed adrenalin rush for today's movie fans.<br/><br/>Summing up: The franchise is alive and kicking with some astonishing action stunts and some really better than average work from Willis and his sidekick Long. A welcome summer blockbuster."

Interestingly enough, the high marks were spread among all age ranges. I honestly cannot imagine mature film viewers giving the movie anything above 5. For those people that haven't seen it, don't waste your money, if you are so keen on watching it wait a few months and rent it. I can't believe it even entered the top 250...

A weak useless villain; bloated running time; ridiculous action sequences (Bruce airgliding down the tail of a F35... people liked that?); and most importantly, a PG-13 ethos that stood in direct contradiction to everything that the original Die Hard stood for -- these and other glitches add up to render DH4.0 as just another ho-hum summer popcorn movie that isn't great by any stretch of the imagination.

It's a comedy, really. This guy is Superman, even better than the Terminator.<br/><br/>I would have really liked the movie if Thomas Gabriel would have shot Lucy (John's daughter) in the foot or something while talking to John on the phone and asked him to stay away, go move to Brazil or something :)) why wouldn't he do it? Also there were at least 2 occasions to kill John and that boy, why did they hesitate to ""talk before""? This ""talk before getting killed"" is getting too old, I've seen it in hundreds of movies! There was nothing to talk about, just press the trigger and make a realistic movie. Even make the bad guy win, so what? It's just a movie anyway, make it unpredictable!

These bombs were mounted inside their dwellings, and were put there well ahead of time but are only set to explode upon a certain keystroke? What happens if that key never gets used? What happens if the hard drive or motherboard fries or the power gets turned off? McLane had no real fistfights, no real chase with the final bad guy, didn't have too much personal interaction.<br/><br/>In the first few minutes while the buildings are being shot and torn apart and explode...nobody in the neighboring apartments calls the police or fire department? Nobody cares about the building they live in? Nobody hears a bomb blow up or rapid fire tear apart a hallway, door, wall or ceiling? The computer graphical interfaces for all the government computer systems just weren't convincing - the entire idea that everything is operated within 1 room just doesn't play right.<br/><br/>Also John gets thrown about all over the place but doesn't limp, doesn't break a bone, doesn't sprain an ankle - gets a couple bruises, but nothing serious.<br/><br/>This movie should have been renamed something else with a female lead - maybe Gina Gershon in a movie titled ""Adrenaline"".<br/><br/>While it was entertaining and wasn't horrible in the fact that is was lame...it just didn't work as a Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>But you'll find that out soon enough.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, by the way...were do bad people and super villains get recruited? How do they get access to all the latest hardware, technology, weapons, transportation system and everything else...<br/><br/>I mean...if they have all the money for that stuff...why do they need more? That already cost hundr4eds of millions of dollars alone...why make you lifelong ambition as a supervillian to get more money which you can't spend and risk your life to do so? For the bad guys to set this all up had to take millions upon millions of dollars and I assume that it also took years to plan the entire structure...so why risk blowing it all when you already have the millions upon millions of dollars to start up your nasty scheme?

Please, a fighter plane! I know it is Die Hard, but still! The casting also seemed off. I like Timothy Olyphant (Thomas Gabriel) in his role and Maggie Q (Mai) was a good cast. On the other hand, I couldn't stand Justin Long (Matt Farrell) in his role. Watching him was like nails on a chalkboard. I also would have liked to see someone else in Cliff Curtis's (Bowman's) role.

","Who cares if it's entertaining, you may say. I beg to differ. Why? Because there's plenty better things to do with life than enjoying this same recycled pulp. Sure, it's got style, it's visually appealing and it has the same hero drawn to a yet another blown up situation just for the sake of being the hero, just what the masses ordered. Yup, Bruce Willis is back as the wisecracking cop from the three earlier films, this time pitted against yet another one token baddie in the form of Timothy Oliphant's poor villain performance inspired by the earlier baddies, just what the masses ordered. Nothing new to see, for other words. But ask yourself this, instead of enjoying the same thing over and over again, wouldn't we actually want to learn why we have violent people and what we can actually do with them instead of, ahem, shooting them in the order they appear? Makes a lot more sense than enjoying the stuff we all say we resist just for the sake of being entertained by it. Mclane saves the day, as usual, killing the foes in the same style, as usual, only this time with watered down violence so the kiddies can also see naughty men die their deserved deaths, just what the parents ordered despite the fact that, until this installment, the Die Hard franchise has been quite gritty to say the least. The worst you see here is Willis covered by blood, bruises and scars. Nothing new to learn either, for other words. And, non-surprisingly, I expected just that when I rented this piece of Hollywood's best. In fact, I only did it because I'm studying audiovisual career(nowhere near Hollywood, thankfully). All I have to ask is what is the point in all this? Entertainment? By sucking up the same lame, shallow concepts in every film till the day the sun explodes?? You got to be kidding me. These films have no point, nothing definitive to offer to ones who go through real violence in a certain thing called reality. But I won't start complaining. You know why? Because that's the job for people who actually take these films seriously. I most certainly don't. Why? Because there's better things in life. The only purpose for these endless Hollywood production line molds is for people to waste time and money with them. If we don't watch violence to learn from it it must be because we enjoy it for being violent ourselves. If I were you I'd skip this AND the previous parts, because there is no point here, just a good guy violently killing bad guys to save the day that is, in reality, never saved. Not this way. Not by watching these repeats. 4 out of 10, just because of the pointlessness."

Almost everything that happens can be termed comic book, from the preposterous invulnerability of the main characters to their lamentable attempts at dialogue. Whatever hint of credible situations occasionally settled into the fabric of the earlier films is replaced now by the most risible, inconceivable denouements. We are used to bad men who can't hit a car with a vast machine gun mounted in a helicopter at near point-blank range, but it's difficult to credit the fact that a little later Bruce Willis launches his car into the air like a guided missile and knocks the helicopter out of the sky! After jumping out of the speeding car he rolls across the highway, gets up, grunts (better than the dialogue to be sure), and starts shooting at the man who miraculously crawls out of the helicopter after it's hit the ground. Well really! And there's no longer any foreplay. The shooting starts almost the instant the film starts and continues at a predictable pace for the next two hours, all carefully doled out to stop morons snoozing after tens minutes without blood and guts. It's terrible entertainment. Humourless, predictable, tension-free, and utterly witless."

","I have to say that I enjoyed the other Die Hard movies to some extent. I'm not an action fan, but they were done well and they were believable. McClane was also always a likable character.<br/><br/>In this movie, the conclusion I drew is that he's just getting old, but he still has to work. He does things in and old fashioned way, talks in an old fashioned way, lacks sarcasm and humour. Sometimes he even looks quite dumb. He's more of a fighting and kicking grandpa, but well he isn't because it's still the Daddy + Daughter thing.. that really becomes tiresome. Why not have her be mother and he the real grandpa, that would be a real sequel and actually reflect what he's playing anyway.<br/><br/>But that's not the worst. The worst is the reaction of the environment: The light in the tunnel goes out, but none of the cars therein switch on their headlights. They crash into each other without breaking. That's not even close to being realistic! All other people besides McClane become stupid supernumeraries that are just obstacles in his way. Yawn! Next thing: Hacking!? SORRY? That's not hacking, that's clicking the right buttons on first attempt on a GUI that you've never seen before. Ridiculous. But wait, that wasn't the worst either, the worst are the characters and how they are totally boring. The villain is just a toothless boring little bad boy and the good government agent is never doing anything besides screaming ""We've got to do something"" while looking incredibly stressed.<br/><br/>I hope they don't make another one."

Willis is simply outstanding. Justin Long is an excellent techie sidekick for Willis. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does an excellent job playing Detective McLane's daughter. Winstead channels the McLane fire and spirit in the heat of battle, but is also able to express love and care through some very lovely brown eyes.<br/><br/>Timothy Olyphant is the weak link here -- not convincing as the lead bad guy. His eyes simply do not betray the intelligence or gravitas one would expect in a high-tech criminal mastermind. His sidekick (and kick she does) Maggie Q is excellent as the no-nonsense martial arts killer. The other computer geeks on the bad guy's team perform well.<br/><br/>Kevin Smith is entertaining as one of the most talented geeks -- and was in my view under-utilized.<br/><br/>The stunts are fantastic.

ANyone who watched the other Die Hard's would know that what really makes it Die Hard is Bruce Willus using the F word. Even his famous line was muffled by a gun shot. <br/><br/>But all in all Live Free or Die Hard provides enough thrills to keep you on the edge of your seat, humor that will make you laugh out loud, and McClane's sparling personality."

","I have grown up with the ""Die Hard"" films. Seeing a new, modern-day version of ""Die Hard"" is fantastic. Bruce Willis once again is the charismatic John McClane whose life motto ""at the wrong place at the wrong time"" fights against a technological-driven terrorist organization who is more interested in hacking into the government files rather than blowing buildings up or holding hostages like the original three. As an ""old-fashioned"" hero, his sidekick is a hacker freak named Mathew Farrell, wonderfully played by Justin Long. And McClane's new arch enemy is Thomas Gabriel (Matt Olyphant), an overconfident and evil-mannered manipulator.<br/><br/>This unusual difference from the usual ""Die Hard"" villains' scheme does not dishearten the Die Hard spirit at all. In fact, it makes the movie all the more interesting, supported by intense CGI effects, which delivers cool action sequences of car chases, shoot-outs, and countless explosions. The visual effects are not overdone; they look very realistic rather than being cheesy. There is also a fair amount of great stunts in the midst of all the non-stop action. There are no complaints in that field.<br/><br/>And it is no mistake that this is a PG-13. I was surprised when the rating came out, since the other ones were R's. This means the violence is toned done and McClane does not deliver his F-bombs. But he still manages to get his famous ""Yippee-ki-yay"" in it. As a Die Hard fan, I was very impressed. The first one and third one though are still the two best ones. 9/10 So, ""Yippee-ki-yay!"""
"TOMNEL","8","4","7","7 July 2007"," John McClane is back, and almost better than ever.
","Stars: Bruce Willis, Justin Long, Timothy Olymphant, Maggie Q, Mary Elizibeth Winstead, Kevin Smith.<br/><br/>After a 12 year wait, we are finally treated to another Die Hard film, only this sequel is actually good. In this Die Hard, ruthless computer hackers are trying to get rich off of a fire sale, and by killing all the other computer hackers. John McClane (Willis) is now a detective who goes out simply to pick up a young computer hacker Matt Farrell (Long), and ends up trying to save the world. Like the first Die Hard film, this is only an action film. Any dialogue that isn't there for humor, or plot movement is non-existent. This film is pretty much pure action, and it is extremely enjoyable. Bruce Willis, though getting older, can still pack a punch, and he has some really fun action scenes. I highly recommend this, because this is the best McClane we've seen since the original.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****."

","This was by far my favorite in the series. Farrell was a great compliment to McClane. Lucy McClane was too young, in Die Hard the picture of the kids showed the girl to be about 8 and that would make her in her late twenties not still in college dorms. Also she was far too pretty, Willis own offspring are no where near that hot. The bad guy was great and there was no Samuel L Jackson screaming. I would have like to see McClane's son involved. The humor was quite good and I was delighted to see that it was rated PG-13 so my kids can attend. I hope they make 1 more before Willis gets too old, he is pushing the limit as is. Where or where have the young action stars gone?"
"craftycurate","9","4","7","7 July 2007"," Cracking action movie with real depth and looks great too
","I wasn't sure what to expect here. Fourth outing in a franchise ... and I saw part 1 again on TV and wasn't that impressed. But 8.1/10 was enough to get me to see it.<br/><br/>Well, what a cracker of a film. It is fresh and exciting and it adds a gritty edge to the franchise. Best of the series for me. Not too long, paced just right (I am easily bored in films but I was hooked), it looks great, it has characters with emotional depth (unlike the flat characters in so many action films). It doesn't suffer from the clichés of the genre (e.g. the burned out cop with estranged wife). Superb action set pieces.<br/><br/>Willis has loads of charisma and holds the lead well, but he is well supported by a great ensemble cast, including a few actors I didn't recognise. The father-daughter relationship between Bruce Willis and the actor playing his daughter works well too esp at the beginning when he hauls the boyfriend out the car! Nice touch.<br/><br/>Digital effects quality is superb - I work a lot in digital 3D and can spot it very easily, but I couldn't see the joins in most places.<br/><br/>Cinematography is great too - they've given it that slightly grainy bleached look that's become popular e.g. in ""300"" - deep blacks, high contrast with a slight bluish tone.<br/><br/>The relationship between this film and parts 1-3 is similar to the relationship between ""Casino Royale"" to the rest of the Bond franchise - it's updated and edgy, and in no way a tired rehash to drain it of its remaining commercial value.<br/><br/>I was sorry it finished! Go see it now."

","I'm just going to get straight to the point, this was BRILLIANT, a text book example of good old fashioned action movie know how! I was not sure what to expect from a Die Hard in the digital age, i was worried, there was no need to be. CGI is employed in parts of the movie, but sparingly and only when needed, it does seem to have been trimmed here and there for language, i imagine subsequent DVD releases will address that.<br/><br/>The bad guys are bad, but not ""over the top"", the stunts are the kind that make you suck in air through your teeth, but best of all it doesn't try to compete with the previous entries in the Die Hard franchise. It just does its own thing and by that default becomes a great addition to the series. Bruce IS McClane, he just inhabits the role of John now, shoot him, kick him out of the window, blow him up or even throw a car at him, he'll just bounce back. <br/><br/>I really gravitate to this idea of his strong beliefs in simple human values and attitudes, is what keeps him centered in the face of this onslaught of technology.<br/><br/>If your looking for a ""ride"" movie, look no further, John McClane is about to have a very bad day, but you'll have a great night !"

","Now I could go on and write you a long summary of the movies plot. But you already know what the movie is about and the only reason you are reading this is because you want to know what I thought of the movie...<br/><br/>That is what a review is.<br/><br/>The story line was okay, and would have been better under a different name, but certainly not Die Hard. It was like watching Swordfish only with more action.<br/><br/>This McClain was more like the recent cops that Bruce Willis has played (Ergo Hartigan from Sin City, and Jack Mosley from 16 blocks). An old tired beat cop who just wants to take it easy and get a promotion.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very tired, and boring. Certainly nothing like crawling through an elevator shaft barefoot, or getting ejected out of a cockpit before it explodes, or even hanging off a bridge by a steel cable as a truck is about ready to swing onto a boat.<br/><br/>Nay, it is mostly machine guns, explosions, and fisticuffs. Nothing that no one has seen before. Not that all of those aren't important to the Die Hard Franchise, but at least in the previous movies they were all larger then life.<br/><br/>The dialog is bland as well. There is no wisecracking McClain. His chemistry with Justin Long is... Eh. After a while it felt more like watching ""I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC"". Long is the hip and with it, and Willis is old and outdated.<br/><br/>Olyphant as the antagonist was boring as well. His character was more of a whiny emo anti-hero then an actual bad guy. Which is a trend we see more and more in movies; having the conflicted character who sees things differently then an actual bad guy.<br/><br/>There was of course some humour to the film, Kevin Smith's character basically made the film...<br/><br/>The end of the movie was very dry and without any type of excitement. It just ended...<br/><br/>The best way for me do describe it would be to compare it to the previous three films...<br/><br/>Die Hard - McClain pulls a gun taped to his his back and with only two shots left, pops the bad guy in the head and Hans in the shoulder and while Hans is dangling from the edge of the Towers, McClain unlatches Holly's watch and we see Hans slowly falling to his death. Very epic<br/><br/>Die Hard II - McClain, opens the fuel line of the plane and falls to the ground after getting into a fist fight with Col. Stewrart on the wing of said plane and then ignites the fuel with his trusty zippo while uttering the famous Yippe Kay Ya, and blows up all the bad guys while making a landing light for Holly. Unbelievable? Unlikely? Yes and YES, but it's DIE HARD for goodness sake! <br/><br/>Die Hard III - Looks Simon in the eye as Simon is shooting at him from the helicopter with a machine gun, says the Yippe Kay Ya, and shoots the power line causing it to get tangled in the rotor blades, causes Simon to die in a fiery death.<br/><br/>Die Hard VI - Mumbles the Yippy Kay Ya Mother (f garbled mumbled line) shoots himself through the shoulder and kills the bad guy. Nothing epic, and just kinda ends with the possibility of the most unlikely dating scenario you could ever think of.<br/><br/>So basically this is what we get. A no chain smoking, no f-bombing, no wise cracking McClain. A bad guy who really isn't a bad guy, but instead is some cranked off computer nerd trying to get even with the government for not buying him a pony... er wait, for not listening to him. And a PG13 rating so kids can see it.<br/><br/>IF KIDS WERE ABLE TO SEE THE FIRST THREE RATED R FILMS, AND OBVIOUSLY LIKED THEM ENOUGH TO SEE A FOURTH ONE, WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU WATER IT DOWN TO PG-13??? So, there is my review. Die Hard in name only, and would have been a good story had it not been a Die Hard Movie..."

The scene with the flying car as seen in the trailer to the movie was great as were the other stunts. As I watched the movie I was like I can't believe John McClane is still alive lol. I also thought that Justin Long did a great job in his supporting role. It is scary to think that something like this could really happen and how paralyzed most people and our country would truly be.

The graphics in this movie are unnecessary and they look so stupid and fake, it's no wonder I fell asleep through the movie. They turn McClane into a super-soldier somehow because he is able to destroy a jet- fighter, land it on top of a crowded freeway and while the freeway is crumbling to dust, he rolls off the flaming jet and onto the top of a moving truck and then jumps off the truck in a very casual manner. Stay away from this movie, because if you are as big of a fan as I am of the original, you will become nauseated by how much they destroyed it's reputation"
"Changeishere0017","1","5","10","27 November 2008"," An unworthy piece of garbage that nearly defaces the franchise.
","Live Free or Die Hard (or Die Hard 4.0 more respectively) is an absurd, laughable action movie. It ruins itself by mainly being in the Die Hard Franchise in the first place, simply put: there's no way in Hell it fits being the brain-dead cheesy action flick it is. I can respect those types of films just as long as it's meant to be that way (ever seen Shoot Em Up? =) ).<br/><br/>As you may have guessed, what really ruins the film is the insanely impossible and all-round stupid action that takes place. Contrary to some typical belief, not ALL Die Hards were like that. The original Die Hard did have at most two (I think) what I found cheesy moments. Even those were excusable. But Bruce Willis running over Maggie Q with an SUV and her being unharmed and hanging on the hood is not. As isn't crashing a car into a toll booth using it as a jump therefore having the car crash into a helicopter thus bringing it down, or John McClane being able to jump onto a moving jet, stand on it, blow it up and then jump off of it right where it crashes and emerge unharmed, and so on. Once again, none of that is Die Hard AT ALL (exceptions: a few parts in Die Hards 1 and 3 and Die Hard 2-ugh).<br/><br/>The people in this film do not help at all either. It's an insult that Bruce Willis signed on to this in the first place. This is quite possibly his worst film. Oh and let's not forget the crap performances by Justin Long (annoying in this film), Maggie Q (tough girl act does not work for you in Die Hard 4, stick to live action appearances in the Need for Speed videogames, okay), Timothy Olphant (sucks horrendously as a villain), and it's all topped off by a small appearance by Kevin Smith as the clichéd fat geek with the geeky nickname.<br/><br/>I shall not forget the overall bad premise of Live Free or Die Hard either. Why does John McClane, a cop, have to all the suddenly 'save the country'? Die Hard 1 was simply 'kill the terrorists to survive and save the hostages' while being confined ONLY to a building, not fly from D.C. to this place and then Kevin Smith's basement. Die Hard 3 was even passable because it showed him as a NY police officer. Now it's 'save the United States from certain doom because some douchebag is controlling the cell phone towers and what not!' <br/><br/>Die Hard 4 (excuse me, Live Free or Die Hard) is a crap filled action movie that I all-round loathe. If you're just looking for something to entertain you and you're not bothered by any of the things mentioned above, then waste you're hard-earned dough and rent or buy it. If you're a Die Hard fan or you've seen the previous films that were GOOD, then wait until it's on Cinemax like me or avoid at all cost.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a shame to the series and only entertaining as a laugh fest."

"dory_1982","4","5","10","24 August 2007"," Die Hard 4 without feeling
","The only actual scene reference i make to the movie is in the trailer.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4 lacks the original feel of the other 3 in the franchise. Bruce Willis played his cornerstone character perfectly, except the story and plot were terrible.<br/><br/>Typically, the Die Hard movies have centered around a basic motivation and threat. One easily digested by the audience.<br/><br/>In #4 we are continually bombarded with technical references - only some of which we are expected to grasp. In places, if seems more like a 'first'installment in a sequel series, with lines and scenes written to educate the audience quickly to keep us on track with the story.<br/><br/>Also, we are used to being privy to the story, and following McClane through the movie as he figures it out, with breath-taking action and plot devices to keep our interest. Obviousness, for Die Hard, is essential, as it's what the other 3 have been built on. Perhaps #3 in smaller pieces, but a larger digestible story was obvious anyway. Writers and directors have relied on other movie making elements to keep the movie interesting. #4 keeps the audience in the dark, and releases information in dribs and drabs, in a bid to maintain attention. This severely frustrated me. This is different from #3 as we could see the overall and simple plot combining with the smaller 'tasks' as the character Jeremy Iron's played comes to light. Die Hard = a no brainer kind of movie. I don't want to think when watching Die Hard... I want to grasp the basic concept and setting straight away, and follow McClane's journey of shooting and superb action for that last and immediate twist at the end.<br/><br/>Even though Willis played his character well, the overall perception of McLane was more of desperation then dedication. Previous Die Hard's, his perceived attitude was one of 'at any cost', which didn't come across accurately in #4.<br/><br/>With technology available that wasn't, even for #3, #4 is jam packed with effects. Almost all of them very very cool. But #4 had two flaws with these. First, the other movies justified the violence (in the context of the realm of Die Hard) very very well. Necessity was evident. And second, effects and stunts in the first three at least looked possible. Even if they were special effects, they looked like it was legitimately possible - there was no thought of ""yeah, as if"". Special effects in #4 looked put on for the sake of having them there - not to contribute as strongly (as the first three) to the story. Because of CGI etc anything is possible. But some realism - even just a hint of it - needs to exist. Such as crouching down and having 2 cars - either side of you - break the fall of another car coming at you from above.<br/><br/>In each movie John's 'side kick' has become more vital and visible to the overall story. #2 was more a convenience as this responsibility was spread over other characters. #3 was Zuess, but that combination was perfect. #4 we see the nerd stumble through the movie (the performance by the actor was excellent, the character was not written correctly). This character also seemed to exist as a contrast to John, to support the John McClane perception. Nothing but John should be doing that as strongly as this character has been. At least in #3 Zuess had his own personality, perspective and motivation. Also, it seemed the nerd was written in to appeal to younger audiences since Willis is now into his 50s. Who cares! Everyone knows the first Die Hard was filmed a long times ago.<br/><br/>All in all, the producers could have taken out the references to McClane, removed the title Die Hard, and no one would have guessed that it could have been a Die Hard Movie. Then the fans would have been happier as it wouldn't have to live up the responsibility of carry the Die Hard legacy the other three movies did so well."
"richardsixone","7","5","10","13 July 2007"," Underwhelming at best
","I'm at a loss to understand why some people are rating this so highly. I'm a fan of all the previous Die Hard films, I can even enjoy the third one for all its flaws but for me, 4.0 just didn't work.<br/><br/>Certainly some of the action was spectacular, the car/helicopter chase/battle was a tremendous set-piece but it was the only noteworthy highlight of an otherwise average movie. If you're looking for another positive, the addition of the Lucy McClane character initially seems to smack of just giving John someone to rescue (groans all round). But by the end, Lucy is the one interesting character, showing how her dad's tough and resourceful streak has rubbed off on her.<br/><br/>One of the key problems for me was that the goal of the villain was never particularly convincing. He was after money inevitably but as it was cybermoney, it isn't as tangible as millions of dollars in negotiable bearer bonds or gold bullion.<br/><br/>Also lacking was a sense of real threat, real danger to life and limb. We are told how shutting down various systems will cause national panic but the result seems to be nothing more than some fender-benders, some minor protesting outside the police station and a blackout. In all previous films, peoples lives were at risk but here only the bad guys were at risk.<br/><br/>Related to this is the idea that John McClane is now basically indestructible and just keeps coming back a la the Terminator. Gone is the vulnerability of the first film (the classic bathroom/glass in the foot scene) or even the considered reluctance of the third film (not jumping off a bridge onto a crane because ""the cables will cut you in half"").<br/><br/>The sidekick idea was never going to as effective as the Willis/Jackson chemistry and Long does what he can with a typical hacker role. Olyphant is sufficiently threatening as the main villain without being particularly memorable (more like Die Hard 2's bland villains than the more distinctive characters from 1 and 3).<br/><br/>As for the rating controversy, this did seem like the TV version at times with clumsily cut violence and obvious swear-word removal but an R rating would not have solved the basic story/structure issues. Disappointing."

","Mr. Wiseman does not have much of a directorial credit attached to him apart from the b grade vampire franchise 'Underworld' and being the assistant director of the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day. But that does not put off the studio bosses of Hollywood, as they provide him the opportunity to direct the fourth edition of the cult action franchise 'die hard'. As a 'Die hard' fan myself I know it is not rocket science to direct die hard, but still the die hard films had a certain personality attached to it. Its central character john McClain was not heroic and was a vulnerable person. He used to not get the sudden bout of heroism and perform some death defying stunts, instead they existed but as an urgent act required in certain situation, which had a certain charm of itself.<br/><br/>Come this summer and everything has changed. Sure it comes as a surprise that producers planned the fourth edition now, with lead star Bruce Willis well over his fifties and in no position to run half way through New York like die hard 3. But that did not stop Len to have a vivid imagination of the things john (Willis) is going to do. John is having a great time killing and blowing anyone and everything that comes his way this time no matter how old he has become. John this time around has to escort a teenage hacker and bring him over to F.B.I which seemed routine but ends up being john's routine gun fight with the bad guys. This time he is fighting to save America from an internet based terrorist who is using a complex program named 'firesale' to destabilize America by controlling the communication systems, the natural resources & power and finally the money. As America goes down, it only needs the one man army of john McClain to save itself with a little bit of help from the boy hacker and john's daughter. With all the ingredients in place to put America back in the Stone Age with someone along with a good sense of humor to save it, the audience has nothing to worry about. Everything has been taken care off. John is going to fight through anything I mean even a natural gas disaster or an F-35 fighter attack over a multi-storied bridge to save America. He is not going to stop at anything and he is ready to joke around anytime he wants even when he is hanging around a crashing car in the elevator hole. As the movie progresses the hacker boy also tries to take a few potshots to crack a joke around a little. With john's daughter also imitating her father's sense of humor around the bad guys you pretty much know the terrorist's smiling days are over as the good guys have been selected to be the immortals of this studio franchise. This is your typical late 80's and 90's action movie added with huge stunts but not a die hard movie. The patient building of the next sequence is gone and there is no time to catch a breath as everything is packed in and the terrorist sends trouble from each direction with one touch of computer mouse click.<br/><br/>But it all works. Not because it deserved, but that the audiences felt different. With this decade belonging to the matrix styled sfx actions this old wine comes with some freshness as everyone missed the hard hitting punches, full blast of cars, chopper, buildings, and bridges. Due to which everything felt surprising. Make no mistake, if this movie would have been released around 1997 it would have been just another action release but circa 2007 it is a big release along with die hard name attached to it everyone is eager and the audience is ready to lap it up. With these advantages by default the movie does not disappoint on the action front either. The actions are big and well executed and with john McClain around you know there is nothing to worry about. So just sit back and relax. John will be fine."

","Another exercise in boredom (running for no less than 130 minutes), another case of megalomaniac budget and minimalist results (the children in Africa are still hungry), another hack director going through all the political correct action routines (with two exceptions). It might be a good time to give the genre an honor funeral in the big flag waving Hollywood style.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that not more people are crying out against the abomination that is ""Live Free or Die Hard"". Frankly, after the credits rolled I couldn't remember what made me go into that theater in the first place. Part curiosity, part stupidity I guess, the drizzly weather might have had something to do with it as well. Also, it got very high ratings from both the crowd at IMDb.com and America's top critics on rottentomatoes.com. Call it blind faith then. Other than that, I was just hoping for a decent action flick in a long row of indecent action flicks. Sadly, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" turns out to be one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory. In retrospect, the signs were all but too clear. First of all, the swearing is gone, the holy grail for every die hard ""Die Hard"" fan. No f-word, no fm-word, instead a whole lot of computer lingo for the technocratic audience. Now, if there has ever been a movie beside ""Deadwood"" that elevated swearing to an art form, it was the ""Die Hard"" series. But let us sympathize with the dilemma of the producers, it's kind of hard to get a PG-13 rating - and you want to get that PG-13 rating - when your protagonist chooses to express is his inner turmoil in four letter words, not that there is much of that pathos left in Willis' character anyway. Which indirectly brings us to the next problem. They compromised. Simply put, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was tailored for the widest possible target audience, which for better or worse also includes every type of nerd under 18. Gone is all the blood spilling, guts carving gusto of it and instead they moved us to a cozy little CGI place, CGisland, where nothing ever really hurts, except maybe a grain of maize that did not bust open. Which brings us directly to the next problem. The CGI sucks. I remember that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was supposed to deliver some good old physical action stunts. Well, it doesn't! Especially, the sequence in which a fighter jet is chasing Willis driving a big truck is so ludicrous and over the top, that you will find shaking your head in disbelief. Plus the same sequence was already done to near perfection in James Cameron's ""True Lies"", not that the underage audience is bothered by such historic details. Let's talk about the villain then. Admittedly, it was fun seeing Timothy Olyphant moved out of the dirty old West and put right smack in the middle of a clear-cut techno-thriller. Personally, I think they chose the wrong bad ass from the ""Deadwood"" cast. Ian McShane might have made a much better antagonist in the old ""Die Hard"" style, instead they went for the evil grinning gentleman type, must have had something to do with target audience. Which brings us to the next obstacle. The techno-thriller genre. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is about as much a ""Die Hard"" movie as ""The Bourne Identity"" or ""Mission: Impossible 3"" are Oscar material (okay, I got that rhetoric all wrong here). At best, it's an upgraded version of ""Hackers"", with more action and more explosions. It's the ""Lawnmower Man"" without a lawn to mow. Of course, we get the irony, analog veteran pitched against a virtual enemy he can hardly see or even smell. It's hard to knock your enemies teeth out when they hide behind a firewall. Now, there was plenty of sarcasm in the originals, sure, but they never sported this witty irony that in the latest installment abounds at nausea. How many clever one liners can you stomach before the whole thing gets ridiculous? Which brings us to another problem. The ""nerdiness"" of it all. Yet another cheap trick to widen the target audience and win over all the internet nerds, discussion board junkies and if they get really lucky their girlfriends as well. Formula: Throw in a goofy sidekick that will make it easier for those who were born with a dial up plugged into their cradle cushion. In every other ""Die Hard"" movie Matt Farrell would have been killed, probably in a particularly sadistic manner, within the first 10 minutes of the movie, and the audience would have loved it. Now instead, he gets cheered on and even is allowed to save the day, yippy ka yeeeee They even stooped so low as to play the funny guy card as well. In ""Mission: Impossible 3"" it was Simon Pegg who got to show his mug for a few minutes, in ""Die Free or Live Hard"" it's Kevin Smith! Why? Well, I'll take a wild guess here and say it might have something to do with widening the target audience. As a mere side note, I want to add that it was kind of annoying how the blue tints of the ""Underworld"" universe at times spilled over into the ""Die Hard"" universe or what's left of it. To all of this add director Wiseman's terrible timing in action sequences and Bruce's absent minded screen presence and you get a disaster of a movie. I'm enjoying a mindless thrill ride at the movies, but ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is flat out insulting my good taste in bad movies. With two exceptions. I liked how the Asian gal gets beaten up, that was mildly affronting. The second exception is the terrorist announcement using mash-ups of speeches from the U.S. presidents. They should separately release it on the DVD extras, it might make a good clip for You Tube."
"misbegotten","5","5","10","5 July 2007"," Unfortunately, the least impressive of the series.
","I'm a big fan of the Die Hard series, but I found this instalment to be just too soul-less and mechanical. The reason why the original Die Hard was so successful was because Bruce Willis's battered and bleeding blue collar cop John McClane was a welcome antidote to all the '80s superhuman movie heroes played by Stallone, Arnie, and Chuck Norris. But after three sequels, McClane is now portrayed as being so indestructible that even kryptonite probably couldn't stop him, and a large part of the series' appeal has been lost. One set-piece involving a fighter jet (shades of True Lies) is so unbelievably destructive that it becomes cartoonish, totally breaking the suspension of disbelief required to view films such as these (it's for exactly that reason that blockbuster action movies fell out of flavour in the late Nineties, with audiences eventually embracing the low key, back-to-basics approach of the Bourne series). And Willis's invulnerability spreads to other castmembers: on several occasions characters fall twenty or thirty feet onto solid concrete, only to get up and keep running or fighting. The low point is probably Maggie Q's villainess still being active and lethal after being hit by a 4x4 at high speed.<br/><br/>The previous films boasted some fine villains (Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber remains the finest criminal mastermind to appear on screen), but this time the bad guys are a particularly colourless bunch, and their grand scheme to seize control of all the computer networks on America's eastern seaboard never carries much of a sense of urgency or serious threat. As for the heroes, Willis merely goes through the motions, while Mary Elizabeth Winstead performs a minor miracle with her severely underwritten role as his daughter, who's only in the film to get kidnapped. The best performance comes from Justin Long as the nervy hacker forced into becoming McClane's sidekick, but even he struggles to register amongst all the explosions and collapsing buildings."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","5","10","2 July 2007"," You're that Guy
","""Live Free or Die Hard"" is perhaps among the greatest action movies ever made. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is nonstop action and the most fun you can have at the movies this summer. Director Len Wiseman (of ""Underworld"" fame) quickly enrolls you, and it matters little how preposterous the action gets. Bruce Willis is awesome in his reprisal of New York Detective John McClane. Willis like his character is older, and plays him as such with a world weariness and power. Justin Long is amazing as the cyber hacker Matt Farrell, whom McClane is tasked to protect. McClane (Willis) is assigned to bring to the FBI hacker Matt Farrell (Long), who may shed light upon a world gone amok. The intangible key to the movie is Willis and Long's working partnership and chemistry. Even with one of the most convoluted story credits: Mark Bomback for screenplay and story; David Marconi for story; John Carlin's article ""A Farewell to Arms""; Roderick Thorp for the original characters; the story is engaging and in the realm of possibility-- really.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, Farrell transfers his software code to the deadly and beautiful Mai (Maggie Q). Soon thereafter the Eastern Seaboard becomes engulfed in a catastrophic network meltdownpotentially encompassing the entire nation. Upon observing the chaos, Matt concludes to FBI director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) that this is a ""fire sale"". Apparently, in the hacker world this mythical ""fire sale"" refers to network Armageddon. There are three stages of a ""fire sale"": 1. transportation and communications shutdown; 2. financial system collapse; 3. termination of infrastructure such as power and water. Is this the work of ""virtual terrorists"" creating a new world order or an elite group seeking unimaginable wealth? Matt is an unintentional pawn; thus, he and McClane must hunt down legendary DoD Consultant Thomas Gabriel (coolly evil Timothy Olyphant), who masterminds this apparent anarchist plot. The pursuit becomes personal when Gabriel holds McClane's daughter Lucy (strong and spirited Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hostage.<br/><br/>Aside from the captivating car crashing into a helicopter or big rig dodging heat seeking missiles from an F-30 fighter jet, it is the human drama and conflict of ""Live Free or Die Hard"" that is so appealing. Early on in the movie computer nerd Matt confesses to McClane, ""I am not heroic."" McClane tells Matt that the hero is ""that guy"" who does what others don't do. So there is a sense of honor when McClane says to Matt later in the story, ""You're that guy"" Acknowledge Willis for playing McClane as true, grizzled, and strong throughout, and Long for authentically playing a smart ass kid discovering his own power. This is a hero's story.<br/><br/>Under Wiseman's direction the action and fight scenes are spectacular and breathtaking. Maggie Q as Mai just beats the crap out of Willis, in the brutal martial arts display. My bud Robert, pointed out to me that fight sequence was more expertly cut, rather than a demonstration of martial arts prowess. Regardless, Maggie Q is totally hot. She is absolutely beautiful and commands a powerful presence as Mai. And Bruce Willis as McClane is truly a ""Timex in a digital world"". McClane endures an amazing beating throughout. Yes, Willis also dishes out on the bad guys in kind. Bruce Willis is natural as our wisecracking hero. He is so deft at balancing smart ass and noble hero. Timothy Olyphant strikes the right tone as the icy malevolent Thomas Gabriel. Olyphant brilliantly underplays his part providing a welcome contrast to McClane. Olyphant is strikingly handsome and darkly charismatic. Justin Long as Matt expertly plays off the other actor's styles. He is funny with a light presence. Long also provides a subtle strength of character in Matt. Wiseman orchestrates all the elements together to produce great summer time entertainment. Where other big budget sequels failed ""Live Free or Die Hard"" prevails with classic heroes and evil villains done with amazing energy and spirit. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is just so much fun to watch."
"MaxBorg89","7","6","13","28 June 2007"," Terrific movie, but why the hell is it rated PG-13?
","Of all the action heroes that have appeared on the big screen throughout the years, Die Hard's John McClane still stands out as the most charismatic and likable, thanks to his down-to-earth attitude and reluctance to being defined a ""hero"". These characteristics are retained in the franchise's new installment, Live Free or Die Hard (or Die Hard 4.0, as it is known in Europe), which manages to be fresh and exciting even if it's been 19 years since the series began.<br/><br/>The fourth movie shows us a different world from what we were used to: after 9/11, the main fear is not that we will be attacked by foreign terrorists, like the first film's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), but that the enemy might strike from within our own country. And that's exactly what happens: a man named Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and his crew manage to breach the USA's main computer networks, controlling everything from telephone lines and traffic lights to the stock market. If he isn't stopped in time, he can destroy anything in the nation that is run by a computer - which is practically everything. The real bad news, however, is that he has made sure all the people who could put an end to his work are dead. Only one remains: young, nervous hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, the Dodgeball guy who kept getting hit in the... well, you know), who has to get to Washington D.C. alive in order to understand what is going on. And who is is charge of keeping him alive? That's right, it's McClane (Bruce Willis), who would really rather be at home and try to fix his own problems: you see, he's divorced and his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) refuses to talk to him. But there he is once again: in the wrong place at the wrong time, ready to kill some bad guys and save the day.<br/><br/>The previous entry in the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995), suffered mainly from being set in the entire New York City area, whereas the unique element of the first two movies was the tension deriving from a single location (the Nakatomi building and an airport respectively). Fortunately, director Len Wiseman (Underworld) knows what fans expect from a Die Hard film and gives them exactly that: although the threat in the film involves the US in their entirety, the script allows Wiseman to stage all the major action scenes in smaller, limited zones (a highway notwithstanding), mirroring the sense of claustrophobia that defined the franchise in its early years.<br/><br/>Another thing that has been left unchanged is the McClane character himself: his worsened private life makes him even more reluctant to do this kind of stuff again, but he has to because, as he tells Farrell in one of the movie's most revealing scenes, no one else is willing to do it. The true appeal of the franchise has always been in its unconventional leading man: even though he gets a kick out of blowing up stuff (""Did you see that?"" Matt asks him after he has killed one of Gabriel's henchmen; ""Yeah, I saw it, I did it!"" he replies ecstatically), he prefers being elsewhere, handling everyday things and putting his life back together. Unlike Rambo or the Terminator (the two characters that ruled the action genre at the time he made his first appearance), McClane is vulnerable, and he gets hurt a lot, which is why people root for him all the time. Willis has a great time reprising his favorite role, and he deserves extra praise for not being afraid of showing that he has aged, becoming a little less skilled at dodging blows from the enemy but nevertheless still determined to go all the way with it (similarly to Danny Glover, who famously kept saying ""I'm too old for this sh*t"" in the Lethal Weapon movies).<br/><br/>Great support comes from Long, Winstead and Maggie Q, but the real value comes from the villain: having learned from his Deadwood costar Ian McShane, Olyphant ditches the OTT mania that made his Scream 2 character risible and goes for underplayed intensity instead, playing Gabriel as a realistic, unsettling update of Hans Gruber.<br/><br/>If there is a problem with the movie, it lies in the rating: a PG-13 is an open contradiction of everything a Die Hard movie stands for, and even if the violence is strong enough to demand an R in places, there is an overall feeling that something is missing.<br/><br/>The PG-13 also means that another series trademark, the frequent profanity, is essentially limited to ""sh*t"", and the absence of more offensive insults is particularly felt in Kevin Smith's cameo: without the swearing, it's hilarious; with the Clerks director's notorious foul language, it would have been comedy gold. But die-hard fans (pun not intended) needn't worry: the franchise's immortal catchphrase is included, and once Willis delivers it it's confirmed beyond any doubt that John McClane is the best action hero of all time, and it was worth waiting twelve years for his return.<br/><br/>Yippee-ki-yay indeed!"

"Exiled_Universe","9","3","5","2 July 2019"," BEST DIE HARD MOVIE SO FAR OUT OF THE FIRST 4!!!!
","Being a PG-13 movie and the only die hard movie to be PG-13 as of now is actually kind of sad because there will be less blood and less cursing, but the action sequences are hell of fun and WAY better than any in the first 3 films. This really feels like a die hard movie and for PG-13 its actually really good. It was just a classic die hard movie but better. More action, better acting, better cast, better everything. I was planning on giving this an 8 but actually it deserves a 9. For scenes like the elevator scene and the countless chase scenes, this really makes up for all the action that the old die hard films lacked and since this is a more modern and recent film it will sure too amaze :p"
"beaconb","9","3","5","28 May 2017"," Arguably as good as the first!
","Let's face it. The 2nd Die Hard tried to be a typical sequel; it wasn't bad, but wasn't that great. The 3rd was a step below that. This sequel didn't feel like a sequel, other than the character being the same. This played more like a buddy movie and had a lot more laughs than previous versions. One final note, if you haven't seen the one that came after this, the one in Russia, don't bother!"
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","5","26 April 2016"," Gunfights, explosions, and pure energy by our action hero John McClane
","There is more than likely no other action film franchise that tops the Die Hars franchise. This high-octane made a massive impression on movie goers everywhere when it debuted in 1988 with Bruce Willis spawning the role of John McClane, a hero full of attitude and charisma, and easily recognized as one of the most iconic action heroes in cinema history. Whether he's taking on terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza building in Los Angeles, at Washington Dulles Airport, and playing a deadly game of Simon Says with one in New York City; McClane never fails to entertain us. This fourth installment sees Bruce Willis reprising his role as McClane once again with Len Wiseman, the man behind the 'Underworld' franchise taking over the director's chair. John McClane, still working for N.Y.P.D., is divorced from his wife Holly and is left estranged by his daughter Lucy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). When the FBI faces a cyber attack from the hands of an international cyber terrorist Thomas Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant) and Lucy is captured and taken hostage by his goons, McClane is called in by the FBI to stop Gabriel and bring him to justice before the he leads the nation into chaos. In the process, McClane finds help from no one other Matt Farell (played by Justin Long), a reluctant young computer hacker who assists him on his off-the-rails mission.<br/><br/>After twelve years since the third installment, this fourth entry takes almost everything from the previous entries and cranks them up a notch. Here, the stakes are higher, explosions are more frequent, and the action sequences are much more intense than you may anticipate. The action scenes featuring highway car chases, helicopter crashes, and copious gunfire serve as the most glamorizing beauty of the film, as do the action sequences of the previous installments. What's new here though, is that the action is taken at an absurd level that borders on implausible such as scenes of McClane jolting off an airplane or drifting an 18-wheeler on a highway, but it ultimately doesn't steer it away from the entertainment value, it's still pretty fun. The plot works pretty well too, with the film taking the story and expanding it on a more grand scale where not only a larger population of innocent lives are at threat and of course the White House, but the nation itself. In addition, the pacing is no issue. Bruce Willis remains as likable and charismatic in the role of John McClane as ever. Justin Long does an alright job, but perhaps not as appealing as opposite Bruce Willis. The chemistry between the duo fits well at times, but occasionally feels flat. Timothy Olyphant gives a solid performance as the cyber terrorist Thomas Gabriel. However, he certainly much less memorable than the previous villains spawned in the franchise. The antagonist feels a little underdeveloped and stands easily forgettable by the end. Viewers should not another Hans Gruber-like villain but one that is worth entertainment value while he lasts.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard is an exciting, fresh popcorn flick that is destined to please action fans everywhere, and a worthy installment to the Die Hars franchise. This film can easily be stamped as one of the most thrilling action films of the decade, and marks a strong point in Bruce Willis's career. Is it the best Die Hard of the series? Not exactly. But for what it's worth, it's fun."
"classicsoncall","8","3","5","28 January 2016"," ""Oh man, that is all bad...""
","Uh-oh, guilty pleasure time again. This happens occasionally with Bruce Willis and Jurassic Park dinosaur movies. Now there's not much in the film that I would consider even remotely plausible, but it's a whole lot of fun to watch. Like when John McClane rams the fire hydrant and the water spout knocks a guy out of a helicopter! Come on, how could that ever happen? But then the film makers went to that same well again when our hero takes out a second one - ""You just killed a helicopter with a car!!!"" Okay.....<br/><br/>Well look, every once in a while it's OK to give your brain a rest and just go for the gusto with something this outrageous. I liked Justin Long as the character Warren Cheswick in the 'Ed' TV series, so seeing him show up here was kind of cool. I thought the dialog between him and Bruce Willis could have been written a bit snappier, but a lot of it worked alright. The whole fire sale business was an interesting concept and makes you wonder if something like that is potentially possible by domestic or foreign terrorists. Don't really want to find out.<br/><br/>So if you like action flicks this one's recommended. Maybe not for all the right reasons but what the heck. You only live free or die hard once. Unless you're John McClane of course, in which case you get to do it again and again."
"The Grand Master","7","3","5","1 February 2015"," Still a fun movie with plenty of action although a bit far fetched at times
","I actually had misgivings about this movie at first. First, Bruce Willis is over 50. Second, although there is plenty of action the violence has been toned down. Third, there is not a single 'f' word. The famous line, ""Yippi-kai-yai motherf....."" is censored, sending many fans of the Die Hard movies in an uproar. This had the potential of sucking big time. How wrong I was. Die Hard 4.0 is actually a fun movie with plenty of action. I have seen both versions, the cinema version and the uncut version and both are just as good. To be blunt, the uncut version should have been released in the first place rather than diluting the violence and language to attract a wider audience. It just felt sacrilegious.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis returns in his iconic role as New York Police Detective John McClane. This time he is divorced from his wife and estranged from his family including his daughter Lucy Gennaro McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Following a brief computer outage at the FBI cyber-security division, the FBI requests all law enforcement agencies take all known computer hackers into custody for questioning. McClane is asked to take in young computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long). McClane arrives at Farrell's place in the nick of time to foil an attempt on Farrell's life by a group of henchmen sent by cyber-terrorist Mai Linh (Maggie Q) who is working for and a love interest to the mastermind behind the cyber attack ex-Department of Defence consultant Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). While Thomas Gabriel orchestrates a ""fire sale"" on the vulnerable US infrastructure and the entire computer system, McClane and Farrell must team up to prevent the fire sale from shutting down the USA and sending it back to the dark ages. It also takes a personal turn for McClane when Thomas Gabriel locates and takes his daughter Lucy hostage.<br/><br/>It was great to see Bruce Willis back as John McClane, with his witty dry humoured one liners, although now he acknowledges that he doesn't receive anything for being a hero at the cost of losing his family and being lonely. McClane also acknowledges that he is ""that guy"" that gets thrown into the action because there is no one else to do it. Justin Long as Matt Farrell was a bit whiny and wimpy at first, but he still acts as a decent sidekick for McClane. Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel is a lot different to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, William Sadler's Colonel Stuart or Jeremy Irons' Simon, but he made a decent villain as the icy, grimacing mastermind behind the cyber attack aiming to create anarchy across the USA. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy Gennaro McClane was excellent as John's estranged feisty daughter. A memorable scene for Lucy was when she tells Matt Farrell to dig deep and find his manhood.<br/><br/>Len Wiseman (Underworld) takes over the director's reigns of Die Hard 4.0 and he does a credible job. Composer Marco Beltrami (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Scream) takes over from the late Michael Kamen and ensures he honours Michael Kamen's work by maintaining the similar score , including a few references in the score from previous Die Hard movies. Based on a magazine article ""A Farewell to Arms"", Mark Bomback and David Marconi keep the story mostly realistic and show viewers the reality of what could happen if the country was under a cyber attack and thrown into chaos.<br/><br/>Though some of it is a tad far-fetched, Die Hard 4.0 is definitely worth watching, and Bruce Willis proves he still kicks butt and puts bums on seats. The uncut version of Die Hard 4.0 shows what the movie SHOULD have been if it was not watered down to attract a wider audience. That aside, Die Hard 4.0 is still good entertainment.<br/><br/>Cinema version: 7/10 <br/><br/>Uncut version: 8/10"
"antonjsw1","8","3","5","13 July 2014"," Not quite as good as its predecessors, but a fun action movie nevertheless
","After a 12 year hiatus between this and Die Hard With a Vengeance, John McClane is back in a fun adventure. While the film lacks the hard edge of the three previous entries, is unnecessarily sanitised in an attempt to get a bigger audience; lacks the emotionally satisfying epilogues of 1 and 2, and the brutal fun of 3,it is an entertaining outing that does actually play well to McClane's character, with Bruce Willis wittily acknowledging is older years, including typical parental anxieties about his growing up daughter and as a result has a subtly amusing ""I'm too old for this s***"" vibe throughout the film. <br/><br/>Supporting players are good, Justin Long's and Kevin Smith hacker characters are pretty entertaining, as is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a feisty Lucy McClane. Maggie Q is the standout villain is a ruthless, focused and largely silent character – in fact her boss, head villain Thomas Gabriel (a seriously disgruntled ex-civil servant!) comes off not only weaker and less interesting compared to Maggie Q's character Mai Linh, but does not reach the heights of William Sadler's lead bad guy from Die Hard 2, and certainly is nowhere near the tension and power exuded by both Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman as the Grubers from the previous entries. <br/><br/>As a result of fewer interesting characters this time around, more of the burden falls on Willis, but he carries the film brilliantly, as usual. The plot is actually very clever, but as the film goes towards its climax, it begins to run out of steam somewhat, leading to a rather anti-climactic climax and not hugely satisfying epilogue. However the rest of the film is a lot of fun and very entertaining, with some great action set pieces and some funny wise-cracks. Pacing is very good and the film's interest never flags. Director Len Wiseman keeps the pace zipping along very nicely, and does try very hard to have the action set pieces as in camera rather than visual effects were possible. He also has a lot of reverence from the previous films, are there are some amusing nods to these if you pay attention. The climax with an F35B jet is typical Hollywood OTT and while fun doesn't have the finesse of the Harrier sequence from True Lies. Visual effects of are solid, Steven Duggan's photography is slick, as is Nicolas De Toth's editing . Marco Beltrami produces a very effective score, which stands up very well against Michael Kamen's work from the three previous outings, but brings a new fresh musical atmosphere to the proceedings. <br/><br/>Overall and entertaining and fun picture, and while not quite as good as the previous entries is a worthy sequel."

","Live Free or Die Hard is the fourth installment of the franchise and the first of the revival. It is easily the best one since the original Die Hard. This time, however, the threat is much more global.<br/><br/>You can see Bruce Willis come back as John McClane. He's still making jokes, playing the hero and recalling past episodes, but now, he's a little grumpier, and somewhat less enthusiastic about his life. With him, is Justin Long who plays a quite funny hacker, and Kevin Smith who cameos as an other hacker. Those three are definitively the best actors of the bunch. Opposite them is Timothy Oliphant who does a pretty good job in the role of the main bad guy, and the very sexy, especially in her FBI body armor, Maggie Q as the martial art babe. The rest of the cast delivers a acceptable performance, if little better.<br/><br/>The score has some nice rhythm, the camera shots are good, the editing tight, the action big, and the story very interesting.<br/><br/>However, there are some large logical flaws in the scenario as is always the case when it comes to computers. Usually, that's not much of a problem for most audience members. Also, there's that weird projection screen car ride that's badly done for our time, and the inconsistent reactions from the daughter. Finally, some of the stunts are way beyond human capacity, which wasn't so much a problem in the first episode.<br/><br/>Excellent entertainment."

","'One' 'two' 'three', and finally four. I waited a long time for four too! <br/><br/>Bruce Willis, well what can you say about Bruce that hasn't already been said? You're fired? Maybe although you know that no right minded director is most-likely going to have such a huge creative difference with an icon like Bruce that he would fire him from a project. <br/><br/>This was a fun chapter back into the life of John McClane, again. More than I can say for other movies that have done four it's tough to keep bringing pure magic to the game like this though. Bruce has energy to burn it seems like. He just rolls and you want to follow him through the whole thing wherever he leads. He definitely has more cool than even a lot of the younger actors that are coming up today or have been around for a while even. He's like old school cool with a steely-edged and unpolished finish. I enjoyed the story, it was faster paced then even the preceding chapters, although the first for me will always be the ground-breaking best. The characters in 'Live Free' seemed pretty polished, all except for McClane of course. He just is, what he is...on the job, rough, ready to fight and committed. There was enough to keep you on the edge of the seat, more than enough. The only bone that I had to pick with this high rated action extravaganza is the fact that it didn't need all the special effects that it contained. That's the only reason that I didn't rate it a perfect '10'. <br/><br/>I liked the added new talent (as of lately) Cliff Curtis as Deputy Director Bowman. He is really outstanding as a straight-good guy role as well. I admit he is a savory villain, a fun to hate type, or a bad guy that you want to blast! Curtis is a great cast member. <br/><br/>Truly, Die Hard the first and third to me were the essence of what a tough and well-mapped out story is all about. The original changed the way that I looked at cinema from that point out.<br/><br/>McClane was deep, even with his quick witted come-backs and snappy retorts. He was still, cool as one could be in that situation. It was gritty. It was brutal, and sophisticated, yet funny and simple. It really had it all. So when two came out I saw it and said, ""I liked it but not as much as one."" Then three arrived and I felt good again. Four made me cheer for John McClane all over again...and for that I can't complain!<br/><br/>You can't beat the feeling of exhilaration that comes from the 'Die Hard experience'!!!! Bruce Willis is John McClane. I am so glad that it was Willis that got the part and not Burt Reynolds as they had written the original script for the first film, with him in mind as John McClane.<br/><br/>Try it for yourself, if you haven't seen it already.

Actually, it feels like they just took a bounce of films and edited in McLane a little bit here and there... And the screenplay can *not* been an original DIE HARD-script. This has to have been a script that was too bad for a sole release, so they added McLane to it to make it a bit more ""interesting"". Too bad it doesn't work. A bad script is always a bad script.<br/><br/>Instead of McLane's wife we have his daughter here. That doesn't work at all and feels totally useless.

One man is out there alone and somehow he manages to save everyone, including himself. It isn't important whether our hero is on a building, plane or just on streets but what is important is how the whole movie is made. First ""Die Hard"" is still untouchable and best of series. ""Die Hard 4"" is somewhere in range of the third movie, pushing the second movie on last position. Maybe everything is made better then in a third movie but I just like that movie with Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson as co-stars. On the other hand fourth movie started from nothing and obviously producers decided not to take any big and famous names in this project. They already have Willis and they decided to cast young, promising actors (Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Maggie Q). I agree with that decision because I think that all of them did good job. Especially Justin Long who really surprised me. He acted very good in role of young, scared hacker. Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and he's so confident in this role. Another good one for Willis who really needed this after few years of ""non hit"" movies (period from ""The Sixth Sense"" to ""Sin City""). But don't worry about Willis cause he's really someone you can call movie star. If producers had 100 million dollars (I just took one number), they decided to gave 20 to Willis, 10 for other actors and director and everything else in action scenes. Direction of this one was given to young Len Wiseman (only ""Underworld"" series) and he did a good job in putting lots of action scenes in the plot. He really stayed loyal, to other movies of the series, on number of action during the movie and that is a good thing.<br/><br/>Everything I talked about so far was good sides of this movie but as any other this one has it's bad sides. It is mostly making the impossible possible. For me impossible is for a man to jump out of a running car, to jump on a plane, to survive fall from great heights, to survive all those bullets who are meant for him. And after everything, he can run again like nothing happened until the last scene where he sits on the floor longer then usually. He even shot himself but hey, that's John McClane. I always watch that realistic side in every movie and I can understand that jumping out of car became normal but I just can't pass over some things. When I'm saying this I don't mean only about this movie but to all those movies who are making things like this possible to a normal man (John McClane is human and not some Terminator or Jack Sparrow adventure character).<br/><br/>Putting everything together all I can say is that mostly I enjoyed in this movie and for me this is good action movie. Just turn off that realistic point of view and maybe you'll find this movie excellent. There is some good acting and some really good special effects that are important sides of this movie and I recommend this one to everyone who want good action movie. You'll probably get what you expect. I did."
"smickey","3","3","5","3 August 2007"," Disappointing...
","Those who like the saga of detective John McLaine being in the wrong place at the wrong moment may be disappointed as the movie does not really keep the promises because compared with the others it is far too exaggerated. Only John McLaine of course can drive a trailer the way he does and destroy an Fighter. And what about the fight with the Chinese girl. That hit the roof. Come on... he hits her full power frontally with an SUV and she survives without a scratch, also after being dragged through various walls and landing in an elevator shaft. Who is she wonder woman? Is she one of the Fantastic Four? And the bad guy is really not a bad guy. He is not convincing at all. Much better the bad guys of the other films. Also the Feds played a poor role. The story as such seems pretty realistic. These type of situations may happen as all is based on computer controlled technology. Unfortunately the story that the guy was angry is not a new one this year, with the difference that The Breach was much better. Disappointing is the current Hollywood wave of using Europeans as bad guys. OK a European group played also the bad guys in the other movies, but this starts to be annoying and shows only a certain attitude towards the rest of the world."

","A 4th July movie; I performed the obligatory preparations (especially leaving my brain at home) and sat down to watch two hours of pure eye-candy. What I saw instead, before I walked out forty minutes later, was a gross insult to my optical nerves, my gluteus maximus, and my wallet. I didn't watch the last half of the movie; it might have been the best use of celluloid since 'Independence Day', but after twitching through half-an-hour of badly-stitched clichés of much better movies, my tolerance alarm was blaring too loud for me to care. The sight of Venus setting over the hills as I left the cinema was the cheapest and most rewarding experience of the evening. <br/><br/>When I invest 8 in dodging the rain, I expect instant dividends, not a random sequence of eavesdroppings from fellow customers mumbling 'jealous dad from Armageddon', 'escort like 16 Blocks' and 'control room from WarGames', yet the moving air from each end of the audience's alimentary canals was the highlight of the performance. <br/><br/>Quite simply, I didn't care; without the necessary diet of action, my brain regained control and I became increasingly frustrated at the insulting script, offensive acting, embarrassing nods to Globalism and oh-so-fashionable abuse of colour and contrast. I won't be the first to say this, and I certainly won't be the last: if 'Die Hard 4.0' is the best that the USA has to offer, I wish the British had won the War of Independence."

","I was just complaining to a friend that there aren't enough FUN movies being released (not counting animation). It seems like there are so many sad endings and dark message movies out there lately. & The fun movies that are out there have way too much CGI. I missed the good, 'ole fun action movie.<br/><br/>So I was so happy when I rented ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and I got taken on a fun, action ride. There is a great mix of chase scenes, fight scenes, and humor. The relationship between Bruce Willis' character and Justin Long's character is perfect, and it was probably my favorite aspect of this film. I had no opinion of Justin Long prior to seeing this, and now I think he is very funny and talented.<br/><br/>There are plenty of stunt-packed action sequences too. My only small criticism is that the action is almost too over-the-top. I understand that when watching a great action film, you usually need to suspend disbelief and go with it. However, some of the crashes and falls that characters lived through were SO enormous. It was like they had nine lives. So I would say that it did detract from the suspense of it a touch because I had no frame of reference as to what would actually kill a person or what qualified as true danger...<br/><br/>But that really is a small thing. Just go into it expecting a fun, thrilling ride and you will definitely get it!"

","""Live Free or Die Hard"", a long anticipated sequel of John McClane'f films, the Action / Adventure / Crime / Thriller is pure fun for its 130 minutes of run time. Almost twenty years after he single handedly (and barefooted) stood up against the group of ruthless international terrorists that held hostages, including John McClane's wife, Holly, in a Los Angeles skyscraper on one Christmas night, New York cop, tough guy John McClane is back. In the fourth ""Die Hard"" movie, McClane faces the biggest challenge of his career and the stakes are unbelievably high. In the first ""Die Hard"", the bad guys took over the building, in the second film, McClane was against a team of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (Sadler) who was holding the entire airport hostage. In the third one a man calling himself ""Simon"" (Jeremy Irons) threatened to detonate bombs around New York City unless Detective John McClane cooperated in a game of ""Simon Says"". In the latest ""Die Hard"" installment, low-tech McClane(""You're a Timex watch in a digital age"", he's been told) is up against a ring of highly intelligent and dangerous Internet techno-terrorists who are very close to taking control of America's computer infrastructure, breaking in and shutting down all the networks, creating havoc and panic around the country in ""fire sale"". As the young hacker who happened to be on of the terrorists targets, explains, ""It's a three-step... it's a three-step systematic attack on the entire national infrastructure. Okay, step one: take out all the transportation. Step two: the financial base and telecoms. Step three: You get rid of all the utilities. Gas, water, electric, nuclear. Pretty much anything that's run by computers which... which today is almost everything. So that's why they call it a fire sale, because everything must go."" Technical terrorists-geniuses thoroughly thought through every possible small detail of the vicious fire sale attack but they did not include in their plan one variable, sarcastic, cynical, disappointed and wise cracking Detective John McClane who now works for Homeland Security. I loved the movie. It is a very decent entry in the ""Die Hard"" series. It is creative, the fights and explosions are spectacular, and the action sequences are full of adrenalin. John McClane is older, that's true but nothing can slow him down, and certainly not his age. When he is on the screen saving the day, his daughter, and his country, I know he would get every one of the bad guys, and I hope that he will be back - for another ""Die Hard"" movie.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the first movie I've seen on Blue-Ray disk and I was very impressed by the quality of the picture and the sound. Since I have not seen it in the theater, it is the next best thing. :)"
"Slack_Er","6","4","8","25 December 2007"," Die Hard 4: Die Nerdier
","Is it just me, or has the Die Hard franchise gotten progressively worse as the movies take John McClane outdoors? The first movie -- inside a claustrophobic building -- great stuff! The second film -- mostly inside an airport -- not as good as part one, but still good stuff! The third film, highways and all types of outdoor environments -- sucked! And the same goes for the latest installment. I read a quote by Bruce Willis where he said this was the best Die Hard film yet, maybe that should have been the catch to avoid this film. How many sequels that have the actor promising ""this one is the best yet"" have ever lived up to that billing? And what ever happened to tough bad guys? The head villain in this film is a nerdy hacker who may be the only career hacker who wears Armani clothes. And his top dog is a kung-fu Xena who I doubt weighs more than 90 pounds. I guess these are the only people 50-year-old Bruce Willis can still spar with. This film has so many references to teenagers, online games, hackers, and Star Wars action figures, John McClane no longer looked like the biggest, baddest cop around, he simply looked like the only who ever saw any action under the sheets."

","The problem with IMDb these days is that too many people use it, thus mediocre populist special effects extravaganzas like this can achieve a score of 7.8.<br/><br/>The original Die Hard was a great movie. Die Hard 2 was a remake of the first film, albeit even more far fetched. By the third installment they had lost the plot altogether, and this one is virtually incoherent.<br/><br/>There is NOTHING in the way of suspense, and the action is not so much unbelievable as blatantly impossible. For instance:<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>None of the hackers ever once pick up a mouse. Yet their screens are covered by Windows. Clearly these hackers have mastered the Windows key strokes down pat. If you thought the hacking presented in Swordfish was bad then this is even worse. When will Hollywood realise that there's nothing cinematic in hacking, even if you speed up the process by 1,000,000%? <br/><br/>Some of the hackers were also martial arts experts and extremely fit people.<br/><br/>When McLane gets thrown out of the 4th floor window, bounces down various pieces of steel pipework without breaking any ribs, then jumps into and hotwires a 4x4, drives it up 4 levels car park, then through a glass wall into their power stations main server room... did it never occur to anyone that it would be really stupid to have a server room that controls the national grid of the eastern seaboard of the US separated from it's car park by only a glass partition?<br/><br/>And how about the scene where a state of the art jet fighter is unable to hit his 18 wheel truck with a missile, yup McLane's reflexes are so highly developed he can dodge missiles in a truck. Then when the plane shoots down the flyover the truck is driving on, McLane manages to jump 60ft from the truck onto the roof of the plane, while the pilot EJECTS, then hangs onto the plane while it enters a spin, before finalling leaping 100ft onto another section of flyover, sliding 300ft down it at an angle of 80 degrees, only to walk way from the whole incident.<br/><br/>Then there's the scene where they escape fire from a heavy machine gun by hiding beind a plasterboard partition. In real life even then people 2 buildings away could be shot by that thing... Then when the 2 pounds of C4 goes off it only takes out one side of the plasterboard partition (remember the original Die Hard where a similar quantity of explosive caused structural damage to a 40 story skyscraper???<br/><br/>I new as soon as the machine gun fire kicked in only 90 seconds into the movie that it was going to be pants and it was.<br/><br/>Makes Rambo 2 look like Bad Day at Black Rock.<br/><br/>AVOID!"
"napalmskunk","5","4","8","27 August 2007"," Die hard 4
","Seriously this film is awful and that is as spot on as it gets. I watched it thinking of all the reviews be it on here or most of the TV/reporter reviewers and i was all excited. I mean how many of us have seen the die hard movies on TV about 50 times plus? Exactly.<br/><br/>For me the order in terms of quality of action and film goes 1,3,2 and lastly 4. Now i watched this today and couldn't believe how bad 4 was, ideally i'd have rated it 5 maybe 6 out of 10. First McClain is telling jokes like Arnie in T3 then he seems not only weaker but at the same time able to do more strength moves and stunts, i mean he hangs off waiting for a falling drop 3 times!! Then there's the fact that nothing actually happens in the film, i mean some hacker guy along with John gets chased 3 times thats about it and the helicopters are done to the death. The tunnel scene where the car flips over a million times just makes you think this is Hollywood in dreamworld x10, and that says something. You literally think ""yeah right"" not to mention the 'kung fu' girl who gets hit by a 4x4 at 40-60 and survives to fight John McClain likes shes just been born, fresh as a daisy.<br/><br/>Although all that is film content if i was to be major picky then i could say the GUI computer content is a bit too OTT like Hackers was. You don't just execute a virus and see a lovely screen showing you it in that way. Sorry i know it has to work for the basic public but it washes down as well as the action scenes did. That lorry swerve worked like a race of Mario Kart.. Again Yeah right.<br/><br/>My advice watch this movie for free as any cost in £pounds will hurt you. We all love Bruce but like T3 all good things should be left alone."
"moimoichan6","4","4","8","8 August 2007"," Die Hard : 4.0/10.0
","Funny how references and influences seems to suffer from a boomerang effect these days. Take the ""Die Hard"" movies for instance, whereas the first one almost immediately turned into a classic that redefined the way Hollywood creates action movies for years, the last one that resurrects a series everyone thought definitely over, is just an average movie, that barely copies elements we already saw ten times or more (an informatics terrorist treat, a tired and angry (anti)-heroes who's unhappy to have to save the world one more time, etc). And the most annoying thing is that you already saw that in the previous ""Die Hard"", but also in other series, like ""24"", which are directly inspired by ""Die Hard"" (unity of time and space, charismatic terrorists, realism in the action scenes, and Jack Bauer has a lot to see with John McClane : he's also a tragic hero who sacrifice everything for his country and has nothing in return). And the least I can say is that this ""Live free or die hard"" is of course the worst of the ""Die Hard"" movies, but it's also worst than modern action series like ""24"".<br/><br/>This movie deals with a very ""modern"" subject (that will certainly look ridiculous and old-fashion in ten years, just like this movie) : a giant informatics virus is put in the internet by terrorists in order to destroy civilization and send it back to the stone age (and, for it's a ""Die Hard"", also make a lot of money...). But one man, that seems to belong to this stone age and doesn't know anything in new technologies (in ""Die Hard 2"", he didn't know how to use a phone in a plane !) will break their evil plan : this man is John McClane.<br/><br/>No surprise from the script that passively gives the spectator his blockbuster dose of adrenaline, action and humor. And this lack of originality in the story is underlined by the platitude of the directing : cold photography to give an high-tech and modern aspect, movie for TV-style as soon as the action scenes are done, and impressive (McClane crash a car in a helicopter ?), but boring (saw that already, it's Jack Bauer in ""Matrix"", isn't it ?) action scenes. Where the hell is the inventive and inspiration of McTiernan ? Where is his glorious use of space, the great use of vertical in the building of the fist movie and the amazing horizontal use of NYC in the third in this impersonal movie. Ha, right, John McTiernan is now too old for Hollywood since the ""the 13rd Warrior"" experience, and producers prefer inoffensive ""yes-man"" like Len Wiseman to finish plate sequels as this one on time.<br/><br/>It's really a sad period for popular cinema, when Hollywood only recycles itself, doing unless sequels, prequels, remakes or adaptations. And it's not even as if they're as good as the old ones..."
"asc85","4","4","8","13 July 2007"," Ridiculous
","Went to see this movie because the reviews were generally positive. Although this film had it's entertaining moments, the action scenes were ridiculous. The film actually reminded me of ""Eraser"" that came out a number of years ago with Arnold, which was similarly ridiculous.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: <br/><br/>I guess John McClane must be Superman in disguise for taking all those hits and falls, and getting up like nothing happened. The most ridiculous one of them all was when he leaps from the helicopter, and the piece of road is used to break his fall. <br/><br/>The other ridiculous moment (non-action) is when the bad guys rescue his daughter from the elevator. And before she gets out, she goes, ""Can I see some ID?"" Now, what would happen if they didn't have ID? Is she going to run away? Is she going to stay in the elevator? It's OK to ask that when you're protected by your house. But in a stuck elevator with no one else there? <br/><br/>I also didn't like Justin Long as the snarky Generation Y kid. It was fun to see Kevin Smith in a role other than what he does in his own films, but I doubt someone would be that flippant when the country is being destroyed.<br/><br/>Only Maggie Q was especially good. But she also must have ""Superman"" genes in her final fight scene, when she kept staying alive no matter what happened."
"xamsx","6","4","8","6 July 2007"," Die Hard 4.0
","When I first heard that a fourth Die Hard movie was being made, I cringed. Whilst many of my friends tried to convince me otherwise, I always thought it would be an above average modern action movie, but not a good Die Hard movie. The whole concept of making a fourth Die Hard movie twelve years after the last one just further strengthens my belief that Hollywood has run out of original ideas; this is the summer of sequels and heavily laden source material movies after all.<br/><br/>The movie started off in a promising way with the introduction of McClane (Willis) in a scene with his daughter Lucy (Winstead), the dialogue in which reminding me of the McClane of old. By the time the first action scene roles around it still has the feel somewhat of the older Die Hard's with a good old fashioned shootout, culminating in an explosion. The subsequent conversation between McClane and his new sidekick Farrell (Long) reflecting on McClane's age and the fact he hasn't been in a situation like this for some time, was a nice way of mirroring within the film that the Die Hard franchise has been gone for a while. This is something that I felt could maybe have been played on a bit more, but unfortunately wasn't and for me this is where it stopped being a Die Hard film and just became another generic Bruce Willis action movie that he has been making for the past 10 years.<br/><br/>The script I felt had promise and in parts was indeed funny, but overall it didn't have the wit or charm of the previous instalments, despite some solid acting and enjoyable scenes between Willis and Long. The direction was very disjointed and confusing in places (notably one conversation between two characters where there must be 10-15 cuts and 5 different shot types) which I found distracting, but maybe was just me being too scrutinous.<br/><br/>The villains did not only not compare to previous Die Hard films but were pretty unbelievable and badly acted, with the lead villain Gabriel being played very wooden by Timothy Olyphant. This perhaps was not entirely his own fault due to his limited locations and surroundings, but his henchman that seemed to survive massive blunt force trauma at high speeds, falls from high heights and huge explosions with minor injuries were quite laughably unbelievable. Especially the parkour frenchman that was seemingly capable or running faster than bullets.<br/><br/>This air of ridiculous seemed to transpire to the later action scenes, that whilst being grand and impressive, were frankly just entirely unbelievable. The previous instalments did indeed have some quite outrageous scenes, but nothing compared to these. The charm of the previous ones were based around the fact that McClane was just your average guy that was put into these situations, never thinking himself a hero but always acting as one. In this film he seems more like an indestructible comic book super hero.<br/><br/>Overall this film just feels like a modern Bruce Willis action flick with the Die Hard title slapped on to make it a bigger draw and to gain more revenue. It is enjoyable in parts as long as you're not willing to take it seriously and if you can sit through the ""war on terror"" propaganda. If you're looking for a Die Hard movie though, watch or indeed watch again the original, instead of this watered down and censored summer ""blockbuster""."

","I read all the critics reviews of the new Die Hard movie and knew I would not like the film. My expectations were very low and after seeing the film I got exactly what I expected. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! Critics usually lower their standards during the summer, when most of the movies suck anyway. Furthermore, they are giving praise to Die Hard 4 because they are fed up with CGI-infested action/comic movies. Die Hard 4 does not use a lot of CGI.<br/><br/>On to the movie. The script is horrible. The dialog is bland and repetitive. The side characters and villains are boring. Justin Long was better than I thought he'd be, but his performance is no where near Sam Jackson's in DH3. Bruce Willis tries his best, but the bad script and poor one-liners and lack of swearing ruin his efforts. This is a cheesy action movie with Die Hard slapped on the prints. All attempts to recall the previous films are vague and forced. Len Wiseman may be good at action sequences, but he turned Die Hard into a cartoon. The lighting and cinematography don't resemble Die Hard at all. The Previous 3 films looked and felt like Die Hard movies. This feels like Underworld or Enemy of the State. The action is way over the top. The beauty of the previous entries was that the action slowly built up through the film and the progression made things believable. In this film, there is no progression, just gratuitous action scenes that are there just for show, not for story. I love the previous Die Hard films, but this one made it Jump the Shark, a la Lethal Weapon 3 and 4. The only reason I'd want there to be a DH5 would be so they could bring in a writer and director who would stay faithful to the previous 3 installments. They should just pretend DH4 never happened. Don't even rent it.<br/><br/>I think the studio wanted PG-13 because they knew they had a lemon of a movie and wanted to get more people out to see it. They were also afraid of Transformers. They should be. Transformers was way better."

Had a strong feeling of déja-vu about it... this practically was ""Firewall"" 2.0 with added scenes from ""Speed"" and ""True Lies"", using McClane as a connection to the previous ""Die Hard"" movies, and rehashing plot elements from other recent Bruce Willis films, like ""Hostage""... Come to think about it, ""Hostage"" could've been a better choice for a ""Die Hard"" sequel than this.<br/><br/>It also felt cramped and unrealistic. Which is strange, considering that we're no longer dealing with an enclosed, claustrophobic setting, and McClane is now zipping along the East Coast with ease (helicopter lessons, anyone???) I think some sequels should never be made... this is one of them.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film was just as bad as ""Alien vs. Predator"", and demonstrates that: 1) when a studio (FOX) itches to continue a franchise, it sweeps aside the mythos and character development (like the above-mentioned ""AvP"", someone else suggested ""Superman Returns"") and 2) Len Wiseman, far from being a hot young director with bright ideas (personally, I found the ""Underworld"" films idiotic) is just another run-of-the-mill hack like Uwe Boll. Definitely, Wiseman is no David Fincher; sadly, he can't even be a Michael Bay!<br/><br/>Last, but not least, what's with all these bad hacker stereotypes? Back in '95 they would've still been cool and fresh, but this is a 2007 film, and even the hacker in ""The Core"" was more believable."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","8","2 July 2007"," All the usual ingredients, but well put together
","Here we have all the usual ingredients of a police thriller. <br/><br/>Item: Standard odd couple of hard-as-nail old cop and another. After a rapid-fire rapper in ""Block 16"", Bruce Willis has this time a computer wiz kid. <br/><br/>Item: Cute daughter a generation gap away. <br/><br/>Item: Jet plane coming UNDER a freeway fly-over at attack a ground vehicle. <br/><br/>Item: Mind boggling IT warfare. <br/><br/>Item: All kinds of spectacular action expected of this genre. <br/><br/>Item: Smart-Alex one liners.<br/><br/>I can go on, but that is the general state of things. Ever since day one, topping the gun-taped-to-naked-back sequence has been a mission impossible. And yet, ""Underworld"" director Len Wisemen has managed to put together a vastly entertaining 4th installment of Die Hard. <br/><br/>The funniest moment is when Willis blocks the surveillance cameras of the bad guys and asks in a whisper his IT pal to check the source. ""You block the camera with your hand but the microphone is still on"", comes the voice of the bad guy. The best eye candy is Maggie Q walking around looking so beautiful and cool, both. One reference that some may miss is John McClane's reply to his daughter about his crazy coup of shooting through his own shoulder to get the bad guy that grabbed him from behind, ""It seems a good idea at the time"". That is of course Steve McQueen's famous line from ""The magnificent seven""."
"Superunknovvn","6","4","8","1 July 2007"," Just when I thought old fashioned action movies were dead...
","""Live Free Or Die Hard"" is a delight. It brings back old fashioned action movies that have been substituted by martial arts movies ever since... well, ever since ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" came out. John McClane even makes a little reference to that when he just runs over a martial arts-fighter with his truck. This man doesn't fight with any hipster techniques. It's John McClane, for Christ's sake.<br/><br/>I've only really come to love the ""Die Hard""-franchise in the past couple of months. The first three parts were on TV and watching them one after the other they become more and more fun (although, part 3 remains the only really good movie, in my opinion). Add to that the wonderful song and video ""Die Hard"" by a band called Guyz Nite (you can watch the clip on youtube), and I got myself seriously hyped up for the latest entry in the series.<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about John McClane is that there's really no reason why a whole franchise should be dedicated to him. He could just be any wisecracking cop-character that has ever been played by Bruce Willis. The only thing linking up from one part to the other is that McClane has an ex-wife. That's about the only connection from movie to movie. It's not even Christmas anymore when John is ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" and Allen is missed, too. That doesn't really matter, though. The ""Die Hard""-moniker just makes sure producers put twice as much effort into developing cool action sequences and promoting the movie appropriately.<br/><br/>So here we are again. This time McClane has a daughter. He's a bit older and not much happier than before. This movie comes off a little darker in tone than the previous ones and due to the absence of Samuel L. Jackson it's far from being as much fun as ""...With A Vengeance"".<br/><br/>Another difference is that this time, all of America is threatened by terrorists not just McClane himself. His involvement in the events has never been as far fetched, but then the whole story is completely far fetched with the computer terrorists being able to control EVERYTHING - the traffic, the media, the military - with just one mouse click. McClane gets beaten up and thrown around so much in this movie and some action sequences are so far out (especially one with a jet that shoots rockets at our hero) that you constantly have to remind yourself to keep the old brain switched off. At times the oneliners aren't as good as they should be and some action sequences are just too much.<br/><br/>Still, that's part of the appeal of these movies and it's one of the reasons why this franchise is so much fun. After three parts of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" I couldn't say that I want to see any more of these flicks. With ""Die Hard"" it's different. John McClane beating up terrorists just never gets old. Yippee-ki-yay!"
"krueger95","2","5","11","26 July 2007"," McClane isn't nice anymore
","Die Hard 4 wasn't as bad as most of todays sequels of classical series (like the disastrous new ""Bond movie"", Superman Returns, etc.). It was even almost as funny, awesome and action filled like Die Hard 1 and 2. Die Hard 3 was just depressing stuff, which couldn't be watched as a holiday movie anymore.<br/><br/>So i was surprised by the quality of Die Hard 4. But 2 scenes ruined it. The first one when one of the bad guys told via walkie-talkie that McLane was at the second floor and then you hear McLane shoot him. This guy was completely defenseless and at the former Die Hard movies he simply would have knocked him out. But shooting a defenseless guy is no hero or anti hero stuff at all. Its simply bad guy stuff.<br/><br/>The second one was when he enters the drivers cabin of the truck at the end of the movie and killed the driver by shooting through the closed door. Once again this isn't hero behavior, this is simply first degree murder (just watch ""Raiders of the lost ark"" to see how things are done correctly). So McLane isn't the grouchy hero anymore, he is simply a killer. And this destroys the complete mood of the movie, which would have been otherwise good, old popcorn cinema you could watch every holiday."
"andrewmerritt-31652","9","2","3","27 January 2019"," What is wrong with critics?
","Live Free or Die Hard is the fourth installment in the Die Hard franchise and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. In this newest edition John McClane has to escort this hacker to Washington D.C. before some cyber terrorists kill him. After John McTiernan left after directing Die Hard and Die Hard with a Vengeance, the studio brought in Len Wiseman to take up the reigns. Len Wiseman is known for directing the Underworld movies and what he gave us is an MTV music video that's very gothic. And what I like about this new Die Hard is instead of dealing with your typical bland terrorists they substitute that and give us cyber terrorists, which is a scary thought if you think about it. And John McClane is useless when it comes to technology because he's a 19th century person living in a 21st century world so he has to have a sidekick who's familiar with technology. And just like Die Hard with a Vengeance where Samuel L Jackson was the sidekick this new sidekick played by Justin Long is equally as good as Samuel L Jackson. Live Free or Die Hard is like 1984 and Brave New World of action movies without making it too dystopian where the main villain played by timothy Olyphant acts like as a sort of big brother meets Mustapha Mond if he were a real person. He's not like Hans Gruber or Simon Gruber, but he's entertaining as he channels in his inner rage, and you hate him, but everything that comes out of his mouth is hilarious. I should address that unlike the previous Die Hard's, which had an R rating, this Die Hard has a PG-13 rating so John McClane won't say his catchphrase. And because of this there were so many critics complaining and whining about how this isn't John McClane or this isn't a Die Hard movie. And my response is people need to relax. This definitely counts as a Die Hard movie. I mean it may be different because it has a new breed of terrorists, but it's still Die Hard nonetheless. And you can still buy the DVD and switch it to the unrated version where you can still hear John McClane's famous catchphrase. Its not like Len Wiseman isn't going to make his own Die Hard movie and not give us what we want. He still gives us the Die Hard and John McClane that we all know and love, just in his own unique way. So in the end, I say don't listen to the critics go out and see this movie and experience a different side of Die Hard that has the right ingredients of a summer blockbuster."
"Hey_Sweden","6","2","3","12 January 2016"," One good thing about it: it makes me want to crank some CCR.
","The ""Die Hard"" franchise gets reinvented for the technology-driven 21st century in this long but somewhat diverting action picture. Bruce Willis is in fine form as terminally tough and cranky NYC senior detective John McClane. He ends up having yet another of his trademark REALLY bad days when he agrees to do a favour for the FBI. His task is to pick up a hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), and bring him to the authorities in DC. What McClane doesn't know is that Farrell was exploited by psychotic techies, led by cyber terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who want to shut down the whole country.<br/><br/>The formula was already beginning to wear thin by this point. While it is fun to see Willis do his wisecracking, tougher than thou routine, the material isn't as entertaining (as topical as it may be). Part of the problem here is that the bad guys sort of lack personality. Most of them, save maybe for Thomas' henchwoman / girlfriend Mai (the sexy Maggie Q) are just standard issue goons. As directed by Len Wiseman, the movie is never, ever boring - I give it credit for hitting the ground running - but it ends up being pretty damn stupid. In these movies, we always expect McClane to turn into some sort of superman who handles the problems almost single handedly, but that aspect gets pushed to another level here, with an absurdly over the top finale. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is slickly made, as far as it goes, but feels more generic than the previous entries.<br/><br/>Long is good as the kind of character who the viewer might dislike at first: he's annoying, but after a while, he begins to ""grow a pair"", as they say, and proves himself worthy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fairly spunky as the now-grown Lucy McClane. The consistently solid Cliff Curtis does his best as a no nonsense federal agent. Olyphant is usually money in the bank, but his villain is rather boring and unmemorable. Filmmaker Kevin Smith is somewhat amusing in the role of a very stereotypical loser / master hacker.<br/><br/>This kills 129 minutes in entertaining enough fashion, but is more for the undemanding action fan than truly discerning viewers.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."
"Wuchakk","7","2","3","18 September 2015"," Big, dumb action flick delivers
","RELEASED IN 2007 and directed by Len Wiseman, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the fourth installment in the Die Hard series. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is ordered to pick up a youth hacker (Justin Long) who's targeted by cyber-terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel and Mai Linh (Timothy Olyphant & Maggie Q). Their goal is to create chaos by taking over the USA's transportation grids and stock market. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's cute and feisty daughter while Kevin Smith has a small role as a computer geek living in his Mom's basement.<br/><br/>Rigid fans complain that this sequel is ""Die Hard in name only"" because I guess it deviates from formula but, really, the Die Hard series is ANY challenging adventure that John McClane experiences just as the 007 flicks consist of James Bond in differing challenges; same thing with Dirty Harry. In any case, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" works as Die Hard sequel or as a stand-alone action flick with Bruce Willis. The story holds your attention while the action scenes are out of this world. They're so over-the-top that some write the movie off as absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone so it helps the viewer go along with the ridiculous things that happen rather than tune out.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns,"" but ""Live Free or Die Hard"" evades that ditch by giving us fairly interesting characters and a compelling story. It may not be great but it certainly fills the bill if you're in the mood for a wild action flick.<br/><br/>I like the continuity of the series: McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is acknowledged here and we meet his daughter, now a hottie, and hear of his son, Jack. We learn of the severe price that John's bold, serious approach to his profession has had on his personal life. These things are further explored in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" (2013), which is basically just as good as this installment.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 128 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California. WRITERS: Mark Bomback and David Marconi conceived the story/script based on an article by John Carlin.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","One night, McClaine is asked to pick up a pesky hacker, Matt Farrell (Long) and his night is supposed to be finished. It turns out to be much more. McClaine brings Farrell to DC with him to try to stop a cyber terrorist (Olyphant) I was insanely hyped for this movie's arrival. I've been hyped before, but rarely like I was for this sequel. I'm an avid fan of the first three Die Hard movies. Die Hard 2's enjoyment has started to wane for me, Die Hard 1 and 3 are two of my favorite action movies of all time. This movie didn't live up to my unreasonable hype (How could it?!) But it did entertain me heavily. My main mistake was expecting the ""old style"" of Die Hard when I first saw this. It was a little weird seeing a Die Hard movie take place in 2007. Despite how entertaining it was, it didn't feel like a Die Hard movie when I first watched it. Everything was far too modern and advanced. Upon further viewings of this movie, this is no longer an issue. I've seen it 4 times since it first came out, and I always manage to enjoy it a lot. The action delivers in a big way. McClaine was beginning his transition from lucky to Superman, but the action scenes are great. There is a great one with a lot of vehicle carnage in a tunnel. Another good one is in the finale. It's ridiculously OTT, but it provides a lot of thrills. If you love action like I do, you won't be disappointed. I do think they could have gone further with cyber terrorism. That's a minor carp though. Bruce Willis is as dependable as ever as McClaine. He hadn't lost a step and he was a joy to watch. There aren't many things better than watching McClaine do his thing. When Willis is motivated, he's always a blast to watch. Justin Long is Bruce's match. His incessant whining entertained me. I also loved his chemistry with Willis. I was really disappointed he wasn't brought back for the 5th sequel. Timothy Olyphant is decent as the villain. His intensity is surprisingly lacking and he was weirdly subdued for his standards. He has flashes of brilliance, but I felt he could have done more with the part. Maggie Q plays a sexy badass! Not much more to it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fine as McClaine's daughter, but her part is a bit thin. I also thought the estranged relationship with McClaine could have been more powerful. Kevin Smith is OK. I did wonder why they didn't add Bonnie Bedelia! I wanted my Holly fix.<br/><br/>I watch this at least once a year and proudly own it on DVD! It may not have been what I hoped for, but it's a solid action movie without a doubt. The action is tremendous, the storytelling is good enough to keep your attention. It may not be the sequel we deserved, but I like it anyway! It's certainly better than parts 2 and 5. <br/><br/>7.3/10"
"manitobaman81","7","2","3","21 August 2014"," Good
","The story is nothing special, but exceptional performances from most of the cast go a long way. McClane and a young hacker join forces to take down master cyber-terrorist who likes evil. The cinematography is stark and bare. It's fun watching it because its complexity begins within its characters. This is one of those movies that Willis isn't only in for the paycheck. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone dialog and attempts and comic relief. I don't care what they say, Willis is a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. The screenplay is tight and well-written, and it's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one."

","Len Wiseman directed this fourth entry, which sees Bruce Willis returning as Police Officer John McClane after a 12-year absence. Here, John is sent to find a computer hacker named Matt Farrell(played by Justin Long) wanted by the FBI, but it turns out that someone else wants him dead as well, since his apartment is shot up, forcing McClane to flee with his suspect, and try to get him to safety, but it turns out that disgruntled former federal employee Thomas Gabriel(played by Timothy Olyphant) is behind it, and is planning to take down the entire computerized system of the U.S. to get even, and expose its vulnerability to international terrorists. When he kidnaps John's daughter Lucy(played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) this suddenly gets personal... Entertaining return to form for John McClane with an interesting plot and lots of action.

"Tehmeh","7","2","3","26 November 2013"," I had to forgive a lot with this one.
","The best action movies were made in the 80's. Die Hard was among them. While the sequels (especially Die Hard 2) didn't improve on the first one - which isn't exactly a flaw, since the first one is a classic and almost impossible to top - they did have that certain grit and 80's feel to them.<br/><br/>With Die Hard 4.0 (sigh, that's what it's called here in the nordics), I had to forgive a lot of things in the movie to enjoy it. I still haven't found the non-PG13 blu-ray with finnish subtitles, so currently I'm stuck with the theatrical release.<br/><br/>These are my gripes: <br/><br/><ul><li>PG13 is useless. The trend to release everything in PG13 is insulting to action movie lovers. I don't even know what bothers me the most, the awkward and awful almost-cursing (""jerkoff!"") or the lack of brutal, impactful violence. The way the movie is cut somehow does seem to make up for the lack of blood without totally losing the impact, but anyway these are significant shortcomings for me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>John McClane is not a superhero nor should be treated as such. When I think about my favorite scenes from the three previous movies, I never (not even once) thought that ""hey, this scene would be better if that guy fought a jet"". It's not the SCALE of things that made the first film a genre classic, it was a very confined environment with a lot of simple battles.</li></ul><br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>Those are my gripes with Die Hard 4, and I'm not alone with them. Anyway, onto the good stuff. The story is decent enough. Willis is still (mostly) okay, and there's something about Timothy Olyphant that I can't quite grasp. I love watching the guy, yet his character doesn't seem really menacing. I don't fear him, I don't even hate him that much, but I want to watch him. It's weird in a positive way for me. Justin long manages fine as a stuttering sidekick/exposition device. Kevin Smith was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>The action is (minus the ridiculous jet scene) passable for a PG13 flick. Lots of cool moves and stunts, won't complain. I thought the movie got gradually a little bit worse as it progressed, but the surprisingly good start (apartment shootout scene) somehow carried the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I still probably like this more than Die Hard 2, but then again the PG13-rating can, in time, make me change my mind. Naturally the first and third are superior to both Die Hard 2 and this one.<br/><br/>This could've been a pretty awesome action film if treated properly. A solid R-rating from the beginning, tighter script with more tense action without certain ridiculous ""big"" scenes, a more interested Bruce Willis...but the ship sailed. Die Hard 4 is OK, if you're willing to forgive some of its shortcomings.<br/><br/>I skipped Die Hard 5. Everything that people say (read a lot of reviews here on IMDb, had some friends even warn me not to see it) makes me not want to see it. And I won't, I don't hate myself that much.<br/><br/>If the producers/filmmakers/Bruce remember or care about what's good in this franchise to begin with and deliver a good sixth entry, I will give that one a chance. I'm not holding my breath."

John McClane is back with an even bigger bang. Justin Long has a few jokes as the fast talking computer geek. But all the computer talk doesn't really fit the Die Hard franchise.

"JoeStok13","8","2","3","28 March 2013"," Incredible Mix of Modern Cybercrime and Old-School Die Hard
","First of all, congratulations to Len Wiseman for not messing this up and creating a brainless shootout movie. I was so worried that was going to happen. But it didn't, so thank Len.<br/><br/>The plot was excellent, because of the great antagonist who basically wants to bring down the U.S with a massive cyber attack. Great acting by all the cast members, especially Jason Long who brings that bit of 'hopeless guy humor' after a classic John McClane action scene. This epic nerd who calls himself 'Warlock' and lives in his mom's basement also assists and pisses off McClane, which is pretty amusing.<br/><br/>There are of course some fast-paced action scenes with explosions coming at you from almost everything that is sent to kill McClane, including a helicopter and a fifth-generation fighter jet. The guy took out a helicopter with a car! That's insane.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an intelligent movie that was well written and directed. Not too outrageous or insane, with just the right amount of McClaneness. If you haven't watched the previous Die Hard movies, you'll still enjoy and appreciate this one. It doesn't connect with the previous movies at all, so the plot won't be confusing. If he wasn't already, Bruce Willis will definitely be a legend after this movie. It's, like I said, a great combination of modern cybercrime and old-school Die Hard."

If you have not watched this wonderful addition to this beautiful action film franchise, then you are missing out, as I have said before in my Die Hard 2 review, Jack Bauer has nothing on this guy, in fact he wishes he could be as bad ass as this guy (John McClane). My favorite part in this movie is where Bruce Willis got his ass hand over to him by Maggie Q then he went all crazy on her.<br/><br/>The Die Hard franchise made it to the 21st Century with Die Hard 4 and McClane was head over heels on top of the situation. This movie is so good that it is hard to believe it was made 12 years after the last Die Hard, because after Die Hard 3, I felt the producers have nothing else to add that will make this franchise a most remember, but then we are introduced to McClane as a father of an adult daughter and Daddy McClane don't play, and Daughter McClane is just as crazy as Daddy-O.<br/><br/>The story follows McClane, who was in the wrong place again as he got involved in modern day warfare where the criminals use computers mostly to get the job done. <br/><br/>John McClane (Bruce Willis) is sent to pick up a known hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and McClane happened to arrive in time to save Farrell from being killed. But this didn't stop the bad guy's leader (Timothy Olyphant) and his right hand girl (Maggie Q) from launching a cyber attack on the US.<br/><br/>A nice movie, great setup wonderful screenplay and a most watch, after this was the latest Die Hard released in 2013, A Good Day to Die Hard."

Even if the rest of the films are not perfect at least the character was intact. In this movie I did not feel as if I was watching John McClane. They should have just named the character something else and the movie might have been slightly more enjoyable. I kept being disappointed by things and I never felt as if it was a Die Hard movie. I did not like the introduction of a ""young"" sidekick with little to no chemistry with Bruce Willis. I am also not convinced that the actor (Tim O....) knows how to act. Everyone was actually pretty bad, even Kevin Smith. He was still probably the best actor in the movie. There were too many plot holes and I did not enjoy the hacker aspect. I seems like it is trying to be too trendy and it is annoying. Cool scenes in the movie were made less cool because John McClane does not do stuff like that.

","10 July 2007. It's time once again to turn off one's brain and just go with the flow. This time around, Bruce Willis gets to fly higher and bust stuff up more. Unfortunately, it's all show, little of the intellectual wit except for some good one-liners. There is a brief attempt at family relational issues. Not all the gimmicks and the fireworks seem to go according to adventure thrill plan, but the interest is never lost, the action never really slows down. But we have the can't do anything right good guys along for the ride. It's so one sided, no balance. But the action keeps flying and exploding, unbelievable or not. This is summer entertainment at its best or worst. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","Of all the Die hard films, I think that this is one of the best, second only to the original Die Hard. There's a great chemistry between Bruce Willis and Justin Long and Timothy Oliphant makes a fantastic pretty boy villain. The script has a great sense of humour and the spectacular action set pieces are directed with a slick edginess. It's a bit long, but the time is well filled with plenty of wild stunts. I really liked this movie."

","Okay, so my title is a little bit misleading - Bruce Willis' tough-talking, no-nonsense New York cop will never fight Thanos alongside Captain America and Iron Man. The reason I mentioned Marvel movies is because I always see 'Die Hard 4.0' as a 'superhero movie.' The original 'Die Hard' film was about an ordinary man who was flawed and just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When terrorists took over a large building, he was the only one who could stop them. It's wasn't just an action film, but a tense, claustrophobic thriller. However, as the sequels piled in, the action got more and more overblown and it became less 'Die Hard' and more 'Die Impossible.' In short, it's probably easier to kill the entire Avengers line-up than one - supposedly normal - human. Now, that may be a criticism, but then I quite like Marvel superhero movies, so I just go with it.<br/><br/>Sometimes 'Die Hard 4.0' is also known as 'Live Free or Die Hard.' If you're wondering what that means then don't expect an answer here. It simply marks the beginning of the film-makers' desire to start naming the films using 'cool-sounding' phrases that don't actually make any sense. Therefore, I prefer 'Die Hard 4.0' (what followed, aka 'A Good Day to Die Hard' is even less fathomable!).<br/><br/>This time round poor ol' McClane simply gets a call to escort a young man to the FBI one night. This results in him (eventually) destroying a helicopter with a car and taking out an American fighter jet while armed only with a truck. Yes, the 'Die Hard' franchise has progressed to that from one man with a gun and no shoes. Therefore, if you're willing to accept this mega change in the way the story is told, you'll have an absolute blast. I see this film more like a Bond film (pre Daniel Craig, of course), rather than a super-serious, ultra-realistic spy-thriller (ala Bourne). It's got so much overblown action that it's the perfect film to watch while munching popcorn (if anyone still eats popcorn at home while watching various popular online streaming services).<br/><br/>The trick is simply to suspend all disbelief to enjoy this. You'll have to just accept that Bruce Willis is - once again - in the wrong place at the wrong time (possibly making him the unluckiest man alive in the process!). You'll also have to accept how a bunch of cyber-terrorists trying to bring down the American economy also directly happens to threaten McClane's daughter (after his wife was put in the firing line in the first two and his son in the - next - fifth instalment). And, if you can do that and put up with Bruce Willis' trademark smirk and array of one-liners, then you should have a lot of fun in this. Big. Dumb. Fun. Besides, it's a worthy of Oscars if you compare it to what came next in Russia alongside Jai Courtney."

","This is the fourth film in ""Die Hard"". In this film, John McClane will face a cyberterrorist launching the chaos in the American capital. Directed by Len Wiseman, the film has a screenplay by Mark Bomback. Bruce Willis takes the lead role.<br/><br/>This film tried to play with the problem of computer terrorism and how, through an internet network and a computer, anyone can cause damage to the fragile system in which we live. The attempt, despite the merits, proved to be negative due to a poorly written and poorly thought out script, full of plot holes and incongruous situations.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis remained fairly as expected. The rest of the cast did not disappoint but did not shine much. The choice of Timothy Olyphant for the main villain, however, was a tremendous casting error. Throughout the film, he showed that has not adapted to the role, keeping such a theatrical and forced posture that never gets to look menacing. The scenarios could have been better and more interesting: if the action takes place in Washington DC, why we have not seen more often the locations most commonly associated with the city, such the Capitol or the Lincoln Memorial? The special visual and sound effects are good, but fail this query was so bad for an action film that already was expected to be good."
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","1","19 February 2015"," Digitalized special effects are not that good
","We finally had to come to the modern world and computers. This film is so frightening for simple people that it should create a real panic among them. It deals with all the central networks created by our modern society to control govern and command absolutely everything that can be set in some kind of network. The big fear is that when all networks are synchronized and connected one person from one keyboard and central computer will be able to control absolutely everything in life and society. Everyone knows about it. Check Terminator for that. <br/><br/>In Paris they even have some higher education professor, Marcel Gauchet, who explains that in such a society we just need to blow up or paralyze the nodal points of these systems to bring a society to a stand still and thus impose a revolution. No one has been able to find out if that man is using this idea as a menace against society or as a warning to society. Some of his students were even investigated some years ago as having played a role in such an attack on the fast train network in France<br/><br/>But this fear is also lined with another which is a lot older: the fear of machines per se. People are afraid of machines though they use machines everyday, like cars and other means of transportation. Computers are even more frightening than a crashing airplane because all we see on the screen is a whole lot of figures, in fact digits, and we cannot understand what the machine is saying, and it is always saying a lot. We have always been afraid of foreign languages, and computers speak a foreign language.<br/><br/>The third level of fear you can find in our world is the fact that after 9/11 we have put all our valuable data on central computers that are supposed to be hyper protected and they are. The film demonstrates that they cannot be reached from the outside by hackers but can only be reached from the inside that is to say from these giant central computers themselves because they are absolutely isolated from the outside world and their connection with this outside world is absolutely under digitalized secure surveillance. So the hackers who want to prove the vulnerability of that central computer has to penetrate the fort in which it is located. Only a military operation can do that, but that operation is just plainly unimaginable. The human guards can be killed but they can be so connected to the central security that the alert is given as soon as some sensor senses the attack on the body or mind of the guard and then instead of sending two guards as reinforcement a security wall can fall down that can only be opened from the inside. <br/><br/>The system that is shown here, for our entertainment for sure, is super fragile and super UN-protected. It is less protected than a henhouse against foxes. It is as little protected against the infiltration of terrorists as a sieve is ready to retain water. So that makes the fear ludicrous and the entertainment loses all suspense value and all frightening effect.<br/><br/>Of course John McClane has to have a partner and this time it is a young hacker that the terrorists want to kill and that the FBI wants to interrogate. He becomes the digital mind of McClane and McClane is nothing but the brute force, the basic muscle of the operation. The two together are funny in a way since they are so different and one could be the father of the other. <br/><br/>But the film is funny though the digital special effects are so visibly artificial, not even analogue, that they become cinematographic anecdotes. I think these action films have lost something g with the massive shift to digital special effects. They just look unreal and what's more we recognize the special effect maker and then we recognize a special effect we have already seen in some other films. We may even wonder if they are after all not plainly the same.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

As for the othersÂ… the baddies' leader, Thomas Gabriel, played by Timothy Olyphant, comes over as lightweight. There's a nice turn by Mary Winstead, playing McClane's daughter Lucy Gennaro (McClane).<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is a bit lame with a gang of computer geeks set to take over the world by messing with the internet. Their motivation becomes apparent as we uncover more of the background of their leader but is never completely convincing. Fortunately the production crew are more talented than the average Washington driver, who just seems to drive into other cars if the lights turn green.<br/><br/>The action scenes here are brilliant, and frequent. Anyone who can take down a helicopter by launching a police car into the air deserves respect. I managed to suspend my disbelief at the powers of various computer hackers long enough to enjoy the unfolding story and the wry humour. Willis is smart enough to know how to handle this stuff and it's due to him that this film works. With a more convincing villain and plot I would have given it a nine. Bruce saves it from slipping below a seven, and I'm looking forward to the next instalment."

","""Live Free and Die Hard"" is the 2007 entry into the Die Hard series, starring Bruce Willis as John McClane and Justin Long.<br/><br/>Here, it's basically a disgruntled employee wreaking total havoc on the U.S. and shutting down everything - power, communication, you name it. And the professional hackers the group hired to write the programs are murdered one by one so they can't talk. All except one (Justin Long), and he's been picked up by John McClane.<br/><br/>That's the basic plot. This is a summer blockbuster movie meant to be experienced in a theater. It is nonstop. There are more explosions, car chases, crashes, leap from tall building, individuals attached to speeding cars on the outside, cars suspended in mid-air with someone hanging off the end, and characters who have been through being shot, karate chopped, jujitsued, thrown against walls, and strangled who still manage to live per second than perhaps any other film.<br/><br/>I can only say if you like this kind of film, this is one in the genre to see.<br/><br/>The script must have contained maybe two pages of dialogue total.<br/><br/>If you like your films fast and action-packed, this is for you."
"brando647","8","1","1","25 September 2012"," Great Action Movie, but Missing the DIE HARD Vibe
","The fourth film in the DIE HARD franchise had a lot working against it: it had been more than a decade since the last film and the filmmakers had fallen into the recent pitfall of shooting for a PG-13 rating to broaden the audience (and, by extension, the box office profits). DIE HARD is one of those series that just cannot be anything less than a solid R-rating. If you're planning on watching LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD for the first time, do yourself a favor and find a copy of the unrated cut where the bloody violence and language have been restored to the series norm. If you do, you'll find the movie a lot better than settling for the defanged theatrical version. The movie finds John McClane (Bruce Willis, returning to the role) roped into an investigation when someone hacks the FBI and the usual suspects are rounded up. McClane's job is to bring in Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) for questioning but, before he can bring Farrell in, the two become targets for whoever has marked the hacker for death. Within hours, the United States is under a full-scale assault on its computer networks with transportation, communications, and utilities on the list of targeted systems. With the nation plunging into chaos, McClane and Farrell are the country's main hope in stopping a cyber criminal with a solid plan of bringing the United States to its knees. It's DIE HARD for a new millennium with John McClane facing his most baffling challenge yet: modern technology.<br/><br/>Movie studios revisiting old franchises to milk further profits out of its audience has a sketchy history of failing to provide a decent film; if you have any doubts, feel free to revisit other attempts from around the same timeKINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) and HANNIBAL RISING (2007). The idea becomes even more questionable when the original star is brought back to the role they made legendary (e.g. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones). When the actors weren't that young to begin with, a ten year gap between films can mean a massive difference. Oddly enough, it's not so much the case with Bruce Willis. Maybe it's just because the man is the embodiment of disgruntled cop, but he falls right into the role and I never found myself questioning if he was too old for the same action. John McClane is probably Willis's best role ever and he hasn't lost that spark yet. If anything, Willis is the best part of this whole movie when the comic relief and extravagant action set pieces get to be too much. Justin Long is that comic relief, with his character of Farrell failing to speak in anything but sarcasm. It's funny for a bit, but wears by the end. The villain, played by Timothy Olyphant, is acceptable for a bit of modern day evil; rather than brute force, the most dangerous modern terrorist is the one who can steal everything the country has come to take for granted with a few keystrokes.<br/><br/>I actually dig the fact that DIE HARD 4.0 made an attempt to modernize the series with McClane finding himself lost and confused in a world that continued on without him. It was a cool touch. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the story in the new movie, but it was the way it was told that didn't sit right with me. I know McClane has gotten himself into some crazy situations before, but this movie goes a little too overboard for my tastes. McClane is a stone-cold action hero, but he's always been human. He can be hurt, he can be weakened. DIE HARD 4.0 has him jumping on top of an F-35 fighter jet from a collapsing freeway and launching a police car at a helicopter. He's gone from human to superhuman. I mean, come on, I can't be the only one who felt this was the most off-putting aspect of the movie. I have to admit that this is a solid, fun action movie but it doesn't feel like a real DIE HARD. I guess this was 20th Century Fox's attempt at rejuvenating the franchise and selling it a generation of audience members who might have been too long to catch any of the originals (which also explains the PG-13), but it's sort of a betrayal from anyone wanting to sit down for a new adventure for the John McClane we know. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD has some great action and a few sharp one-liners, but it's ultimately missing something."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","1","1","6 September 2009"," Not the best.
","Live free or die hard is the fourth film in the famous Die Hard series. The fourth time isn't the charm. I really liked it, but something about it wasn't as good as the original. Or any of the others for that matter. I just thought that Live free or Die Hard has some ridiculous moments. For instance, there is a scene where Bruce Willis hits Maggie Q's character with an SUV and she still lives. That would never happen. I think that two of Live free or Die Hard's action sequences are over the top. I also didn't really think that Timothy Olyphant was as menacing as Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons. Of course he does bad things but he isn't really that evil. I would've preferred it if Maggie Q was the lead villain. Those are the only problems I had with the film. I really enjoyed the rest of the film. There is spectacular action sequences and good performances. The film could've been worse. It could've been all over the top action and no plot. Live free or Die Hard is probably the weakest in the series. But I didn't think it was a bad film. I don't give it *** because I appreciated it. I actually give it ***1/2. I know I may be being too kind but it's a good entry to the series.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard:***1/2 out of ****"

","I was really hoping for the great summer blockbuster, and thought this would be it. But I felt really disappointed the whole way through. And I walked out of the theater feeling like, ""Okay, how can I salvage what's left of my day?"" This story -- and I use that term loosely -- is driven by this new style of bad guy that seems to popular in Hollywood these days. They are the omnipotent, omnipresent bad guy who see everything, know everything, and can do anything. So how can you battle them? How can our hero prevail? Oooohh wow, I can just envision the writers patting themselves on the back. It must seem so suspenseful! This omni-bad-guy has appeared in the last 10 Harrison Ford movies. You can't move without them knowing it; they've taken over your computer. Where do you turn? Eegad.<br/><br/>Remember the first Die Hard? How do you get outside help with no phone? Puase for suspense. You pull the fire alarm, brilliant! Bruce Willis watches with glee as the red flashing lights of the fire trucks pierce the night and approach, no doubt soon followed by police cars. And we feel his agony when the red lights stop flashing and the trucks slow down and turn around. Now THAT was interesting! Here we have a lot of car crashes (I mean, A LOT). Think: Blues Brothers in Chicago car crashes. Only here it's supposed to be serious, but it's not; it's just silly. Consider this: if every traffic light in your town suddenly turned green at the same time, would every intersection involve a 60mph collision? I think not. Everything might grind to a halt, sure. But in Live Free Or Die Hard, all the lights turn green and all hell breaks loose (I haven't ruined anything -- that happens in the first 15 minutes).<br/><br/>There is very little original here. And the leaps of faith needed for this flick require mental iron-man triathlete.<br/><br/>Like so much other pulp shoved out the Hollywood meat-grinder nowadays, this movie LOOKED good, and had all the right ideas. But without a good story, with build-up, with drama, you just have flash after flash. There's no real REASON to care about these characters.<br/><br/>I STRONGLY suggest you wait for the video and rent it. But no matter, you will flock like everyone else to spend your $10. Decently entertaining, but disappointing. Enter the theater with NO EXPECTATIONS and you might be entertained -- as your brain slowly shrinks a little more."

","LFODH was my favorite Action Film to come out in years.<br/><br/>As a Huge Did Hard fan I feel I must point out that I was indeed a little worried about the PG-13 situation.<br/><br/>However it is a complete non-issue in the film itself. They handle the change so well that unless you go in looking for it you would probably never know this film was toned down at all.<br/><br/>To uses Bruce's own words it is a Smash Mouth Action Film and it's just as good as the ones before it.<br/><br/>McClane is back in a big way, his character has grown and yet is clearly the same man, there are no fears in regards to that... It's not just some Bruce Willis Action movie... It's Die Hard.<br/><br/>The Plot is pure summer action delight. It reminds you that the good old days have been gone for a while... Before seeing this I did not even realize that I had not seen a Great action flick WITHOUT some super powered dude in tights, in ages... And Die Hard is exactly that... A good old Fashioned Action Flick.<br/><br/>And yet it also manages to bring the series into the Millennium smoothly. The changes are summed up nicely in one of Olyphant's lines. He says to McClane ""You are a Timex Watch in a Digital Age"" <br/><br/>A perfect line to sum up the film.<br/><br/>The thing that I really loved about LFODH was the fact that it served as a reminder that Good Men Die Hard. This is not only a fun action romp but it also says a lot about who McClane is as a Character... Moreso then either of the other sequels... This is summed up in his signature Catchphrase.(you know the one) It is not just some throw away toughguy remark in this film... Which it could have been... He could have just said the line at any point and the Crowd would have cheered.... But instead, they use it to speak about who John is as a man and as a character.<br/><br/>It is so well handled that it actually comes off as BETTER then in the other films... Despite being altered to suit the Rating.<br/><br/>The supporting Cast is all great as well... The Baddies each have their own moments that are very enjoyable and are all fleshed out nicely... Olyphant lives up to his predecessors wonderfully... He is every bit the brilliant ringleader that Rickman, Sadler and Irons were and yet has his own unique flavor as well.<br/><br/>Justin Long is great and acts as a perfect modern young man to show us just how badly we need REAL men like McClane again. He rarely comes off as too annoying and when he does it's in the context of the plot and McClane is just as annoyed as you or I would be.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead was particularly impressive... Her role is not large but you can tell that she did her homework... Every line she utters, every look she gives... Everything about her Screams that she was raised by Holly and John McClane... It's uncanny how well she balances the character traits of her parents and still comes off as her own person.<br/><br/>I am trying to avoid all spoilers but I'll touch on the plot briefly. This concept of Cyber Terrorism was a very volatile subject to use as the center of the film... It could have blown up in their faces like so much C4 strapped to a Monitor. However it does not fail at all... They manage to show a great amount of what is possible with this sort of attack and they manage to do it without losing that Die Hard feel. Again I come back to the difference between John and the World the way it is today. This balance drives so much of the film that I cannot stress enough how impressed I was by the writing and direction... No, it's not Oscar worthy and no it will not change the way we look at the world but it DOES work perfectly for this type of film... I would have expected nothing else.<br/><br/>All in all I count Live Free or Die Hard as an Equal to the other films. It actually manages to be MORE character driven then the past couple and yet is loses nothing in the Translation to the Post 9/11 world.<br/><br/>For me... This was a Ten."

And, trust me, John McClaine has never looked badder.<br/><br/>This action-packed epic begins with McClaine assigned to bring a teenage computer hacker to Washington DC for questioning, for the FBI had been having trouble with a hacker. This proceeds to deliver hard-core non-stop old-school Die-Hard action, with car chases, fist fights, and shootouts galore! One thing I've noticed while watching this movie is the amazing chemistry between Bruce Willis (McClaine) and Justin Long (teenage hack Matt Ferrell). While everyone in this movie does a spectacular job acting-wise, Willis and Long are the two to watch for, especially in scenes together (with, thankfully, is often).<br/><br/>Yes, the infamous line is muttered; just don't hold your breath for it to be as epic as the previous three times it was said.

"Bosco-HK","9","5","12","27 June 2007"," Magnitude on the Ritcher scale is wrong!
","The second movie title to continue as a sequel does not really fit the true magnitude of the movie. ""FOUR POINT O?"" on the Richter scale, I believe not, this is way more than that! A compliment at that.... as well as the way to prove this time around a possibility in the suspense level of yet another sequel. Am I right, despite the official statement that it was a French translation. For a natural disasters movie addict like me, I hope this is one of the possibility that was how the second movie title was also chosen not to be in roman numerals.<br/><br/>Anyways! Everyone hang onto your seats and take cover!!! New Independence Day quote coming from LF/DH... ""Like father, like daughter."" Father John McClane (Bruce Willis) shoots the foot with a gun, so does his daughter, Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). That was just too good to be true because she hates her Dad so much because he always follow wherever she goes and spy on whatever she does. But that same gunshot style definitely flipped the adage. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the most amazing choice because her voice has a serious tone of both fear and arrogance, and the strangest of all, it brought about no questions in regards to blood ties with her Dad in the movie. I doubt that there are many who can convince the audience, so much as to how they are not related at all in character.<br/><br/>Also, right before that scene, when she was forced to talk down his father on the walkie-talkie, she mentioned that there were 5 men to go. Man, that was just fantastic! She definitely inherited all the possible genes from her Dad. Back to her Dad, John, the scene where he sneakily use a fire hydrant's broken-fury and another scene where he used a police car to crash into a helicopter in mid-air... although we all knew that this is all for show, but you can imagine the intelligence of John McClane. He is not just a senior detective, he is one freaky physics scientist without the white coat, walking down the street. In this movie, Bruce Willis put up some great comedic lines to calm the audience from the explosions and brutality brought upon him.. it is telling you that ""I am still alive to kick some ___ !""<br/><br/>His scene in that huge rig truck definitely proves my point, he is a walking demon of the NYPD force, a zombie detective who has been awaken to sniff out and finish the computer Satan --- trademarked line by commentator.<br/><br/>Mai Lihn (Maggie Q) was super bad! Not sure of the exact quote, but here goes -- McClane: "".. Kung Fu ... "" stuff, he beats her down with homeboy style throws, like brother-to-brother friendly fight. It is definitely nice to bring in part of the Chinese culture in this Independence Day feature.<br/><br/>This movie has definitely turned out very fatherly and the jokes were all well-placed. The last scene with Lucy in one ambulance and Matt Farrell (Justin Long) was just-so-not-this-movie but inspires how people do attract ""the electric current through the eyes"" as the Chinese saying. In fact, I enjoyed all the humor because Justin Long has been in most of the love comedies. Another piece of comedy that I like was when they entered the Warlock (Kevin Smith)'s dungeon. His ""Command Center"" LOL!!! It really reminds me of playing Command & Conquer games and all its series. And even so, the name 'Warlock' is hilarious enough... no need to ask where or what games I played to know that... I probably cannot name the origin of that name anyways.<br/><br/>Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) played the mastermind role. The intensity was breathtaking like Face Off (1997), and his men were sensational, such as the one who was like ""Spiderman"" -i just couldn't catch his name, all the suspense and excitement!- , whom McClane called 'hamster'. That was extremely funny!<br/><br/>In all, everyone was superb! I recommend this movie without doubt!<br/><br/>I think that this movie is great without the profanity within the character of John McClane, he does not need that to prove to others that he can sweep his enemies by rolling a dirty roll of toilet paper, he can do it with rolls and rolls of clean ones anyways. --- trademarked line by commentator."

","went to the UK premiere of Die Hard 4.0 last night full of expectation and anticipation. all the stars were there and to be stood a few metres from the man himself, Bruce Willis, was quite a good feeling. before the film was screened the cast and director did some short introductions and one thing struck me more than most.. Len Wiseman the director said he was 'very nervous' about showing the film. This didn't bode well because i am of the opinion that if a director has been given the chance to direct a film in arguably the greatest action film franchise around with one of the biggest stars in the world, and with a huge budget i would be thinking that i cant wait to show people. he was right to be nervous because ultimately the film doesn't deliver what the die hard fan wants.<br/><br/>personally i found it hard to connect this film to the previous three, of which i am a huge fan. at times it just didn't feel like a die hard hard film and i think much of it has to do with the fact that when i think john mcclane, i think receding hair line and borderline alcoholic, as opposed to the shaved head and frankly much fitter and 'cooler' looking modern day mcclane.. and more to the point no white vest! <br/><br/>the film on the other hand does stage some pretty huge and elaborate action sequences and there is a welcome cameo from kevin smith. if u are a total action junkie and have no real interest in anything else but the action then this is the film for you because it is 2hrs + of relentless action, and i mean relentless."

If they make a 5th installment of Die Hard,some titles for it should be Live Smarter or Die Harder,Die Hard 5,Live Soft-Die Hard,etc.But overall,this is a great action movie not to be missed and makes some other action movies look like Disneyland."

","I really wanted to see this movie, even though I thought it wasn't going to be very good, because it's the fourth in the series. And you know what happens to follow-ups to sequels, they degrade per added number. But from the start of the movie I was grasped, and the movie absorbed me completely. I saw the trailer once, but I totally forgot that the movie was about internet-terrorism. It kept my interest until the very end. There aren't only plenty action sequences, but there is some humor to be found too. Especially those from Matthew Foster (Justin Long). That guy can really be funny. One side note, I must say that it's over the top sometimes, but that isn't really harming this movie at all. It's a sequel worth made!"

Live Free Or Die Hard is just perfect. Its actually amazing, Bruce Willis the 50 plus guy doing what he did. And truth be told I had my reservations against this movie. All through summer all the blockbusters failed due to a weak script. But Live Free comes with an awesome script, plus some mind blowing CGI. True you get to see loads of vehicles getting blown off, that includes a chopper, and a F-35 not to mention the countless cars. But Bruce Willis does what he does best. Those quirky jokes, and strong language is back.<br/><br/>Acting is perfect, the visual effects stunning, camera work brilliant, dialogs/screen play too good. Die Hard 4.0 was just about perfect.

Action In The Movie Is None Stop, You Surely Wont Get Bored For 2 Hours, One Things Follows The Next Which Keeps You Aware, Awake And On Your Toes. 3.

Cast Beside Bruce Willis Was Rather Lame, Bad Guys Aren't Really Convincing, Even The Good Guys, The Supporting Cast Lack Charisma, Especially If You Compare It To The Excellent Actors That Played In The Previous Movies, This Is Surely One Of The Weakest Points Of The Movie, Don't Know Who Chose The Entire Cast But Someone Did A Bad Job. 2. The Plot Was Really Lame, Im Not Saying That Something Like This Couldn't Happen But The Way It Was Executed On The Screen Was Rather Weak In Its Reliability. 3. The Last Part Of The Movie Was The Weakest, The Places At Which They Were Shot Are Not Worthy For This Series, One Example, It Really Looks Fake How Bruce Willis Follows The Bad Guys, And ""By Chance"" Sees Into Which Warehouse They Have Entered, And Of course, The Bad Guys HAVE TO WAIT For Him To Arrive, So He Can Kill Them, Really A Weak Ending.<br/><br/>In All Movie Isn't Bad, You'll Will Surely Have 2 Hours Of Fine Entertainment, Its Worth 6.5 Out Of 10, Mostly Because Of Bruce Willis And The Money The ""Blew Up"" To Make It, By The Way The Director Of Movie Is Really Not Worth Of This Series Either, Seems To Me His Point Of View Is Like Of A Small Child Who's More Interested Bombastic And Entertaining Explosions, Which Don't Always Look Reliable, Then The Plot And The Characters Which Should Be The Basis Of Any Movie. If Not The Money And Bruce Willis I Would Give It Much Less.<br/><br/>Well Maybe I Had To Much Expectations Cause I Really Loved The Previous Movies, Loved Them From The First Time I Saw Them ;-)"

It's the classic Batman and Robin movie.<br/><br/>In terms of comedy, this movie doesn't really offer much. Maybe the occasional chuckle from 'you know it's coming' comedy style. In terms of actions however, this movie offers plenty of it. Just about all you can imagine; cars, helicopters, jets, women. There's not much romance at all though.

It lives up to everything a ""Die Hard"" film is supposed to be about: Bruce Willis beating the living crap out of the bad guys and laughing about it afterward.<br/><br/>And the film most importantly doesn't take itself too seriously.

","When the first poster for this film went up in our movie theater, my jaw dropped. My mind crawled back to 1988, to a film that redefined action heroes for everyone. But could Willis, nearly twenty years older, still hold up his end of the bargain and deliver the same quips and whips as before? My fears were quelled right away as McClane is once again tossed around by explosions, leaping through windows to dodge gunfire, hurling himself from moving vehicles, and still manages to survive just so he can smile at the bad guys' shocked expressions when they realize he is still alive. And Ol' Brucie handles every bit of it with the same sort of wit and charm we have come to love. Fans of the first film may be a little let down, but please don't compare this to the second or third of the series. This is a way better film than 2 and a little better than WAV.<br/><br/>If our recent string of action films (Casino Royale, etc.) does not prove that filmmakers have a wealth of technology available to wow viewers with flying cars, gut-wrenching chase scenes, and painful-to-watch crashes, the scenes in this film will set it straight for you. Though some of the scenes are a little unbelievable, there are so many edge-of-your-seat action scenes in this movie that you don't dare even leave to use the restroom."

The story itself wasn't very appealing as in the previous films. The characters, with the exception of Bruce Willis, weren't as memorable, probably from their lack of substance and character appeal - especially the bratty Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).<br/><br/>There are, nonetheless, some adventurous scenes such as the computer breaches and the action-packed climax.

The producers should have stuck with the original premise of having a Pleasure cruise being taken over by a group of high sea pirates. It would have been more believable. I hope part 5 is better than this, but again they have him teamed up with someone, this time his ""son"", who more looks like a friggin model, than a normal everyday person. I don't have high hopes.

","Live Free or Die Hard is a disgrace to the name of Die Hard, it's one of the most unnecessary and also most uneventful action movies ever made. They literally take everything that made Die Hard good and disregarded it and made it like every other generic action movie. I loved the first and third movie, but this, I will argue and say it's the worst action movie to come around in 10 years, it's unforgivable. <br/><br/>The movie begins with John McClane who is talking to his daughter over the phone, you get an idea that all these years of fighting John McClane is burnt out, aged and tired. He is assigned to safely escort a hacker played by Justin Long who is probably one of the most annoying characters ever. He learns there's more to the job, there are terrorists out to kill him, because he's a skilled hacker. The villain has an agenda to breach and hold America hostage. The villain by the way is lame, uninteresting, unlike the other villains in the Die Hard movies, he's forgettable and rather poorly written. Also, John McClane makes an attempt to stop the guy. He does so with the annoying hacker. He also has a taxi cab fly and hit a helicopter. You know, stuff you'd only see in a Transporter movie. <br/><br/>I understand that Die Hard movies are loaded with impossible stuff, but this took it too far. A car hits a chopper, then John McClane drives a car into a building and then there is a scene where he is on a plane. Also, unlike the other Die Hard movies, the action was lame. Very uneventful, no intensity whatsoever. The first Did Hard movie (The best Action movie of all time) it held my interest, it was intense and suspenseful. This one, nothing, I actually daydreamed throughout the entire movie, I honestly didn't care, I wanted the movie to end. I am shocked at the rave reviews this movie got. I guess since the general public loves it, I must be wrong right? Well, I can go on and on about that topic but I choose not to.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard is terrible. Len Wiseman as a director for it really didn't contribute, I feel his style works great for music videos but not so much for movies. I'd like to see him tackle maybe a fantasy movie in the likes of Dark Crystal or maybe Legend. Something with less action, he has an interesting visual idea but this movie, his style didn't work. I also mostly blame the writers for this. Anyways, Live Free or Die Hard is terrible, I will go off and say, I give it an F."

But it's not very smart, and even less fun. And as a Die Hard movie, here's the problem: there's nothing personal in it for McClane; no wife in peril, no brother of the bad guy he killed who's forcing McClane to stampede across New York City. He's just there. He's cardboard hero guy, being billed as a superhero without a cape. and when you've got him falling out of buildings, hurling cars into helicopters and battling fighter planes, it's the Indestructible Bruce Willis Show.<br/><br/>Credit where it's due, it is bookended by Mary Elizabeth Winstead scenes, which is enough to keep you seated from one set of credits to the next.

","Plot: A group of cyber-terrorists wreck havoc in the USA by shutting everything down and a single cop along with the help of a hacker must stop them.<br/><br/>After watching all four Die Hard movies in Blu-Ray I decided that I would review the worst of the series. Yes, you heard that right the worse of the series. Like so many great action franchises of the late 80's, (Rambo, Terminator, etc), it started wonderful, it had a good sequel, the third one was meh and then comes the fourth one which makes you wanna throw something at the TV screen!<br/><br/>The plot of all Die Hard movies, although far better than your average action film, was pretty simple. However what it lacked in storyline it made up in building tension and keeping you at the edge of your seat. In the first movie for example, McLane was quite skilled and clever, but he was just a single guy who could bleed, who was afraid and who was always outnumbered. In here however the whole movie is just an excuse for loud explosions, gunfights and car chases you know popcorn entertainment! Moreover McLane seems to have gained some supernatural powers, withstanding WAY too much damage contrary to the more realistic McLane of the past.<br/><br/>Willis handled the protagonist's character pretty good so far. He was badass but he was also human. He was witty and charismatic but he was also quite realistic, an action hero that you could actually like and give a damn about. Here he is just a blunt, generic protagonist. Also, instead of the genuinely sweet romantic chemistry between him and his wife we now have the typical garbage of the 21st century. Divorced with a daughter who hates him and yada, yada, yada what happened to good ol' romance in our days? (Cthulhu, I feel old!). Finally the annoyance called Justin Long, whose character is supposed to be the comic relief here, but instead he ends up being an irritating sidekick who I wish would die as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The worst disappointment comes from the bad guy though. We had Hans Gruber who was magnificent, then we got Colonel Stuart who was quite decent and then we've moved on to Simon Gruber who was okay, I guess. Here the bad guy is a boring, walking mass of non-menacing nerdness. Instead of the powerful aura of Hans Gruber, Thomas Gabriel made me feel that I could kill him just by using foul language. Furthermore the misc. characters here consist of nameless bystanders and generic goons, where in previous Die Hard films you could actually remember their names and faces. Oh, and lets not forget the extremely stereotypical Kung-Fu Asian bitch that almost all movies have these days *throws up*<br/><br/>It's all badly directed and meaningless action scene after meaningless action scene and like in most modern films everything is color-filtered with an ugly glue-grey that is supposed to make everything cooler but instead makes it look dull. Finally like with most action flicks, everything simply defies logic and while I can deal with some stupidity when it comes to Hollywood-made action films this is plain ridiculous. Some cyber-terrorists destroy a whole country with a couple of Alienware laptops while a single hacker tries to kick their digital asses with a help of what else? His own laptop!!! Boring, stereotypical, way to predictable and as adrenaline pumping as sharpening a pencil, Live Free Or Die Hard is a stupid piece of US Propaganda, perfect for cinema zombies, but not for those who appreciate the art form of movie making. Avoid!!!<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: US Propaganda meets Popcorn Entertainment (2/10)<br/><br/>[+] Err popcorn tastes good!<br/><br/>[-] Boring, non-existent plot and dull, stereotypical characters. Action scenes that will make you feel sleepy. Hollywood made US Propaganda at its worse. Ugly color filtering.<br/><br/>Also Check: Cliffhanger (1993) – Die Hard (1988) - Phone Booth (2002) – Taken (2008)"
"John_Acrob","6","3","6","11 August 2007"," Die Hard ended with the trilogy.
","Live Free or Die Hard could possibly be shortened to ""Live Free"". The similarities between this film and the previous Die Hard titles ends with the names of the characters. Don't get me wrong, as an action film, Live Free or Die Hard is a passable effort. But as a Die Hard film, it's nothing short of a total failure.<br/><br/>Whatever insanity crossed through the producers minds when deciding to edit this film down to a pg-13 is truly beyond comprehension. It would have been bad enough to film the movie as a pg-13, but to edit out nearly all of the profanities in the film is a total travesty. Not only is it un-Die Hard, it was painfully obvious. John McClane would have a small monologue, and the camera would dart around the room in a desperate effort to hide the fact that the word f___ was probably coming out of his mouth every 3 seconds.<br/><br/>Timothy Olyphant may be a promising young actor, but whether it was the direction, or Olyphant himself, he does not work as a Die Hard villain. His bulging eyes and semi-threatening dialogue wasn't enough to cover his overall, rather bland performance.<br/><br/>We yet again see the somewhat-new-but-already-tired female kung-fu bad-guy gimmick, and despite the fact that she gets her ass kicked, it's still extremely contrived.<br/><br/>Nothing felt right in this film. Even Bruce Willis' performance was not even remotely similar to the John McClane we all know and love. Willis could have been playing any other action hero. There was none of the jovial bravado that defined his character in the previous films, it was instead replaced with crappy, pg-13ed dialogue and poor comic relief from Justin Long(who could well be a fine young actor, but just got annoying in this movie). Even the violence, while frequent, was shrouded by constant camera cuts and elaborate stunts.<br/><br/>The first Die Hard film was, in my opinion, one of the finest action films ever made. And while swearing and violence aren't always necessary in a film, they simply ARE in a Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>Worth watching to build your own opinion, but personally, i consider the Die Hard series as ended after 'Die Hard With a Vengeance'."
"bburns","8","3","6","6 August 2007"," Yippee-Ki-Yay!
","I worried about ""Live Free or Die Hard"" before it was released. While the first 3 were rated R, this one would be rated PG-13. I didn't like ""Die Hard 2"" because it was missing John McTiernan's intelligence, and McTiernan was also sitting this one out. And as much as I like Bruce Willis, I was worried that he might be a little long in the tooth to be an action hero again. Then I saw the movie, and my fears were put to rest.<br/><br/>In ""Live Free"", John McLane (Willis) is an old man who doesn't do much chasing and shooting after bad guys anymore. Instead, he's called on to escort nerdy hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) from New Jersey to Washington, DC to advise the FBI about someone who's hacked into their database. Unfortunately for them both, Farrell has been targeted for assassination that very night by the same hacker. By the time they elude the killers and get to DC, the hacker Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) has infiltrated every government computer and brought the country to a complete halt. And that's when McLane decides to go after Gabriel using the same M.O. of the first three films: blowing up everything between himself and the bad guy. But he needs Farrell's help in finding the bad guy and undoing the techno-damage, and so they become an unlikely team.<br/><br/>As to my first worry (the PG-13 rating), it really doesn't make that much of a difference. There are still enough explosions and killings to appease action fans. The only thing toned down from the first three films is the language (""Yippee-Ki-Yay motherf*cker"" is replaced by simply ""Yippee-Ki-Yay""). Also, there is a break from violence in the middle to form a subplot involving Matt's even-nerdier friend ""Warlock"" (Kevin Smith) that is played for laughs rather than thrills. While I liked the first and third installments, I thought the second was stupid. But this movie is actually reasonably smart, and based on real tech issues (the script is based on an article from ""Wired"" magazine). And although by part four, the lead actor (or actors) usually sleepwalk through a role, Bruce Willis is still believable as an older, wiser John McLane who would prefer not to have to be a hero.<br/><br/>There were some things I didn't like about this installment. For one, it is filmed on DV instead of film. This makes the scenes at night or in dim light look really cool, but the scenes in daylight or well-lit rooms look washed out and hazy. Also, one of the things I liked about the first Die Hard was that unlike most of the other action films of the 1980's, the female leads were three-dimensional. But in this film, Gabriel is aided by his exotic Asian girlfriend (Maggie Q) with lots of sex appeal and not much else. And McLane's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is the typical action-movie damsel in distress.<br/><br/>But for the most part, this was a fun action flick worthy of its heritage. Can't wait for part 5. 8 out of 10."

This could happen in a James Bond movie and as it does in such movies, the hero makes everything all right in the end, killing lots of people with extremely little blood.<br/><br/>So far, so bad. But the final scenes are so ridiculous, that you get too tired even to smile. If there's humor in James Bond, it's just boredom here.

Also i loved the McLane/Gruber relationship in die hard and die hard with a vengeance. I never felt even close to Gabriel, and the whole kidnapping Lucy was nothing new (to be honest i was never even worried for her). I liked Willis in this film but the plot let much of it down and the fighter jet scene I thought was in their only to show the world that this is how cool FXs have got (i know die hard films are famous for pushing the realms of reality but this was very OTT).<br/><br/>Not a bad film but we expect and deserve better, i think this should be the end of the franchise because i always felt that the trilogy was complete."
"classicalsteve","6","3","6","15 July 2007"," More Action But Less Story -- OK but could have been great
","What put the original Die Hard in a class by itself in the action genre was its interesting fusion of action, plot, story and character in which all four elements were dependent upon the other. The original Die Hard certainly had a lot of non-stop action sequences but they always managed to further the plot, the story, and even the character of McClane. In Free Live Die Hard, a lot of action takes place for the sake of action. I don't think I can remember the last time I saw this many cars and trucks blowing up and/or getting smashed beyond recognition. But unfortunately, the chases and car wrecks seemed to have little to do with the story or the plot. I found they detracted rather than furthered my interest.<br/><br/>The essential plot is probably the most complex of any of the other Die Hard offerings. A young techno-maniac named Thomas Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant) is plotting revenge against the US Government for stifling his career as a security tech genius. Now he has become the hacker-from-hell who has infiltrated the US's national security, law enforcement, and power systems in the ultimate hacker's hack. And this endeavor that, not only costs lives but millions of dollars, is enacted to prove a point, like all hackers engaging in hacking (i.e. I can hack into your security system so I will). Very 21st century of course. The essential idea of the hack to end all hacks is quite brilliant. But unfortunately the hacker's motivation, plot, i.e., his story, gets snubbed in favor of more car chases.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is probably the strongest when Willis befriends a 30-something computer geek, Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who knows more than the average 50-something about the world of young computer techs. As the story unfolds he reveals more about this other world to Willis. At one point the baddie says to Willis ""You're an analog cop fighting in a digital world."" We then meet another hacker who has beat the predatory hacker Olyphant and we are again given glimpses into the world of internet and hacker addicts. His room his replete with computers, movie posters, and junk food.<br/><br/>But then, the movie turns more and more into a string of hyped action sequences and never fully develops the central idea of the story. The movie instead of continuing the idea of hackers and their world, particularly the mastermind terrorist-hacker, the movie becomes about big long car chases on freeways, with only about 978 cars banged up to round out the engagement. The mastermind Al Capone of Hackers still didn't get enough development and screen time. I almost wished we had had a flashback to the time when he was a government tech consultant being undermined by top executives.<br/><br/>This movie still has its entertainment value but how many car chases can one see before it's starts becoming been-there-done-that. Free Live Die Hard is a movie that definitely could have lived up to much greater potential. If you love your car chases and don't care about story, see it eight times."
"Jonny_Numb","6","3","6","12 July 2007"," Die Hard: Generations
","Being a die-hard fan of the ""Die Hard"" series for as long as I can remember, watching the first installment in 12 years is by turns exhilarating and jarring: ""Live Free or Die Hard"" shows just how much the process of cinematic action has changed in such a relatively short period. Whereas we once had stunt-men and creative blocking/editing to successfully deliver the illusion that, yes, that IS Bruce Willis unloading a can of whoop-ass on Alan Rickman's, William Sadler's, and Jeremy Irons' henchmen, we now have technology to deliver increasingly improbable action (not that the action in the previous films was ever very probable) with our bruised, now-bald rock of a hero, John McClane, in the foreground. While this makes the action-sequence ceiling seem limitless, it makes much of ""Live Free""'s stunts and set-pieces veer into ridiculousness.<br/><br/>And, of course, that is one of the reasons we pay the over-inflated ticket price to watch Bruce do his thing--we know most of the stunts and set-pieces are anything but humanly possible, but we are riveted to the appeal of Willis's Everyman dynamic. In ""Live Free,"" our undeterred hero butts heads with Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant--""Go""), a former government worker feeling burned for having his techno-savvy Homeland Security protection program rejected (or something to that effect--does it really matter?); with the ultimate goal of locking down all of America's technology, these Caucasian terrorists (with a female Asian martial-arts expert, and--curiously--French assassins) incite a ""fire sale"" that only Willis and techno-geek Matt Farrell (Mac pitchman Justin Long) can stop. As McClane becomes his usual one-man force, Gabriel raises the stakes by kidnapping his daughter, Lucy (""Death Proof"" hottie Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The road to the conclusion of this 130-minute monster is paved in carnage, all of which Gabriel claims ""can be fixed"" (""On the back of the taxpayer, right?"" I mused to myself).<br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman, who cut his teeth on the style-heavy ""Underworld"" films, seems a rather natural choice for this type of material, which puts action over plot. But his direction is almost too slick for its own good--part of me embraced the uses of CG technology to make the action more urgent and polished, but my inner series purist felt betrayed by a convention that is, quite frankly, overused in cinema today. To ""Live Free""'s credit, most of its uses are seamlessly integrated, but when a Harrier Jet is chasing McClane around a winding, elevated highway at the film's climax, the temptation to laugh almost overrides the equally strong urge to gasp. The scene works, but is closer in tone and appearance to Michael Bay than John McTiernan.<br/><br/>Which is why I suppose I titled my review ""Die Hard: Generations."" ""Live Free"" shows Bruce Willis at the end of his franchise credibility, and while he has plenty of ""yippie-ki-yay"" to see him through this entry, the inclusion of Justin Long's ferret-y hacker seems like an attempt to bring in a younger audience. Ditto the use of computers as harbingers of destruction--while taking a less-than-subtle jab at how our lives have been overrun by technology, Long's savvy is more a point of interest for kids weaned on iTunes and pirated programs (whatever happened to the good old days, where terrorists took control of high-rises before the advent wireless networks?). And another dubious nod toward making ""Live Free"" palatable to (and viewable by) a younger audience is its PG-13 rating; while the carnage is pretty substantial, it seems as though the filmmakers held back very little in the way of wholesale death--the axiom being, ""you can kill as many generic henchmen as possible in quick edits with no (or little) blood and beat a woman as long as she's an Asian martial-arts expert and get a PG-13, but with more gore and one extra F-bomb, you'd be in R territory."" While the film sated my summer action fix, I wonder why a film that already pushes the barrier of the PG-13 didn't simply venture into R territory anyway (after all, part of the appeal of watching the original trilogy at an impressionable age is seeing stuff we're not ""supposed"" to see).<br/><br/>The villains of ""Die Hard"" have always been part of the key to the series' success, sophisticated yet flawed foils to Willis's distinctly ""mom and apple pie"" hero. Thespians like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons had fun playing against type as criminal masterminds of ill intent (but no ill humor), and held their own against the unflappable McClane. Olyphant, by comparison, comes off a bit bland--potentially another 'touch' for the detached generation weaned on Michael Bay; cold and smartly calculating, Thomas Gabriel epitomizes ""The Man""--the soulless computer geek (with a better wardrobe and haircut than his more transparently dorky accomplices) whose Bill Gates-ian demeanor naturally breeds contempt. By the time McClane confronts this terrorist threat, the effect doesn't come off as spectacularly as it has in the past (though the Harrier chase that comes right before is a hard sequence to top).<br/><br/>While I have leveled a lot of seeming criticisms against ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" I still recommend the film on the basis of its sole purpose: as pure entertainment to pass a lazy summer afternoon. Willis is as tough and appealing as ever, and Long makes a good counterpoint to his grizzled veteran. While not on the same level of the previous films, which valued substance on a level above the superficial (watch the scenes between Reginald VelJohnson and Willis in the original, or those with Samuel L. Jackson in the third to see what I mean) it is certainly worth a look."

","A film with great action-scenes and high adrenaline performance. Bruce Willis makes a good impact with his acting and performs very well as one man show guy. But the special effects are too hyperbolic and very ridiculous (no one can survive after a crash with a jeep as the Chinese girl for example). Furthermore there are many good lines from the actors. The hacking from the terrorists were also accomplished in a way that seemed very simple and that makes the movie to lose its realistic tune (how on earth can a simple laptop to hack down a great server and how it's possible a great country as USA to be hacked so easily). Let's hope the next 'die hard' to be more good."

","I went out to see die hard 4, First let me say that it was the best of the die hard series from my perspective. The only thing I would say is that Its continually been redone. John McClain is in the same situation hes always in, bad guys are being bad. he kills them all. and saves the day. Its nothing original. Its been the same as Die hard 1 in every movie. Although I like the die hard series and believe this is the best one there were times in the theater I was just like ""come on, come on! get to the point already"" I was never ""on the edge of my seat"" or excited because its all been done before. its worth seeing but after seeing it, its not my first choice at the box office."

","To start with, I enjoyed this movie and have even gone twice. I know there was a lot of worry with the PG13 rating. I agree that sure it could have seen benefits in areas with the R rating, but it still held up very well. Besides a reduction in language there is not a lack of action.<br/><br/>I loved the aspect of a character like McClane using his tough old school methods against an enemy that uses computers and technology as a weapon. While the whole country is in an upset over losing technology, McClane just needs a gun and his will.<br/><br/>Nothing will ever be the first Die Hard movie. My thing though is, if you are a fan, you're a fan so something as simple as losing some cussing shouldn't turn you off. This is still John McClane saving the day by any means. <br/><br/>And with the quantity of bad movies coming out these days, I'm still glad there are a few quality movie franchises still around. These new movies may make more money, or get better write ups, but in the end they don't have a 20 year franchise backing them up. <br/><br/>There is still a demand for Die Hard, and Rocky, and Rambo all these years later. I think that says something, regardless of what supposed all knowing critics say about these movies."
"sir_clive","7","3","6","8 July 2007"," A great action movie, but no Die Hard
","I just saw the movie, so I thought I should drop by and share my opinion.<br/><br/>It is a great action movie, that's for sure. It is NOT, however, a Die Hard movie. There was absolutely no character development, quite a few of the action scenes seemed overblown (Mc Lane is not James Bond, for Christ sake - that's one of the reasons he was so likable in DH 1-3). Also it was WAY too technical, without even trying to be SOMEWHAT accurate about it. Literally ALL of the hacker and computer related scenes were hilariously unbelievable.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the cast (except for the surprisingly weak villain) and the special effects were very good indeed!<br/><br/>All in all it was well spent EUR 17,-- (that's approx. USD 22), for some cool action with Bruce Willis in it, as well as for reviving some fond memories of the previous movies. Unfortunately, not more.<br/><br/>If the movie didn't pretend to be a DH sequel, it would get an 8/10 from me, instead of 7/10 I just gave it."
"dibyajyotisarma","Null","3","6","7 July 2007"," When there is a Willis
","Okay, enough of these sequels thingy. We are not even talking about Die Hard, one, two, three, and compare them with the new one. Thankfully, the film does not need to latch on its famous predecessors. It can pretty much stand on its own, trust Bruce Willis. Oh, yes, it's a Bruce Willis movie, frame-to-frame, action-to-action. So let's talk about Willis as John McClane, a role that made him a star in the first place. Willis rocks like never before. There are two shades of character that Willis is good at playing, a doting, overprotective father to his teenage daughter (Armageddon) and a good cop taking it all to save the day (Mercury Rising). Here, he does both the job perfectly. He's not the McClane of the earlier movies. He has aged, but boy, he's still a handful. Talk about aging gracefully! Vampire specialist Len Wisemen (Underworld) turns his attention to cyber crime this time, and if you can handle the idea of blowing up a computer by pushing the delete button, let him guide you through the action, cyber or otherwise. Gun fire, explosion, car races and other action set-pieces are the highlight of any Die Hard film, and here, you have them in abundance  computers blow up, cars go flying, flyovers come crashing, and McClane survives all these to save the day. And you don't complain, they are all first rate, something that you have seen on the big screen after a long time (if some scenes reminds you of The Italian Job, Underworld or Hollow Man, you can always ignore them.). There was a super nerd called Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) working on government cyber security programme, told the government that the countries cyber security is vulnerable and they must do something about it. But the bosses would not hear anything about it and he was duly fired. Now, the nerdy boy is all fired up to teach the government a lesson by systematically hacking all the computer systems in the country  telecom, electricity, energy, everything. It's a virtual 9/11 situation out there and none have a clue what's going on, except for Matt Farrell (Justin Long), a hacker and our good ole' detective McClane gets embroils into the scenes when he was asked to escort Ferrell for an interrogation. Then follows the classic situation, two unlikely partners in a desperate journey to save the world: A geek and a gunslinger. Sit tight for a jolly good ride. Long complements Willis old-style cop with his geeky sweetness (If all the computer manipulations look simplistic, that okay, the film is about the action, right, not how far can you take this cyber crime business!) A feast for all Bruce Willis fans, after a long time."
"kevin_crighton","8","3","6","7 July 2007"," The biggest surprise of the summer!
","The signs weren't great. A 4th movie of a series, the last of which was made almost 13 years earlier. With the exception of Bruce Willis, a cast that on paper didn't look to impressive. A director whose Underworld movies were OK, but had too much reliance on CGI.<br/><br/>But...Die Hard 4.0 is an absolute blast!<br/><br/>The plot, sees McClane teaming up with a computer geek to stop terrorists from destroying the computer system of the American government, and making a lot of money out of it.<br/><br/>What follows are some very impressive action sequences, from a shoot-out in Farrell's (Justin Long) apartment, to a car helicopter smash-up, to a chase sequence involving a truck, van and a fighter jet!!<br/><br/>Bruce Willis may be a bit older, but he handles the action set-pieces as if he's never been away from them. But his best moment, for me, is a scene between McLane and Farrell in a car, where he reveals the downside of being the hero. It's a small moment in a big movie that's quite touching.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, I was surprised. With no Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, or Samuel L Jackson to bounce off, I was concerned as most of the cast are either up-coming (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Justin Long, Maggie Q) or actors better known on TV (Timothy Olyphant - from Deadwood). However Olyphant is quite good as Gabriel, the computer genius behind the plan. While perhaps not as menacing as Rickman or Irons were, it should be pointed out, his character is different. They were terrorists through and through. Gabriel has (he believes) been driven to do what he's doing by the Government. Maggie Q as his second-in- command good too. The fight between her and Willis is surprisingly brutal for a man v woman fight. But she is convincing and can easily hold her own.<br/><br/>Justin Long, who is better known for playing in comedies is quite a surprise here. As Farrell, who gets caught up in something, that he had been involved with creating and then trying to stop it, Long does well and in the little pieces of action he gets involved with again convinces as an action geek! Winstead as McLane's daughter doesn't have much to do until the last third of the movie, but she's a good actress and makes Lucy McClane believable as John McLane's daughter. The rest of the cast do okay, even if not completely memorable.<br/><br/>But the biggest revelation here is actually Len Wiseman. As I said, his 2 Underworld movies had a reliance on CGI, and I was concerned that Die Hard 4.0 would suffer from that, but he's kept the CGI to a minimum here. This movie harks back to when you actually created proper stunts, and you can almost feel and hear the poor stuntmen suffering for their art here at times. Only during the jet fighter sequence did I become concerned about CGI, which is a good thing. Up till then, if there was any, I didn't notice, or simply didn't mind.<br/><br/>In a summer so far where the action movies have either been disappointing or too CGI heavy, it's pleasing to say that Die Hard 4.0 not only blows the competition away, but has livened up what was looking to be a poor summer. This is exciting and funny."
"qvdb","8","3","6","2 July 2007"," Yippie-Ki-Yay?
","I'm what you could somewhat call a die hard 'Die Hard' fan, as I've enjoyed every movies in the series (albeit, the 2nd one less) and have always enjoyed the crazy action and funny one liners and the whole mood created by these films.<br/><br/>This movie brings us back to John McClane's unfortunate world, and I've got to say I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. I was scared the movie would become too 'CGI-ized' but was pleasantly surprised that Lens Wiseman made more or less subtle use of digital technology. The action is impressively set up and quite frankly, delivers on every level.<br/><br/>My main criticism (and this made me cringe slightly before watching the movie too) was the producers choice to have this film cut down to a PG-13 for a wider audience to enjoy. While I understand the idea, 'Die Hard' for me as always been so much fun because it was an action series (unlike say Mission Impossible) that had violence and swearing which made it feel more adult orientated. The one liners in this movie aren't as efficient as before and the repetitive kiddie insults used by McClane, which would certify the rating, make him seem nicer, and turns John into a more 'friendly neighborhood' policeman type instead of the iconic, dirty, down-talking cop which made him famous. Even the trademark line of the series, the emblem of this character, and the greatest quote of all time(exaggerated, I know) is bleeped out by a gunshot! <br/><br/>All this said though, the film was top-notch and impressive, and anyone looking for crazy action, entertainment or popcorn fun will enjoy this as much as I did. I recommend it to any Die Hard fan, or simply someone who wants a good time.<br/><br/>I just hope the R-rated Director's Cut will be released on DVD so we can get a real sense of Die Hard back."
"Listen_to_the_Law","8","3","6","2 July 2007"," Great Action Movie
","Live Free or Die Hard is an overly-intelligent action movie with more intense action than just about any other movie out there. It's the fourth movie in a series that dates all the way back to 1988, when the original Die Hard came out. Lots has changed since then: lead star John McClaine (Willis) is approaching AARP status, special effects have vastly improved, and for the first time in the series, this installment received a PG-13 rating. This is certainly a strong PG-13 movie- some of the action scenes can get pretty violent but not anything to warrant an R rating. LFoDH doesn't seem to be hampered by the rating, as all the action scenes are full-out and in your face, just like a great action movie should be.<br/><br/>For never seeing a Die Hard movie before this one, the story struck my by surprise. There is no ultra-violent ego-maniac trying to take down McClaine by sheer force. Instead, the story is all about a group of very elite computer hackers who have access to just about everything in the country that depends on computer signals: stop lights, gas pipes, airplane radio signals, transmitters, security cameras, etc. Their goal is to reek as much havoc as possible and to bring down the entire country. Cliché, but intriguing. Some of the hackers work is generally creepy, as you will see when you watch the movie. Director Len Wiseman counters the claims of ""unrealistic"" through main evil-doer Thomas Gabriel. It would be unreal for one man to have access to so much information in the federal government and the security agencythat is, of course, unless he used to work there! With the enemy knowing the ins and outs of all of his targets, how can he loose? He can't, exactly. However, there is John McClaine, a hardened veteran of situations exactly like these. As a New York police officer, McClaine is tough, smart, and sarcastic. To be even more of a badass, he goes by his last name only. In the beginning, McClaine is contacted by the FBI to pick up a suspicious computer hacker from New Jersey by the name of Matt Farrell. The FBI thinks that he has something to do with the growing number of hack-jobs they have been dealing with. However, Farrell confesses to the mess, but points out that the hackers ditched him and are now expanding their power under Gabriel. Farrell says that he would never do such a thing, and that he may know how to track down Gabriel. That is, as long as he is willing to work with McClaine.<br/><br/>The story isn't as polished as I would've hoped, as there are times when unexplained stuff will occur and previous ideas are thrown out the window. However, these are few and far between, so it's hard to fault the movie much for that. Live Free or Die Hard is the first true action movie of the summer, and it seems to be here for a whilewell, until July 4th, when Transformers comes out. But for these few days, Live Free or Die Hard is the movie to see.<br/><br/>Good) great action scenes/moments, strong lead character, very smart movie Bad) ending isn't truly satisfying, a few storyline holes Kevin Smith) The hilarious ""large"" actor adds in some necessary humor as the Warlock. Oh, and he plays Gears of War"
"crowrobot","8","3","6","2 July 2007"," ""Live Free or Die Hard"" provides excellent thrills and laughs in a summer of disappointing, bloated blockbusters...
","Comparing the new film ""Live Free or Die Hard"" to the 1988 classic ""Die Hard"" seems kind of pointless to me (I have yet to see ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" or ""Die Hard With A Vengeance). They are two films born of different eras, each with their own goals in mind. ""Die Hard"" is obviously a classic, but LFODH does a great job of providing the goods for an entertaining summer action flick.<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is: Former US hacker Thomas Gabriel (an unimposing Timothy Olyphant) decides to bring down the computer system of America and cause chaos. It's up to New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) and geeky hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) to stop Gabriel's plan, especially considering that the baddies get hold of John's daughter Lucy (a feisty Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Much gunfire, explosions, and fistfights ensue.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked about the movie is that McClane and Farrell truly need each other. McClane is behind the times, described at one point as ""a Timex watch in a digital world"", while Farrell is insanely up-to-date. McClane provides fisticuffs, Farrell supplies hacker skills. I liked their budding friendship, and Farrell has a surprisingly effective character arc as he grows a backbone; one of the best scenes in the film has him refusing to help Gabriel complete his plans. Long is a funny actor, and he has a good rapport with Willis, who proves once again that he came out of the womb in order to play this character. Winstead makes a fine McClane-in-training, although her first scene is a little creepy thanks to the script.<br/><br/>The bad guys, alas, do not fear as well. While I suppose Olyphant is fine doing malevolent stares and speaking in a half-menacing whisper, he doesn't really prove to be much a challenge for McClane. His two best scenes come in a confrontation with McClane over a web cam and when he sighs to Lucy, ""I can't talk to him, *you* talk to him,"" like a disappointed parent. Maggie Q has a great fight scene with Willis, and parkour expert Cyrus Rafaelli has some cool scenes, and his death is kind of magnificent.<br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman (the ""Underworld"" series) does a fine job with the action scenes, although even I have to admit that the business with the fighter jet seems superfluous. What he's not so good at is tension and danger, save for the opening apartment battle and McClane and Farrell's infiltration of one of Gabriel's targets.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating does not dampen the experience too much. Yes, it'd be nice to hear McClane drop f-bombs by the dozens, but at least he gets to say his most famous line (albeit slightly muffled). Strangely, I didn't notice the supposed dubbing errors that many critics have pointed out; maybe I'm just not good at that sort of thing. The violence pushes the rating about as far as it go, and it's satisfyingly brutal.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is stalwartly old-fashioned. Like it's hero, it's a throwback to simpler times, a breath of fresh air in a season of bloated CGI extravaganzas (although I am still looking forward to Transformers, which looks to combine new-school effects with old-school sensibilities)."
"kgprophet","6","3","6","1 July 2007"," Action - Stunts - Car Chases - BOOM!
","By chance I noticed that my favourite theatre was showing a Midnight screening of Die Hard 4. Being a fan of the first three films, I was a little jazzed for another go-round with John McClane. Was it worth it? Well, it's no Die-hard 1 or 2, but gives you some fun action. The biggest setback is the lack of original ideas, there are aspects of identifiable plot points from many other films. There are pieces of ""Last Action Hero"", ""True Lies"", ""Die Hard 2"", ""Italian Job"", even ""Road Warrior"". The biggest asset is a well paced storyline with plenty of action. People who are fans of real stunts over CGI will be generally pleased. The scenes that are obviously digital effects are not make-or-break scenes, the entire film doesn't depend on whether we buy the effects shots or not. There is a good deal of car/truck/helicopter/jet fighter chase scenes. However, by we the time we get to the third act, it all starts to feel familiar. Knowing this, the filmmakers cut to the chase and don't even pretend that SuperJohn (TV ads say he isn't another superhero - but he does have super powers). McClane continues to walk away from explosions, car wrecks, exploding cars, exploding freeways, and exploding buildings. The bad guys he kills along the way are just statistics after awhile. The key villain has a nice angry look, and a couple other supporting characters aren't wooden. <br/><br/>Buddied up this time around is Justin Long (of ""I'm a Mac"" fame). He just barely makes the cut of being cool enough to be a Keanu Reeves, without it feeling like ""let's add all the things that young people find hip and cool"". The movie certainly does lobby for the younger generation (a McClane prequel is on the drawing boards). It features hackers, Kevin Smith, a teenage McClane hottie, cluelessness about the 70s, OnStar, Blackberries, and so on. If it wasn't for extra re-writes and even more helicopters, it would be like ""Mercury Rising"" or some other action-for-action's-sake kind of dullness. The movie has moments of serious bad guy stuff, and missteps trying to toss in inappropriate jokes. The film constantly is riding the line of trying to have it's cake and eat it too. A few scenes seem to cast a serious tone on brutal violence, but then gleefully slaughters bad guys. ""Kids, Violence is Bad, now lets go kill more Bad Guys"". It is obviously the film was shot to be an 'R' rated film. There are scenes that look like bad TV dubbing, with actors saying tame words over naughty words, but the lips aren't matching. <br/><br/>The cinematography was notably slick, something better than '24'. <br/><br/>I Give it 6 out of 10."

","To be honest, I am not a die hard fan when watching this movie. The trailer was cool and I thought I would catch because of its intense action. I have seen Len Wiseman's movies, Underworld and Underworld 2. They are not bad but here he proved that he can handle big action with exploding cars and he did it. He managed to put all the intense action violence into a PG-13 rating. I can say it is rather more intense than violent.<br/><br/>The story is action-packed, almost around every ten minutes, action will come, blasting John McClane and his ""pal"", Matt. Matt was wanted dead but John comes along and saves him from the exploding computer. Thomas is a hacker and wants to hack all the USA system. And you know what will happen, John going to stop him, meets some near-death incidents and making jokes. Finally, Thomas gets so angry with him and he decided to hold his daughter hostage. It is pretty intense but it has some humour too. Not bad for an action movie's style.<br/><br/>Len Wiseman proved he can direct big action so he moved down from Underworld to direct Die hard 4.0. He is amazing. It is more intense than Underworld, it is better than Underworld. Those fans who think that Die hard 4.0 should be rated R, watch this, it is quite intense even for a PG-13 movie. It is great and I am not a Die hard fan. Even people who like hard-core action movie will like this. It is worth the ticket price."

But as it turns out, Live Free or Die Hard turned out to be probably the best action movie of the year! Bruce Willis is now 52 years old, but not only does he not look it, he can still play John McClane like he did 20 years ago. He's still rocking these Die Hard films. It was also a different take since we are now in a different era, so it was cool to see all the updated features of living and being in 2007.<br/><br/>John is still divorced and his kids won't talk to him, it's a wonder why he's still in his job since it's all he has left in his life. But when he gets an assignment mearly to pick up a computer hacker, Matt Farrel, he and Matt get attacked in Matt's apartment. It turns out there are some terrorists that are after Matt since he's such a well known computer hacker, these terrorists are after money and to make the country their's. But I guess they didn't see the other Die Hard movies, because they should know better than to ever mess with John McClane or his daughter! <br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard may have extremely unbelievable situations, but that's what makes it such a great action film! These are some of the best action sequences I have seen in a long time, my favorite was the SUV with the female terrorist, that was so cool! John has in no way lost his edge and I wouldn't hesitate to say that this is the best Die Hard sequel so far! Justin Long was a great addition, he's coming quite a long way in his career. Timothy Olyphant is a great villain, but still I wouldn't compare him to Alan Rickman, he's the ultimate villain. But still, I would highly recommend this film to any one, it's a great action movie and just altogether an excellent summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>8/10"
"joachimokeefe","6","3","6","1 July 2007"," Let down by plot compromises
","Die Hard 4.0 is enjoyable on the level of 'how many cars can they smash up in one movie?', but on the human level they've compromised John MacLean. In this story he's little more than a bodyguard for the tame hacker until halfway through, and then it's as though they thought, 'Oh, we'd better give him some motivation - let's put his daughter in a hostage situation'.This is fine all the while it's leading up to the final confrontation with all sorts of CGI and stunts, but the ending is a real letdown. They make us swallow all that nonsense about patching networks at lightning speed and literally wrestling a jet fighter to the ground, and then what's the big finish? A bog-standard boring old Mexican standoff - in a shed or hangar - that might have come from TJ Hooker. There's no payoff for believing all that hokum! MacLean should do something even more amazing to turn the tables ON HIS OWN; instead it's a group effort and Bruce pulls off a cliché. 8/10 for a stylish CGI actioner, 4 for the ending. And the violence against women in this movie is not right; that must be why the PG rating. But it's not right."
"Buddy-51","7","3","6","30 June 2007"," proof that action-movie overload can be a good thing
","After a twelve-year-long hiatus in which he was off doing other things, Bruce Willis finally returns to his signature role of NYPD detective John McClane in ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" a pulse-pounding action film guaranteed to confirm every paranoid suspicion you've ever had that humans are indeed at the mercy of technology.<br/><br/>In this installment, McClane has gone far beyond rescuing people trapped in a burning building; he's moved into saving-the-world territory as he takes on a disgruntled security expert who, after his warnings about massive system failure are ignored by the United States government, devises a plan to bring society to its knees through a mind-boggling display of techno terrorism.<br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman doesn't fool around when it comes to giving the action audience what it's paid good money to see; from the very first scene, he shifts into full-throttle mode and never once lets up throughout the course of the movie. In fact, so skillful is he at staging the elaborate action scenes that one barely notices that a mere human being like McClane winds up withstanding a tougher pounding than any genuine super-powered superhero ever have had to put up with even on his worst day. Indeed, McClane engineers so many hairbreadth escapes and arises unscathed from so many predicaments that would have killed a lesser man ten times over that we begin to think he should be given a comic book of his own for all his efforts.<br/><br/>Clearly, credibility is never a very high priority for any action movie, and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" compensates for its weakness in that area by being fast-paced, seamlessly stitched together and surprisingly good-natured despite the rather alarming body count it manages to pile up in time for the closing credits. Nobody embodies the sardonic, wisecracking, stoic hero better than Willis, and even in his early 50's, he displays an agility and athleticism that would turn many younger action stars green with envy. Willis receives fine support from Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Cliff Curtis and the beautiful Maggie Q. Although easily nine-tenths of the movie is straight-on action, writer Mark Bomback still manages to sprinkle in the requisite one-liners all such protagonists need if they are to be taken seriously as action figures, and he has fun with the irony that the bad guys with all their cybernetic gizmos and technological thingamabobs are no match for McClane's good old-fashioned ingenuity and brainpower.<br/><br/>What would the world do without John McClane?"
"Special-K88","Null","3","6","28 June 2007"," despite the standard formula this latest picture is a formidable addition to the series

Unfortunately McClane once again finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when that same hacker becomes the target of a cyber-terrorist ringleader who instigates a systematic scheme to shut down the entire country. Despite a twelve year hiatus and familiar plotting this post-9/11 fourth installment packs plenty of punch with inventive action scenes, first-class stunt work, and more than enough wisecracks. Rough, tough, and action-packed, with Willis in peak form as the ""old school"" hero, and Long a good fit as his mild-mannered sidekick.

Justin long as the sidekick works in fresh way. he's a wimp but still ""that kind of guy"" . he did a great job with comic relief, even dough die hard doesn't need comic relief from other people than Mclane himself. his comments are just priceless. go see this movie, i cant believe true die hard fans are boycotting this. they are missing some awesome action and dialog. cant wait for the DVD release!"

"Quinoa1984","5","6","16","2 July 2007"," it's not horrible to see it once, but it won't have much of a place in my DVD collection
","Live Free or Die Hard will attract, and has already attracted, masses of fans of the Die Hard franchise or simply the 07 summer blockbuster crowd, looking for big huge explosions and John McClaine (Bruce Willis) as the cynical New York detective out to kill a lot of people (and there are a LOT of people this time around, by hook or by crook or car smashing into helicopter) in his mission to do whatever it is the screenwriters get him to do. Which is fine. But personally, the movie comes off like a bag of Doritos or a McDonalds burger that has 'New and Improved' in big letters on the outer box, but the contents are stale and left out in the open air for much too long. It's not necessarily ""good"" for you to start with, but it should be something to make you feel good in the sense of more primal thrills. Yet I call shenanigans on this one this time. Like Superman Returns or particularly Terminator 3, the studios via the writers are left to their own devices to think up a gimmick or situation, not so much any kind of story, to pluck their big headliner hero into, and the idea is that whatever this is the audience will be fine with it as long as they get the basics of what's expected.<br/><br/>It's not that the fourth Die Hard installment doesn't try and go for big action. On the contrary, it's got more heavy-duty action than at least the last two Die Hard installments, and probably just as much as the first. But there's a catch- actually a double catch- in the movie this time. Instead of the real work being put into the script and casting and THEN the big action set pieces and violent fights, it's the other way around, and there's a sinking sensation even from the first few minutes that this will be all too formulaic. To give some credit where it's due, it's like looking at a used Jeep that's been re-assembled a couple of times: you'll get around in it, but it's not the most enjoyable of rides. The ""new"" ingredient mentioned before comes in the form of the threat this time being a high-tech scheme/plot to overthrow America by way of overriding the already over dominant presence of technology itself. The ideas behind this, of governmental control, of the abstract power of computers, are only thrown in of course as stuff to set up the picture, but there's more potential here than is really tapped- and it's potential that is already fishy by already seeming to be there as a device unto itself, no pun intended, as opposed to actually leading to other things in the movie (ala in Die Hard 3 the ideas of racism, the ""other"" and so on).<br/><br/>The only thread that continues through all the films, and maybe to a more successfully ridiculous degree this time, is money. This time the big-time ex-White House terrorist played by the practically straight-faced villain Olyphant is after billions and billions, or maybe just wiping out the system altogether. But unlike in at least the first and third installments (I haven't seen the second one in a while), it's left goofily as just a sidebar to lead up to an uber-conventional climax in an airplane hanger with the key players. Really though, even if this weren't necessarily a Die Hard movie, and it still had all the same plot elements, it would still feel re-cooked: the father over-protective of the daughter not seen again until needed for the plot; the obnoxious sidekick- here so obnoxious it hurts even in supposedly funny scenes from Justin Long; the sassy female 2nd banana to Olyphant played by Maggie Q, who is almost a ninja cyborg as opposed to a human being; the 'man in charge' at the government agency two steps behind the protagonist and antagonist; and, disappointing considering it's Kevin Smith, the oafish secret guy who pushes the plot just a little more along.<br/><br/>I'm not opposed to big mega-buck franchises pumping out another feature from a series I've admired for a while, and I'm sure if there are others in the future (matter of fact Indiana Jones 4 comes out next summer), I'll likely be there again to plunk down a few bucks and see what comes up. But with Live Free or Die Hard, as stupidly watchable as it can be in its big-bang action sequences, it's like a watered down treatment of a blockbuster for a series that should be the toughest around. When I was younger it was a lot of wicked fun seeing a high-octane movie like Die Hard with a Vengeance (still my favorite of the lot) with Samuel L. Jackson doing as much cursing as he did in Pulp Fiction. In this installment, the ""F"" bomb, considered a big no-no for the MPAA, is actually dubbed over (in lieu of a PG-13 rating) if uttered once or twice- with the perennial catch phrase cut off by a gun-shot- albeit still allowing for more ""S"" words than a sailor on sabbatical and enough ultra-violent moments to make probably the original director of Die Hard wince. It's a double standard, which is bad enough, but heaped on with a predictable plot that runs its course before the movie ends it leads to almost a kind of indifference. In one word, it's ""Eh"" movie-making."

"daneldorado","10","4","10","7 July 2007"," The best ""Die Hard"" sequel to date
","No one is a bigger fan than I, of the original ""Die Hard"" (1988). I was silently rooting for Bruce Willis to have a major breakthrough flick after his smarmy but endearing stint as Cybil Shepherd's sidekick on TV's ""Moonlighting"" and his first foray into features as Tom Mix in ""Sunset"" (also 1988). And he came through, big time, in ""Die Hard."" The original DH blew my socks off... just as, I suspect, thousands of fans from coast to coast were sockless after seeing this very violent, very profane, but also very humorous thriller set in an L.A. hi-rise, featuring a charismatic villain (Alan Rickman) and Willis as a displaced NYPD cop, John McClane.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 2"" (1990) and the third entry in the series, ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) were disappointments... especially since we knew Willis still had it in him as an action star, with stupendous performances in two more thrillers, ""Striking Distance"" (1993) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994).<br/><br/>So now, watching the latest episode in the ""Die Hard"" series -- alternately called ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (for the U.S.) and ""Die Hard 4.0"" (for other nations around the world) -- it was impossible to hold one's hopes too high. Would this sequel fail also, as had the first two followups to that immortal original? <br/><br/>The good news is that ""Die Hard 4"" is the best sequel to date. John McClane (Willis) is older now -- the promos say he's 52 -- and completely bald, but he is no less ready for action. <br/><br/>In this one, McClane is dispatched on a routine mission -- pick up a computer hacker and deliver him to headquarters -- but along the way, both he and the young hacker (played with an agreeable nerdiness by Justin Long, 26 but looking younger) are ambushed by the minions of Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a former FBI computer programmer gone wrong, who has masterminded a plot to wipe out all of the U.S.' infrastructure... by remote control. Obviously, this is a 21st century ""Die Hard."" When the computer geeks take over, watch out! But in an effective, reassuring way, the strictly analog John McClane proves more than a match for the cyberpirates. He dispatches them one by one -- most deliciously, a ferocious female kung-fu master (Maggie Q), whom he defeats after a lengthy tussle, eventually dropping her down an elevator shaft, then throwing an SUV on top of her, to keep her company. Yes, it's that kind of movie: One violent sequence after another, but all played tongue-in-cheek.<br/><br/>In fact, there are times when the ongoing action in the film is upstaged by the humor. John McClane has always had a comedic streak in him, and here the wisecracks come fast and often... and not just his famous ""Yippee-Kai-Yay"" line, either. After he maneuvers his police car into jumping a ramp and diving into a low-flying enemy helicopter, his young hacker friend says, with understandable disbelief: ""Wow! You killed a helicopter with a car!"" McClane's deadpan reply: ""I was out of bullets."" <br/><br/>Finally, after two hours of mostly Road Runner/Wyle E. Coyote-type mayhem, McClane draws a bead on that most malevolent King of All Things Digital, Thomas Gabriel, and dispatches him with the famous McClane signature line... only this time, because of the film's PG-13 rating, the final word (after Yippee-Kai-Yay) is muffled by the sound of a gunshot.<br/><br/>Unlike some others who have left messages here, I was not at all distressed by the film's lack of F-bombs. We've heard enough of those by now, haven't we? It was actually a relief -- a moment of giddy pleasure -- to hear McClane issue that signature line, with the profanity filtered out. And it was funny. As I say, the whole film is played tongue-in-cheek. And finally, we have a second John McClane film worthy of its illustrious pedigree. <br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the best sequel ever, to the magnificent original.<br/><br/>Dan Navarro (daneldorado93@yahoo.com)"
"marcelrinia","3","4","10","7 July 2007"," Suspension of belief
","I can't believe most reviewers are so positive about this movie. 8 out of 10? come on! I like a good action movie as much as the next guy and the original Die Hard is one of my favorite action movies of all time. This one however lost me about twenty minutes in, because it just got too... ridiculous, for lack of a better word. <br/><br/>When I go to see summer blockbusters, my expectations are already lower than usual. But this year's box-office-hit-wannabe's have reached an all time low (or I just got too old for this sh#t). Film makers have long since given up on story line, continuity and character development. This year, they also seem to have given up on trying to convince the audience that what they are seeing is in any way possible. This movie has no vampire/werewolf hybrids, super heroes, magical prodigies or even undead pirates, but it might as well have, because that wouldn't have made the big scenes any more unbelievable. <br/><br/>I don't understand why every movie needs to be bigger than the last, because bigger automatically leads to ""more and more unbelievable"". The way thing are going now, in a few years we'll be watching movies that consist of nothing but one long action-scene.<br/><br/>I won't make a list of things that bothered me about this one. I will however give my advise to viewers: go see it if you must. Preferably do that in a theater with a really big screen. But, if you loved Die Hard, really liked Die Harder, but -like me- really DISliked the third one... don't expect this one to be any better! In fact, try not to think of it as a sequel to the first two (take away the title and Bruce and there's no Die Hard left).<br/><br/>PS. Two things about this movie I did like: Maggie Q and Timothy Olyphant."

But i should he has really lived up to the expectations and the movie should go among one of the best movies of 2007. when so many sequel fails to keep up, die hard 4 has fought its place to climb above Die hard 2.<br/><br/>Bruce still has the charm to do the John McClane. He still have the energy for the action sequences. His careless smile and do or die decision might look more a fancy movie, but come on this is what we look for from him. Never die attitude and some unbelievable actions makes the series alive and die hard 4 does the same. The best part of the movie is the director still follows up a few tiny things that makes the McClane character so interesting.<br/><br/>There are a few we might feel we miss, 'cos the movie tries to keep the pace up without adding too many conversations... but i would have loved it more if they done some more funny conversations and actions that heats up the villain and shows McClane a more cool headed officer.<br/><br/>If you are die hard fan and who loves non-stop action then i bet you will watch this movie more then 10 times.

Director Len Wiseman did a fabulous job keeping this movie true to it's roots, the action is fast and furious, casting of the bad guys was terrific, and the special effects were just right - not too much, not too little. They made a genius move to cast Justin Long as Matthew Farrell, the uber-geek who McClane is trusted to bring in; Long manages to do a lot of heavy lifting in this film as the perfect foil for Willis. Go see it, it's a real roller-coaster ride - the audience was laughing, gasping, and holding their breath with the action. When the collective audience enjoys an experience like this together, you know the film is good; it felt like we were all together in a ride at an amusement park. A worthy addition to the Die Hard series!"

We have all scene this corny action before, and we get bored with this. The acting was okay, but that isn't enough to raise my rating up. The concept is retarded and unoriginal. The movie is like Grindhouse to me. It's like a double feature. One half is about something, and the other is about something completely different. I went into this movie thinking it would be better than a lot of movies. But what I got was cheesy action, not very good acting, and several things that shouldn't even be in this movie. The only person that added any good acting was Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She was great. But everybody else was drowning her with their suckingness.

I only wish i'd of stuck with my original judgement, and not decided to rent it after stumbling across the 7.8 rating on IMDb - (Idiotically I never read much into the reviews).<br/><br/>Firstly; i'd like to make it clear to any avid film-goer - avoid this film like the plague. If you're into the whole ""making ill-thought CGI exploison after exploison"" thing, this is probably your cup of tea. I could barely watch the film without the persistent thought in my mind that it had absolutely nothing to do with Die Hard franchise, instead, it seems to just be another run-of-the-mill trashy Hollywood (note the decapitalization)revamp which adheres not even remotely to the original plot nor characters. To be fair, I'm sure the name of the film only includes the words ""Die"" and ""Hard"" so it would line the pockets of the higher-uppers.<br/><br/>In fact, on second thought - I'm not even sure WHY i'm writing this review. It's so disgustingly bad i'm not even sure it deserves any literary response, let alone any positive emotional response. In fact, I urge all of you to go see this movie, you can only truly appreciate how appalling this film is if you see it with your own eyes. I'm not even sure that if I was to write an in-depth review, that I would be able to exude just how poor a sequel it is.<br/><br/>1/10 - it doesn't even deserve the 1.

His John McClane rings true, plain and simple; no matter how outrageous the action becomes, you still can feel the heart of a genuine human being beating underneath there. And his sense of humor? Fuggedaboudit. Nobody can deliver a sarcastic sly remark better than Willis, and he gets a chance to do that a lot in this film - the hilarious one liners fly fast and furious. It's when McClane stops making jokes that you know he's going ultra-serious, and that's when the real fun begins.<br/><br/>The remaining casting here is perfect across the board, as well. Timothy Olyphant is completely believable as the villain, Maggie Q. is great as the second most major physical bad ass in the movie, Justin Long grows on ya as McClane's reluctant sidekick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is totally captivating as McClane's daughter Lucy, and writer/director Kevin Smith rocks as the ultimate computer hacker, Warlock, whose frequency is, of course, 66.6.

I hope FOX uses Rodrick Thorpe's novel The Detective as source material for DIE HARD 5 . . . without the late Rodrick Thorpe there never would have been John McClane.

","Die Hard is brilliant, Die Hard 2 is great and Die Hard with a Vengeance is good. This film is decent enough, but something was missing.<br/><br/>I get the good things out of the way first. The film does look great, even with a lot of blues going on, the location shooting is striking and the editing and cinematography is crisp. The music compliments the film wonderfully with some nostalgic choices of songs and motifs, and while I didn't quite feel the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Justin Long both of them give performances that are quite good. The film is very well directed as well, and the action has enough thrills to please.<br/><br/>However, while the action is thrilling there isn't enough of the claustrophobic or suspenseful atmosphere to make it go the extra mile. The script also feels quite weak, there is the occasionally cheesy or clichéd line but the real problem is there is nothing really memorable or quotable. Same with the plot, which due to some predictable plot points, uneven pacing and a lazy ending doesn't have the impact the action does. I was especially disappointed though in Timothy Olyphant's villain, Olyphant is not a bad actor as such but not only is he given little to do other than sneer or be wimpy but Thomas Gabriel for me is the weakest written and developed of all the Die Hard villains.<br/><br/>Overall, I didn't hate it, didn't love it, in fact my reaction was kind of ""meh"". 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","Die Hard 4.0 is a dinosaur of the 80's action genre. But what people forget is dinosaurs are awesome. They are big, loud, fearsome and they explode! Well, they should explode for my analogy to work because everything in Die Hard 4.0 explodes - cars, planes, helicopters, buildings, the White House, gas terminals, trucks and a whole lot of computers.<br/><br/>I was worried when | went to see Die Hard 4.0 that I would find it difficult to watch a film with Bruce Willis in his 50's as an action hero but when I started watching it I found that this was so far down the list of things that were completely unbelievable that it really didn't matter. And Bruce as John McClane didn't try to be the strongest or fastest or most dangerous he just does what he does best - doggedly refuse to die.<br/><br/>But what surprised me most about Die Hard 4.0 was the injection of a bit of 21st century style into the self consciously 80's plot. John McClane finds himself in a high-tech world of computer intelligence agencies is out of his depth - he doesn't know how to use a computer. He has to face a highly skilled team of terrorists, hackers, martial artists and free-runners amongst others. And he does so with his usual of dry whit and determination.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 is a refreshing after a spate of overly long comic book sequels that take them selves to seriously. It's nice to have a film that has fun with its genre.<br/><br/>Thoroughly over the top fun - 7.5/10"

","I was always very worried when I heard a new Die Hard film was on its way, especially after learning that John McTiernan was not directing. However, the trailer raised some hopes for me - things looked pretty good.<br/><br/>Before I continue, I want you to know, I AM a Die Hard ""Die Hard"" fan. I really did give 4.0 a chance, but I came out of the cinema thinking; ""That was John McClane in an ordinary action movie, that wasn't a Die Hard movie"".<br/><br/>My main concern was how the music was going to keep the production up. When the lights dimmed & the movie started, I wept with joy as I heard Kamen's ""Die Hard"" motive in the music. As I watched, I could instantly tell the camera-work was going to be completely different in this film to the others, and it was. But I thought, providing the score is accurate to the previous Die Hard movies, everything would be alright.<br/><br/>But oh how disappointed I was. The score quickly moved from Kamen's ""Die Hard"" to ""Just another generic action movie score"". Which was a great shame. Without the Die Hard music, I was having trouble really believing it was a Die Hard movie. <br/><br/>As an action film, this movie is very good. The action is well thought out, great fun to watch & not to over the top with CG, which is a VERY good thing. But somehow, it just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Sadly, Bruce Willis' amazing talents playing McClane were devastated in this movie. He had very little screen time compared to the majority of the other characters. There were never any scenes where we would see his face & some expressions for more than 3 seconds. In previous Die Hard's, the camera would always hold on McClane to see how he reacts to what's being said to him. Completely not the case here.<br/><br/>The editing was very average & generic of an action movie. It wasn't edited like previous Die Hard films. There were some fantastic shots in there but really only ""some"", the majority were plain & boring. McClane had too few lines, everyone else got to say far more than he did. Everything else they said was pretty mundane, and everything he got to say, was never quite that thrilling.<br/><br/>Sadly, as with most films - if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen all the best bits. Again, the case with Die Hard 4.0. <br/><br/>I have more gripes, too. Firstly, the bad guys. They're all a bunch of weedy, boring geeks. None of them have any slique or style, or real menace about them like the Gruber brothers or even Colonel Stuart. Also, what they're doing really didn't seem like a threat. No innocent people were killed giving McClane MUCH MORE of a reason to take the ""terrorists"" out. And at moments when there are huge crashes, McClane doesn't get frustrated about people being injured/dying. McClane's conscience is ESSENTIAL to a Die Hard movie but it really did NOT show in 4.0. Granted, when the taxi is smashed, he does care for the driver :)<br/><br/>Secondly, the fact they've made it PG-13. This is a MAJOR problem. When I go to Die Hard, I want to feel like an adult integrating into McClane's world. I didn't. I felt like a child, being given a sneak preview of what McClane's adult life is like. Coarse banter is again an essential part of McClane.<br/><br/>And even if it isn't, why has he become so clean without any explanation? Why has he given up smoking?<br/><br/>Also, I've read here that some people loved the references to other Die Hard movies. I noticed 1, it made me laugh, but it was pretty lame. It would've been nice if he'd reminisced about his time with Zeus, or mentioned Al. Those would've been better moments for me.<br/><br/>Also, the bad guy's final line; ""And on your headstone McClane, it'll read; Always in the wrong place at the wrong time."" This SUCKED. That was a throw in quote to make people chuckle and it SUCKED. He just comes out with it, it's completely out of context (because during the movie McClane is BARELY in the wrong place ever at the wrong time). Also, this is a phrase only McClane would know from Die Hard 2. So how does the bad guy know to come out with it? It was a disappointing, sucky one liner.<br/><br/>The death of the bad guy is also incredibly short & lame. So is the title; Die Hard 4.0 - that is an absolutely awful, boring name. Why couldn't we have had ""Live Free or Die Hard"" in the UK?<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good action movie, but it wasn't a Die Hard movie. They've catered far too much for a new, younger audience than Die Hard's older audience. McClane is a dying breed, if this is his last film - he really has NOT gone out with a bang. He's kind of fizzled out slowly & boringly.<br/><br/>Sincerely though, I hope that isn't the last. If there is to be another with Bruce, I hope to God its more of a trip down memory lane (like Rocky Balboa) rather than just-another-action movie.<br/><br/>There's lots more to say but if I keep going I will just feel even more disappointed. So, as per always, here's my list of favourite Die Hards; 1. Die Hard (obviously) 2. Die Hard with A Vengeance 3. Die Hard 2: Die Harder 4. Die Hard 4.0"
"guyfromjerzee","6","3","7","7 July 2007"," The franchise is slowly dying
","Despite the PG-13 rating, I was still pretty excited to see the movie. Overall, it's a decent action flick, but it pales in comparison to the other three films. Yes, the PG-13 rating contributes to this sequel's downfall. While the other ""Die Hard"" flicks were edgy, violent, and full of swearing, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is like the airline version of those three movies. Am I saying that a film requires excessive violence to make it good? Of course not. But this is not ""Gandhi."" This is ""Die Hard."" I expect to see blood and guts. I expect to hear John McClane swear like a sailor. Don't get me wrong. The film does have some spectacular action sequences, including a nail-biting fight sequence inside an elevator shaft. No, it's not a rip-off of the sequence from the original. It's a totally different action sequence, and it works. The same goes for the climactic scene on the highway, as well as the scene where McClane destroys a helicopter with a car, resulting in the great wisecrack you've seen in all the trailers. ""You shot down that helicopter with a car!"" ""I ran out of bullets."" Regarding Bruce Willis's performance, he seems to be on autopilot, almost bored with the role of McClane. He flashes his trademark smirk whenever possible, and seems to play almost a caricature of himself. I felt he brought out more dimension to his character in the other three films. Plus, the dialogue isn't nearly as witty, resulting in not as many of those sharp McClane wisecracks we've grown to love. I kept waiting and waiting for him to deliver the brilliant ""Yippie-Ki-Yay"" line. He finally does towards the end of the flick, but the F-word is muted by a gunshot. Justin Long plays Willis's unfunny sidekick. We go from the great Samuel L. Jackson to a young twerp who as much as wit as Seth Green. I was reading the trivia section, and found out that Jessica Simpson and Justin Timberlake were each considered for roles in the movie. Thank God the filmmakers came to their senses! Hopefully, after watching ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" Hollywood will finally learn that some movies are not meant to be PG-13! Think of it this way: One of the incentives of shelling out the big bucks to see the movie on the big screen is to see things you can't see on network TV or even basic cable. If you want to condense a Matthew McCoughnahey romantic comedy or ""Lord of the Rings"" flick down to a PG-13--that's fine! But not action movies! Not horror movies! We're living in such a PC society that pretty soon porn flicks will be released as PG-13.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a slightly above average movie, but if you take my advice, dust off your ""Die Hard"" DVDs or VHS tapes and watch them all back to back. You may as well wait until this fourth installment hits the DVD shelves. It's not worth coughing up your 10 or 11 bucks. However, I will give the filmmakers props for using the great CCR tune ""Fortunate Son"" over the end credits."
"Bungle-9","7","3","7","7 July 2007"," Good fun but not really a Die Hard movie
","This was a good movie. Good action, funny lines, lack of reliance on CG effects, evil eyed bad guy as well as Kevin Smith's most awesome cameo ever. I think I got my money's worth. I loved the way Marco Beltrami kept the good old themes of the now passed Michael Kamen in the show.<br/><br/>However I think Bruce Willis let me down a bit. The John McClane I remember was crazy, funny and with plenty to say, but here Willis just cruises through with perhaps one or two purely McClane moments.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from some really sucky ADR dubbing work. On many occasions you can plainly see someone's lips moving one way but what you hear is completely unrelated to what you see. I swear I saw one guy wiping his mouth with his sleeve and I could still hear him go through his sentence clearly. <br/><br/>Where's the macho arguments that we saw in the first three movies? Where's the attitude that McClane had and was evident between him and Samuel L. Jackson in the third? All these things are missing. Also McClane's use of his trademark line in this movie is such a cop out it made me die a little inside. And now McClane can jump from a burning truck onto concrete and walk away minutes later. Silly can be good, but sometimes it went a bit too far here.<br/><br/>Seems I'm the only one to see this.<br/><br/>All in all it's good fun, quite tight and provides good escapism, but it's not without its problems."
"o_v_overbeek","9","3","7","7 July 2007"," just go and see it
","I was told this movie was a 2 out of 5 when i went to see it, but hey, seen the first 3 in the cinema, might as well see the 4th.<br/><br/>and then you sit there, and it takes you back to your childhood.<br/><br/>good old 90's action, no cgi bullshit, just a semi decent story line, with cheesy lines and some damn good action! Very good, very good indeed.<br/><br/>a few moments are pushing the borders of realism, as your about to comment, Bruce does it for you, which makes you feel more connected with the main character. some serious funny lines<br/><br/>lets face it, just go and see it"
"charchuk","7","3","7","7 July 2007"," Visually impressive
","I was thoroughly impressed, but that's only because the action scenes were unlike anything I'd seen before. Truly, my mouth was gaping a lot of the time. Luckily, the rest of the movie's not that far behind. The script has some weak spots, but it's mostly solid, and the acting is surprisingly decent. Bruce is Bruce, of course, but Justin Long is pretty funny and Timothy Olyphant is a great villain. The editing a.k.a. censorship bothered me a bit, especially the trademark line, but there's enough snappy dialogue to overcome it. The action was great, but it got to be a bit much by the end of it, especially the truck + jet bit. The climactic scene is aces, though. Not as good as 1 or 3, but miles ahead of 2."
"Mikael_A84","9","3","7","5 July 2007"," Die Hard 4.0
","Bruce does a really good work. Nothing wrong with the movie as the other says.I enjoyed it was good stunts and special effects. Good actors to.Ihave seen the other Die Hard movies to many times so was good that Die Hard 4 is out now. looking forward to Die Hard 5 if Bruce is still in shape. I know that other thinks its sucks but just good all do not think the same. Those 2 hours of the movie went really fast, happened a lot of action so was the end suddenly. After all was the most amazing scenes like the last one with the 18 wheeler verses the harrier. I also heard that Bruce did his own stunts to, thats impressive thinking about his age(52 years old)"
"SkidMcCormick","9","3","7","5 July 2007"," Die Hard 4.0 - Unrated Edition! SPOILER ALERT
","Well guys, I saw the unrated cut of Live Free or Die Hard and here's what I think.<br/><br/>Okay,the plus points: The Ultimate Action Edition as it's called here is certainly more brutal than the PG13 version. You see more blood spurts, John McClane cursing a bit more (especially in the elevator shaft where he calls Mai an ""effing bitch"" just as she blows up in the SUV!)There's also the tunnel scene where JM is driving towards the copter and makes the comment: ""Bonnet's on fire, that can't be good. This is a bad effing idea!"" He does say MF earlier on and a few more times during the film. There are extended scenes too, namely the evacuation of employees in the anthrax scare and Olyphant's dialogue where the Wall Street brokers are panicking. The action scenes, notably McClane taking out Gabriel's henchmen are slightly more extended, but worth it.<br/><br/>The bad: There's dialogue tweaking here & there, which I think, takes away the fun of the edited version. For instance, when Matt Farrell runs up to McClane and says: ""You just killed a helicopter with a car!"" McClane's response is simply: ""People get killed by hundreds of thousands of cars every year...only this is four more"", then they chuckle. Personally, I prefer the ""Ran out of bullets"" line a lot more. Because we were so used to the PG13 version, you do feel at times that perhaps the addition of swearing just crops up for the sake of it, although there is a nice touch where Deputy Director Bowman loses it with the 2 NSA agents.<br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to go thorough the special feayures of the DVD, but the gag reel is hilarious, where the cast are really having a laugh.<br/><br/>One more thing and I'm sure you're all dying to know: Does McClane say yippee-ky-yay **********er? He sure does and believe me, justice is finally served!"
"pixiesrule77","4","3","7","5 July 2007"," Bruce (Not So) Almighty
","Overblown, effects-laden follow up, as a slightly unlikeable John Mclaine (he hits women and threatens to beat up nerds) takes on geekerzoid terrorists in a bid to save corporate America  kind of ironic considering the only reason this film exists is to line the pockets of Hollywood Execs and a balding star in need of a hit. <br/><br/>It's not so much the plot that's the problem, after all the ""Die Hard"" movies aren't exactly built on elaborate scenario, but the sheer lack of imagination displayed here (what with movie number three having already been set in a City location) and the vacuous excuse for a script creates a hollow husk of an action flick that resorts to preposterous explosions in a failed bid to hold our attention. These ridiculously absurd set pieces escalate, with the face-off between a F1 Fighter Jet and a Hydraulic Truck being a bridge (or several exploding and collapsing bridges in fact) too far. Give it a rest Bruce."
"specht2007","9","3","7","5 July 2007"," Best action film of the 21st century.
","This film definitely exceeded my expectations. Which is saying a LOT considering I was really pumped for it. Even though most of the best scenes were used in the trailer, it still never failed to deliver. John McClane paired with a computer nerd/hacker is genius. He was always the type that never liked nor understood technology. He really knows how to beat the bad guys the only way it works, the ""analog"" way. While almost 2 decades later he still has the same vulgar attitude we all know and love.<br/><br/>Now, some people have said things like ""there were too many plot holes"" or ""the glass 'magically' reappeared"". It's a Die Hard movie. It's not about the continuity, or the plot. It's about the action and how much a man can take before he gives up. Which seems like never in John McClane's book.<br/><br/>The only thing that brings my rating down a notch is the sloppy editing to make this PG-13. You can point out every part of the film that has ""excessive profanity"" edited from it. Especially when frames start to jump back and forth. Though it doesn't take too much away from the overall experience, it's the only problem which doesn't make it on par with Die Hard. Though the part that we've all been waiting for ended up satisfying my needs. It's up to you whether you consider the tag-line to be cut short or not. It's really that close.<br/><br/>This film is without a doubt, the best action flick to grace the silver screen for 19 years. And perhaps with an unrated DVD release, it could be even more.<br/><br/>John McClane, welcome the f*** back. We missed you."
"shiftyeyeddog","9","3","7","5 July 2007"," Worry not - Die Hard is BACK!
","A movie needs four things to really feel like a true Die Hard movie: Bruce Willis as John McClane, Michael Kamen's musical score, Jan DeBont's cinematography, and a memorable villain.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard has only one of those four things.<br/><br/>...yet despite that fact, I was surprised to find that it is not only a good flick, but probably the best Die Hard movie since the first. Bruce is back in full force as McClane. Marco Beltrami did a phenomenal job of imitating Kamen's scores, possibly even using some of the same themes and musical cues from previous films. This goes a long way toward creating the atmosphere of a Die Hard film. The cinematography seemed a little more modern and slick than previous installments, but they were very smart in avoiding a lot of the modern trends that would have really taken away from the film: Slo-mo is used very sparingly, and the more frenetic action scenes aren't all just quick-cut, shaky-cam, over-edited messes.<br/><br/>This leaves us with the villain situation. Timothy Olyphant is a good actor who can really steal a scene in the right role. But here he is only given a couple of really meaty moments to shine, and comparing him to classic villainous actors like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons is just unfair. So while he does a fine job, his character is not particularly memorable. The rest of the villains are filled out with the usual generic henchman, with the exception of a kung-fu right-hand woman and an overly-acrobatic top thug straight out of a Bond film.<br/><br/>Justin Long has always been a fun, underrated actor in my opinion, but again I was worried he'd come across as a lame comic relief sidekick. Yes, he provides a lot of the laughs for the movie, but he is able to do it in a way that seems natural for his character, and it never seems forced. I still hope that his career continues to be successful, and he gets better and better roles. (and yes, his computer in the movie IS a Mac.) I was extremely worried going into this film and had kept my expectations down accordingly. The director and the unthinkable PG-13 rating made everyone go ""huh?"" But you really don't even notice. If you didn't already know going in, you'd probably think it was an R. It's always nice to have high hopes for a film and have that film match your expectations, but to go in and be SO pleasantly surprised is a great feeling. I was grinning though half the movie just because I was so thrilled it was living up to the Die Hard name. The action is exciting and even if they went over-the-top in a couple sequences (the F-35 scene is quite far-fetched and feels like it belongs more in a True Lies movie), it never takes you out of the movie. It's just a great action flick.<br/><br/>This probably ranks second in the franchise only to the original in my opinion, and has now taken the top spot as my favorite film of the year so far."

","What else do you expect when you have John McCLane shooting down a helicopter with a car coz he ran out of bullets. That particular sequence was the defining moment for me when i saw this film.<br/><br/>Excellent direction, Strong visuals, Great cast, Amazing Amazing Amazing Action scenes that provide you the thrills you seek from an action film. THis is the fourth in the series and for me this is as good as the first one if not better.<br/><br/>The set pieces were brilliantly done. The subtle humor was just right for a film like this and Bruce willis kicked butt throughout this spectacle. The film has plenty of die hard moments and needs to be seen on the big screen at least twice.<br/><br/>This film was an unexpected pleasant summer surprise of this year.<br/><br/>I want Die hard 5, if the same director returns.<br/><br/>10 on 10."
"EvLauster","8","3","7","4 July 2007"," Alive and loving (almost) every minute of it, the infamous McClane is back and better than before!
","Running on nearly 20 years Bruce Willis's infamous rough and tough N.Y.P.D officer McClane is back and up against a new nemesis. When a Cyber terrorist threatens to fire sale the Country it's up to none other than John and his newest sidekick (Long, he's no Jackson but manages to live up to the title) to save the day. Sadly the damn MPAA has wrongfully put ""Die Hard"" under PG-13 where as apposed to it's predecessors had the wonderful R rating. You would think this would be outrageous which at times it is, there's no cursing and McClane's quote is nearly spoken in a whisper. But the action remains as sturdy and entertaining as McTernian left off in 88. Although a few sequences are a little too popcorny for me when they should be intense and hardcore. Despite being the 4th film it's good, on par with the original even. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is fun, action packed, comical and the plot is a little creepy when you think about it. ***"

","For Canada Day my wife and I had a retro date weekend. Like many moons ago we went to the KFC and then to an action movie. I enjoyed Dieharder. The story is interesting, while the stunts were over the top, and I enjoyed the doses of humor. <br/><br/>Dieharder had computer hackers attack the US. Bruce picks up a hacker and the wrong place wrong time story unfolds nicely. I say right place right time for America. The bad guys are bad, and the good guy is solid.<br/><br/>The solid good guy Bruce Willis adapts and overcomes evil encounters with over the top stunts. The jet freeway deal, the traffic tunnel and ending stunts were great. I love the ending.<br/><br/>Willis's sarcasm in dealing with the stress is a great tension reliever. I liked when he talks to himself in the annoyed tone via the tunnel scene. The humor is done at the right time for the wrong place plot.<br/><br/>The directing and acting meld together well with the above mentioned Die-hard formula makes Dieharder entertaining. 7 out of 10. Worth seeing this summer. I wonder if this is the last of the 80's style action movies with Sly and Arnold out of the picture?"

","I went to the cinema yesterday to watch this movie and really had a great evening. Whatever one could expect from knowing the first three ""die hard""-movies, it is all there. Especially a Bruce as we know him best, tough and unbreakable, always with a sharp tongue. The whole audience cheered and laughed throughout the complete movie. What seems to be new to the story is a big portion of chauvinism. As a matter of fact, the two or three women that show up on screen are regularly beaten or at least addressed in rude ways. The audience was of course male-dominated and this scenes always got cheers. But frankly, the few ladies in there seemed to enjoy it most. So both, scenes and reactions, were nothing for any women's rights activists to be happy about."
"MadWatch","8","3","7","27 June 2007"," A Thrill a moment
","Live Free or Die Hard is the latest in the series of 'Die Hard' movies with Bruce Willis playing the iconic character: John McClane. In the first movie, bad guys hold a building hostage. In the second movie, bad guys hold an airport hostage. In the third movie, bad guys hold a city hostage. Now in the fourth movie, bad guys hold a country hostage!<br/><br/>If you liked the first three movies, then you should like this movie: It is more Bruce Willis, more John McClane, more action, more stunts, more explosions! The movie is non-stop for the entire two hours. I mean, there is hardly any 'downtime' where the story is not advancing or something is not happening. It is go, go, GO! The acting was great, as far as 'action' movies go. Even secondary characters were acted and portrayed well. A lot of the stunts were really over the top, but all in good fun.<br/><br/>I didn't like the McClane's comments on the hacker, ""You play with dolls"" ""Don't have a girlfriend."" or telling his daughters prospective boyfriends that he will 'kill them', because, to me, it is just more anti-male sexism, but not enough to ruin the movie.<br/><br/>So, if you are looking for an entertaining, thrilling, action, ""popcorn"" movie, then Live Free or Die Hard is the movie for you. In fact, I watched the movie opening day on Wednesday, if my friends go and see the movie this Saturday, I may join them and watch it again. :) I rated the movie 8 out of 10."

","Each time they do a ""Die Hard"" movie, they get better and better. This one was no exception. The action starts at the beginning and takes your breath away. Every frame is so filled with movement you feel like you're actually there and expect pieces of whatever just blew up to come falling down around you.<br/><br/>I think the most important aspect of this film (while already being ALL the things I absolutely LOVE about the Die Hard series) is the connection to the kids. John McClane's daughter and Matt Farrell, super hacker, are represented in an incredibly ""real"" way - not condescending but as teens who have the same issues as the guy next door's family...well until they get involved in John McClane's world. At the end, you almost feel like you've stepped into John McClane's ""non-action"" life when the two keep repeating ""did he/she say anything about me?"" These characters lend themselves to a future ""Die Hard"" endeavor - McClane's daughter being the type who would take names and truly kick some rear-end.<br/><br/>The action was amazing. The story kept my attention from start to finish. I left the theater with a sense of camaraderie with all the other ""Die Hard"" fans who came to the ""minute after midnight"" premier in the United States. We ooooo'd and ahhhhh'd so much we missed half of John McClane's best lines, ensuring we would all have to come see the movie again once the initial booming impact of it faded away and we could concentrate on the story.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake for this most incredible of evenings was the fact that my favorite filmmaker, Kevin Smith, had a role in this movie. I know I'm being greedy, but I want ""Die Hard 5"" already. I never expected ""Lie Free or Die Hard,"" but now that I've had it I want more. Hopefully someone will come up with a good script that will lend itself to being adapted to John McClane. If you loved the fast-paced, action-filled, take no prisoners style of the first three ""Die Hard"" movies this one is an ABSOLUTE MUST!!!"

"moviefan1725-1","10","4","11","27 June 2007"," John McClane Lives Hard With A Vengeance!!!!!!!!!
","When the original Die Hard was released in 1988, it did not receive much fanfare. It was the 80's, and every semi-celebrity, singer, pro athlete, was getting a crack at being a movie star. Mostly men, starring in low rent action flicks (Hi, Brian Bosworth). Die Hard starred an actor known only for his comedic chops on a popular, chick-friendly TV show. No one had any kind of expectations. Yet, history was made with that movie. It introduced the ""everyman"" hero. The normal guy who gets scared, bleeds when he gets shot, and is easily identifiable with the audience. Plus it was the most fast paced, edge of your seat, in your face action movie ever made. To this day, it is the movie that all modern action films are measured against. It inspired endless clones and, of course, the inevitable sequels. Sequels are, of course, often inferior to the original. But a sequel doesn't have to be better than its predecessor to be a good movie. Die Hard 2 and Die Hard With A Vengeance, while not as good as the original, are still great action movies. Now, almost 20 years after the first film, Bruce Willis returns to the role that made him a movie star, and delivers once again. Live Free Or Die Hard is not only the most amazing action movie in years, but is the best in the series since the original. Timothy Olyphant leads a group of cyber terrorists bent on destroying the American infrastructure. They completely shut down traffic, crash the stock market, and plunge the entire eastern seaboard into a blackout. Willis' put upon character John McClane is thrown into the middle of the mess when he is told to pick up a young computer hacker who may be involved in a series of murders involving other hackers. Justing Long does a great job as the hacker, Martin, who had no idea what he was getting into. It could have been a cliché role. The helpless nerd that screams and cowers in fear when the you-know-what hits the fan. Instead Martin proves himself a capable young man that, though scared out his mind, rises to the occasion, and stands by McClane even though he knows it could cost him his life. The scenes between Willis and McClane are the heart of the movie. They form a bond much like an estranged father and son reconnecting. But Martin is every bit the sarcastic smart-ass that McClane is, and their banter creates some truly hilarious moments. Also noteworthy is Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays McClanes daughter, Lucy. She too could have had a cliché role. She could have either been the typical damsel in distress, or the too tough for her own good chick, who generally comes across as laughable. Instead, she strikes a perfect balance between the two. She's is a vulnerable young woman, but she's also the daughter of an NYPD cop, and can take care of herself. At one point she flat out challenges Olyphant's character to a fight by saying ""Let's step outside. We'll see who hurts who."" And you believe that, given the chance, she might very well mop the floor with this guy. Of all the actors in the movie Timothy Olyphant has the biggest shoes to fill. Olyphant's villain, while not as flamboyant as the others, seems to be the most driven. He doesn't make time for fancy speeches like Alan Rickman's Hans, or give the good guy puzzles to figure out like Jeremy Irons' Simon. He's just totally straightforward. He knows what he wants done, and he wants it now. He's not an especially memorable villain, but he is an effective one. But when you talk Die Hard, you really are talking one thing in general...action. This movie delivers and then some. I must give director Len Wiseman a tremendous credit. There are several virtuoso action scenes in this movie. From a shootout in Martin's cramped apartment building, to a cat and mouse game between a helicopter and a police car that culminates in an absolutely thrilling tunnel sequence, the movie never lets go. Only at the end, when McClane squares off with a military F-35 while driving a semi truck, does the movie venture more into True Lies territory, than Die Hard. Still, it's an exciting sequence that's fun to watch. Finally, I must say THANK GOD for Bruce Willis. What has been missing in modern action movies, more than anything else, is a real TOUGH GUY. Thanks to cgi, we've grown accustomed to scrawny little actors like Keanu Reeves becoming action heroes, because visual effects can make them do anything. (To be fair to Keanu, I must acknowledge the fact that he did bulk up in another of the great action movies, Speed) We have been in need of guy that we believe can kick bad guy tail. Bruce still has the everyman thing going on, but he's also got the tough guy down cold. He is in perfect form in his signature roll. He's tough, cool, and works the ""why me?"" attitude better than anyone around. McClane isn't in this fight to prove anything. He's doing it because he has to. Because, as they say in the movie, he's ""that guy"". In a summer full over over budget, over-hyped sequels, this is the first one to deliver the goods. It gives you what you want, and adds more on top of it. In a sense, history is repeating itself. In 1988, no one expected anything from the original Die Hard. Now, 19 years later, in a summer full of overblown ""epics"" that rest on the laurels of their predecessors, Live Free Or Die Hard makes good on the promise made to us in 1988 with the first film...it blows us through the back wall of the theater. It may not be the biggest movie of the summer, but so far, it is BY FAR the best."
"Robert_duder","10","4","11","27 June 2007"," Could they really bring back the greatest action series? HELL YES!!
","I am not a fan of sequels following decades of the previous installments. Why wait so long? That being said Live Free or Die Hard was probably my most anticipated film of 2007 because Bruce Willis and his portrayal of John McClane single handedly hammered out some of the best action films of the eighties and early nineties. But could they really do justice?? Could they really resurrect the character and the series and not make it forced and still do justice to the Die Hard name?? Oh hell yes they did!! Live Free or Die Hard is ALMOST everything I could have ever expected from a fourth installment 12 years after Die Hard With A Vengeance. It had it's faults, it couldn't be perfect but my gosh it came just about as close to perfection I could have even imagined. It exceeded my incredibly high expectations and sits now as the greatest of the summer blockbusters to date and certainly high above any of the myriad of sequels this year. Director Len Wiseman is fairly new to the direction game having only created the Underworld series but did so to greatness (especially the first one.) That being said I think Wiseman went out of his way to make sure Willis had a big say in everything and to make sure this Die Hard was right along par with any of the previous ones. One of Live Free's faults is the same as every other blockbuster 2007 film...it's TOO packed. These films are proving that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. Live Free or Die Hard is over the top adrenaline and packed full of fantastic stunts and explosions and one liners and everything the first three Die Hard films were known for times three. So it can be a little over whelming. The story (which I was concerned might be a little 'techy') actually worked perfectly and was the perfect 'new' story for John McLean to deal with because he was very out of place amongst this brand of terrorism but his cowboy ways still worked.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis returns and blows the face off of anyone who thinks action exists without him and Die Hard. He brings John McClane back to the screen like he had never been away. I thought for sure he wouldn't be able to be the same character that was twenty years ago and he is...he's perfect!! Willis is still the action king!! Timothy Olyphant takes the helm as the lead terrorist with big shoes to fill following Alan Rickman, William Sadler, and Jeremy Irons as Die Hard bad guys and Olyphant is just awesome. He has that deviant evil look to him and that cold, unforgiving way about him. One of the most disappointing aspects of the film was the final battle between McClane and him because it was short and too quick and there wasn't a build up but still he is just awesome. Justin Long...what to say...I like the guy, I have liked him ever since Jeepers Creepers but I was scared to death what he would do as the sidekick to Willis in this film and it turns out he was awesome!! Long was the perfect opposite to McClane and made for a great sidekick and wasn't used so much that it became annoying. Instead he did an awesome job as the neurotic hacker turned good guy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also really surprised as the terrific Lucy Gennaro/McClane. She looked a lot like Bonnie Bedelia who played Holly McClane in previous installments. She also had the fire and wit that Willis brings to his role so she was perfect. Cliff Curtis was alright as the man on the other end of the walkie talkie and head agent in charge but he was a little dry for all the action and plot.<br/><br/>What all the critics are saying is true...the film does run a little longer than necessary, and one of the most disappointing things was the delivery of McClane's infamous catch phrase ""Yippie Kayay Mother F%$#er"" came too quickly and just seemed out of place and I waited the whole film to hear it delivered, it just wasn't right. The fight scenes were a little short especially the big battles but there was plenty of terrific and memorable one liners and action sequences that just make you wanna jump up and cheer including McClane shooting a fire extinguisher as a make shift bomb, an intense chopper vs police cruiser scene, Fighter Jet vs Semi truck and just McClane vs bad guys. Live Free or Die Hard is one of the best sequels I have ever seen and absolutely deserves the Die Hard name. Bruce Willis looked cut and copied right from the original Die Hards, he looks incredible, young and easily handles the action scenes and looks macho doing it. Blood soaked, cut and torn with that familiar faded brown muscle shirt. Witty quips oozing during every situation. This WAS DIE HARD!! Although unlikely I hope this completely reinvigorates the Die Hard Franchise and we see at least one more because this is the kind of kick ass hard core action flick the new millennium has yet to see. This was the throw back to the unstoppable action flicks of the eighties. I WILL see this again...and it's an instant action classic!! 10/10"

","I have always been a big time Die Hard fan, but once I saw the ""PG-13"" rating, I felt reluctant to show up at the theater. What's Die Hard without the F-bombs and gory scenes? Apparently, a sick, action packed die hard experience.<br/><br/>Thomas Gabriel played by Timothy Olyphant hired a group of hackers together to pull off the ultimate cyber heist. Of course, John McClane makes their lives a living hell with the massive explosions, the sweet Stealth fighter plane blowing up a highway, and the most memorable scene ever, the car flying in the air and blowing up a helicopter.<br/><br/>I haven't seen such great nonstop action in a very long time but in my standers, Live Free or Die Hard wasn't as great as the original. The whole programming heist was a little too high tech for the average viewer and the plot itself wasn't too original but the action scenes definitely make up for it.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a good comedy, this movie is good for that as well. Every other scene contains another witty humorous comment which I enjoyed."

"Leofwine_draca","7","2","4","25 June 2016"," Pretty decent for a modern action film
","Long-awaited (release twelve years after the last instalment in the series) and eagerly-anticipated, I went to the cinema to see DIE HARD 4.0 with huge expectations, being a massive fan of the series. The good news is that this deserves success as a sequel. Action-packed, with an involving plot and some solid action scenes, this is above average for the modern action film, revitalising the classic action formula with updated editing and style. Probably the best thing about this film is the quality of the acting. Bruce Willis gives maybe one of his last true efforts as the ageing hero, and he breathes new life and comedy into an old character. Surprisingly, his partner in the film, Justin Long, who plays a computer hacker, is just as good, a real charismatic everyman whose humour and warmth infuses the movie despite the irritating character quirks and hipness he's saddled with.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that this film doesn't quite match the quality of the first three films in the series, but it's still good and fun on a superficial level. The film is long but never flags for a second; the script, about terrorists utilising computers to take over America, is cleverly-written and novice director Len Wiseman adds plenty of style to the proceedings. The action is large-scale; from the opening apartment explosion to the car vs. helicopter showdown, this is involving stuff. The good news is that there's also plenty of old-school heroics with Bruce tackling villains in brutal bouts. Things do get a little over-the-top with the climax, but this is forgivable.<br/><br/>CGI is utilised throughout but there are still plenty of stuntmen involved and nothing about the action disappoints. There's a high level of humour in the movie, which doesn't always hit the mark, and there are a couple of great, skillful villains in Maggie Q and Cyril Raffaelli. The latter, riding high after the cult success of DISTRICT 13, provides the film with some pumping free running stunts, and Bruce's showdown with the Asian beauty is one of the film's best, and most surprisingly brutal, highlights."

","I'm sure like most people at the time I was highly dubious about Hollywood bringing back such a beloved franchise after such a long time. Films like Die Hard usually lose their quality and imagination past a trilogy in favour of money making trash with a big name attached. How utterly delighted when on viewing the film this was the farthest thing from the case.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 is an enthralling, rip-roaring adventure which is dripping with style and keeps you really gripped to the action.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis returns to the role of John McClane effortlessly and this time he's thrown in to the unfamiliar territory of cyber terrorism.<br/><br/>Visually it's great, a lot of time has been spent on beautifully moody lighting and some really great set pieces. The story, at least for a geek like me is a fascinating one and never lets up with plenty of motivation to keep the characters moving along. <br/><br/>I have however, a sneaking suspicion that this was written as an original stand alone film that the producers tacked the Die Hard name on to and wrote in the McClane character. True or not it certainly doesn't hurt either side of the equation. Although it's very much a computer driven storyline Willis get's more than enough screen time with plenty of fights and brilliant one liners straight from the gung-ho era.<br/><br/>A lot of people complained about this film being a PG-13 and to that I say get over yourself. If you need an R or an 18 rating stamped onto a film to judge it's quality then you are no more than a film hipster. I honestly didn't notice the lack of profanity in the film (Something which I think is effective but completely unnecessary if you have a good story) and everything works just fine and the action is tremendous.<br/><br/>I feel many people will overlook this film because of some snobbery but honestly, do check it out. <br/><br/>You won't find a slicker, well written and more action packed and entertaining film for probably a long time!"

","There's nothing that wrong with Die Hard 4.0, as an action film. It got a lot of the Die Hard saga action moments. And, well, that's what Die Hard is all about. However, there's something here which isn't quite right for me. I don't get why the bad guy is... the bad guy. He's basically freeing the people from a corrupted system. OK, he's getting paid for it (choosing himself how much he wants for the service), but so does the government (the REAL one) day by day. The exact same thing the ""bad"" guy does, it's done in a daily basis by the US government. The only difference is that the government is brainwashing the population instead of actually making it free, like this super evil character does. So, my dilemma is, why is Willis after the good guy? Selfishness, basically, once his daughter gets kidnapped. But before, for some weird and distorted sense of morality. And yes, the government (again, the real one) also kills people in a daily basis to keep things running smoothly, for ""the greater good"". I can't like this film simply because it's all wrong. If the director wanted people to think about deeper things, it wasn't necessary to cover it up with a huge pile of moral BS.

"benjamin_lappin","4","2","4","11 November 2007"," Die Hard And Die Now! Ways To Ruin A Franchise Volume 4
","The Hollywood machine continues to churn out the sequels to films en mass, providing us with unnecessary instalments which provide little, or indeed nothing, to solid franchises as a way of making a quick buck (or in this case a quick million bucks) by praying on an audiences affinity with preset characters. This little formula means that the film in question has to pay little mind to character development or any such ""frivality"" and can merely concentrate on providing film goers with what have been titled ""summer blockbusters"" which translated for you and I means action and special effects, and little else. <br/><br/>Up until this point the Die Hard 'trilogy' had been a fairly successful brand. The first and third films were very clever, or at least very clever for their genre, and while the second was somewhat of a disappointment it was at least watchable if not engaging. But Die Hard 4, or Live Free And Die Hard or I Want To Die Hard After Having Seen This Movie 4.0 ends up with our protagonist John McLaine as an older man, if not necessarily wiser, who now in the modern 21st Century has to tackle the problem of not megalomaniacs in skyscrapers but the all more dangerous cyber terrorism. Where as before, especially notable in the very first film there was a sense of 'wrong place at the wrong time' here the plot feels very contrived as it forcibly sends Willis on the route to danger and is this time accompanied by a virtually versed 'sidekick', as they find themselves conjoined at the hip in an effort to stop the 'bad- guy'. <br/><br/>You'd have hoped this would have been inoffensive viewing, but it proves to be the most offensive of the entire 'quadrilogy'. Everything in this new modern Die Hard universe is achieved through shiny lenses, generic story lines, groan inducing quips and lots of whooshing noises...oh, and the inevitable explosions, which just get out of hand. The entire film feels like it's merely jumping from one set piece to another with little thought for plot development (although there'd have to be a plot first) and the new 'cyber terrorist' angle feels like it's merely been thrown in to justify the severely O.T.T action segments. Taking down a helicopter is one thing, but it hardly feels impressive, possibly because of the overplaying it suffered in the trailers but also because as an audience there a great number of us who are severely tired of CGI sequences. What annoys more-so is that these CGI sequences are continually being used more and more to provide a cool factor or to wow us into submission rather than anything being said or done by characters. The moment just before the heli- carnage where McLane and his companion duck to try and avoid a car twirling towards them only to be saved as it lands on two cars that happen to drive up next to them is tripe of the highest order. It's not believable, it's not cool, it's a cheap means to escape a dangerous situation, and to be frank, despite all the money pumped into it, it doesn't look real. <br/><br/>Reality seems to be this films major drawback, it doesn't know where it wants to position itself, it's obviously mindless entertainment and as such feels it can justifiably go around doing whatever it wants in its attempts to be cool, but then it tries concurrently to be serious. They have John McLaine going around hurling cars at flying vehicles and then overplay the cyber terrorism to make it seem grounded in the modern world as of course cyber terrorism is ""the biggest threat"". It doesn't quite know if it wants to be a serious action film or a summer blockbuster. There is little in the script to keep you riveted and you don't so much turn off your brain for two and a half hours (oh yes, it's far too long to) but turn off your entire body and melt motionlessly into your seat. Die Hard 4 merely follows the well trodden route of X-Men 3, Spiderman 3 and various various others into the realms of ineptitude, but most tragically into the realms of franchise destruction, and Die Hard 4 manages to do so with a bigger bang and more carnage than in the quadrilogy combined."

By sheer force of will, luck and guts he gets through the ordeal, just. However watching Willi's character in this film you felt you were watching a superhero who regardless of the impossible odds placed against him would emerge with a cocky one liner and save the day without a problem.

","This film is a good example of a film that has the promise of a great action-packed movie worthy enough to be called a true follower of the Die Hard trilogy, but doesn't live up to it. Instead you get a thin storyline that is not really worth mentioning and a plot that is unbelievable. Especially the use of technique in this film is laughable, I diddn't know hacking was so graphical.<br/><br/>Whereas in the previous ones you had some kind of context. You had the original, the second was the joke on the story itself by being put in the same kind of situation again, the third was about revenge. Here it is really like they took the character and just dropped it in a random story about a villain that wants to rob some money with the help of computers, and they thought that would work. The one-liners that are dropped too keep you connected with the sarcastic underdog character of McClane, has lost all of it's drama and impact. You have to see this guy vulnerable and moaning on every hit he takes, but he keeps standing up like nothing happened. He has become a SUPERHERO and that is a big..NONO<br/><br/>This villain that is being portrayed here paled by it's predecessors (Jeremy Irons, etc). The entire movie he has one facial expression and he doesn't even get his hands dirty. The interaction with McClane was very lame. No real clashes or drama either caused by bureaucrats or otherwise was a dominant factor that would cause McClane to fly against the wall. Real tension was also hard to find. There never where lots of people in danger by an eminent thread unless bringing down the traffic-lights is considered to be so threatening that shivers will run down your spine. Just one incident where the parliament building is being blown up, seen on a TV, but turns out to be a fake scene created by the cyber terrorists - that created a little Independence Day moment.<br/><br/>The hacker-guy that McClane has to protect and has the most interaction with, misses any real chemistry. The dialog is very predictable and cheesy. I almost feel sorry for the guy that he has to say those lines and make it come off believable. Yes, he is the typical stereotype sidekick but without McClane swearing his mouth off it just sounds very lame. But he made it to the end without getting really annoying. That's a plus for him. Also at one point you see Kevin Smith(a director) playing the character of a geek friend of the hacker-guy. All I want to say about that is that he is on screen way to much because I already forgot what his role in the story exactly was. So that's all I want to say about the dialog. <br/><br/>Then you have this very stylized action-scenes and I guess you can see the directors mark here. At one time you see this bad guy coming after McClane in a manor that you think it's a vampire with extraordinary powers from his previous set of vampire movies ( which by the way are very good in their own right), but it's totally unbelievable here. That should be in a fantasy movie like True Lies or something where all boundaries of reality are set in a completely other dimension. It was ridiculous. The pursuit of the truck by a fighter-yet and losing it from the truck, the fight with the girl that get's banged threw several walls and still comes back...wait, isn't she from the cast of Heroes - the one that can heal herself -...I can go on. Also the action-scenes are just there for the sake of having action-scenes. That's just annoying. If you remember FirstBlood 3, you know what I am talking about. And that is the ultimate example what I can think of.<br/><br/>And then the ending....very boring. McClane suddenly shows up and he exchanges some words with the supposedly villain that keeps his daughter hostage, but might as well be a disgruntled office clerk. I never felt his daughter was in any real danger. He kills him with a single shot and it's over before you know it had ever really began. Then it rushes of to the scenes where they lick there wounds and say some more very cheesy lines. <br/><br/>This is just a movie that wants to make money solely based on it's name. It's a movie without a soul. Seeing Bruce Willis playing his role is seeing an average guy being transformed into a superhero. It has little to do with the original McClane character. I actually felt a growing urge to stop watching it after about 20 minutes because of all the ridiculous stuff that was adding up. <br/><br/>The fact that Y spend so many words on this comment is because some of the faults they made could easily been avoided and would have been more respectful to the Die Hard brand and too it's audience. The fact they made it a PG-13 rated movie also has a lot too do with it. I don't know who they have in mind in terms of audience, but they must be really shallow and growing in numbers also if they can get away with this. But apparently they can, seeing some of the other comments here.<br/><br/>This film is a complete joke if you want to call it a Die Hard movie. If it was possible to get your money back based on reasonable expectations I would do that."

","OK I was thoroughly looking forward to this one, all three predecessors were all entertaining and enjoyable movies, ranging from extremely good to above average.<br/><br/>So the new one, any good?! Well I think its another ""above average"", but certainly NOT another ""extremely good"". Acting was pretty good, Bruce Willis is always enjoyable even in below par movies. Timothy Olyphant made a pretty good bad guy, his character arc was OK, and he had some good lines, a subdued subtle menace type approach which I liked. Justin Long is the only other member of the cast worth mentioning, he had again like Timothy some excellent lines and dialogue and thanks to that came across well in the movie. Good performances from all three main characters.<br/><br/>Direction was OK, unfortunately it came across like an episode of ""24"" that had been injected with some steroids. Didn't have much flair or style to it. Script was OK considering the genre but nothing out-standing. As I said earlier all were certainly above average, but nothing exceptional. The special effects however were, I thought some of the scenarios and action sequences they pulled off were fantastic.<br/><br/>I did however tire of the OTT circumstances the John McClane character was surviving, it seems since his last outing 12 or so years ago the only thing that might send John six feet under will be Kryptonite....? Overall a worthwhile watch if nothing special, the original is always the best, but this one never really even challenged the first one at any point bar special effects as expected. Hopefully we don't see a Die Hard 5.0 as I hope John McClane gets a much needed pen pusher position within the NYPD......<br/><br/>****** out of **********"
"mjscarface","7","2","4","5 July 2007"," It's Die Hard, cleaned up and polished but still entertaining!
","First of all, the feeling that most people will get is that this isn't a true Die Hard film. You can divide the four films into two pairs; one, the trapped, claustrophobic actioner and two, the mobile a-b-c-z thriller. I didn't have a problem with McClane running around from town to town because you can't carry on reusing the hostage premise.<br/><br/>On paper, the storyline looked weak - McClane vs. computer nerds didn't sound that great and their dastardly plot just didn't appeal to me. However, I thought the film did well to show the kind of dependency we have on computers and how we'd be lost without them. The film came across as Die Hard 3- meets -Enemy of the State, with bad guys pulling up every detail and piece of surveillance possible to track their targets. This made the villain slightly more interesting, when it later shows what kind of danger he holds. My other concern was the sidekick aspect. While Samuel L Jackson was good in the last film, the idea of McClane having to protect a geeky kid was worrying. But once again, my fear was quickly removed when Justin Long (despite that awful radio scene) gave a good performance, especially in his comic timing.<br/><br/>While the plot surprised me, the pace kind of dragged to a halt at times. The tech talk will either go over your head or be drilled into it, having been repeated over and over again. Also, the film has a sanitised feel about it, with muted colours and steel/glass interiors, taking away the rawness that McClane is better suited to. The climax was my main disappointment though - after witnessing some amazing action set-pieces I expected good things from the final face-off. Instead, we get the lamest villain-dispatch in the series (even worse than the tacked-on DH3 ending).<br/><br/>On the whole, I was still impressed by the movie - and the action. The Die Hard films have been memorable for including insane stunts ever since the fire-hose jump. In Die Hard 2 the ejector seat was the money shot whereas in 3 it was the car chase. This time, we are treated to some of the best in the series. Even a shootout in an apartment manages to be more entertaining than it should be. Later on, there are some jaw-dropping stunts as McClane uses a number of vehicles to take out... well, other vehicles. The visuals are fantastic and the fighter plane vs. truck sequence looks very cool. While the blood has been toned down, there is lots punishment dealt out. In fact, everyone is super-durable in the film - getting constantly hit by cars, falling great heights and getting up afterwards.<br/><br/>But also, there is plenty of humour. This is where it probably beats DH2, which had faults that crippled the film (awful dialogue, dopey characters). There are plenty of great one-liners which got a good reception at the cinema I went to. The performances are also very good, with Long likable, Willis on form (obviously) and the villain Olyphant playing the detached type rather well.<br/><br/>Overall, the film IS a Die Hard because it keeps the three elements in tact, all the way through: eye-popping action, juicy one-liners and of course, Bruce Willis."
"raamr","6","2","4","4 July 2007"," Neither Rock Solid nor Utter Garbage
","I really wanted to 7. I just took it down a point caz through out the movie I felt that there was no logic. <br/><br/>I read a few reviews before buying my ticket. I had my expectation set to 5 I guess. I really loved all of the Die hard movies. And I'll say I enjoyed this one too. There is a lot of action the best are shown in the trailer. But there is lot more that you would enjoy. <br/><br/>Yes.. some dialogues are meaning less. Yes.. lacks major logic. Yes.. has some useless characters Yes.. not the best of the sequels<br/><br/>But it is very much entertaining. If you are expecting the story to be realistic then there is nothing that you'll like. If you want Bruce action and mild comedy and his punch lines.. you have lot to enjoy.<br/><br/>The very basic reason people are complaining is because screen play isn't perfect to justify the plot/story. They should not have picked such a hi-tech crime for this movie. If there was less hi-tech and more of common crime or terrorism... it would've justified the 8+ rating."
"cadfile","6","2","4","4 July 2007"," PG-13 made this film just average
","I spent my 4th of July joining Detective John McClane for yet another bad day. Unfortunately this 4th bad day limped across the finish line.<br/><br/>It wasn't a total disaster but the movie suits marketing this as a PG-13 film and then pretty much presenting it as PG really hurt the reason I liked the Die Hard series. They even garbled his catch phrase. UGH! I wonder if 20th Century Fox knows you can use at least one F-word in PG-13 and you can also show women topless. That would have made this film a bit better.<br/><br/>I want McClane to be crude, mouthy, and foul mouth. In this film he is crude and that is about it.<br/><br/>I liked Justin Long as the geek hacker. He had some great lines - even better than McClane.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead's ""Lucy"" was a treat. She seemed to be just like Dad which I enjoyed very much.<br/><br/>I thought the plot and ideas behind the story were interesting and something that doesn't get discussed enough in the real world and overall the film had some good, if not real plausible, action scenes.<br/><br/>I hope that an unrated version comes out on DVD because the PG-13 version just didn't work for me."
"pekjr4","6","2","4","4 July 2007"," Fun, but not exciting
","Thank God Bruce Willis can act and is credible(still) as an action star. I was disappointed with the movie for a few reasons: 1. Not as ""smart"" as the first and third installments-more of a formula flick. Think ""True Lies"" more than ""Die Hard."" 2. Bad Guy-- ZERO charisma or screen presence when compared to, say, Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons. Couldn't really hate him. 3. Suspension of disbelief-- In the past, we saw McClane get beat up, drag himself around and still win-- and we could squint and believe. There is one scene in here where the watcher can tell that someone thought they had to add just one more thing to make it exciting-- and instead made it totally unbelievable. No spoilers, but you will know. (and the scene is a clichÃ©' anyway). Fun, no points."
"poolandrews","7","2","4","4 July 2007"," Good but not brilliant.
","Live Free or Die Hard, known as Die Hard 4.0 elsewhere around the world, starts as New York detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is ordered to pick up a computer hacker geek named Matt Ferrell (Justin Long) as a favour to the FBI who are investigating a strange computer hack at Washington. However it appears the FBI aren't the only ones interested in Ferrell as when McClane gets to his apartment several heavily armed men try to kill him, McClane saves Ferrell but finds himself in the middle of a plot to throw the entire United States into chaos by hacking into & disabling everything major system like paralysing the public transportation system, all forms of communication, gas, electricity, the internet etc. A disgruntled ex FBI nut called Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) & his men intend to use the chaos as a cover for one of the biggest robbery's ever, that is unless McClane can stop them...<br/><br/>Directed by Len Wiseman this is the fourth entry in the popular Die Hard series of action films & is good but not brilliant & if I'm honest I was a little disappointed with it overall. The script by Mark Bomback was apparently based on an 'artlicle' called A Farewell to Arms by John Carlin & I've heard of films being based on novels but a newspaper/magazine article? Although when it comes down to it the plot is basically the same as the original Die Hard (1988) as a group of thieves use the cover of terrorism to steal lots of money. Anyway, I liked Live Free or Die Hard for what it was as it moves along like a rocket which is good since it lasts for over two hours & it prevents boredom setting in, it's nice to see John McClane back in action & speaking of action there's some truly fantastic set-pieces & stunts. However I also didn't like Live Free or Die Hard for what it wasn't, it didn't feel like a Die Hard film with the obvious toning down of the profanity & violence, I mean the villains in this don't seem to put up any resistance to McClane & he simply ends up shooting them, there's no big fights with bone crunching sound effects at all & the violence is very tame to none existent (although it'll come as no surprise if a longer more graphic version is released on DVD). Then there's the main villain Thomas Gabriel who has to be one of the most bland & dull bad guys ever, he's just some young guy casually dressed who only gets to shoot one person in the leg & that's it, he's just not evil enough & who on Earth decided to kill off Mai (Maggie Q) so early into the film? She was easily the best villain & she was a babe as well, at least she could actually fight. I don't know, I liked it but at the same time I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Director Wiseman does OK here & he keeps the action moving along, unfortunately by dragging the Die Hard series kicking & screaming into the new millennium (the last film in the series Die Hard: With A Vengeance (1995) was made over a decade ago) the focus of the storyline is all about modern hi-tech computers, cell phones, the internet, hacking, defence systems & it has the feel of distancing McClane from the action, since a lot of what happens takes place in cyberspace there's nothing physical there if you know what I mean & the film tries to make the point that we rely on such technology too much. McClane & Gabriel never meet until the very end either which also has the unwanted effect of distancing them, sure they talk over the phone but it's not the same as an intense face-to-face meeting is it? The action set-pieces are at times spectacular with cars launched into flying helicopters, chases, shoot-outs, huge explosions & my favourite sequence when McClane is driving a large semi truck under & over some elevated freeways being fired upon by a fighter jet. Most of it is very over-the-top & not based in reality as McClane can seemingly jump from a jet onto a concrete freeway & survive with no major injuries.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 there's plenty of action on screen for the money but that really does sound like a lot doesn't it? It extremely well made with high production values & great stunt/effects work. The acting is alright but this isn't classic foul mouthed wise cracking Willis, why oh why did Fox cut this down?<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard as a stand alone action film is a pretty darn fine one but as the fourth entry in possibly the greatest action series ever it comes across as a bit of a disappointment, as I said I thought it was good & I liked it but I didn't love it as there's a lot of room for improvement."
"kevincookspitfire","6","2","4","4 July 2007"," Die hard has outgrown what first made it great...
","I had only an inkling of this idea until I saw the fourth title in the series, but think about it: Die Hard's scope has increased with each installment. The original took place in a single building. The second was a whole airport complex and surrounding area. The third was the whole city. Now, with the fourth one, we've got an adventure to save the world.<br/><br/>I know that I am not alone when I say this: part of what made Die Hard (The original) great was that it was such a personal-level action flick. The bad guys want money, and John just wants to save a small group of hostages (The fact that his wife is in there is irrelevant) More than this, though: he was fighting for his own survival. He was being hunted, and became a hunter. The confined space of Nakatomi plaza made it all the better: by the end of the movie we feel like we know the building as well as the characters. We see the same rooms throughout the film, and we get a feel for the layout and a general sense of the building. This was wonderful: it felt like a real building, and that small, personal scope made me and many others feel like we were right there with Mclain, counting our bullets and using appropriated supplies to tie off our own wounds. And the whole time, every time a terrorist goes down, we're counting them down. The enemy had our hero out-gunned, but they weren't invincible. Also, Mclain got the snot beat out of him. By the end of the movie, he's noticeably just barely hanging in there. The whole thing was awesome action, but it was just perfect in terms of scope and realism.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 changed this. We were at an airport, but Mclain wasn't in the same situation. Yes, his wife was once again in danger, but it was indirect. The terrorists didn't know about her, and couldn't use her to make the conflict with Mclain personal. He was an interloper, in the situation because he chose to be: he had a hero complex. This is why I didn't like this movie. Mclain wasn't being hunted, the terrorists were mostly without personality, and mostly just fodder for the ""bigger"" action scenes. The airport setting also meant that we were moving around too much to get as immersed as we were in the first one. It still tried, though, and I did get kind of into it. Decent twist, as well.<br/><br/>The third installment was somewhat saved by the appearance of Samuel L. Jackson, but again: the setting and terrorist threat were just too large and impersonal, even though the half of the plan is a personal vendetta against Mclain. It seems contradictory, but by leading us on a tour of the whole damned city and dealing with countless numbers of people, none of whom really get developed fully, the movie turned a personal conflict into a ""save-the-world"" romp. The series changed here, and not for the better. Stand-alone? It was a decent action movie, but it carries the name die-hard, and thus must be measured against it's predecessors (In my opinion).<br/><br/>Now we have Die Hard 4, and I really want to like it. It has a bit of a message with its constant references to the media and government. Whether or not you agree with the opinions of the characters aside, these things really just distracted me. Great, you want to have some political commentary, fine. I could have gotten past it, but this movie is almost entirely about politics and the actions of the American government in relation to the film's main protagonist. The events in the movie happen on a nation-wide scale, and affect millions of people. There seem to be countless goons on the bad guys' side, a fact that Mclain actually jokes about at one point. Even the handful of ""special"" terrorists, the ones that Mclain must fight one-on-one and that pose a serious threat to him are left with few revealing lines, and in one's case, we hear more jokes about how ""hot"" she was (These are made postmortem) than we do character-building lines of dialog. Mclain is dragged into the situation, rather than rushing in on his own, but it's only a plot device this time. It isn't until late in the film that he gets any sort of personal stake in the events going on around him, and everything until that point just makes me hate his character. He's tripping on a hero-god complex. The movie sets us up with a couple comments about the ineptitude of the US government's ability to deal with crises, so since the government can't handle it, obviously Mclain has to? What happened to the man running for his life, trying to get help from the outside from the first Die Hard? He's certainly nowhere to be found in this film. There are still points where he acts like he doesn't want any part in this whole ""save the world"" business, but he follows these up by hunting down terrorists without any real provocation or motivation other than a vague order he was given at the start of the film that became irrelevant about half-an-hour in. I couldn't help but think as I was watching that right then is when the Mclain I knew from the first film would have dropped the kid he's with off at FBI headquarters, then gone home to sit out the crisis. This is my problem with this movie: Mclain is now officially your stereotypical action hero, and nothing more.<br/><br/>I have to give credit where credit is due: Willis did an excellent job capturing the same ""John Mclain"" essence: the tone, stance, and sarcasm are all spot-on. It's not his fault that they've insisted on disposing of the movie's character."

The aging New York police officer John McClane is sent to pick up notorious computer hacker Matt Farrell(Justin Long) who may be the only person that can remedy the situation. Thanks to Farrell it is quickly realized that this invisible terrorist is attempting to pull off a Fire Sale. A Fire Sale is a 3 pronged attack to shut down a countries resources.<br/><br/>Live Free or, Die Hard is a classic good versus evil, save the world from certain destruction tale that is done in a manner better than most action films of the last decade. The emotional portions, though few, play well enough and give a brief glimpse into the personal lives of McClane and Farrell. This is for the most part an impossible nonstop action ride with many avenues exploited when is comes to ways to defeat a foe with a automobile. The fourth installment of Die Hard thinks, but not too much, and satisfies the urge for an explosion that viewers came to the movie to see. McClane and Farrell find their way out of impossible situations, and the audience is gifted with the most impressive action sequences to be shown on the big screen since the climactic battle sequences in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>The only stone that may be able to be thrown at this film is that there is not enough swearing, which causes McClane's classic line to be shorted from it's final impactive F-word. Live Free or, Die Hard is one of the most complete movie going experiences of the year in terms of Hollywood blockbusters. John McClane owns this summer in a way that Spider-man, Shrek, or Jack Sparrow only wish they could. Live Free, or Die Hard earns an explosive. 8/10"

","Die Hard has been the one of the best action films of all time. Very well written, hilarious moments with Bruce, & over the top scenes to pump your adrenaline. Still most were disappointed with the previous movie, Die Hard With A Vengeance. I enjoyed it but some critics were skeptical about Bruce and Samuel L. Jackson, plus the story not being enriched with smart terrorism. That has all changed with Live Free Or Die Hard. Bruce Willis returns as Detective Jon McClaine, still divorced, still complaining about his life, and having complications communicating with his teenage daughter. The movie starts of well, starting with the main story about a group of highly skilled hackers diving into the F.B.I.'s Cyber Security Center. When things begin not to work at the Center, the head of the department wants every possible hacker to be brought into D.C. for questioning. In comes the hero, asked by the feds to bring in Matthew Farell, played by the funny Justin Long, A sarcastic but smart hacker who has been in trouble with the F.B.I. before. As soon as Willis arrives to Long's apartment, the action begins. I can't really explain anymore on the story. What I will tell you is, its worth every dime to sit in the theater. It catches you the moment the action begins. Very well written like the first two, hilarious moments with not just Bruce but with Justin as well, and one hell of a ride. The reason it has an 8 though is the fact that it won't appeal to everyone."

","After a 12-year hiatus, Bruce Willis came back for a fourth entry of the Die Hard. The fourth film sees an analogue hero in a digital age: the villain even states this to John McClane. Die Hard 4.0 (or Live Free or Die Hard as it was known in the States) was an action film of its time: instead of old-fashioned brawls and bloody shootouts, the fourth film saw henchmen use martial arts and parkour, the cinematography had that noughties sheen and the plot focused on national security and terrorism. Even with this new direction Die Hard 4.0 was still a well-made action-thriller and the plotline of hackers being able to bring America to its knee was ahead of its time considering what Russia and North Korea were able to do in the 2010s.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 did have some excellent action sequences like the parkour in Camden and fight between McClane and Mai Linh (Maggie Q).

","So glad to see the return of the funny dialogues in this version. The original ""Die Hard"" was packed with snappy, witty dialogues, which makes it so enjoyable to watch again and again. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is one big copy fest of the original movie from the eighties, with literally every single characteristic copied out of the original movie, BUT a good copy, aint a bad thing. This latest Die Hard version is a rather enjoyable one.<br/><br/>The only things that are really bugging me a bit about this version are the boring CGI effects and the mediocre supporting actors. But besides that I am rather pleased by the return of John Mc Clane.<br/><br/>Anyone even interested in the story, which isnt bad by the way?

","A divisive sequel on it's release, largely due to it's watered-down PG-13 rating, and better mannered (not to mention better dressed) McClane. The more outlandish, CG heavy action scenes turned off old-school fans, who liked their McClane bloodied and genuinely vulnerable. Here, McClane's feats of daring-do seem more appropriate for a Marvel Studios movie at times, and the portrayal borders on a pastiche. If anything, the McClane here is all-too-close to the invulnerable action hero cliché the first movie was rallying against. And, the villain in this movie was cookie-cutter when compared to the greatness of the Gruber brothers, and of course, Justin Long was no Samuel. L. Jackson. But, putting these gripes aside for a moment, Live Free is an entertaining ride that follows the story structures of the sequels that came before it, and is hinged on a suitably modern and apocalyptic concept. It's a sequel that I believe has slowly won over the fans. That said, 'A Good Day To Die Hard' destroyed most of the remaining goodwill for the series in one fell swoop."

","Twelve long years without a John McClane movie is like an eternity to an action fan. This one spent so many years in production hell that it was easy to believe that it would never happen. But after years of eagerly awaiting another, and possibly final, adventure from the now classic character of John McClane we got what we wanted. A brand new, original, and action packed sequel that delivers in more ways than one. This is a great additon to the franchise and, except for a few flaws, it lives up to the hype that so many years away from the screen had produced.<br/><br/> The story is one of the reasons that this one is so good. A brilliant cyber-punk exposes the faults of our information age in what is called a 'firesale'. A systematic deconstruction of our advanced and computer dependent society into the dark ages. The simple ideas expressed in the movie bring a fear that many Americans wish they never see in their lifetimes. With everything going awry, John McClane is asked to escort a computer geek to Washington who could be responsible for the calamity or possibly know how to stop it. Its a great idea for a Die Hard movie, but did the director and cast make it what it had the potential to be?<br/><br/> Quite simply, yes. Like the third installment in the series, we get to see a new John McClane. An older, wiser, more mature, and cynical John. He gives us the feeling that he has been here before and he has seen so much in his life that this is just another story he can tell his grandchildren. He also makes you feel a little sad for him. After all he has done and been through, his wife and children still want nothing to do with him. Joining him to hose out the 'firesale' is our computer geek Matthew Farrell played by the always good humored Justin Long. This one brings back the buddy film vibe from Die Hard With A Vengence, but our buddy is a lot more funny and incapable of handling the situation he finds himself in. The only disappointment from the actors in this one comes from an actor I usually enjoy. Timothy Olphant plays our cyber-punk villian trying to destroy everything our current society relies on, and his performance seems a little weak and hollow. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays John's estranged daughter Lucy and her acceptance of her father give the ending of the movie a nice heart touching power.<br/><br/> Overall, the movie turned out MUCH better than I had expected. With the exception of the ending, which seems a little too ridiculous, the movie is good in almost all respects. The action kicks in early and never relents. The ferocity of the violence and the humor of both our leads give credit to another installment in the Die Hard saga. If anything you must watch this just for the ten minutes that Kevin Smith is on screen. It is priceless."

","A serious tough guy, wishing by no means to be a hero, but accidentally becoming him during different feasts. Who? Of course, John McClane – ordinary police detective returning to our cinema screens. In order to teach the baddies. Any crime, even original and ravishingly planned, must be revealed. Its organizers must be arrested.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 4.0"" is the movie of the 21st century. It consists of the minimum ironical dialogues and maximum dose of action. The old Hollywood formula dictates to finish introducing the characters at the 20th minute of the story and start the adventures. The first ""Die Hard"" film that successfully appeared in the year 1988, diligently followed this formula. In the new film, the shooting takes place immediately and without introduction. The direction was entrusted to Len Wiseman, author of ""Underworld"". He has kindly surprised me, by presenting not only the effective attraction of advantages, but, by being able to maintain that layout, which causes us to sympathize John McClane for so many years. Actor Bruce Willis ideally fits the main hero. He is more than 50. He runs hard. His wife – Hollywood star Demi Moore – left him and married the considerably younger guy. At the set, he is relentlessly caused to still be the last action film hero. He is such: arrived from the 80s, fond of listening to classical rock by ""Creedance"" and realizing nothing about the modern information technologies. It is hard to fight against the enemies, as the whole state control is automated and entrusted to a single computer centre. Who controls these computers, that takes all possible assets. The bald character of Bruce Willis has only to follow the old methods: to respond to the hit in double manner. If the close person is threatened – go and eliminate the villain.<br/><br/>The computer knowledge is offset by young hacker Matthew Farrell (28-year-old actor Justin Long, who still plays the teenagers). The action of the film begins with John McClane receiving the simplest task – to deliver the computer pirate to the FBI agents. Short escort turns into the long adventure. Totally as in ""16 Blocks"" thriller by Richard Donner seen recently. The amount of money spent is different. And exactly ""Lethal Weapon"" by Richard Donner competed with ""Die Hard"" in the action cinema arena. Today, we can see the result.<br/><br/>John McClane still dies hard, matching the original name of the film ""Die Hard"", which has been unnecessarily ignored by the film distributors, by distorting the ironical sense. <br/><br/>John McClane's balls are still hard and withstand the powerful Kung- fu hits. Bruce Willis himself accepted that the most difficult episodes he found were those when he was kicked by erotic Hong Kong beauty Maggie Q. The director succeeded in organizing the persuadable company of actors. The main terrorist of the virtual space was played by Timothy Olyphant (""Sex and the City""), who impressively contributed to the camp of enemies. The French-speaking actor Cyrill Raffaeli, who has mastered the Parkour that is popular in Europe, tries to manage detective McClane in person. However, McClane may only be injured. Not killed. John McClane is the symbol, who does not die equally like James Bond. These two characters have become much similar. Daniel Craig's agent 007 became harsher. Bruce Willis's McClane started jumping down from the planes. We are forced to believe that he is not less lively than his colleague from the secret British service.<br/><br/>The first ""Die Hart"" films developed the plot in the closed space (skyscraper and airport). They used the claustrophobic tension and actor's contrasts. The third part of ""Die Hard"" has mainly collapsed because the action has been transferred to the streets of the city. This made the integrity of the story collapse.<br/><br/>In this, latest, film, the place of action is not limited. Therefore, the underexperienced director had to sweat well for us not to have a tedious time. Our focus had to see the memorable heroes all the time. The lack of the particular place of action needed to be offset by the stunning adventures.<br/><br/>I think the task is fulfilled. I agree with the viewers, who were sitting at the hall and applauding after the ordinary effective action episode. Only the cinema magic and artfully distributed humorous cues may cause to believe the trueness of the events being shown. There is plenty enough of them in the film. They even more cause to remember ""Casino Royale""- the most stylish adventure film of the year 2006. The new ""Die Hard"" justly pretends to the best summer entertainment, buys us over with its wittiness and ageless hero. Let Bruce Willis not become angry, but he was born exactly for this role. We must not become surprised, if the producers will cause him to pin a police officer's badge and to introduce himself to us once again: ""Hello. I'm McClane. John McClane""."

","It seems as if the movies are starting to get further and further apart, but then again even though number three basically started off really good and progressively went downhill after that first explosion, this latest installment, 12 years after the previous one, doesn't even seem to get off the ground. In a sense it seems as if a producer was reading a script for a completely unrelated film and realised that they hadn't done a Die Hard for a while, and gave Bruce Willis a call. Discovering that Bruce was more than happy to bring McLane back onto the big screen, completely rewrote the characters to centre the film around the hero of Nakatomi plaza.<br/><br/>Mind you, a lot has changed since we last met with John McLane – everything has gone digital, and everything is connected by computers. Also, this is post September 11, so suddenly terrorists are more on our mind. Anyway, we have this young computer hotshot (and the fact that he seemed so young really annoyed me in a way) who had worked for the US Government. However when we pointed out all of the security flaws and how vulnerable they were to a cyberattack, they took it on advisement. So, he decided to go public, but the government wasn't all that impressed and basically made sure that he had a really bad rest of his life. Well, being somewhat upset at being dumped like that, he somehow got together heaps of money, and a team of crack soldiers, and then pretty much took down the system.<br/><br/>The way I see it, Die Hard one has terrorists taking a building hostage, number two an airport, number three a city, and number four the United States of America. Mind you, as well as getting progressively lame, they also become progressively unrealistic. For instance I am always astounded at the resources that these criminals have at their disposal, though we must accept that at least in number two we were dealing with a South American Drug-lord (and number one and three did suggest that the thieves were actually pretty well resourced). However, come number four, I am still scratching my head and wondering where on Earth this computer geek managed to get his hands on enough money to pull this off, and also make the connections that he did (as well as acquiring FBI uniforms and a helicopter).<br/><br/>The film begins with a group of computer hackers progressively being assassinated, and in a way this sort of suggests that maybe, just maybe, including it into the Die Hard franchise is not really a good idea. However, it could just have been the case that they felt that if it was a stand alone movie then maybe it wouldn't have worked as well as it did. However, adding it to the Die Hard franchise really doesn't do all that much as well. Okay, while the film does address issues with how interconnected our society has become, and how reliant we are now on computers, in the end I sort of look at it and think, well, The Net dealt with this issue so much better, and while I didn't think all that much of that film, it was certainly superior to this one."
"Scarecrow-88","7","0","0","21 June 2009"," Live Free or Die Hard
","NYPD senior detective John McClane(Bruce Willis) must deal with cyber terrorists who are shutting down major cities along the Eastern seashore and, with a hacker, Matthew Farrell(Justin Long) wanted by the FBI(..he's responsible for a certain code which has aided the terrorists), must stop them. Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olyphant) is the scorned computer genius(..he attempted to warn the government of how vulnerable America is of an cyber attack, through unpopular means only using a lap top, leading to his dismissal) leading the team of terrorists whose operation is to withdraw all the financial data from government networks, with hired gunmen, equipped with the latest hi-tech weaponry at their disposal, out to kill McClane or anyone else in their way. McClane and Farrell will have to assist each other in order to combat a seriously dangerous enemy who have incredible abilities using technology as their weapon. McClane is the brawn(..using his instincts and determination to avoid constant attacks on his life)and Farrell is the brains(..a brilliant tech-savvy kid whose knowledge comes in handy when faced with undoing Gabriel's handiwork). Eventually, as these actioners often do, McClane's own daughter, Lucy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)will be kidnapped by Gabriel as a bargaining chip, putting extra pressure on him as he attempts to stop these criminals.<br/><br/>I didn't think it could be done, but the filmmakers were able to make Live Free or Die Hard even more outrageous and preposterous than Die Hard With a Vengeance..not an easy feat. You have bridges collapsing while McClane, driving a semi, dodges the firepower from a f35 jet(..oh, and how he is able to use the jet to escape certain peril must be seen to be believed!). There's the amazing sequence in the tunnel where McClane and Farrell narrowly avoid cars spiraling towards them. McClane is able to use a vehicle to cut a chopper right into. Even a smaller scale action sequence where McClane must escape constant gunfire in Farrell's apartment as gunmen surround them(..McClane was simply supposed to escort Farrell to headquarters where gunmen were sent to kill Farrell because of his involvement with Gabriel)will have most saying to themselves, ""Yeah, right."" I have to say the major sequence where Gabriel has all the traffic lights turned green with miles of vehicles halted(..as well as a fake destruction of the White House as citizens are shocked to silence)in DC is as impressive as I've seen in those Hollywood disaster pictures. McClane, the poor guy, is always one false step away from certain death, yet he's hard to kill. His resourcefulness is beyond amazing..one of our great action heroes. As any exciting action film should be, Live Free or Die Hard never lets you catch a breath as McClane and Farrell move from one difficult situation to another, having to interrupt Gabriel's mission to swindle the country by using our technology as a tool. Maggie Q has another nifty supporting role as a ""kung fu bitch"" who causes McClane a lot of hurt, and their battle escalates into bravura fashion with a SUV driven down an elevator shaft! The use of technology wonderfully contrasts with McClane, an old school cop taken aback by the ""cyber-speak"" often used by Farrell. I thought Winstead, though not used until the final thirty or so minutes, is quite effective as McClane's daughter, eliciting traits similar to her old man. Good chemistry(..Willis always seems at home when partnered with a sidekick)between Willis and Long, their differences actually enhance the relationship while trying to save the world."
"darc_wynd","5","0","0","3 July 2008"," A 7.6 rating...
","...is Definitely not warranted by this film.<br/><br/>By no stretch of imagination does this film deserve that rating. Apart from the visuals, which are stunning, this is little else. The plot is uninspired and characters are barely developed beyond the basic background information required. The story is a poorly applied computer nerd's dream; a slighted computer security expert hacks the systems to run and takes control of the entire country. This is actually one of the things I hated most in this film - the over-reliance of computers. For more or less every problem Gabriel, the antagonist, faces, he simply tells his hacker cronies to 'hack' it, and the problems simply goes away. The implausibility of it is so glaring that I'm surprised not many people have commented on it.<br/><br/>Of course, the visuals and action sequences are stunning, the fighter plane sequence being particularly memorable. They are of course the core of this film, and the main reason why most people go to watch Die Hard films. However, this alone does not make up for the poor story, crappy plot and using computers as deus ex machinas in every possible instance.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Die Hard 4.0 is a funked up, new Millennium edition of the now landmark action trilogy and it is definitely catered for more modern audiences. Apart form the whole ordinary guy cop in the wrong place at the wrong time (again!) theme, this does not really feel like a Die Hard movie. Although Willis is great trying to reprise his most famous role, all of the original quips, scenarios, swearing and general tone of the original three flicks has disappeared and in place is a dumb, special effects laden, immature action flick. The only thing remaining is the wisecrack one-liners and subtle nods to the previous Die Hards with a few more continuity improvements thrown in. Take these away and you have a completely different action flick on your hands and if you ignore the ridiculous plot, cliché villains and unbelievable situations this is still entertaining, mindless action fare with McClane, technical mumbo-jumbo going way over his head, just taking out the bad guys.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","0","14 February 2008"," Doesn't really feel like a Die Hard movie but it's a great action flick on its own.
","Just what I had feared after watching its trailer for the first time; this movie doesn't really feel like its part of the Die Hard movie franchise. Main reason for this is its approach. All of the previous three Die Hard movies had a certain realistic action approach. The movies at all time felt like these events as portrayed could really occur one day. It didn't tried to overdo things and put in any overblown action sequences, even though some moments were still rather far fetched to say the least. And then there is ""Live Free or Die Hard"". In this movie John McClane battles a F-35 on an highway with a truck, fights an Asian chick in an elevator shaft will hanging in a van and crashes a car into a flying helicopter. It sort of tells the approach of ""Live Free or Die Hard"". It features mostly overblown action sequences and the movie, as well as definitely its story, are far from believable all. But there is nothing wrong with this all, since this movie is still a great action flick on its own right. Still I'm somewhat disappointed that the movie sort of lacks the same feeling and approach of the previous Die Hard movies.<br/><br/>What makes ""Live Free or Die Hard"" a great movie in its genre are its stunts. The movie knows to come up with a couple of highly original action moments and an even better execution of it all. Len Wiseman shows that he's a man who knows how to handle the action genre. But yes, even so I still wished John McTiernan had directed this.<br/><br/>The movie is good looking with a nice visual (though it was a bit too dark in parts perhaps) style, which looked like they had a serious budget to spend on this movie and they did a good job with the money.<br/><br/>The story and its main-plot is overall pretty good but only problem with it is that it's filled with some stupidities. This unfortunately ALWAYS happens when Hollywood decides to make a movie involving high tech computers and other technical aspects. Some things are just not possible as portrayed in this movie while others are just utterly ridicules (Really, press the delete button to make hacker leave your computer?). Hollywood always spends lots of money on hiring experts who tell them what is really technically possible and what's not but amazingly they all time ignore these advises, all in the best interest of the story and flow, at least in their opinion. I of course can somewhat understand this, since sometimes you just have to simplify a lot and make things happen without having to spend too much time explaining why. But this doesn't take away that the story of this movie is an at times pretty silly one to follow. But oh well, logic just isn't one of the requirements for an action-flick.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is well over 50 but with this movie once more shows that he can still handle an action movie, also as John McClane. The character hasn't changed much, he still manages to get his shirt very dirty only he has lost more of his hair by this time. I have always liked Timothy Olyphant as an actor and I really loved him in ""The Girl Next Door"" but I had my doubts if he was already ready enough for a big villainous role in a movie such as this one. He was good enough in his role but unfortunately he wasn't exactly among the most or best movie villains of this or any other decade. Did they ran out of Gruber brothers already?<br/><br/>All in all, I can really recommend this movie as a superior mindless action flick. And after all, a movie that features a nice Boba Fett reference (of course also involving the Kevin Smith character) just can't be all that bad, even though the fans of the previous three Die Hard movies might still feel a bit cheated by this movie its style, approach and handling.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This review is based on the unrated version--I've never seen the PG-13 one. <br/><br/>The FBI Cyber Security Division and other government computers are breached by a madman (Timothy Olyphant) who plans to rule the world (or something like that). John McClane (Bruce Willis) ends up stuck with a young computer hacker (Justin Long) to try and battle him.<br/><br/>OK--I LOVED the first two ""Die Hard"" films. They were loud, stupid and loads of fun (if a bit sadistic). The third one (""Die Hard With a Vengeance"") wasn't too good. This one was (obviously) shot for an R rating (the first three were all R). The studio cut it down to a PG-13. I HATE when they do that and refuse to see it. So that's why I waited till this came on DVD to view it.<br/><br/>This is a fast-moving, easy to understand action movie. It's full of swearing and it's VERY violent--sometimes a bit too much. Willis' battle with Mai (Maggie Q) is pretty extreme. Still, you have to expect that from a ""Die Hard"" film. The action sequences are truly incredible (even on a TV screen) and there's plenty of casual violence and blood and gore. The script is dumbed down so anyone can understand it--but who watches this movie for the plot? I had a fun time but towards the end the action goes WAY over the top and gets totally unbelievable. STILL I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The acting is just about what you expect. Willis is good in his role (as always) and Long is good also despite having to be the ""comic"" relief at times. Olyphant is OK (I guess) as the villain...but I could never take him seriously. Basically everybody just hits their marks and say their lines with total conviction--that's all this calls for. Kevin Smith is very funny in his bit as Warlock. <br/><br/>So--loud and stupid but fun. See the unrated version."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","0","16 November 2007"," Nothing special
","John McClane returns after a decade or so, looking a little bruised and battered before the action even begins it has to be said, and the subtlety of his everyman persona is extinguished within the first five minutes as we see him in the badly written role of over-protective father to a feisty McClane-clone daughter. That early scene served warning of how far the franchise has fallen. It's still good in terms of summer blockbuster fare, but it is unrecognisable as the spawn of the 80s original. Willis as McClane back then redefined the genre  here he's just doing an Arnie impersonation as he slides around on the wing of an out-of-control fighter plane and issues warnings to the bad guy that he's coming to get him.<br/><br/>After that early worrying insight into McClane's domestic woes, things start to get back on track as we see McClane and his suspect/sidekick embroiled in a high-tech game of cat-and-mouse around the streets of Washington in what is a cute and effective reversal of the 'confined space' scenario of the originals. Willis and Justin Long play well off each other and, while Timothy Olyphant's set-up is a little too Blofeld-like for this franchise, the systematic shutdown of society's high-tech infrastructure is as entertaining as it is outrageous.<br/><br/>Sadly, writer Mark Bomback runs out of ideas in the final third of the film and reverts to typical action-hero clichés. The film careers alarmingly out of control, abandoning reality for the sake of 'look-what-we-can-do' effects that have that aforementioned fighter plane dipping under bridges in pursuit of McClane's truck. ('You're shooting at the wrong guy!' Willis screams at the pilot, and I couldn't help wondering how often those words had been screamed by other victims of similar mistakes in the last eighteen years). The climax is particularly weak  I can't recall ever seeing a bad guy meet his end so lamely or irrationally  after all, surely if McClane can survive the impact of the bullet it would do even less damage to Gabriel.<br/><br/>For mindless high-impact entertainment you probably won't need to look any further than this one. But, sadly that's all that's left of the original superlative idea  and after a break of ten years or so you'd have thought they could have done better.."

This quite inexperienced guy (only one movie and its sequels) had certainly tried hard to bring us the joy and entertainment provided by the 3 first DH movies. But he forgot a big big issue there : ACTING. Yes, DH4 is really bad acting and bad casting. While the villain, in the first 3 nearly stole the show, in DH4 he is quite of memorable.

Therefore the main problem with this movie is somewhere else! The scenario! *****May contain Spoilers********* I mean even though it is quite unrealistic it starts pretty well with an organization because a very long and well planned plan has taken control the US computers network... And not just superficially, the whole TV network, financial network, traffic network, but not somehow the power network, they have to do it manually (after all why not?). But then after a nearly ""End of the World"" start, you discover that their only reason for that is to get a ransom for some data! The bad guys offer to clear all the debt of Bruce Willis and set his children well off for their life, control the whole financial system, but do all this for money!!!! After this stupid explanation, it goes on an on without any logic from places to places, you discover that they where able to cut the power of by destroying the station but instead they lost their time in the beginning by do it manually. That the main bad guy can hack the best security system with a laptop but are not able to unlock a computer code manually... That the computer geek that they tried to kill so desperately at the beginning is useless (apart from the fact that he somehow knows the code of a very restricted area (I still can not believe this one...) And it goes on and on and on... In summary: the movie is enjoyable but you must switch your brain off otherwise it will badly affect the fun!"
"manhattanmoviemaniac","Null","0","0","12 July 2007"," better than #3, as good as #2.....but there is only one #1
","Well, Bruce Willis is back as the wise-cracking energizer bunny of action movies, John Mclane. Eighties heroes are back in vogue in Tinseltown and the Die Hard franchise is the second to cash in (following Rocky Balbo duhhh). They really stuck to the formula and managed to make a decent action pic that is high-energy, fast-paced and far-fetched (but to quote Meatloaf, ""Two out of three ain't bad""). The whole effort has a slight tongue-in-cheek tone, so it is easier to laugh with the ridiculous parts rather than at them. Willis is good and, as in #3, he has a buddy in this one, played by Justin ""Hi, I'm a Mac"" Long to help with the humor and techno jargon.<br/><br/>The Die Hards have always had high tech master villains and this continues with #4 which could have been called Die Hard 4: When Good Geeks Go Bad! Mclane's personal life is its usual mess when he is asked to pick up a computer hacker, Matt Farrell (Long) for questioning. He gets there just in time to save Farrell's life from some really serious dudes and the chase is on. Now Mclane has to keep Farrell alive while foiling the bad guys from taking control of all the communications and utilities on the east coast.<br/><br/>""When Hackers Attack"" is a popular Hollywood theme and we have seen similar stuff in movies like Enemy Of The State and, more recently, ""Déjà Vu"". Still this movie is not bad and the explosion junkies will main vein it for a satisfying action fix. I am going to tie it with #2 for second place in the Die Hard series. Just don't expect everything to make sense and know that it has a believability rating 'that's frigging impossible'. Art it ain't, but lively it is. Yippee Ki Yay!

"deastman_uk","Null","0","0","4 July 2007"," Die Hard with hokum
","When faced with the usual made by numbers mish mash action film, you hang on to the odd funny lines or maybe something good going in under the covers. There is little to cheer here, just lost time.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis rolls around effectively. The geek is too Neo like but workable. The action scenes are ridiculous, the plot problems appear faster than the script team can rewrite, and there are a few genuine Attack of the Clones style clangers.<br/><br/>But the action is nothing if not well directed, and entertainment does not have to be great. The computer scenes are improving - no longer do we see an entire screen dedicated to saying ""You have mail"" or other movie only software. Americas growing awareness that 9/11 was probably not quite what it seemed is not derided here, nor is it milked."
"CharlesVonFunhammer","3","14","61","27 June 2007"," Made me want to see Die Hard 3 again
","This is not a good movie. I liked the previous die hard movies, 1 and 3. The second one, well, Bruce is right when he says it suffers from lack of claustrophobia - but then again so do 3 and 4. The trailer looked bad, I said no to it, then it got good reviews and I was persuaded to go to a midnight showing for fun. I was looking for some good action.<br/><br/>Like Die Hard 3, this movie is a sprawling action adventure movie spread out over many cities. Unlike the third movie, this takes place over two days. Like the third movie, this is a buddy cop movie, where the villain is a super-genius white dude with an exotic assassin woman as his lover/bodyguard. She of course gets killed brutally, and we the audience of men, cheer when a woman gets killed because, let's be honest, we're living out our male fantasies. We can't hit women anymore, not like the good old days, so we give them a kung fu kick or a sickle and that makes them enemy combatants, so it makes them fair game.<br/><br/>The third movie works better because it wasn't an accident that it was John Mcclane. Therefore, we have a reason for the movie, for him being in it. This movie could have easily been an action movie where the names have been changed to protect the innocent. Bruce Willis himself even said that were other scripts that could have been Die Hard movies that were made into other movies. <br/><br/>The third movie involves the audiences through it's riddles, silly, but be honest, you were trying to figure it out. Also, stealing money still made sense at that point. The third movie features bad guys that mis-direct the government in order to steal money - guess what happens here? What Americans are really afraid of, now, isn't terrorists stealing money. It's terrorists killing without demands. Killing just to kill. The movie has action, but no violence. No blood, not enough cursing. We never feel emotionally involved. We never feel scared. No good guys die, the stakes are never really raised. We've seen this movie before and before it was bloodier, and harder-core. This movie was made by geeks, not by cowboys.<br/><br/>The technology in the movie is too sleek, too futuristic, too unreal. There's an french assassin who has superhero abilities on par with the guy from the opening of casino royale (which ruins that sequence).<br/><br/>The film's dialectic is between the real and unreal - the digital and the analog. A fair point - a film that boasts no CGI (or minimal) is therefore about itself. Die Hard 4 is about why Die Hard 4 is awesome. Digital movies are bad, live-action movies are awesome. Die hard is a live-action movie. Therefore, Die hard is awesome.<br/><br/>There are some good set pieces here, and some cheesy speeches about what being a hero is all about. There are some good moments, action without violence, by which i mean blood. Justin Long is fine, Willis is beautiful as always. There's no plot, but I know you don't care about that. But seriously, the plot doesn't make sense, okay, okay, shut up, watch the movie, enjoy it, don't think about it. Right? Cheers"
"DICK STEEL","10","4","12","29 June 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Die Hard 4.0
","John McClane,USA's supercop, returns to the big screens. being at the wrong place at the wrong time yet again, kicking some major terrorists ass since the original Die Hard way back in 1988. It has been almost 12 years since Bruce Willis last starred in the definitive cop role, which some would arguably state that Die Hard had kick started the action movie blockbusters in the late 80s to 90s.<br/><br/>I was just a 12 year old kid when I watched the original Die Hard, with a bruised and battered McClane surviving on gut instinct and an incredible amount of sly wit to turn the tables on the bad guys despite being heavily outnumbered. And with a building not big enough as his playground, Die Hard 2 saw him move up a level to weave in and out of an airport. Samuel L Jackson tag teams Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance, where they run around NY City playing Simon Says, and now, McClane has to take on a group of multi-nationality mercenary geeks who threaten the entire USofA. The playground keeps getting bigger, but that's only befitting a supercop, ain't it. both in threat level and geography.<br/><br/>Mark Bomback's story in Live Free or Die Hard continues to paint a picture of woe for McClane. You'd expect a supercop like himself to be highly decorated, rewarded, commended etc, but as it turns out, he's painfully divorced, has almost nothing except for the shirt on his back, his daughter Lucy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, (Death Proof, Final Destination 3) refuses to acknowledge him, and nothing could be worst than an escorting mission right out of 16 Blocks, right?<br/><br/>And that's where he gets into the wrong place at the wrong time, getting back to the formula. In fetching an easily impressed geek hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), he finds himself in the thick of the plot to bring down the national infrastructure in a coordinated takeover using a Fire Sale methodology which Farrell unwittingly contributed, and it's up to the duo to save USA, especially when the old school cop obviously had his inadequacy and disdain for technology show, sometimes leading to comedy.<br/><br/>While most of the action sequences have been shown in the trailers, and while they might look like your usual car chases, explosions and gun battles, somehow there is still a ""die hard"" feel to them all. Perhaps this can be attributed to formula again, and some familiarity of ""have we seen this before"" (aka the lift shaft sequence), only to have them being updated for today, and of course, being a little faster, a little more furious, than our aging hero could handle. There's a scene which might make some scream ""True Lies!"", and Maggie Q unfortunately is a tad overrated, relegated into a typical role that if it's Asian, then there must be some kung-fu involved.<br/><br/>And speaking of the bad guys, the Die Hard franchise have always featured foreign subversive elements, like Euro terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) in Die Hard, and his brother Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) wanting to avenge Hans in Die Hard With a Vengeance, while some General in a fictional country made McClane Die Harder. The trend continues here, especially with the employment of Frenchmen who can do Parkour. The motivation, save for Die Harder, has always been the same - Money.<br/><br/>The bad guys of course never learn from history, and repeat the same mistakes. In this one, while they seem a little smug with themselves, actually work with less loyalty than those in the other movies. Timothy Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel comes from within, out to prove a point as a disgruntled ex-government employee, Obviously Thomas has no respect for history, and although he has access to records, is quite oblivious to know who he's messing with, and repeating the same mistake as Hans Gruber did in taking a family member hostage. Despite some similarities in plot development in the hopes of stalling McClane, the formula too extended to things like McClane making contact with the bad guys without actually seeing each other in the flesh.<br/><br/>That bit though contributed to a kink in the production, with a somewhat major error in having the walkie talkie seem like a working telephone, and bad editing made mouth movement out of sync. There are other loopholes, or some would deem ridiculous, preposterous or impossible sequences (just like how I say Die Hard With a Vengeance had this scene where Willis and Jackson slam onto containers, and yet survive), but hey, so long as McClane gets to kick some arse in a satisfactory manner, without mercy and almost always with a quip, I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 is indeed another hurrah for John McClane. Willis has played other cop roles like in Hostage, Sin City, Mercury Rising, 16 Blocks and the likes, but none of them are as memorable nor as definitive as McClane. Of late there is a return of old school heroes like Rambo and Rocky teaching their contemporary peers just how to stamp their mark in action flicks, and there absolutely is no doubt on McClane's successful return. <br/><br/>Yippee-Ki-Yay indeed!"
"StephenColbert44","10","4","12","27 June 2007"," In McClane We Trust! Die Hard is back...
","...And this time it is better than ever. It has been awhile since the last installment of John McClane's life (DH: With A Vengeance), and I was so excited to hear that a fourth entry in the series was going to be made. Well folks, it has arrived and it will make those die hard Die Hard fans say Yippee Ki Yay all over again! I'm sure if you've visited the IMDb forums for this Die Hard, you probably know what the film is already about. So, I'm just going to skip that part.<br/><br/>I'm writing this to say that this installment stands up to the legacy that is the Die Hard movies. Sure, we aren't looking at the same John McClane (Portrayed by the always awesome Bruce Willis) that we saw back at Nakatomi and Dulles, but hey, characters, just like people, always change, and they aren't going to be like they were. But McClane is still enjoyable, knocking out the baddies and dropping some awesome one-liners. Plus, you can't forget his snickers after something explodes.<br/><br/>Justin Long works as McClane's sidekick! I thought he did a very excellent job, and he made the film work. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is wonderful as Lucy McClane. You can clearly tell that she is a McClane child. Timothy Olyphant is a great villain, although I still rank Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) ahead. I put him on the same level as Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) from DH: With A Vengeance.<br/><br/>The computer attack on America works well. It makes the plot interesting. And this installment delivers plenty of action! From car crashed, explosions, and various hand to hand combat, this is what makes this one of the best Die Hard movies ever. I put it right behind the original and above the other sequels. Also, the supporting cast is awesome and I loved everybody's acting.<br/><br/>And for you PG-13 rating haters, believe me when I say this, it doesn't bother or ruin the film in any way. Please people, don't bash a film before you see it, give it a chance. It will be worth it.<br/><br/>So, once again, Die Hard is back and better than ever. Bruce is still that same lovable and enjoyable John McClane that we all know. He may not be exactly like he was in Nakatomi Plaza, but he still as awesome. So, Die Hard fans, go see it and relive some great memories, and action movie fans or any moviegoers, go see it, you'll become a Die Hard fan as well. Thank you for reading and remember, Yippee Ki Yay! Live Free or Die Hard is now playing in theaters everywhere and it rated PG-13."
"TrueStoryGuys","10","4","12","27 June 2007"," Best Action Movie in a long long time
","The most flattering thing to me about this movie is the fact that CGI was barely there, leaving a bare-bones in your face old school action movie. I was as worried as the next die-hard fan when I heard they were making a 4th, and then even more worried when it was cut to pg-13, still I came out of the theater tonight extremely pleased, even with extremely high hopes and I was not let down one bit, sure some of the ""blood and gunshot"" scenes were trimmed, but that just gives us a unrated DVD to look forward to. The pace was excellent, the effects awesome, the comic relief great, the movie just worked on almost every level. I mean how often can you say that the 4th chapter of a movie franchise is fantastic?, Not much, but with live free or die hard you certainly can."
"snavarrol","10","4","12","27 June 2007"," McClane gets an unwilling sidekick. Mclane meets bad guys. Maclane kicks bad guys a@@ in amazing style.
","Best movie of the series. The action scenes are amazing, thank god very few digital effects and the few are well kept (although some are pretty obvious). The direction was pretty good although the camera moves a little too much for my taste. It actually made me dizzy and at some points it moves so fast that you cannot even see what is going on. Humor is impeccable and well done, not overdone. It is hilarious to see the ""Mac"" guy from the apple commercials play a hacker. The daughter is useless, her acting horrible and plays no real role in the movie but hey, she is cute and a ""redhead"". If you are a geek like me you'll notice that the writers learned a couple of tech words from the hacking world and just kept repeating them in many cases wrongly (we get it is a fire sale after the first hundred times they mention it. We understand you know what an IP address is. Who in the world has their IP associated with their name!) Also, to keep it PG13 there are a lot of bad words cut short and weak substitutions for the ones they should have used (Dang!) My opinion, the action makes up for all the shortcomings."
"the-movie-guy","10","4","12","27 June 2007"," Bruce is back and the movie did not disappoint me
","(My Synopsis) New York City Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is assigned to bring in Matt Farrell (Justin Long), a computer whiz-kid hacker for questioning by the FBI. This is a simple assignment just before the 4th of July holiday, but there is nothing simple when McClane has a part in it. McClane soon discovers that terrorists want Farrell dead, and they also have begun attacking the United States by shutting down the computers that control our infrastructure causing turmoil nationwide. McClane and Farrell go after the bad guys, and matters turn explosive.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Bruce is back! This is one of those movies that did not disappoint me. I knew what I was going to see, before it hit the screen, and it hit its mark. It only took a few minutes before you have some explosive action. This is what I came for, and the action continued. This is one summer blockbuster movie that delivers what it advertise. The CGI effects are exceptional and the stunts are fantastic. It looked like Bruce should have been killed several times, but I know it is only a movie. As usually, Bruce has some funny lines throughout and as always, he has a hard time killing the bad guys. By the end of the movie, you will feel a little worn-out, because you will really get involved in the show. This is one of those good movies that will entertain you, and you will be talking about some of the action scenes as you leave the theater. (Twentieth Century Fox, Run time 2:10, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"
"gailseredni","10","3","8","29 June 2007"," loved it
","This one was as good or better than the FIRST Die Hard. It has so many laughs, loads of action, and of course dream boat Bruce. I loved it and I think a large audience will like it. It appeals to both women and men. The audience was laughing and clapping and totally enjoying it. Best movie I've seen in a while. <br/><br/>The classic bad guys were hated, and the lovable side kick to Willis was lovable. Most people in the audience were 40-60, but anyone age 14 and up would enjoy this film. Hey, I might see it again.<br/><br/>I'd rate it with a 10 because how often does a film appeal to both men and women. I had loads of funny stunts, and multiple explosions that guys love and of course a car chase scene or two. It had the pretty woman (although one of the bad guys) and several fight scenes. The women in the audience will look Bruce's new look, at least new look for John McClain. He's bald, but beautiful. Although I still prefer him with hair, it did seem to work for him. He looked like he's beefed up with some weights or something too. Hey, he's gorgeous either way."
"willie-horton","10","3","8","28 June 2007"," This film is worth seeing on the big screen
","The Die Hard films have been set on progressively larger stages: the first took place inside one high-rise, the second in an airport, and the third in greater New York City. This film covers the entire mid-Atlantic region, and it's big enough to do the job. Bruce Willis truly fills out the role of John McClane, and his co-stars are perfectly cast: the computer geeks, for example, looked and sounded just like guys I've known. The action, while a bit far-fetched in spots, is perfectly staged and filmed. This movie deserves to be seen at the theater: the look, sound and feel is so big that nothing else will do it justice."
"jpuhakka78","8","3","8","28 June 2007"," Way the action should be!
","Watched this movie moments ago..<br/><br/>and I have to say that there has never been case where fourth movie in any series could be the very best of it. Usually quality does degrade from title to title, but this time this is not the case.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. (And Oh boy I really were skeptical about this ""4.0"" thing) Everybody was doing their parts as actors and actresses (and very well if I may mention). Sound and special effects where top notch.

"mactorrents","10","3","8","28 June 2007"," Solid, Entertaining and cunning
","The fourth movie in the series of Die Hard is a very solid. Filled with action and stunts only John McClane would pull. The movie is surrounded in the world and a pool of 'cyber-terrorism' there are many movies regarding this subject however very few are as entertaining. Of course the ending is easy to predict, like in any action movie, but that is not the point. The roles were very well divided among the actors, the stunts were well made and often quite logical, of course depending on how much bullets Mr. McClane is packing. I recommend this for anyone who liked the previous three movies, for anyone who likes a good action movie with some witty lines and some very odd romance."

Die hard so yeah i don't like the hard core brutal gritty movies. This movie is the real deal, an actual good 4th part. Honestly this movie was amazing. I liked every character for what they were, and yes McClain changed a little since the other flicks but in a good way. Hes older now and more mature (still a wise a$$ though) and is more reserved, till hes ticked. Oh and pg-13, if it wasn't plastered every where on these boards you wouldn't know, seriously all they did was cut out all f words(feel stupid saying ""f-words"" like a 2 year old) and dint focus on the blood, and it STILL WORKS! Bravo to everyone involved in the film. And yeah people have differing opinions so go see it and form your own Yippie-Ki-Yay to all and to all a happy trail."

","Finally, a big budget sequel that completely delivers. Many may say that this wasn't the best Die Hard of the series, but let's be honest nothing will top the first Die Hard. However, this one nicely delivers. It brings back, good old fashion action, that isn't saturated with CGI and one of the most iconic action heroes of the 80s and 90s. Bruce Willis is back as John McClane and he carries this film, with his usual McClane ""just doing my job the only way that I know how and maybe people get killed along the way"" attitude. And as for the villain, Timothy doesn't live up to Hans Gruber, but he works for the story. This is a must for any Die Hard fan as it combines elements of the previous 3 films and makes us remember why we like to wait for the summer for the big budget movies."

","Wow, this is one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen. I'm glad I went to the movie theater to see this instead of renting on DVD, due to the outstanding special effects. I recommend that you go to the theater to see this if you are a fan of action movies. IMDb is being lame right now, so I have to put in more of my opinion. Well my only complaint about this movie is that there aren't enough bad ass action sequences, such as the one in the trailer where John McClane (Bruce Willis) drives a car into a toll both causing it to become mis-shapen, therefore turning it into a ramp to launch it at a helicopter. OK well over all this is a pretty awesome movie as I have previously stated so go see it."

In 4, it's the entire country.<br/><br/>As 1 and 3 were linked by Simon and Hans, 2 and 4 are linked as the terrorists are once more former United States citizens turned against the country for personal gain. Thomas Gabriel does provide a bit of wit, but no where near as memorable as MacClane's previous antagonists. MacClane makes it seem his years of experience pay off well as he handles all of Gabriel's men with relative ease, which was unseen in the original three Die Hards. MacClane came back to a licking, but proves once again, he or his stories aren't going to die easily."

","I'll make this short. I saw the movie last night and it was really typical run of the mill fast cut action movie garbage. I can't believe that they used so many CG ""action"" shots either. 20th Century Fox must figure that everyone is either blind or stupid. The whole computer hacker plot thing seemed really dated too. This easily looks like a movie from the early to mid nineties.<br/><br/>At least other action movies have redeeming qualities like XXX (C'mon!

","I loved this movie. Half because of Bruce Willis, who is my kind of hero and my kind of man, and half because of the fact that, besides the action scenes, there is more to this hypothetical situation presented in the movie. It shows - when maybe we need it more than ever - how we have enslaved ourselves in technology and how easily can be triggered our destruction. What detective McClean shows us is how to make our own path in life instead of walking in the footsteps that have been laid out for us. Nothing is out of reach if we want to! This movie comes in a time of my life when I most needed faith in the fact that I could change my own life, and Die Hard set an example for me. Of course, the action is very tastefully conceived so that even the most unrealistic stunts become a natural part of the entire experience called ""DIE HARD"". ""LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD!"" - I believe that I have found my motto. Watch it! And don't forget that it can also be a spiritual interpretation to a well done action movie."

Honestly, at first I was undecided whether or not I wanted to see this movie, because I am a horror fan,but I'm glad I did.

The movie will make you laugh at slow parts and make your mouth hit the floor at the fun parts. The one thing about this movie that scares me is something big. In all other Die Hards, the terrorist situations were small and stayed in one area. This incident effect all of the US(but I won't spoil it for you) Not a single thing in this movie disappointed me except one thing.

","John Mclayne is back and there is more action than the previous three combined (at least in my opinion).

IT's a great Friday night flick with lots of violence and minimal swearing ""yippie ki yay..."" Bruce Willis is great as Mclayne and surprisingly Justin Long played a great part and Timothy Olyphant as the villain was perfect. The story is basically about a giant hack job ""Fire Sale"" ...

","Live Free Or Die Hard aka Die Hard 4.0 is a lot different from the others, as well as having plenty of action scenes it also focuses on the hi-tech aspect, this is definitely a techno-thriller as well as an action flick, one of the other Die Hard films has a story that mentions computers, but nowhere near as advanced as this movie.<br/><br/>The performances are good especially from Justin Long, however Bruce Willis's reactions to shocking circumstances are non-existent, it's either bad acting and bad directing or it's his character's personality which doesn't want to show anyone that he's worried or fearful.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 rating."

","If they had stopped after ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" the franchise would have been probably my favourite trilogy of all time. However just like Sylvester Stallone goes back to Rocky after a few flops, Bruce Willis had not had a hit in a while, so we got a fourth Die Hard movie. And sadly it is not up to the standard of the other three.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: John McClane (Bruce Willis) reluctantly teams up with a young hacker, Matt Ferrell (Justin Long) joins forces to take down master cyber-terrorist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) in Washington D.C.<br/><br/>This did not feel like a Die Hard movie at all, more like yet another substandard Bruce Willis action flick. One of the things I loved about ""Die Hard"" was how human John McClane was, in previous movies we have seen him both hurt and scared. Here he is almost superhuman with him recovering in a matter of minutes. Another thing is John McClane should always have hair, no matter how little of it Willis has left. Justin Long was insanely annoying. He is not in the same ball park as Al Powell in the first movie, and not even the same sport as Zeus from ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" and the PG-13 rating just leaves everything watered down. One of my pet hates in most movies, but even more so in this one, was how the bad guys were excellent marksmen till it actually mattered (killing Willis and Long) and the action scenes were soooo over the top and ridiculous it bordered on parody at times.<br/><br/>On the plus points Mary Elizabeth Winstead is OK, in what could have been a cliché role as Lucy Gennaro/McClane, Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q are both OK as the movies main villains. And as a movie geek, I enjoyed seeing all the geek toys in various apartments."

","While I have liked the franchise, this one I want my time back for. All the action is usually great, but this one seems to have been written for a lot of loud bang-up scenes and for Bruce Willis to fight a lot.<br/><br/>Potential spoiler - In one section of the movie, you are asked to actually believe the following:<br/><br/>All power in the United States is fully controlled by exactly three sites - huh?<br/><br/>The supposed security at one of these sites is so lax that pretty much anyone could easily break in - huh?<br/><br/>And, this one is the REAL killer... That major gas distribution lines are run UNDER the site, AND - there somehow seems to be an ignition source within those lines that can be remotely controlled - SUPER HUH?<br/><br/>I now have to ask...

","The first three Die Hard movies were spectacular, amazing. John McClane is this sort of average New York cop who just happens to be there when all that stuff goes down or in Die Hard with a Vengeance he is requested. But in 4.0 it's like the whole Die Hard franchise has jumped off a cliff with too many stunts and involving his daughter was ridiculous. In my mind it will always be Holly he is trying to save plus strangers. But now it's his kids who are shown once but other than that only exist in pictures. And going back to Holly where the hell is she? In the first movie she is in Nakatomi Plaza as a hostage, in the second one she was stuck on the plane and in the third one McClane had not spoken with her in a while and then he called her but rushed off again so we could only hear her calling after him when he dropped the phone. But in the fourth one she has no role in it at all. At the end of this I can only say that there was only three Die Hards; Die Hard, Die Hard 2 and Die Hard with a Vengeance."

","This is perhaps my favorite Die Hard movie. Mainly because it has John McClane trying to rebuild a relationship with his children... one at a time. In this case he is trying to have a relationship with his daughter, Lucy.<br/><br/>Just like the other three movies the pace starts out slowly but after about ten or fifteen minutes the action picks up. It's not so fast paced that you miss anything. Or that the movie is faster than the other movies. The pace of these movies is one element that makes them so enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis reprises his role as John McClane. Lucy is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Joining in the fun is Justin Long who plays Matthew Farrell; Timothy Olyphant playing the role of Thomas Gabriel, the bad guy.<br/><br/>If you remember, in the first movie John had to thwart the efforts of Hans Gruber in stealing money from a corporation by taking over a building and the occupants of the building became his hostages. In the second, John thwarted the efforts of a paramilitary unit from helping in the escape of a drug lord while holding an airport hostage as well as the many airplanes in the skies above. In the third movie, John must thwart the efforts of Simon Krige, better known as Hans Grubers baby brother, from stealing millions of dollars worth of gold.<br/><br/>In this movie, John must stop Thomas Gabriel from stealing the entire countries wealth. Gabriel tries to do this by forcing what is known as a ""fire sale"". A ""fire sale"" is where a hacker or a group of hackers take over three or more of the countries infrastructures. This can be banks, electricity, natural gas, or some other modern necessity.<br/><br/>Eventually, Lucy is kidnapped, so the task for john becomes one in which he must rescue her. Matthew Farrell helps John along the way, but eventually is captured as well. John comes in in the nick-of-time to save them both and kills the bad guys. But the way he kills Gabriel is probably the best I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I give this a 10 out of 10 stars."
"winner55","9","2","5","31 January 2009"," grand finale to a classic action film series
","As with the another recent attempt to revive an '80s action series - 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' - I'm sure most of us hope this will be the last we see of this franchise - but for completely different reasons. ""Kingdom' was an embarrassing visit to 'been-there, done-that' land with a tired director and a tired-looking actor tried to relive the golden moment of their action-film prime. So, please, no more from Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Here we have an entirely different scenario. This film is almost as good (perhaps better, it's a matter of taste) as ""Die Hard II."" And if we don't want to see John McLane again, it's because we don't want Willis et al. embarrassing themselves the way Spielberg and Harrison did. We all knew that ""Die Hard III"" was a pretty weak finale to one of the more exciting action film trilogies in American cinema; and I think most most of us should now feel that the real finale to the story of John McLane has at last appeared - he got older; he never remarried; he didn't end up a drunk; he's still a cop; he can still kick butt in his middle age. And the story is no more ridiculous than that of Die Hard II or III, but the execution is certainly way above that of Die Hard III. I mean, the action doesn't stop, yet there's plenty of time for plot development and even the quirky, melodramatic character development we saw in the first and second films of the series.<br/><br/>Also, it must be noted, Willis, who went sleep-walking through Die Hard III, is here again in fine form, complete with true grit and blue-collar wit. He never pretends to b a super-hero, he just gets stuck with a super-hero's role (and plenty of incredible luck, of course).<br/><br/>Of course it's outlandish, and a lot of the stunts involve CGI. And he story is so wild, one reason to hope this is the last of the series is because 'out-doing' themselves would mean sending McLane off on a mission to mars, and that really would end all credibility.<br/><br/>So, assuming this is as wild as they could get, and letting the Die Hard series just be what it is - blockbuster action films for the sake of entertainment - this is one of the best."

","My vote for best film of 2007. Not to crazy a claim considering my favorite film of all time is Die Hard (1988). At first I was scared, considering I saw early pics of Bruce with his head shaved. Then I found out the director of Underworld (a film I thought sucked) was directing.... Oh Boy... but then I saw the trailer.... I got psyched!!! But then I found out it was PG-13!!! (SH*T!!!)..... But then I saw the movie.... and as a HARDCORE DIE HARD JOHN MCCLANE FAN, I tell you, THIS MOVIE KICKED ASS!!! I mean Die Hard has been my favorite film for 20 years... since I was 10 years old in 1988 (the funnest time I have ever had in a movie theater)... and this is the best sequel, EASILY! It's the funnest time I've had at the theater since the original Die Hard. Bruce Willis as John McClane is an American Icon that should stay in the memories (and hearts) of filmgoers till the end of time. I've heard complaints about the bald head and PG-13 rating (complaints I too had before I saw the film)... but the fact is John McClane is the most like John McClane in the original than he has ever been (he barely cracked wise in the third installment... and his wisecracks are crisper than ever in this one)... a couple idiots complained that he's not an alcoholic anymore!!! That was only introduced in the third film.... also complaints about not smoking... IDIOTS... he didn't smoke at all in the third film! Bruce Willis has only been better (or equal to) once as John McClane... and that's the first film... I truly hope this is the beginning of a new Die Hard Trilogy. THE BEST FILM OF 2007!!!"

This film knows when to be serious and when to wink at the audience, and the director seems to have taken to heart some of the basic tenants of movie-making that directors like Steven Spielberg have forgotten (War of the Worlds, anyone?), namely; If you're going to put your characters through hell, the audience first has to care about them, and secondly, action films should be...FUN!!! This film succeeds on all accounts and had me chuckling to myself several times at the wit of the script and the chemistry of the leads. Intelligently written, well paced, oh, and did I mention the stunts? Brilliant film-making and a good time to be had for all!!! If you like action, don't miss this puppy!!"

","I honestly don't know what to think about Live Free or Die Hard. It's a movie with no story to it.You need a hell of a good performance to pull this one off and we get it from Willis, who fits into this role like he never left it.<br/><br/>The plot if you can call it a plot is cyber terrorists trying to take over Social Security to insure a billion dollar heist. McClane is brought into it when he takes a hacker named Farell to D.C to be questioned by the FBI over a systems malfunction. McClane becomes entangled in all out mayhem when his hacker becomes the target of numerous assassination attempts. The man behind this evil plan is an ex-FBI agent named Thomas Gabriel. Gabriel knew too much and was ""crucified"" for his observations on the vulnerability of the Government's files. When Gabriels' plans go sour, he takes McClanes' daughter hostage and it becomes a personal battle.<br/><br/>I was entertained by this movie but I can only really give it a mild recommendation. I just found the lack of a real story or villain frustrating. The evil plan serves only as a plot piece and not a real threat to our country. The entire movie is really just McClane shooting henchmen. We don't get any insight into how he has changed over the years like we did in the surprisingly outstanding Rocky Balboa. He just seems up and rearing to go and besides for Bruce's bald head and a few grunts, age serves no place in this story.<br/><br/>I am pleased to say that Live Free or Die Hard does not use much of 9/11 at all. I was afraid with a title like that it would try to be a patriotic war on terror fluff film.<br/><br/>Gabriel is an incredibly weak villain. Timothy Olyphant's portrayal is only menacing to the lowest degree. We can tell his performance is meant to be evil but we just aren't scared or threatened by him. I don't expect Hans Gruber but I expect someone who can give McClane a ride for his money.<br/><br/>The pros for this movie are simply that it is a fun way to waste time. McClane is a superhero this time around and you have to except the fact that this movie is void of any shed of reality. Sometimes it's just fun watching Bruce Willis climb an Air Force fighter plane..."
"aldenbello","9","2","5","23 August 2007"," Not bad at all
","and all of us fans thought : ""Oh oh!"" Would a 12 year old franchise and a Bruce Willis in his 50's hold up to its predecessors? So with a little tension (especially when pulling out my credit card to pay for the ticket) I wondered what this may bring. Well, I have to say that the story is not bad. The acting is good. The action is definitely there, probably more than in all the others and for it being a pg-13 film probably right at the edge. Bruce was fabulous and the whole plot was believable. I think they did a good job in continuing the seemingly never ending story of John McClane who for one reason or another ends up in an unlikely life situation for the fourth time in his life and dies as hard as a human possibly can. Action packed entertainment though and totally worthwhile seeing, if you like the type of film. All in all it did not disappoint, it held up to what it promised and I might go see it again, just because the thrill of being in a grand theatre brings the action more across than on a TV. I like the title because it is one of my mottos: Never give up, but rather die with honor (like a Klingon) trying to do what's right!"

","This was the first Die Hard movie I'd seen, but after seeing the trailers I thought it would look like a great action movie. After I saw this I rented the other three and realized that 1) This was a great action movie and 2) This is the least like a die hard movie. Bruce Willis once again played Police officer John McClane who had to pick up some hacker and drive him down to D.C. Not too hard right? While once assassins start attacking this movie gets tense and is action packed with tons of stunts and special effects. Now the other 3 have a sort of gritty feel to them, but that doesn't make this a bad thing, I do like this film better than some of the previous Die hards but it still feels a bit different. Even with a PG-13 rating the action is awesome and mcClane says his famous line ""Yippey Kai Yay Mother"" you know the rest."
"aharmas","9","2","5","8 August 2007"," Top this one!!
","2007 is proving to be a remarkable year. Whereas the creative bombs have been bigger and yet made tons of money, we got films like these, giving us exactly what we demand from movies: loud, entertaining, interesting, funny, and thrilling, without an ounce of tedious dialogue or unnecessary flash. Bruce Willis knows how to pick them, and he works hard at making sure he delivers what we want.<br/><br/>McClane is a lethal weapon again, targeting just about what he needs in order to achieve his goals. Military Planes, trained assassins, trucks, cars, automatic weapons are all just different types of hurdles that he overtakes, not without a bit of risk along the way.<br/><br/>His detective is still pretty lively and gutsy, with a caustic sense of humour and ready to dispatch batches of sarcasm, as the situation demands. This time he must somehow from the country from an economic and cybernetic catastrophe, and though he is a little behind in technology, he manages to take advantage of a computer hacker, who might or not help him bring down the terrorists.<br/><br/>This film shows every bit of the budget, as cars, roads, buildings, elevators, people, computers, and more are blown up and scattered all over the screen. It also contains a couple of scenes that immediately become classics, as McClane uses a helicopter for target practice and finds new ways to leave a flying plane.<br/><br/>There is not a single boring moment in the film, and this is the biggest compliment a Hollywood movie can receive this year. It is a bit over 2 hours and is as lean as a thriller has ever been made. The only reason it doesn't get full marks is because of a bit of puzzling facts, is this all happening on the 4th of July? Why are so many people in suits all over the cities? Still, if you like loud, entertaining, and exciting films, this one is as perfect as they make them!!"
"jeroen-98","9","2","5","8 August 2007"," Die Hard 4.0 was Awesome!!
","As I said in the title, Die Hard 4.0 was awesome. It was the best action movie I've seen in theater since The Matrix. Yeah, I thought it was that good, or maybe I can't remember others at this point. Better than three, way better than 2. You can't compare it to the original. It wouldn't be fair. Die Hard was revolutionary in it's time and as such it made an impact on how action films will be shot from that point on. It was the first action movie with a script that had more to say than just being a red line through some action sequences.<br/><br/>I really liked the fast pace the movie had. The action scenes were fast and plenty, and that's why you would pay to see this movie. I loved the way how the terminator made a cameo to kill a few bad guys with the press of a button. And as you expect from a die hard movie, the script was well written. In every die hard script there is something happening to keep everybody busy while the terrorists (yeah, the movie industry uses that word again) has a second agenda to get away with a boatload of money. Somehow John McClane ends up in the middle of it and start being a pain in the villains ass. The thing that bugged me about Die hard with a Vengeance was that the terrorists knew McClane was there, they even put them there on purpose. Of course it worked well in that script, but I was happy to know that they went back to the familiar formula of the first two movies, by getting John McClane to the right place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>During the movie I kept wondering what the expenses were of such an operation and what could be worth the hassle. To pull the chaos spread in the movie off they needed a pretty good bankroll and you can't be 100% sure to get away with the prize. But I started to think about the damage done to get where they were going and I'm sure there are some countries willing to fund this endeavor, since the chaos was inevitable.<br/><br/>The one scene that did slightly bug me was the chase scene in which the harrier tried to shoot down the truck. There is no way that a pilot whose only been given the option to stop the truck would risk his billion dollar aircraft just to take out the truck that wasn't going anywhere after he took out the road below. I even doubt that a pilot would miss a slow moving large vehicle like that, in the first place. But for all that it's worth it was still eye candy to look at.<br/><br/>The acting was of high level. Timothy Olyphant played his role as brain smart villain really well, I liked the way he lacked to social skills to go with the smarts. There is a great scene where he hands the phone to the wrong person that shows this shortcoming. Justin Long played the role of computer hacker without knowledge of the implication of his actions just as good. After he sees what his actions have brought him, you feel heartfelt sorry for him. The small part of Kevin Smith was fun to watch too. Finally the star of the movie: Bruce Willis. You can't comment negatively on how he portrayed John McClane, he IS John McClane. I love the way they let him age in this movie. He has a teenage daughter now, and he, of course, lost contact with her. He's the same grumpy cop with a hard of gold as in the first 3 movies, who is muttering the injustice done to him while he takes out a helicopter.<br/><br/>All in all a great movie, worthy of the Die Hard name"

Of course, McLane is hurt, but a few scenes later seems recovered as if nothing happened! Pure gold! This film is 'old school'. The hero doesn't pussyfoot around, he unleashes shotgun justice as and when its necessary. The amount of firepower in this film is something which will please fans of the other films, there's plenty in there!

","What distinguishes Die Hard films from the other thrillers with pyrotechnics, is the relationship the John McClane character has with his buddy and his antagonist, in the film. Sometimes, as tn the first Die Hard, the buddy and the antagonist are the same guy: ""Happy Trails, Hans!""<br/><br/>The dialog that ensues from these relationships is sometimes superb and always interesting. Bruce Willis' John McClane distinguishes himself as something more than a show host serving up the blown up cars and imploded rail lines and bus terminals.<br/><br/>McClane must relate.<br/><br/>The new and most interesting curve in Die Hard Four is Matt Farrell (Justin Long), a charming and impish young geek and computer hacker, who in manner and demeanor is the opposite of the muscled take charge McClane.<br/><br/>McClane is casually attempting to break up a relationship his daughter is having with a lowlife, when the FBI calls to have him do a routine pickup of Farrell, part of a larger roundup of computer hackers nationwide.<br/><br/>McClane has trouble finding Farrell. Meanwhile, pandemonium is breaking out in the Y2K world of Terror that surrounds us today. A clean cut goody-two-shoes government anti-terror planner, smeared and fired for trying to alert the government how easy a high tech disaster could be launched, gets angry and decides to create mayhem and chaos himself.<br/><br/>This clean cut Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is the bad guy match for McClane's affections, to Matt Farrell's shape-shifting slipperiness. That's good. McClane needs at least one guy who is simple and easy to understand.<br/><br/>Gabriel is already setting off cherry bombs and firecrackers everywhere before the aging McClane -over fifty now and hairless- manages to track down and corral the smooth and elusive Farrell. McClane's capture is difficult. But Farrell backpedals with Matt pretending he is all cooperation with Mac, when in fact he is stalling and planning to escape.<br/><br/>McClane really has almost no time to take him to the Precinct. Instead he finds himself enlisting Farrell's high tech know-how in a pinch. Farrell warns him, at one point, that if he tries to hot-wire this car the old low tech way, he is liable to set off the airbags knocking them both senseless. Farrell instead pulls a PDA from his backpack, and fakes his way into the car's computer to start it. McClane is impressed, but not admitting it.<br/><br/>Quickly the FBI Bureau Chief Learns that Gabriel is so many leagues more sophisticated than Government agencies, it is going to be difficult to stop him let alone catch him. McClane learns that many of the other geeks in the roundup have been assassinated, except Farrell, who narrowly escapes that fate moments into his capture by McClane. Big John deduces that the murders have something to do with Gabriel's plot to show America how easily it can be devastated and reduced to a pile of steaming rubble.<br/><br/>McClane eventually helps Farrell escape the clutches of the bureau so the two of them can track down and defeat the Gabriel Nemesis.<br/><br/>They are a dynamic duo. McClane's stress becomes unmanageable when he learns that Gabriel has taken his daughter prisoner. I was for him bringing the lowlife boyfriend along for the ride because there would be more laughs, but the producers wouldn't listen to me.<br/><br/>Young Farrell keeps riding to McClane's rescue, always diffident and fearful that he has no tactic that will work this time. Finally, Farrell pulls out the stops. He's out of ideas and needs to commune with HIS GURU from Philly: WARLOCK!<br/><br/>McClane is leery about this tangent, but agrees finally. He and Farrell journey to a rundown alcove in Philly, Warlock's lair. It looks suspiciously like the ruins of the black neighborhood Philly's mayor ordered torched a few years ago, to quell an insurrection of black folks. The Audience is dismayed to learn that Warlock is just plain old Clerks Director Kevin Smith, now on his knees after several flops, and forced to play portly character parts in other people's films. You remember Kevin. He's the silent guy who stood outside the convenience and video stores in Clerks selling drugs, while his taller, slimmer partner dripped a patter of obscenity-laced sexual innuendos to passing women. Anyway, Kevin Smith is the Guru here. The audience reluctantly accepts this. Even Warlock, who has also narrowly missed being murdered, is out of gas idea-wise. Both he and Matt Farrell have been able to use the cell phone system even though it is dead for the rest of the country, by harnessing system algorithms through their PDAs. With this avenue fading too, the two geeks' blackberries gasping for power, Warlock and Matt go looking for some low tech information: they look up an address in the phone book.<br/><br/>There are showdowns with Gabriel, attempts to save McClane's daughter at a power plant, more high tech derring-do, and many last minute saves of the doddering McClain by the Y generation Farrell. It all comes out in the end. The film is able to put its heel down in two major demos, the Ys and the Boomers, so the end is set to come out foursquare behind the values of movie audiences in both generations.<br/><br/>Watch this space for a Revenge of the Nerds sequel to DH Four, when Farrell goes ballistic and tries to date McClane's daughter!"

","With the controversy of the USA rating of the film aside (the b.b.f.c. yet again gave a '15' certificate like 2 and 3), the fourth instalment of the die hard franchise lives up to its predecessors, expanding the franchise even further - die hard 1 centred terrorists in a skyscraper, die hard 2 in an airport (slightly bigger), die hard 3 set in a city (bigger), and die hard 4 set across the entire USA (huge). This evolution of the core plot allows die hard 4 to be bigger, better and even a little over the top, but works well, allowing for plenty of action, thrills.. and a car crashing into a chopper. Bruce Willis reprises his role as the fearless John McLane, who is now over his fear of flying. Fans will be glad that McLane gets the job done in the same manner as the previous films, in the cool and calm manner that every guy wishes they could be. Despite his famous catchphrase being disrupted with a gun shot and the lack of strong language, die hard 4 still has the brutal fighting and gory deaths, including someone meeting a nasty end in a grinder. It's been 12 years since dh3, too long in my opinion. Whatever happened to the two year gap between sequels? Better than 2 and 3, Die Hard 4 is a refreshing breath of fresh air for (excuse the pun) die-hard fans, which lives up to its title. Worth watching, and is one to buy when it comes out on DVD. 9/10."

","To my great surprise this was an excellent movie. Not exactly Shakespeare or anything highbrow but definitely a full entertainment package that will please all who enjoy action thrillers that border on the science-fiction genre. But when you get beyond the special effects and all the noise, the movie poses serious questions: Is the United States vulnerable to computer-based terrorism? Has computer technology become the Achilles' heal of modern society? Bruce Willis gives another excellent performance as John McClane but also impressive is Maggie Q who could be the next Sandra Oh. Ms. Q doesn't say much in this movie but her actions definitely speak volumes. She's all business and she's dynamite."
"muppet-show","9","2","5","23 July 2007"," Finally a REAL Blockbuster
","In a year in which blockbusters typically featured super-heroes, -robots or -pirates, along comes an average Joe (and, dare I say it... Anti-Hero) to blow the CGI assisted competition out of the water (literally in one case).<br/><br/>Le's face it, until now '07 has promised a great line-up of blockbuster movies and sadly, has fallen short on most of the big promises that have been made. Transformers was absolutely disappointing to the point, where I have watched the original cartoon series pilot episodes and have found more depth those... 'nuff said. Pirates was totally incoherent story-wise, with the presence of Chow-Yun Fat being the only saving grace (sorry Johnny). And Spiderman... well I'm not going to even comment on Spiderman...<br/><br/>Then comes McLane. To be honest I was very skeptical of the idea at first, mainly because experience has taught me (especially in recent months)that sequels for some reason just fail to measure up to the originals. Also: the maker of Underworld 2 ?!, well suffice to say I was not really convinced.<br/><br/>When I went to see the movie, my skepticism lasted for about 10 minutes. That is, until Willis disposes of the first villain (who for some reason is French) by detonating a fire extinguisher and blasting the hapless ""Frog"" through the 3rd story window. The roller-coaster ride starts then, and does not end until the credits are running.<br/><br/>The plot an be explained in few quick words (it is an action flick no less). John McLane is sent on a mission to escort a young hacker to FBI headquarters for interrogation, as the FBI's computers have been infiltrated and they are rounding up all possible suspects. At the same time hackers throughout the US are being assassinated by a group of terrorist-hackers, led by Thoomas Gabriel, planning to wreak havoc by shutting down all utilities, electrical and otherwise, hence effectively catapulting the country ""back to the dark ages"". Needless to say the terrorists and McLane cross paths, and... well you'll just have to find out...<br/><br/>The action is tightly packed and fast-paced. Not least thanks to Wiseman's use of lighting and and the clever, and more importantly subtle (as in ""not in-your-face"") usage of CGI to enhance the action scene's visual realism. Kudos to Wiseman for that.<br/><br/>The actors do a great job to convey the needed sense of realism to their roles so as to make the movie believable. Admittedly the role of McLane is not a huge stretch for Willis, who plays the reluctant hero to perfection. It is obvious that McLane, with 3 successfully accomplished missions under his belt already, is an old veteran of his trade, unflappable and not really very impressed by yet another terrorist threatening his country and family. He fires off the cool one-liners as if he had never left. Justin Long does far better than expected as well. He plays the young hacker Matt Farrell alongside our protagonist who is the terrorist's target. Long does a good job in conveying the role of the side-kick, without overly extending his on-screen welcome. His role is believable and affable; and his dialog, especially with Willis and Kevin Smith (kudos as well. he does a great job as ""Warlock""), is good enough to keep the movie's pace consistent. Timothy Olifant does reasonably well as the antagonist. He portrays the cold blooded head-hacker well enough. However I must say he was a bit too 2-dimensional for my taste. Alan Rickman he's not, but we're there for Willis anyway, so I'll let that slide. Maggie Q was a bit disappointing, not for her acting abilities, but for the relative briefness of her appearance. Sadly she does not speak much (in any of her US movies for that matter) but lets her fists do the talking (again, like in all the movies). Also, she is in arguably the most entertaining hand-to-hand combat scene between a man and a woman I have ever seen on the silver screen (eat your heart out Mr & Mrs Smith).<br/><br/>Of course one has to keep in mind that this film is an action film and thus has the story to match. But in terms of action films the plot was comprehensively well written, without excess fat, all-the-while exploring a bit of McLane's inner workings and his take on life as a ""hero"", which I found refreshing. Of course questions such as the classic, why does his car not break down after running into a wall, or how much ammo does he take with him to escort a suspect, or, more importantly, why are all of Olyphant's henchmen either French or Italian...? will never have answers. But in the end, as the credits were rolling I left the theater with a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that McLane has saved the day again in style. Which is a lot more than I can say for most of the other action films that have ""happened"" this year. <br/><br/>It's good to see McLane back and as strong as ever. Yippie-Kay-Yay"

"rogerdarlington","Null","2","5","20 July 2007"," Most expectations fulfilled
","It may be 12 years since John McClane (now a bald and battered 52 year old Bruce Willis) donned his dirty vest to save his fellow Americans, but a fourth outing for a franchise that kicked off almost two decades ago means that you know exactly what to expect - and, in that sense, this movie doesn't disappoint. It is all pretty senseless and over the top but, if you want some mindless entertainment for two and a half hours, you'll get your money's worth.<br/><br/>In the States, ""Die Hard 4.0"" - an allusion to the computer hacking plot and an attempt to be cyber hip - goes by the more triumphalist moniker of ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" and it is a very American work with its emphasis on explosions over exposition, its allusions to Hurricane Katrina and the anthrax plot, and a clever compilation of clips from Presidential utterings. On the other hand, if you didn't understand a word of the dialogue, you could enjoy the set-piece confrontations - especially the downing of a helicopter and the showdown with an F-35 jet.<br/><br/>All the support roles - Justin Long as the expert hacker, Timothy Olyphant as the cyber-terrorist, and Maggie Q as the bad guy's kick-ass companion - are the sort of age Willis was when he first took on this role and this audience demographic will be willing to trade anything like a credible plot or meaningful characterisation for non-stop action, bullets and explosions - even if the end is weak (""Yippee-ki-yay"" doesn't do it)."

","A C T I O N at its best - this is one of the best action movies I've seen in the last 3-4 yrs. <br/><br/>Die Hard series is all about action and witty dialogues. This 4th installment sticks to the path and even goes up a few notches. <br/><br/>Fight scenes  like Casino Royale, the action in this movie is about going back to basics, cutting down on computer graphics and choosing more visceral action (of course, CG can't be avoided totally these days). The movie starts with an absolute scorcher of a gunfight. And it keeps turning up the level. Amazing stunts, a couple of them never-seen-before. The final fight scene gets a little over-the-top. All I can tell you is that it features an F-35 II. <br/><br/>Bruce doesn't let his age show in the stunts; he's very physical, very aggressive, rolling and jumping all around. Maggie Q, the right-hand of the villain, is quite striking. <br/><br/>Dialogues  it has plenty of wit and barb, but not quite as much as the 1st or 3rd parts. Especially the repartee between Willis & Timothy Olyphant (the villain) is quite fun.<br/><br/>The story is passable, and in this kind of an action flick, that's good enough. <br/><br/>All in all, this is the most fun I've had from an action blockbuster in a long time. It beats all the sequels that came out this summer, hands down!"

","Live Free or Die Hard This is the first time I have ever seen any Die Hard film even though it is the 3rd film in the series. That does not matter as like other franchises, the plot in this one is self-contained having nothing to do with any of the others as far as I can tell. Everything makes sense, maybe too much sense.<br/><br/>The plot is about a Washington insider getting a bunch of computer geeks to write him a bunch of programs which are an attack on the US Computer infrastructure. He then takes the programs & starts an attack on the country. It plays like a save the country plot for most of the film- until it is revealed late in the film what his real purpose is - spoiler - money.<br/><br/>The film starts with a computer geek who wrote the program being killed. Our villain is systematically killing them off so he can cover his tracks using a team he has put together. Our hero (Willis) is then assigned to pick up one of the geeks still alive. His first scene is one where he is trying to protect his daughter's virtue (?) from a boyfriend at college. Sounds a little hokey, but it works.<br/><br/>From there, this film takes off like the original film SPEED with plenty of action. It does a great job developing the villain's top Hench woman played ably by Maggie Q (who also did some fine work in Mission Impossible 3). After Willis & the Geek take care of her, they go after the top guy who has kidnapped Willis daughter.<br/><br/>This film has plenty of action & some light comedy along the way. It is this summer's action thrill ride, runs over 2 hours & never gives you a second to rest until the end."

","Live Free or Die Hard is the fourth installment in the Die Hard series, starring Bruce Willis as the tough ass police detective John McClane. This time, McClane teams up with an internet hacker (Justin ""Hello, I'm a Mac"" Long) in attempts to take down some internet terrorist organization, whose goal is to destroy the entire United States economy. The whole plot moves quickly without giving the viewer much time to actually think about what's going on, and in actuality, just sets up the movies' next stunning, yet implausible action sequence. The action sequences are really what this movie is all about. No one comes into this movie theater for a clever script or Oscar material acting. They come to see Bruce Willis shoot people, run around, blow stuff up, and say ""Yippy-yi-yay mother------"" . And that's exactly what they receive. Shot as an R movie, Live Free or Die Hard was watered down in the editing room to obtain a more ""family friendly"" PG-13 rating. It's obvious where some of the choppy cuts are to blank out an F word or cut away right before the impact of a bullet. Even so, it does not become a children's movie. It's still bad ass, and Bruce Willis is still awesome. Keep an eye out for a great cameo of Kevin Smith as ""The Warlock."" **** of *****"
"Brothepro","8","2","5","17 July 2007"," Different from the other films in the Die Hard series.
","Len Wiseman has been notorious for making and directing bad films such as Underworld and it's even worse sequel Underworld: Evolution. So it came as a surprise when he got the task of directing Die Hard 4.0 (Live Free or Die Hard in the United States.) Would this film with hardly known actors (excluding Bruve Willis) and a less than good director live up to the previous films standards? The answer is a definite yes. However if you are expecting a claustrophobic environment that the first two Die Hard's did and you did not enjoy Die Hard with a Vengeance then this is not the film for you. Die Hard 4.0 is widespread reaching from areas to Washington DC to Baltimore. Which by the way is even more than the free roaming Die Hard with a Vengeance. Therefore the action is guaranteed to be more explosive and wily and it certainly was like that as John McClane (played by Bruce Willis, of course) was sending cars into the air and jumping off planes. But the action can feel a bit too fake at times yet nearly all these stunts were pulled off without CGI especially when he sends a car into a helicopter. Yet despite people being shot there is hardly any blood which can kick reality out the window.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good and pretty relative to post 9/11 action films or TV series like 24. It's all about terrorism and villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) being the best computer programmer of all time hacks into every system that depends on the US government. This cause chaos and havoc in Washington DC meaning people are running around like headless chickens wondering what is happening and means attempting to kill a few hackers to stop them from stopping the cyber-terrorism such as Matt Ferrell (Justin Long.) Except he fails to kill Matt as John McClane saves his life. This gives us a great partnership for the rest of the film creating wit during the non-action scenes for example Matt taking the mickey of McClane's lack of technological knowledge and good teamwork with McClane taking the mickey of Matt's lack of knowledge on how to handle himself in a gun fight. With Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Lucy McClane being as mentally strong as her dad these three good guys make a very good team.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the bad guys are less impressive as Maggie Q's Mai seemed stronger than the main bad guy that I nearly thought she was a character cross-breed from House of Flying Daggers and The Matrix which for a full throttle no holds barred film such as Die Hard 4.0 it is a tad bit silly. Timothy Olyphant did act his role well but he wasn't sinister enough or scary enough to be a memorable bad guy unlike Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard or else wouldn't the character of Lucy McClane be scared of him. The only other bad thing is that his legendary quote, ""yippee-ki-yay motherf****r"" is cut off by a gunshot.<br/><br/>If it wasn't the use of the s-word this could have been a 12A (it is a UK rating means under 12's can see as long as they are accompanied by an adult for people who live outside Britain.) as the lack of blood and the storyline appeals more to a young audience but not to worry for the fans of the original as the action is still pretty tense. Overall, director Len Wiseman has definitely proved that Bruce Willis has still got it to be John McClane as his hair is gone but his attitude certainly hasn't. Die Hard 4.0 is as good as the rest of the Die Hard series."
"andydreamseeker","9","2","5","13 July 2007"," Movie Review: Die Hard 4.0 a.k.a Live Free or Die Hard
","Die Hard (1988), Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990), Die Hard 3: Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) and now after twelve years, Bruce Willis is back as NYPD detective, John McClane in Die Hard 4.0 a.k.a Live Free or Die Hard.<br/><br/>The first Die Hard was considered the best action movie of its era and was also responsible for creating the ""action star"" archetype. No prizes for guessing who shot to fame.<br/><br/>The question however should be whether a 52 year old Bruce Willis can reprise his role as detective John McClane. There's also the query upon the movie title with its numeric four decimal zero.<br/><br/>As the film opened, I immediately knew why. The movie title flickered and Mai Linh (Maggie Q) was seen chatting up a hacker, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) with an exchange of payment and information. Moments later another hacker's home was blown up as he presses the Delete button on his keyboard. Something is definitely up and it has got to do with hackers but I still do not know what is really going on. Suspense is created by curiosity.<br/><br/>But where is detective McClane? He's introduced in the movie spying on his daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at a college car park making out with a boy. In this scene we are reminded of the relationship strain between our courageous hero and his daughter. The screenplay here will set the tone of McClane's communication style. There is a sense of authority, wit and involuntary charm about McClane's character that is compelling.<br/><br/>The other character you'll be made much aware of is Matthew Farrell, the hacker who McClane is specifically assigned by the higher ups to escort to the Federal Bureau soon after the argument with Lucy. That would signal the start of 2 hours of non-stop action. The first explosive sequence will see McClane and Farrell fighting and escaping five gun-welding assassins decorating Farrell's apartment with bullet holes. Just at a time when I thought stunts and bullet dodging was a lost art in Hollywood, the production crew here sure showed me. The breath-taking actions never stop until the bad guy is.<br/><br/>The bad guy is Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), the mastermind behind a very elaborate virtual terrorists attack to shut down and take over the United States. The story gets interesting when we know whom the bad guy is but we do not know what he is up to. That is where the suspense, thrills and actions become Die Hard 4.0. The atmosphere is intense to a fault. I was hoping for a break in all the drama to give me some space to breathe and thankfully it came around the hour mark.<br/><br/>Here is the light hearted moment where McClane and Farrell gets to know each other a little bit better when they converse about their lives to each other.<br/><br/>Right after the break came the kick-ass fight scene between McClane and Mai Linh or the sexy and seductive Maggie Q. When I mean kick-ass I do mean kick-ass. Whoa!!!<br/><br/>We all knew McClane die hard so it became no surprise that Gabriel wanted to take things more personally with the kidnapping of Lucy which sets up a fight to the end.<br/><br/>""I'm gonna go kill this guy and get my daughter. Or go get my daughter and kill this guy. Or kill all of 'em!""<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 is the movie to describe the word ""adrenaline"".<br/><br/>I must commend director Len Wiseman and his crew for giving me the rush. (To get a taste of the rush I felt, go to the official website and soak in to the soundtrack) There is another name on the crew list that I must mention. He is Patrick Tatopoulos, the production designer. His artistry as seen in movies like I, Robot, Underworld: Evolution, Silent Hill and Pitch Black gave Die Hard 4.0 a rich visual style. All that and in combining with the vision of Len Wiseman and cinematographer Simon Duggan is a captivating Die Hard film. I especially like the way the camera catches the details of surveillance objects throughout and the use of cool and warm lens filter to set the mood.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, Bruce Willis is great, Justin Long is convincing in his role as the geeky yet irritably funny hacker, and so is Cliff Curtis who I almost fail to mention, in his role as the F.B.I top man. My only complaint is not having seen enough of Maggie Q. I feel she is really maturing into the niche of the female action star genre having last seen her in Mission: Impossible III.<br/><br/>The story by Mark Bomback and David Marconi really tells of the possible terrorist threat in a computerized environment and possibly inspired by the subject of security breach after the events of nine eleven. Having such a heavy dependency on high technology, computers and the Internet in this modern era of ours, it would be terrifying to know they can easily become the means for a terrorist attack. When the title reads 4.0, it says something about computer programming or a serial version of a software. It serves to remind us of the hardware that we have so taken for granted in everyday living, namely the people around us who we often forget to care. On the other hand, Live Free or Die Hard would be saying that we must remain vigilant to prevent our freedom from being compromised.<br/><br/>""All you gotta do is go pick up a kid in New Jersey, and drive him down to D.C. How hard can that be, huh?"" John McClane was lamenting about his job shortly before launching a police car into a pursuing helicopter.<br/><br/>All you gotta do now is go see how he did it. How hard can that be? Show your appreciation, It'll be well worth it."

How can such a derivative film get a score of 8 in the IMDb ratings against all those films out there with some originality. I know films are for entertainment, but with all these movies we have to totally suspend disbelief in a desensitizing manner rather than an artistic one. If this had been the only movie of its kind I would have been far more appreciative but as it is, it's Hollywood Hype all over again."

","Was there too much pomp in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD? There was bombast aplenty, but you can never say ""too much"" when you speak of a DH film or it's pedigree. What makes this work isn't Stanislavsky or any AMPAS-worthy moment. It's simply the John McClane-ian wit we are all accustomed to from the first film, and perhaps the other 2 sequels. And you get a feel of that same character when McClane is thrown into his same old, same old once again. The cheesy punchlines, the self-psyching soliloquy when he's about to do something that's a ""very bad idea"". Et cetera.<br/><br/>What almost feels like a fascinating juxtapousition is the contrast between the modern day sophistication of the cyber terrorists, and the gritty chaos out in the streets that are a consequence of their villainy. Felt by McClane and the millions who become undersiege.<br/><br/>May I also say Mary Winstead was very well cast, she may be an unlikeable character, but she has Bonnie Bedelia's eyes. (McClane's wife in the first 2 movies), and while there are some references to McClane's backstory and familial affairs, they don't intrude into this being a very entertaining stand-alone action film. I especially liked the dialogue in the car about what the consequences are of being a ""hero"", though On the Nose type of dialogue, it worked nonetheless and I felt an iota of genuine emotion. Possibly also because of the gloomy color scheme of that little reflective sequence.<br/><br/>This has plenty of its moments, the first steps of taking America hostage, the eery montage of U.S. Presidents used by the terrorists to broadcast their message, the fight scene with Maggie Q. And I guess 9mm cartridges don't do tissue damage all that much, but only do so after penetrating and obstacle - which might cause it's velocity to drop and thereby destroy what is next to it. Just see the movie to find out what I mean. It's the Yipee Kye Aye part. Live Free or Die Hard works for me.<br/><br/>9/10"

","John McClane is back! As a big fan of the Die Hard movies I was looking forward to this and if you're looking for lots of effects, a few punchlines and daft jokes, this is for you.<br/><br/>His time around John McClane is divorced from Holly and his daughter Lucy won't talk to him and calls herself Genero rather than McClane (Holly did the same thing in the first movie). He's asked to go pick up a computer hacker, Matt Farrell, because someone has hacked into the US systems (I forget which one) and has taken over. The hacker is on a list of 1000 people who could possible do it, and already a few of them have been blown up. When he gets to the hacker's house he stops the assassination attempt and the hacker tells him he was sent a bit of a program to write without knowing what he was doing. He works out that the bad guys are systematically shutting down the US, going for security and banks, utilities, and anything else controlled by a computer, which is basically everything. It's up to good ol' John to save the day along with Justin, and he gets an extra reason to kill the guys when they track down his daughter and hold her captive.<br/><br/>This is big on explosions but, unlike several action movies I've seen, it still has a plot running through it. OK, it's a plot which sounds completely overblown, if plausible, but unrealistic story lines are the bread and butter of action movies after all.<br/><br/>There's nothing particularly cringeworthy in the violence of it, and there isn't really a big punch up you used to get in action movies, instead going for a few fights but lots of explosions and a chase between a transit van, a big rig and an F-15 plane!!! This is really Bruce Willis' show but the other characters get decent screen time too, although it is odd that the bad guys are pretty people but the geeks they have doing the hard work are, well, geeky. Justin Long does pretty well, being suitably freaked out but not overdone, and even the bad guys are pretty low key. There's even the inevitable FBI guy trying to take over, but only for a few minutes. What is it with John McClane and the Feds? A good action movie for modern times. I still like the old way of doing things with punch ups and car chases rather than explosions every ten minutes but that's the way action movies are going now, so I'll deal with it. Worth going to see, and I'd take anyone old enough to get into the cinema."
"Ryu_Darkwood","8","2","5","9 July 2007"," Decent ending to the franchise!
","This episode of the Die Hard-series is a decent ending. At least, I hope that this is the last one. In Hollywood you're never sure if they really can leave a successful franchise alone, just to preserve its legendary status.<br/><br/>In this part John McClane has to take on a group of terrorists that hack the system and screw up the entire infrastructure of the U.S.A. I personally like this approach. It makes the story of McClane a bit more epic than in previous parts of the series. It also has a nice touch of actuality in it, having in mind the terrorist-threat after 9-11 and the failing of help after hurricane Katrina. We see a nightmarish America in chaos; cars crashing, a complete blackout of water and electricity, stock markets collapsing,people panicking, terrorists using vile methods to manipulate the media and police, firefighters and medical help failing to response quick enough. They really did their best to visualize an America during a complete Armageddon.<br/><br/>There are no Arabs to be seen in the entire plot, and I think that is a good thing. Having all-American hero McClane fight terrorists would give the franchise a nasty, propaganda-like atmosphere. They wisely chose for a political correct villain. Though I must say that his psychological reasons to do this vile act are a bit lame. He's a bit of an anti-villain, so to speak. I'd rather see a more evil character to try and stop McClane on his rampage to save the day. Timothy Olyphant has the great bewildered look in his eyes to make him one scary dude, but with his mediocre script he doesn't really come to life as should be. His motives are too vague. <br/><br/>At the end, this part is thoroughly enjoyable. It isn't as good as it once was, mainly because the studio decided that it had to have a pg-13 rating. Most of the action is grander than before, existing out of exploding things and other less physical brutalities. The plot is paper-thin, but hey, I think that action-wise this movie sets a new standard for action movies in the future. Nowadays McClane isn't the only angry action hero, but he does have the right to exist next to more recent heroes as Jack Sparrow or Jack Bauer."

Justin Long was hilarious and played his role perfectly as did Bruce Willis, for the fourth time. Timothy Olyphant was not even close to Alan Rickman's role in Die Hard, but played his role well. The action scenes with Thomas Gabriel's (Olyphant) henchmen were great as was McLane's fight scene with Mai Lihn (Maggie Q). Kevin Smith was also hilarious with his role as ""The Warlock"", a pro at hacking who Farrell greatly admired.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was great. 9.5/10"
"itsparsley","8","2","5","9 July 2007"," Best action film of the summer! Die Hard packs a punch and leaves your adrenaline flowing.
","While many were skeptical about the 4th installment of the Die Hard series I had a feeling that Bruce Willis wouldn't return and tell us it was as good as the first unless he really stumbled upon something special. Before attending the jammed pack midnight showing I read some early reviews that were all looking positive, I had a really good feeling about this movie. As an action fan I have grown to be more and more disappointed with the quality of this genre, so I could only pray Live Free Or Die Hard wouldn't put it to shame. Fast forward. The moment the final credits come up my entire theater gives the film a standing ovation with plenty of cheering. I was so incredibly satisfied with my experience that my only complaint was I couldn't immediately go back for a second viewing. You really have to give action flicks a lot of rope, if you do that with Die Hard 4 it'll blow right past your expectations. What a relief! I had read about the possibility of another Die Hard about 10 years ago, this was well worth the wait! It's also great to see a big scale film that didn't heavily depend on cgi. If you enjoy action movies than this is a MUST see."

","John McClane is, I assume, the poor man's answer to James Bond. Perhaps that is his appeal; the proverbial ""Everyman"" whose innate ability to survive gives him quasi-superhero status, a regular joe who somehow reveals remarkable brilliance and an indestructible nature whenever the need arises. He's Bond without the sophistication; Indiana Jones without the exotic nostalgia; Batman without the cape or the utility belt.<br/><br/>Yet, as such, he is a man of action and certainly not of personality. As personified by Bruce Willis in the DIE HARD films, McClane has remarkably little depth or charm. Willis swaggers through the films with his trademark smirk and a catalogue of mildly amusing one-liners, giving McClane what little color he has. As Willis returned to the character in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, arguably the best of the series, the McClane character was described as Willis' signature role, which certainly sells the prolific actor short. But if the measure of an action hero is whether he would be just as interesting without the derring-do then I don't think McClane would past the test. McClane is only as interesting as the stunt team and CGI special effects allow him to be.<br/><br/>Willis himself is a much underrated and underappreicated actor. The right material and the right character shows him to be capable of giving performances of remarkable subtlety (THE SIXTH SENSE, NOBODY'S FOOL, UNBREAKABLE) as well as sharp comic skill (DEATH BECOMES HER). But when he allows himself to be pulled back into action hero roles (not just in the DIE HARD films, but in junk like ARMAGEDD0N and HUDSON HAWK), he runs the risk of following Burt Reynolds' path into shameless self-parody. That's not to say that Willis doesn't work hard in LIVE FREE, only that for all of his (and his stunt team's) strenuous running, jumping, fighting and shooting, he isn't given much opportunity to be anything more than Bruce Willis dying hard to get a paycheck.<br/><br/>LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is, of course, a stupid movie. All the DIE HARD movies are just plain stupid: McClane stumbles into elaborate plots that don't make a lot of sense, inexplicably ends up in the center of the mayhem and shows unexpected skill as the only man who can possibly save the day. You know, all the things that we'd expect of James Bond, but not of a lowly police detective. Though the sinister plot at the center of LIVE FREE is an attempt to control America by taking over all the country's computers, hardly a plot that seems to promise much action; the comic book violence and high tech mayhem still manages to push the limit. McClane races all over the Eastern Seaboard as cars crash, buildings explode and various villains die more gruesomely than hard.<br/><br/>And there's not much else there; what little effort there's been to give McClane a personality and a life was used up in the first DIE HARD, with the subsequent films focusing on blowing things up real good. That seems to be all that the fans of these films really want, so why bother with anything else? His superhero credentials having been established, there isn't even much attempt to question why McClane repeatedly finds himself in such dire circumstances; it's just taken for granted.<br/><br/>But, it would have been nice had they attempted to shoehorn some semblance of a credible backstory into the film, something to act as a cushion between the special effects and non-stop action. We do meet his rebellious teenaged daughter, though as played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead she's a cipher, forgotten for most of the film until she needs daddy to save her at the end. More interest is shown in establishing a father figure relationship between McClane and a computer geek (nicely played by Justin Long) who gets sucked into being McClane's sidekick -- though I can't help but wonder why the filmmakers didn't make the computer geek character McClane's son (or for that matter his daughter) and thus give McClane some genuine motivation and emotional involvement, something real, in the otherwise far-fetched story.<br/><br/>As is, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is an adrenalin rush of elaborate, slickly executed, and not often believable, stunts. It's often funny, though I can't say it is all that much fun. It's just another day at work for a superhero."
"alexandermangoldt","7","2","5","7 July 2007"," Great flick, but what's with the ending, dude?
","Now, I had better write something while the memory is still fresh: Anyway, I saw this movie in a theatre yesterday, and, two minutes into the movie, I was already captivated. Bruce Willis as John McClane is better than ever and I always liked the way he turns a male chauvinist pig into a likable and even adorable character. The plot is easily understandable but still exciting enough to be not discredited as flat and dull. The action scenes are both hilarious and stunning and they grab you by the balls (excuse my French) and keep you breathless for the entire length of the movie. However, there is one major flaw to this movie: the ending! I thought all the action scenes were quite realistic and even when Bruce Willis killed a chopper with a car I wasn't laughing or chuckling to myself because the scene defies gravity or whatever. But to the end, when a jet plane (F-13, I think) tries to shoot the truck I caught myself thinking: O.K., now they're overdoing it a bit. It reminded me a little of TRUE LIES which was a very unrealistic film to the extent that it was laughable. Well, all in all, it's still a great flick, but I wish someone had taken the director aside when he was shooting the truck/jet plane scene and had told him: LESS IS MORE! But, other than that, great entertainment: Kudos!"

"Sarfield-1","9","2","5","6 July 2007"," John McClane saves modern cinema
","Something clicked in my chest when I saw John McClane on the big screen again after so long. He's older, sure, a bit rounder and balder, but that's him alright. I did not expect much from this movie after watching the trailer, and I definitely did not believe I would say what I am about to utter: this movie delivers. Not only that, it's the best Die Hard since the first one. I wouldn't say it's better than the first one, but it's right up there. Hats off to the director and of course to Bruce himself - I did not think they had it in them. There's a trend of these 80s action heroes coming back for another round of bloodshed, and I welcome them with open arms. I missed watching a good action movie that doesn't try to convey some kind of half-assed, self-righteous message and has a good lead actor instead of a guy who looks good and always has nice hair after a gunfight. I don't know where it happened, I can't pinpoint the location or exact time, but at some point action movies died a little. I'm not saying there haven't been good ones, because there have been, but they're different: action movies these days have to be clever, too full of nonsense. There cannot be simple bad guys - they have to be deep characters with a strong motivation for their actions. If the movie doesn't have 3 interlacing plot lines and a lead who has won an Oscar, it is shunned. We need an old hero to remind us what action movies are all about: Good guys and bad guys, the bad guys get dead and the hero gets the girl. It's not too much to understand, but it is amazing to see. And to all who say ""oh, I just turned my brain off when I went in and had a blast"", I say go turn your brain back on, think for a while, and watch the movie again. You don't use your brain only for dramatic dialogue or a complex plot. Your brain processes images and sounds. To get a movie to envelop you and engage you and suck you into a car-chase, a gunfight, a fistfight, or to get you to cheer for the good guy and to feel good when the bad guy snuffs it  that's hard work. It's extremely hard to get that kind of involvement in action films. That's what we forgot at somewhere, and I'm so happy the makers of this film decided to bring this oldschool movie to us and not change it to fit our namby-pamby standards. This movie was just right. They kept to the roots of Die Hard, meaning the witty repartee and hardcore, bloody action, but they did not just copy and paste a story. The movie's plot actually looks in on itself, how an old hero is brought to a different world. The result is funny and action-packed. The script is very well written (for a Die Hard movie) and everything, from action to characters feels right. Timothy Olyphant, while fairly good as the villain, doesn't match up to any of the previous villains  he's a mean guy but ultimately he's a computer geek, and I guess it's just not as threatening. Willis is at his prime, though, despite what you might think, and he portrays McClane as if he'd never stopped. Justing Long is a worthy side-kick and watching him and McClane work together provides some of the best scenes in the film. What I can say bothered me a bit is the pacing. For some reason the movie felt to be moving forward too fast. But that's a minor concern, and the movie is well-worth watching. <br/><br/>And again, I must give a standing ovation to the film makers. After so many disappointing sequels and remakes in the last few years, these guys actually got it right. John McClane is back! Yippee kye aye -(you know the rest)."

","When we thought that McClane, Bruce Willis, and the whole ""Die Hard"" line has been buried, the industry resurrects them again. It was a thrill to see that ""Die Hard"" was ""coming to town,"" again. Thus, every fan would want to go and see what is the story, and visit with the rough copper, John McClane.<br/><br/>The film is not ""Die Hard 4,"" it is ""Die Hard 4.0,"" which says more than just a chronological order of the film sequence. The title, of course, suggests a more cyber relationship this action production is all about. The film, as the title conveys, is another computer program version. Furthermore, reveals, and connects, to the core of events the plot revolves over.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 4.0"" is a true action film that offers more events, scenes, and thrilling fights throughout the screening. McClane returns, with strength, to life, and as always, he fights to defend his, life, country, and his family. The enemy here is, also, a terrorist who employs foreigners to do the dirty work for him. In addition, the makers of the film made it more difficult for the super protagonist as they forced him to compete with the government's ""good guys."" That helped with the characters' struggle, and somewhat with plot construction.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is not one that is ""great,"" in fact it lacks more sense and intelligence. Some things would never, and could never happen, in the real life, but this is an action film that does not require, nor offers, a strong deep plot. Therefore, a viewer can go there for the action. Furthermore, the writers did a well job with the humor. There are jokes and funny scenes in this little program that made it ""lighthearted."" The direction was not as bad as other action films I have seen. In fact, the director did a decent job here. The lighting work was not bad either, but some scenes could have used a little bit extra sunshine. The editing, on the other hand, was probably the worst. Some scenes were not patched correctly. If the viewer payed attention, some characters would be out of place, not too far off, though; yet, it would be disturbing to the trained eye.<br/><br/>Besides the action and the humor, there is not much to say about ""Die Hard 4.0."" The film is primarily action, and it does not, nor tries to,reach for intelligence. However, some action scenes are cool, and seem smart. I am not found of the plot, I even thought it was dull. The six stars are only for the action and humor."

","As the title says, DH4 was a comeback of the late 90's action movies. You know, the kind where it was all about special effects, explosions, laser-shooting aliens and whatnot? Well scratch the last.<br/><br/>The plot isn't much, it doesn't have you thinking ""oh my, what's this really about"" in the least. It's bland, boring and predictable all the way to the end. Unlike DH1 and 3, which were all about a form of sustained suspense, DH4 is about attitude and explosions. Pure and simple. In away, it's disappointing of course. But the attitude and explosions part was interesting enough to make up for a lot. Sure it's not realistic, and there are those scenes where even a casual observer with no intimate knowledge of weapons or, say, fighter jets goes ""oh come on already!"" But it does look and sound damn neat.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis kicks butt, his good old humor is back. It's a bit different, but it's there. The other actors also do a great job, and Maggie Quigley looks smokin' hot, of course. Soundtrack isn't that fabulous really, as much of the time there wasn't even one so you could hear all the constant explosions. They seem to keep underestimating its' significance these days, considering T3 had the same problem.<br/><br/>Overall it's no different from any other of those over-taken explosion action flicks. Same unbelievable, unrealistic problems, etc etc. But it has Bruce Willis as himself, and a load of nostalgia value. Anyone who hasn't seen or cared about Die Hard before, probably has little to gain from this one. To them I'd say this is a 5-6. But to those who know where this is coming from, and feel they want to get one last ride back to the past, I'd give this an 8. Maybe on a same level with DH2, some ways behind 1 and 3."

But thats OK because I'm sure the writers were not counting on the plot to keep you interested. What this title does deliver on is action.

On his way to turn a young hacker named Matt Farrell into custody, he experiences a modern version of a terrorist attack first hand when he gets stuck in traffic. A group of hackers, led by Thomas Gabriel, have struck at the vulnerable United States computer infrastructure and are systematically shutting it down, performing a ""firesale"" beginning with the traffic light system.<br/><br/>As they move on to crash utilities, banking networks and the stock market, the indexes plummet and America's economy becomes crippled. As usual, McClane gets caught up in the middle of the excitement. It turns out that the recently captured Matt seems bright enough to understand exactly what the terrorists are doing and what steps they are taking to achieve their mission. Soon, the crime-fighting duo of McClane and Farrell are pulling out all the stops and matching wits with the terrorists, hoping to figure out the motives behind their actions and to stop them before the entire nation collapses to its knees on Independence Day.<br/><br/>I wasn't really looking forward to this film because I've never seen any Die Hard films or really wasn't interested seeing them. Well, I finally got to see Die Hard for the first time and I liked (not loved) it. Then I find out this movie was rated PG-13, which got me excited and let down at the same time. I knew they wouldn't say the line in the movie but I was excited because it might be good to see something different for a change.<br/><br/>So it was late when I saw this in theaters but wow, when I saw this film, I did not get sleepy for a second! I didn't even bother to look at what time it was. This movie was so entertaining and action-packed, it was so much better than the original! Well, this is coming from a person who haven't seen the second or third Die Hard films, so my opinion might be different than the others. Yeah, it didn't feel like a Die Hard film but it certainly did give references to the original. If you watch this film, it will feel like an R rated film. It really does. Yeah, you don't get much profanity but you wouldn't be thinking about it when watching the movie. I never liked Len Wiseman's Underworld but I'm glad to say I love this movie!<br/><br/>Now getting the rating controversy out of the way, I'll talk about how fantastic the film is. This film is pretty much a notch up from the original. It has more imaginative/creative ideas to make you go in awe. It is much smarter, much suspenseful, and has many more action sequences that are top notch! I'm glad they used as little CGI as possible because so many films this summer has! It's great to see them doing it the ""old skool"" way using real stunts and props. No, I'm not saying this is a better film because of the action, but I'm saying it was better because it basically tops everything off from the original (yeah, except for the language).<br/><br/>In this film, John McClane is much more crankier. I loved it! The film was much funnier because of his fantastic one liners and comedic scenes! Bruce Willis' acting is great as always. Justin Long's acting is surprisingly good as well as Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who didn't shine through her previous roles in other films. Timothy Olyphant, who plays the villain gives a realistic evil and sinister role and Maggie Q's performance is kick ass! I'm surprised to say this film is fast paced, even for a two hour movie. I thought it wasn't possible.<br/><br/>This film uses what Die Hard didn't. It has a much thrilling score to make the action scenes much suspenseful. The camera movements are great! The film is much funnier and entertaining. This is possibly one of the most surprising summer movie sequel out this year! Average movie goers will get really entertained. Die Hard fans, well, will also get entertained but might get disappointed because of the PG-13 rating, which I wouldn't say they need to worry. This film is a solid action-packed film that delivers!"
"heyuguys1988","9","2","5","27 June 2007"," ""Live Free"" didn't die too hard. (One tiny spoiler)
","First off, the big question is concerning the PG-13 rating. I have to say that I've never been a big lobbier for movies to have harder ratings than they need (FF2 for example was 10 times better than the original), but this time the R rating would have been the right choice.<br/><br/>The story involves super hackers trying to basically put America to an end and John Mclane won't have any of that. The story sucks. Who cares though, right? This is Die Hard, I want to see stuff blow up. And stuff does blow up, which is nice.<br/><br/>But remember what I said about the PG-13 rating? Well, it keeps this movie from being Die Hard 4. It makes it a pretty cool action movie with a character who is kind of like John Mclane of Die Hard 1-3. Minus the characters first interaction with with Matt Farrell (played pretty well by Justin Long), this John Mclane is a different person. He doesn't smoke, drink, swear... none of that. Never do they even mention it. He doesn't have a hangover or need a cig or anything. Gone is the banter and wise-cracking jokes of previous outings. Gone is the Die Hard in Die Hard 4.<br/><br/>But this is still a pretty fun, entertaining movie. I gave it a 7 remember? Lots of things go boom. Lots of things.<br/><br/>Oh did I mention the bad guy? Did I mention he SUCKS? I was so hoping they would link him to Hans or Simon or something where I'd give a crap about him. He looks like he's going to cry the entire time (He almost does). Why couldn't him and Maggie Q have switched places? She was cool and then she...<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!! ...dies.<br/><br/>John's daughter is kind of hot so that works. And Maggie Q is too. But that's really it. This movie doesn't have the pop of previous outings in the series, but it's still got more flare than most acion movies out there. It's still an awesomely enjoyable flick with one of the coolest guys out there (I'm looking at you Justin Long!... okay joking) and I will no doubt watch it again. This isn't stuff they can't fix for Die Hard 5, but I'm not sure how they could go much more large scale than this."

McClane is great as always, and the one-liners are clever and non-stop. I will say that this movie probably has the greatest action sequences that I have ever seen on film (yes, even eclipsing Terminator 2 IMHO).

I am absolutely shocked that this movie was not rated R - it has a tonne of violence (some very brutal) and there is plenty of swearing, just not many F-bombs.<br/><br/>All in all, while it is impossible to live up to the lofty heights of the original classic, Live Free or Die Hard is a highly entertaining movie worth the price of admission."

","The basic formula for the ""Die Hard"" film series is this: A seemingly invincible foe with multiple henchmen, unlimited resources and access to the latest in cutting edge technology hold a group of people or the government hostage, killing at will and demanding an unbelievable ransom  until the bad guys meet unbreakable police officer John McClane.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago, in the summer of 1987, the world met the tough, sarcastic LAPD constable played by Bruce Willis (who became a household word as the bumbling private detective in the quirky TV series, ""Moonlighting""). With his wife among a group of hostages at the huge Nokitomi Building in Los Angeles, McClane systematically dismantled the terrorists' plans and defeated the head villain, Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Two inferior sequels followed suit.<br/><br/>Flash-forward two decades to the franchise's fourth installment, ""Live Free or Die Hard."" Now a New York Police detective, McClane happens upon a geeky young computer hacker, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, ""Accepted""), who was the target of a bombing attempt. Dragging him from the scene (as McClane does to lots of people in this role), he finds out the kid was part of a complicated computer plot with a network of other hackers  all of whom have now been blown to pieces.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of sophisticated cyber-terrorists, led by Thomas Garbriel (Timothy Olyphant, a character in such TV series as ""My Name Is Earl"" and ""Deadwood""), has shut down all traffic, utility and communication networks throughout the Eastern Seaboard, causing major disruptions, financial chaos and wholesale panic in the streets.<br/><br/>The idiot villains also make the ultimate mistake and kidnap the gruff cop's equally feisty daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ""Grindhouse,"" ""Bobby""). Now it's personal.<br/><br/>Gathering what information he can from the rebellious Farrell, McClane figures out that Gabriel is using a ""fire sale"" or a catastrophic computer meltdown to hide the fact he is trying to steal billions in money form the government treasuries. Of course, McClane is the hardware to Farrell's software  he will kill people and blow things up, while the nerd will try to foil the bad guys' plans cybernetically.<br/><br/>It's a combination that goes together pretty well. I mean, this isn't Shakespeare, so don't expect a lot of philosophical rambling or long dialogs about art, literature or physics. It's basically Bruce Willis killing people and breaking things and then wryly commenting on what he just did.<br/><br/>That's okay with me. I wasn't expecting to be intellectually enlightened by this experience, just entertained for a few hours; and that's what happened with ""Live Free or Die Hard."" I now look forward to the fifth version  in 2027, ""Live and Let Die Hard."""
"n_buffum-1","2","2","6","7 December 2007"," Still better than Transformers, but terrible none the less
","Frightfully bad and terribly disappointing. The original was revolutionary because it put an ordinary man in extraordinary situations. Now, John McClain has become Rambo, Superman and Pedro Martinez wrapped into one. He's beyond human, and it does not work. Maybe they should have spent a couple of dollars hiring a writer instead of wasting their money on special effects. The explosions are hollow. The plot is completely unbelievable and maybe I'd let that slide if they put an elf in it or something. But this is supposed to be modern day America. They give us enough BS patriotism that the viewer should demand some semblance of reality. There is no character development at all and I'd have no empathy for the Bruce Willis character if I hadn't already seen the previous movies. I didn't even make it to the end... which judging by the previews includes Willis moonwalking on the back of a moving fighter jet. Thankfully, my girlfriend rented this garbage and I'm not out any cash."
"MichaelMargetis","6","2","6","21 November 2007"," Far Better Than the Last Die Hard, it Kicks Some Serious Ass!
","As far as the first 'Die Hard' goes, it's my all-time favorite action film. I wasn't expecting much out of 'Live Free or Die Hard' due to how terrible the last Die Hard sequel was, but I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Live Free or Die Hard' isn't anywhere near as great as the first two, but it's certainly better than the third. On an action scale, 'Live Free or Die Hard' has more of it than the first three films combined. The action sequences are ridiculous, unbelievable and impossible of course, but at least they are thrillingly entertaining. Bruce Willis is great playing a bad-ass once again, and the supporting cast is surprisingly strong. Timothy Olyphant, probably best known for his role as Seth Bullock on the critically-acclaimed HBO Western 'Deadwood', plays the internet terrorist villain with great intensity and a touch of dark humor. Justin Long, whom you probably remember from 'Dodgeball', is humorous as Willis' sidekick, and it's always nice to see Kevin Smith (writer/director of Clerks, Clerks 2, Dogma, etc.), even though he isn't that great of an actor. Although, 'Live Free or Die Hard' is wildly entertaining, it isn't ""great"" film-making in any sense. The dialogue is sometimes so cheesy I wonder if a member of the animal kingdom wrote the screenplay. Also, the plot takes some tremendous leaps. However, if you want to be entertained with a bunch of booms and bangs, there's really no other film I can recommend more than 'Live Free or Die Hard'. Grade: B-"

","I suppose this film is not more than just action, and it's true. Well, you know...every time and anytime, and any when the sequel of Die Hard is released, I'm sure that the people will enjoy it absolutely. Especially in my country. Well, Indonesia likes an action film too, just about a MANIAC!!! film that you can just see overhead. And I recognize it! There's one good sentence for this movie : A Great and Enormous Job Done!!! The other reason why I like this movie and say that this is a satisfactory movie for me is... that mostly part of the film is just getting 'crazy' and get out of my mind too. I ever said ,""Are they nuts!!!???"" Ha ha ha........it was so ridiculous... But now, I realize. I know, and I'm sure why do the people like this movie so much. Almost of the people.....<br/><br/>I'll tell you one thing again. The first Die Hard movie released in 1988, it means before the time that I was born. I was born in the end of 1992, and the last sequel of this film before the fifth released in 1995. So, the conclusion is, I don't know this movie plot-story so much. Lucky for me, each time the sequel of Die Hard releases, like this fifth sequel, the story isn't continuing and doesn't make me feel dizzy to watch and understand it. That's why, I'm very impressed with this movie.<br/><br/>Last one, I want to know, when will the next Die Hard release? Sure, I'll wait for that time.........."

"simonparker1990","8","2","6","5 July 2007"," Best Blockbuster of 2007!
","The original Die Hard is a masterpiece, one of my favourite movies of all time and I can re watch it numerous times and still never get bored. Die Hard 2 is about on par with Die Hard with a Vengeance, its a good movie and very entertaining, but now I realise they were really a mere cash in attempt on the success of the first movie. So when I heard Die Hard 4.0 was a PG-13 in America, I assumed the worst. I feared it would be another cash in attempt. I say the opposite now I've seen it, while Die Hard 4.0 was made for money, it also seems to put a franchise back in the right track. Its certainly the best Die Hard since the original movie, and its actually one of the most fun of the series. Its a big, dumb action movie, it never tries to be anything different. Its one of the most ludicrous action movies you could ever hope for, and yet it seems so far to be the very best Summer Blockbuster of 2007! <br/><br/>Part of the success of the Die Hard movies has always been Bruce Willis as John McClaine. He's your average guy, he doesn't want to be in these situations, but when he is in them he does whatever the hell he can. Its his down to earth attitude and world weariness that makes him such a great character to root for. Here his age actually seems to have helped him, sure he's flying about all over the place in the action sequences, but you appreciate the character more this time as he seems to have developed. He has his usual array of one liners, he does his great action sequences, and he's just a joy to watch. Its nice to see him finally back on screen playing McClaine, and judging by his performance he's clearly enjoying himself as well. Justin Long slightly surprised me a little bit, he's a funny person and I've never disliked him in any movies I've seen him in. But I never imagined him in a Die Hard movie. Yet here he seems right at home actually, he's pretty much taking over Samuel L Jackson's job from the last movie, of course you miss Jackson a bit because nobody can ever top Jackson. But Long gives it a damn good try and I still think he did a great job. He's got a very funny scene in the middle of the flick, and some great later moments as well. The villains of the movie obviously fall flat in comparison to the sheer brilliance of Alan Rickman from the original movie. But they're still passable. Especially Maggie Q who has an absolutely amazing action sequence that I cannot wait to see again!<br/><br/>But I suppose Die Hard is mainly about the action, that's of course what people are looking forward to, that and of course one line that I shall talk about a bit later. Well the action here is absolutely brilliant! The helicopter and car bit promised in the trailer is as thrilling as I hoped for, yet that sequence is nothing compared to the amazing action sequences that soon follow it. Maggie Q's big action sequence, involving an elevator shaft and a car is absolutely amazing. I really was on the edge of my seat during that sequence I couldn't take my eyes from the screen. And then a later sequence right near the end, which I cannot spoil because it really has to be seen for the full impact to register, just had me sitting back in awe. While there is a noticeable lack of blood they make up for it with huge explosions and great cool stunts. Sure Die Hard movies usually have quite intense violence, here we don't get that as much. Yet it never bothered me as it was so well made! <br/><br/>So now I suppose I have to talk about the one line millions of fans have been waiting to see whether it turns up in the movie. The of course legendary Yipee Kayay, so does it turn up? Yes it does, whether you actually here the last part of it though is debatable. I actually believe I heard it pretty clearly, others say you can't here it. But in my screening I'm sure I heard the last portion of it. There is a noticeable lack of swearing and at times it did irritate as I know that Bruce Willis must of been dying to see the big f bomb. But as a whole the action was more of a distraction for me and I personally don't think it bothered me too much. Die Hard 4.0 is too entertaining a movie to rely purely on swearing. The humour is generally great as well, I love the fact they don't take the movie too seriously. For every big lengthy talk on technological terrorism, we get a wisecrack from Willis that lightens the tone. The plot itself is pretty ludicrous, but the movie is just so well made you don't care by the end of it.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 is a movie that will hopefully spell the return of even more of these styles of movies. Its good to see a good old fashioned action movie that doesn't purely rely on special effects. This movie is my favourite of Summer 2007 so far, and I actually highly doubt it will be beaten. I highly recommend it, its fun, its entertaining, its mad, but most importantly its a Die Hard movie."

","After the huge array of really poor sequels I've seen recently (POTC 3, Oceans 13, Shrek 3) there is finally a sequel I actually enjoyed watching.<br/><br/>Ignore the many howling goofs that there are (like McClain hitting the guy with his car, him hitting a wall at 40+ mph with his back and getting up and walking in seconds).<br/><br/>This is good. The action doesn't go overboard for no reason (unlike Bad Boys 2) and there is a bit of a plot but not much. The story of the Cyber Terrorists could have been explained a little bit more in my view but thats just me.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is just a little bit too long in the tooth to be taken seriously as an action hero of this level and the blatant steals from Terminator 2 and True Lies were a tad annoying that they couldn't think of anything new themselves.<br/><br/>The film is maybe about 20 minutes too long and a few scenes seemed like they were added on as after thoughts to get the film to its 2 hour running time but generally the film is very watchable.<br/><br/>I give it a thumbs up."

","John McClane is back!!!! After being very skeptical of the PG-13 rating and voicing my displeasure about it on the IMDb boards, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie despite the PG-13 rating. The movie still had balls and was certainly a hard PG-13 film.<br/><br/>The movie had some wild and fun action scenes - the tunnel sequence was awesome - and it was a funny, edge-of-your-seat action film. It may not be as good as the first (or even the third film), but it is still a damn good ""Die Hard"" movie.

"hcreeve24","8","2","6","29 June 2007"," John McClane Saves the summer!
","Let's be honest, so far this summer movie season has sucked eggs. Though I throughly enjoyed Spiderman 3, I admit it was a bit overdone and I know a ton of people who hated Spidey's third outing. Pirates 3 was pretty good, but it was too long. The Fantastic Four 2 sucked out loud and every other big summer popcorn movie hasn't delivered what it promised, except Die Hard 4. I was and still am annoyed by the PG-13 Rating, and for weeks before the film opened I was calling it Die Kind Sorta Hard, but the film surprised me. The film I was sure would be a flaming turd turned out to be a fun, diverting, surprisingly clever 2 hours of pure joygasm style entertainment. There is no doubt the movie is flawed, the villain is a wimp, the plot is outlandish but slightly plausible, and there are massive plot holes, but the film still delivers. I have no doubt that if there had been any other character in this film but John McClane, we'd all be tearing this flick a new piehole, but we aren't because the character of John McClane is a winner and he saves this movie from mediocrity. I have no doubt without McClane this movie would be a 5 out of 10, but Willis and his alter ego elevate this material above standard and turn it into something sadly missing this summer pure entertainment. The movie is not a classic like the first one (the best action film of all time), in fact Die Hard 4 is the worst one of the series, and the fact I am still giving it an eight shows how strong this series truly has been. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank John McClane for once again entertaining the hell out of me, and heres hoping we see him again soon."
"Wintersnake","8","2","6","29 June 2007"," A worthy sequel to a classic franchise.
","Die Hard. A title that sums up modern action, with Bruce Willis as the godfather. Everything he has done later on has always been slightly in the shadow of Die Hard, and for better or worse, he will always be remembered as John McClane, inventor of one of the most popular one liners of all time.<br/><br/>That was 19 years ago. Two sequels later and fast forward to 2007, and McClane steps back to save the day. What begins as a normal routine mission to escort a hacker, ends up as a personal vendetta when they become under attack by crazed hacker Thomas Gabriel and his deadly but hotter than life Asian beauty Mai Linh, trying to fire-sell the entire United States, claiming they're doing the country a favor. Fire-sell in this movie, means shutting down everything that runs the entire country, from transportation, communication, power, economy, everything that is driven by computers. Magically by connecting various high-tech looking computers they easily bypass every single security system built and take control of the entire U.S computer system, which while being an entertaining plot demands a complete ""Leave your brain at the door"" attitude to accept.<br/><br/>McClane of course, is not the guy to just sit around and watch the country go to hell. After nearly being killed several times, he gradually closes in on the hackers and kills them back one by one. As he himself explains it, he does it because nobody else can. And honestly, you'll be hard to find anyone else managing to ""kill a helicopter with a car"" because he was out of bullets. <br/><br/>Along with him, he has Justin Long posing as hacker Matt Farrell. Long actually does a nice job here, and he was entertaining to watch. Slightly cliché with the typical ""Wussy who gets more and more confident until he becomes a man"", but that's not Long's fault. He respects Willis and McClane, and it shows. What McClane says, goes. He doesn't get McClane into trouble by stupidly doing things, he refreshingly helps out and assists without causing trouble himself.<br/><br/>While mostly being eye-candy, McClane's daughter has some nice moments as well, but seems to have fallen slightly victim to the script as well. Initially showing her disrespect and anger for her father, she still shows every sign of having been his deepest fan and following his footsteps. It feels a bit too contradictory and she doesn't quite work as well as she should, but it's a minor gripe.<br/><br/>The action is well balanced between various dramatic scenes of chaos as Gabriel shuts down parts of the U.S. Several scenes, including a overview of how the traffic completely crashes everywhere and a twisted montage of the U.S presidents telling their people that all hope is lost works great, and there are several other scenes that nicely demonstrate the chaos caused. If you're able to shut off the brain for two hours, it becomes a fascinating imagination of what could have happened if the entire country was sent back to the stone age.<br/><br/>McClane of course, is the fly in the soup. The bug in the entire system that causes everything to crash. That one single malfunction. And it is in those times, when McClane stops or halts Gabriels progress, that we find ourselves looking at the very same lovable Mcclane 19 years ago. The one that made Holly realize just who that crazy cowboy hiding in the building was, driving Hans crazy. The feeling is still there, and when the action is clever, witty and on a smaller scale, it works well, at times just as well as the original. The scenes between McClane and Mai belong to the absolute highlights, and he delivers some of the best lines in the entire movie, up there with the classics from DH1.<br/><br/>Several other scenes, including a blackout in a subway tunnel, a great shootout with a french acrobat and an absolutely brilliant, short sequence where he stands face to face with a generic bad guy and takes him out point blank will remain classic parts of the franchise from now on as well, and Wiseman proves that he knows how to direct action. Despite PG-13, the action is very, very tense, there's a lot of killing going on, the blood is kept to a more natural level(there's still blood, just don't expect any fountains or huge pools of it) and the curses fly faster than the bullets.<br/><br/>The only scene where the movie stops feeling like a Die Hard movie is the Jet sequence, a well done but impersonal, generic and overdone part which feels more like something out of Terminator 2 than Die Hard. It feels out of place, too long, too over the top to even fit in as Die Hard. McClane might die harder than anyone else, but that was one part where less would have been more.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the rest was top notch stuff, and I'm very happy that DH4 turned out the way it did. Looking at it now, it deserved to be made. It will fit nicely along with the three other movies, and in my opinion, surpasses Die Hard with a Vengeance which is no small feat. It captures the feel of the first two most of the time, Willis is in top shape and just his look caused the theater to go crazy. He doesn't even have to say anything to make it work, but when he opens his mouth in this one, it works even better.<br/><br/>Here's to Die Hard 5, Willis has already said he would be willing to do it. Lets just hope that Live Free or Die Hard dies hard at the cinema so that we can see him for one more round."

","(Very minor and mild spoilers here, but I don't want to take any chances as what's too much and what's cool w/ IMDb. Nobody likes being blacklisted.)<br/><br/>I was so happy when the ""Die Hard"" franchise returned after a dozen years and delivered a solid entry. You could tell they worked hard to make this one fresh and clever and original, unlike the rotten recent last one.<br/><br/>Though it finally goes over the top w/ CGI in the last big action set-piece with the truck and the Harrier jet, up to that point ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is loaded with impressive stunt work and hand-to-hand combat that is real and physical, while the plot taps into a very primal yet modern fear of our technology being taken away and turned against us. There's also that great video ransom threat using a mash-up of U.S. Presidents' speeches to deliver the terrorists' messages, which is truly original and funny and smart yet unsettling. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis settles right back into his signature role, earning both laughs and empathy with John McClane's mordant blue-collar sense of humor, and getting dirtier and bloodier and sweatier as the story escalates, taking a ton of abuse and showing pain and suffering but persevering. Justin Long is basically the Mac guy from the commercials transplanted into the ""Die Hard"" franchise, and he makes the perfect foil for McClane's very much analog sensibility. Timothy Oliphant is a worthy and formidable villain with twisted but just-a-little-bit sympathetic motives; he and Willis do a good job re-creating the cat-and-mouse connection over phones and walkie-talkies and video chats that the original ""Die Hard"" delivered so effectively with Willis and Alan Rickman (not that anybody's EVER going to be as good as Alan Rickman). <br/><br/>Not a classic, but a very solid three-star action movie, a worthy addition to the franchise, and probably the best of the ""comeback"" action flicks that have popped up over the last decade. It's really too bad that the good will inspired by this critical and box office success lead to the decision to churn out the quickie dud ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" which will likely snuff the franchise and end it on a very sour note."
"tobiasmjm","Null","1","2","2 November 2011"," Bruce is back, and not just with a vengeance...
","Our favourite punk-busting ex-cop has returned to the multiplex cinemas once again with yet another action-filled, gripping, 128 minutes of absolute edge-of-the-seat, quality film. <br/><br/>This time, John McClain (Bruce Willis) has teamed up with computer geek Matt Farrel (Justin Long), who has wrote and distributed a code to take down all of the USA in a fire sale; Bruce and co are on a mission to bring it the code back down and save the country from complete destruction. <br/><br/>Len Wiseman is the mastermind behind the film: He worked as a screen writer, as the director of the film and presumably also lending in a hand with the countless props used. And he could well be one of the top directors in the new market, considering this is just his third film to direct he certainly has some major talent. Born and raised in California, Len started his career in the props industry, creating props for the likes of Godzilla, Men in Black and Independence Day until his talent was recognised and he was born into the world of a director. <br/><br/>So Willis seems to have given the good's yet again in the spectacular, fourth of the series of movies, not letting his ever growing age show a sliver. All of his vehicular mayhem has definitely not been spared as Wiseman went to the utmost extremes to create some of the most fantastic displays of CGI that has been seen for a long time - The tunnel scene and the F35 scene the two most prominent flags of this. Yes, we knew they were fake. But it fitted in perfect. <br/><br/>Although one part of the film particularly clicked with me in that during Willis' chaotic game of cat and mouse, he stumbles across a cleverly composed message, made of clips of words that presidents have said over the years, ended by 'live' footage of the Whitehouse exploding, at which point everyone rushes out onto the street in this fantastic zenith, and thankfully, Wiseman has managed to not have a nadir in his film – This being rather uncommon these days. <br/><br/>One of the most alarming things that this film says to us is that this could really happen, and after the film is finished the sudden realisation of that a fire sale could really happen is rather disturbing. <br/><br/>One of the things I loved about this film is that it didn't stray from them comfortable conventions that surround the world of action movies nowadays. Rather than being clever, it gave you exactly what you wanted; it gave you a high-paced, gun firing, bomb-blowing film. <br/><br/>So Mr Lee Wiseman has thankfully managed to round off the Die Hard series with a fantastic end, unfortunately, it doesn't look as if there will be another Die Hard, at least in the near future anyway and you know what I think about that – Yippi-Kay-Ay Motherfu...."
"fidelio7","6","1","2","19 January 2011"," 'That's gonna wake the neighbours'
","I must admit to being pretty worried when I found out that Len Wiseman was directing 'Die Hard 4.0' AKA 'Live Free or Die Hard'. His all-style-no-substance 'Underworld' films were awful; very flashy yet totally empty. So I came to the fourth 'Die Hard' installment with quite a bit of trepidation.<br/><br/>I need not have been concerned, because 'Die Hard 4.0' is a solid piece of action entertainment which really delivers the goods. It is thrilling, funny, and offers action set pieces which are truly breathtaking. Witness the scene involving the four-wheel drive and the elevator shaft, in which the seemingly indestructible Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) does battle with the deadly Mai Linh (Maggie Q... great name, by the way!). A brilliant and innovative way to stage what might otherwise have been a very ordinary fight sequence. And then there is my favourite bit, in which McClane, at the wheel of Thomas Gabriel's (Timothy Olyphant) mobile command centre - a massive eighteen-wheeler - goes up against a heavily armed F14 fighter jet. A huge chunk of freeway is completely destroyed in the ensuing mayhem. Classic! Bruce Willis' performance is perfectly measured as usual, and his John McClane is always humble and never smug. Justin Long offers good support as computer whiz kid Matt Farrell, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead proves a tough cookie as Lucy Gennaro McClane, John's daughter. Comic relief is provided by the always likable Kevin Smith, who plays computer geek Freddy 'Warlock' Kaludis.<br/><br/>This is the first PG-13 'Die Hard' but it never feels neutered or watered down. There are some tough fight sequences but hardly any coarse language. And you certainly do not sit there thinking, 'Man, I wish they would swear more!'.<br/><br/>'Die Hard 4.0' deserves its rightful place in the 'Die Hard' pantheon. It is a real crowd pleaser and the new director proves that he can deliver a thoroughly entertaining summer blockbuster. Thanks to Wiseman, the 'Die Hard' franchise is very much alive and well, and can still kick some major ass."

","The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis: This is the fourth in the ""Die Hard"" action series that centers on a New York cop who begrudgingly serves in the hero role against a highly organized criminal plot.<br/><br/>The Not-Too-Revealing Review: ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" succeeds as an action blockbuster and is undeserving of the usually accompanying adjective ""mindless."" The rough, tough, bruiser of a NY cop is still there, though now with some exploration of just what it is that makes him capable of performing his heroic feats. The stuck-in-the-80s McClane is juxtaposed with a technological world and the people - good guys and bad - that populate it. These and a few more thoughtful and even more subtle themes run through the film and give it a well-rounded flavor. Though mostly adequate justification is given for the appropriate suspension of disbelief, there were three scenes in particular that pushed it too far. For thorough enjoyment you have to overlook those moments. Typically the preface ""It was never intended to win an Oscar"" is used to give license to mind-numbing special effects and action drivel but not so with this ""Die Hard."" Make no mistake - this is an action film - 97% pure action - but the remaining 3% supplies quality character development that sets this action film apart from the standard. I highly recommend this to any Die Hard followers and anyone who enjoys an action movie."

","I have been under the impression that most of the movies coming out of Hollywood including the Indie ones were originals and not lifted from some other source.

In season 3 episode 7 which was aired in 2004 there is an identical situation where all the traffic signals turn green causing massive traffic problems accidents and deaths to thousands of bank accounts getting zeroed out. All this done by a security company based in Seattle, Washington.<br/><br/>Sounds familiar? Except for being adapted to US there is no difference. I am surprised no one else noticed this.

","i just saw the film last night,well lets start with the good. The scene where the helicopter is shooting at the main characters was awesome i felt moved almost as if i was there. OK the bad now. when the helicopter shooter shoots and destroys all the vehicle except wow! the main characters vehicle only gets a cracked windshield, OK i forgive them for this because that was the only part in the film which i felt like i was there. next so the main character drives the police car right into the helicopter while getting shot at by a high calibre machine gun, not believable. the list goes on. the main character is very injured but as the movie progresses he is fine. not cool. at least there should be a scene where he takes painkillers. OK so the scene of the Milford power plant, eh, soso next is: main character versus f35. that is just way too Hollywood and obviously computer animated. the ending was to abrupt main character appears shoots 2 men (poor computer geek) then after some dumb scenes of high hopes and lows: hes gonna win, no wait hes down, no wait the daughter moved a stunt and slides the gun towards him tennnnsssssssse, oh shucks the bad guy stops the sliding gun. i was ""come on bad guy shoot him finish it now!"" but that didn't happen i turned the TV off, good guys win, end......... right?"
"drunkbarbie","5","1","2","9 November 2009"," Disappointingly Average
","I had rather high expectations of this, being a big fan of the first three films and from hearing good reviews of it. Unfortunately I was left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed by how totally average and generic it felt.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong the film is entertaining, it's funny in parts and fast paced. Brucie does well with what he has, but looks too old for some of this stuff. Also I knew from the first 5 minutes what was going to happen; who was going to die, who would be taken hostage etc- it seems that the film industry has given up even trying to be different or to surprise the audience and are now playing up to our expectations.<br/><br/>Also for Die Hard film it is remarkably 'clean'- the fighting is stylised and clinical, not the feel of the other films (in particular the first 2) with no brutality or suspense to it.<br/><br/>It also flips from being incredibly stereotypical (over protective father berating potential suitor for daughter. Also computer mastermind living in his mothers basement- though Kevin Smith is still awesome...) to completely outlandish and unbelievable (the scene with the fighter jet was RIDICULOUS) In summary I would recommend that if you are bored and have a couple of hours free that this is an OK way to spend them- it's fast paced with lots of fighting and explosions, but for me the look and feel of the film were not 'Die Hard'; It reminded me in a lot of ways of 'Eagle Eye'."
"Sjhm","8","1","2","5 November 2009"," It works!
","I was surprised, to be frank, because I thought as some others clearly believe that this would be a sequel too many. However, it works. Perhaps it works best because there was such a big break between DH3 and this newest entrant. The world has moved on, but JM obviously has not, his previous exploits clearly mean nothing to a new generation who has never even heard of him. The theme is the same but this is now the age of technology and JM is as out of step with the latest technology as he is with his relationships. Thus he wreaks havoc with the plans of these junior villains, because he has already sidestepped their plans; and for him it is a simple choice of good and evil. JM's motivation is always crystal clear. He is out of step with life, in a world he no longer truly understands, he's lost everything, wife, family, he's barely connecting with his daughter. The heroism he's displayed as a cop has done nothing for him. But he still represents the forces of good, to keep order in an uncivilised world, and he does what he can with what he's got to keep that order going. He is the unstoppable force for which the terrorists have not planned, which they cannot understand, and who will ultimately prove their nemesis. Bruce Willis is pitch perfect in this role. Justin Long is suitably squirrelly as the nervous hacker who discovers his own courage. The pacing was good and the villains bad. What more can you ask for?"
"WesJones87","4","1","2","11 April 2009"," The more I watch it, the less of a Die Hard movie it becomes.
","I have defended this movie a lot. A HELL of a lot. People have said that it just isn't Die Hard, and I've argued back that it is. However, the more I watch it, the more I realise that it isn't.<br/><br/>The first three Die Hard movies were, with the exception of a few flaws here and there, EXTREMELY enjoyable movies (after re-watching Die Harder, I realised that I liked it more than 4.0). They have believable plot lines, believable villains, connections to each other and over-the-top, but enjoyable action sequences.<br/><br/>Then we get Die Hard 4.0. Not a bad movie, if viewed as a stand-alone action flick. However, it just doesn't fit in well with the Die Hard franchise. After viewing it several times, and after watching the first three, it feels like they took a WWE action movie script, and changed the names of some characters to turn it into a Die Hard movie. Basically, by doing this, they tried too hard to shoehorn it into the Die Hard franchise. Things like Lucy saying her name ""isn't McClane, it's Gennaro"" and the FBI agent called Johnson. It's as if the crew were trying to convince themselves as well as the audience that this WAS in fact Die Hard, not just a normal action movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences, even though I've said otherwise in the past, DO look cartoon-ish compared to the first three movies. When the jet-surfing argument came about, I was thinking about the fight on the wing of the plane in Die Harder, and thinking that it is just as unbelievable as jet-surfing.<br/><br/>Finally, we come to the villains. Hans Gruber, Col. Stewart and ""Simon"" Gruber are all captivating villains, and make you WANT to see them in a final fight with McClane. Tim Olyphant (I can't even remember the characters name off-hand) was really the worst casting choice possible for a Die Hard villain. Totally forgettable and made me wish that there was some other villain who was bankrolling his plot.<br/><br/>So, whilst I still enjoy the movie as a solid action flick in the vein of the Transporter series, if I try to enjoy it as a Die Hard, I just end up feeling let down by the filmmakers."

Well we have our newest Die Hard film in New York with our favorite hero having to protect a computer geek with the fate of the world in the balance. Only Bruce Willis and his geeky sidekick can take on the evil computer terrorists before they do their nasty terror thing.<br/><br/>OK this movie is waaay over the top. I mean like cars flipping through the air and ramming into helicopters and the many many explosions and gun fights. All that being said many of the complaints friends have made is ""I'm computer savvy and it is impossible to do any of the stuff in the movie with computers like they say"". Well I'm not computer savvy so I can believe it to be possible and that allowed me to enjoy the movie. Wizard magazine said it best in a letter written complaining about why spiderman's glove never gets stuck to his webbing when he shoots it. ""Suspend your disbelief!"" I mean you were willing to suspend that disbelief for all the near escapes all the times the enemy comes back from attacks that would kill normal people and you're gonna complain about a little inaccuracy about what people can do with computers? This movie is a fun action film but it is a fairly good addition to the Die Hard series much in the spirit of the previous films. Live on Die Hard!"
"Gambitt","5","1","2","10 November 2008"," Die more harder than ever
","In each Die Hard, the feats become more outrageous as the scope of the movie expands. Die Hard 1 took place in a single building. McClane walked barefoot over broken glass, jumped off exploding rooftops, and single-handedly took down a dozen armed henchmen. Die Hard 2 upped the ante by expanding the setting to an entire airport. Finally, in Die Hard 3, McClane had to race all over New York City to prevent a massive theft of gold.<br/><br/>In ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" the action takes place all along the East Coast. McClane hops all over the country, from NYC, to DC, to West Virginia, to Maryland. What worked in a single building in DH1 simply looks absurd and childish on a national scale.<br/><br/>In Live Free, a covert group of cyber terrorist takes over everything that can be hacked. In a blink of an eye, they take over traffic control, law enforcement communications, the stock markets, private corporate files, federal disaster alert systems, cellphone networks, satellite communications systems, and apparently ANY system that makes use of a camera.<br/><br/>The potential breadth and ease of such a cyberattack is already difficult to swallow for a skeptical audience, but the movie turns this leap-of-faith on its head by arbitrarily designating certain computer systems as ""closed circuit."" Yep, notwithstanding the power of these magical hackers (who by the way, can apparently infect your computer with exploding viruses), there are certain systems that can be accessed only by physically storming the facility with thugs toting guns. It's like how Superman's one weakness in the universe is kryptonite, which just happens to be under every rock in Smallville.<br/><br/>In DH1, McClane did his best to work with incompetent local police and the FBI. In Live Free, the entire nation is apparently handled by one man, an FBI director played by Cliff Curtis. Forget the President, the NSA, the CIA, the entire military. Those silly feds left the fate of the country of one man, who must always handle matters personally.<br/><br/>Disbelief permeates Live Free at the ground level as well. Maggie Q's character is apparently enhanced with steel reinforcements. McClane plows into her with a large SUV and slams her through about five walls. She emerges from the mess as lively as ever, ready to swap kicks with McClane.<br/><br/>Lastly, I don't think genius-hacker Justin Long used a single Mac in this movie. Should someone inform Apple of this harsh betrayal?"

"pyrocitor","8","1","2","8 May 2008"," Mindless entertainment of the foremost quality
","Despite frequent critical bashing dismissing such efforts as empty vessels for pyrotechnics, making a proper action movie does take a certain craftsmanship completely separate from the sort which would result in a quality conventional drama. Keeping that in mind, it would be difficult to dispute the claim that few films in the genre have demonstrated such consistently quality work bearing on such standards as the Die Hard series - in fact, it is debatable that the series helped originate the standard for ""summer escapism"" in the first place. Those familiar with the former antics of wisecracking cop John McClane will be thrilled to hear that Live Free or Die Hard, the fourth film in the series, exemplifies everything which made the first three successes. <br/><br/>The MacGuffin of a plot, detailing a computer centered widespread terrorist attack on Independence Day weekend is just sensible enough to give Willis some credulity in his rampant destruction, striving to save the day once again. And while the usual gaping plot holes, archetypal characters and clichéd situations are as prevalent as ever, and as usual both McClane and his adversaries rack up enough damage to kill an entire army singlehandedly without being significantly slowed down, but such concerns are for the most part besides the point. This is, after all a Die Hard movie, action fantasy at its foremost, where any plot hole can easily be explained away by an explosion or two, and director Len Wiseman certainly does not disappoint on the explosion front. Keeping things moving at a thunderous pace, the astronomical number of action or chase sequences easily makes for the most consistently action packed and flat out exhilarating Die Hard film to date. As would be expected, the action scenes are as usual the central draw of the film, and they live up to expectations formidably, delivering some of the most gripping, deliriously entertaining thrills seen in years - the sheer unapologetic destruction almost laudable in its blatant ignorance of common sense or decor. <br/><br/>Bearing this in mind, it is the slower, emotional scenes which really drag down the film the most. One would be hard pressed to find an audience seeing a Die Hard film for any heavy emotional introspection, and while an attempt at giving the characters depth is a nice attempt, with such a paltry script, such scenes would have done better being left out entirely if not rewritten, to leave room for more interesting scenes (or at least those containing explosions). Instead of adding emotional depth or poignancy to the film, soul-searching exchanges between McClane and his daughter or hacker Matt Farrell are almost laughable in their sloppily written cliché, and detract from the heart-pounding fun of the rest of the film. The musical score similarly wallows in cliché, though does prove similarly adrenaline pumping, and compliments the action well enough, without adding anything special. <br/><br/>As would be expected for such a film, performances are generally an afterthought, and while hardly as abysmal as they could have been, the cast generally fail to outshine the explosions they come into contact with. Reprising the signature role he could play in his sleep, Bruce Willis extracts every gruffly endearing iota from John McClane, wisecracking and slickly delivering formidable destructive onslaughts with ease. Justin Long suitably inhabits the role of manic computer hacker Matt Farrell, essaying the comic relief and 'civilian voice of reason' figure with aplomb. Saddled with most of the worst lines in the film, Timothy Olyphant makes for a rather drab villain, deprived of any real menace or merit apart from angry frowning. Fellow adversary Maggie Q excels in her action scenes but is given next to no character to work with outside of them, apart from posing statuesquely on occasion. As McClane's headstrong daughter, Mary Elizabeth Winstead does little to improve her weakly written part, but Cliff Curtis does his best, putting forth a quality performance as a harried FBI head of security. Watch also for an amusing Kevin Smith cameo as a laughably nerdy hacker.<br/><br/>Fans of the former three films will doubtlessly be drawn to the same unabashed sense of mindless destruction which made the earlier installments so shamefully enjoyable, and Willis back on the top of his game makes the ride a blast. While those seeking character development or sensible plots are clearly on the wrong track entirely, Live Free or Die Hard hits hard on every front which a Die Hard should - yippie-kay-ay!<br/><br/>-8/10"
"Bunuel1976","7","1","2","13 January 2008"," DIE HARD 4.0 (Len Wiseman, 2007) ***
","My tolerance for Bruce Willis only extends itself to when he portrays the seemingly indestructible Detective John McClane in the DIE HARD films – a role which, even twenty years from its inception, still fits him like a glove. His charismatic persona goes a long way in making this hopelessly complicated and yet often dumbly illogical blockbuster undeniably entertaining throughout its not ungenerous 130 minute running time; needless to say, the spectacular action set-pieces are practically innumerable, with each one taking pains to outdo its predecessor in grandness and incredulity.<br/><br/>I can’t hope to make head or tails of the plot for those of you who haven’t seen it yet: suffice it to say, it’s predictably tinged with post-9/11 paranoia in the villains’ bid to put America on its bended knees through the wizardry of a network of geeky cyber-hackers…or something. I have to laugh when in the 1960s, many Cold War espionage pictures were dismissed as incomprehensible, because today’s penchant for hi-tech hijinks and unspeakably technical verbosity in even the most unassuming of thrillers shows a total lack of audience-friendliness. Another puzzling trait in contemporary Hollywood movies for me is the fact that anonymous (often impossibly young) villains are chosen to face off against the formidable hero of the day which rather makes one wonder why it took the latter two-and-a-half hours and so many near death experiences to get rid of this unfailingly sore loser; this is certainly the case here since the main villain is played by an unknown actor, his character was fired by the U.S. government when his plans were deemed too ambitious for them and, worse still, is effortlessly upstaged by his female co-conspirator/lover Maggie Q (who eventually meets her demise in one of the film’s lengthiest and most impressive action sequences). Interestingly enough, Willis himself is flanked by a computer freak but his wimpering, stuttering schtick outstays its welcome; writer-director-actor Kevin Smith has a pleasant cameo as the hacker guru dubbing himself “Warlock”.<br/><br/>Although one is expected to suspend his disbelief in films of this kind, there were a couple of stupid plot-holes the size of Manhattan which bugged me no end: if the villain was a top official in the U.S. Security defense program, clearly bears a grudge against them for humiliating him and is actually enacting the very threat he proposed back then in the first place, why do the F.B.I. need John McClane to alert them to his identity? Besides, if the villain is so technologically adept that he creates ultra-sensitive security programs for the U.S. government, how come he needs a whole barrage of computer geeks to put his plan into action (which, naturally, also necessitates an assortment of armed-to-their-teeth henchmen to eliminate them once they’ve completed their assignment?)."
"petangi","5","1","2","16 November 2007"," Die Hard review from across the pond
","Disappointing largely after a decent beginning. I felt that they fobbed me off with car crashes and collapsing buildings rather than a smarter script and better support cast. The support cast were one dimensional and not funny or sympathetic although Matt Farrell came close. Computer jargon, button clicking and ice cold one-liners get a bit wearing after a while. They worked hard on keeping up the tension rather than try to mix the moods. I felt I endured the film rather than finding myself immersed in the story and the situation, like I was with Die Hard one and two. I really think that if I'm in the mood for a dose of John McClane I'll be getting out One or two or maybe even three but not this one. Sorry, a promising title but they seem to have milked this for all it was worth because of the previous three."

","The 'mistakes' in geography are fine and, at times, fun. Even the continuity is kind of what one would expect from a Die Hard movie, it adds to the charm and fantasy value. The hacking facts are superbly over our heads and as we are supposed to side with John McClane, then he doesn't know either; he just deals in his own kind of facts and actions. It's the master criminals intentions, which are difficult to follow, he seems, at first, to have vengeance on his mind, or the FBI/NSA allude to it: ex- employee thing. Later, towards the end, it is definitely money that he is after, but with just a bit too much overkill: if you destroy a countries financial base and structure.

","In the fourth instalment of the Die Hard series, John McClane is caught up in a wicked game of cyber terrorism when asked to transport young computer hacker Matt to the department of homeland security. After an assassination attempt on both men at MAtt's apartment, the conspiracy becomes reality as an elite group of cyber terrorists attempt to shut down America's computer infrastructure and bring the country to its knees. Their only hope is John McClane shooting the hell out of everyone, including logic, originality but sadly not cliché.<br/><br/>Whilst there is some fine action in Die Hard 4.0 to please even the most cynical of cinema dwellers, the definitive arm that shielded the Die Hard franchise from ham-fisted hokum has now unclutched itself from the franchise. In the original Die Hard - John McClane was an everyman. An ordinary schmo, who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is made abundantly clear from the first frame occupied by My Willis that McClane is now a walking monolith with god like tendencies, that no amount of criminal minds can figure out. In this movie alone our protagonist is thrown out of a speeding car, falls out of a jet fighter into a the back of a lorry taxi, gets shot at and walks through a whole host of things that diminish any sense of believability in the subject. It is credit then, to the film's hugely entertaining action set-pieces, that none of this bothered me to any great extent.

"lostintwinpeaks","4","1","2","12 September 2007"," So-so.
","Live Free or Die Hard (known here in Europe as Die Hard 4.0) is the fourth film in the popular Die Hard franchise of action films starring Bruce Willis as John McClane, a detective with the NYPD.<br/><br/>The first Die Hard appeared in 1988, a no-frills action-suspenser that was followed by 1990's Die Hard 2: Die Harder and 1995's Die Hard With A Vengeance. Both films were not bad as action films (and sequels in general) go. The second film suffered from being a little too similar to the first's premise, while the third upped the ante somewhat and injected some much-needed new twists and turns on a by then already-jaded franchise.<br/><br/>This new Die Hard comes nineteen years after the first and twelve years after the last installment. Bruce Willis reprises his role as McClane. No other previous characters reappear. Sadly, McClane's wife Holly (played by the brilliant Bonnie Bedelia) disappeared after the second film, and you miss Vengeance's Samuel L. Jackson. A lot of new characters don their Die Hard hats with varying degrees of success. Timothy Olyphant isn't bad as the villain (though doesn't hold a candle to Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons). Justin Long is Willis's new sidekick. And we meet McClane's grown-up daughter, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Long and Winstead put effort into their parts and seem to be enjoying the trip. They're nothing to write home about, however, just two more twenty-somethings indistinguishable from most of Hollywood's line-up of young, good-looking stars.<br/><br/>All the Die Hard films have been based on books or original scripts intended for other franchises (the first two were based on novels and the third was intended to be a Lethal Weapon film). This one continues in that vein, being based again on the written word, this time on a 1997 article ""A Farewell to Arms"" written for Wired magazine by John Carlin.<br/><br/>The film's storyline is about virtual hackers and McClane now up against a world he doesn't understand. Hence, his need for a new sidekick, Long's whizz kid computer hacker. To be honest, the plot isn't important and you don't really need to know it. Suffice to say, it's serviceable but no more. What really matters here is: how well does this film live up to its three predecessors? The answer is fairly well. In some ways it is the weakest of the series but, all in all, a night out  no more and no less.<br/><br/>The action is big, bad and bold (though sometimes very repetitive). There are no real surprises, sadly, and that's what I found most disappointing. Sure, McClane is subjected to many perils but you never doubt for one moment that he will survive any of them. The finale when it comes is a bit too quick, a rush job, surprising considering the over-extended battles in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>It seems a pity that, considering the article it was based on, the general paranoia of today's wired world, and the fact that this is the first post-9/11 Die Hard film, that more wasn't made out of the premise. With a bit more attention to the script and some retooling of the set-pieces, we could have had a much better film, something that not only thrilled you with its action but made you think. But that's not what these films are about.<br/><br/>My final comment on this is simply that it's not bad. If you like your action films loud and no-nonsense and you enjoyed the first three Die Hards, then chances are you'll like this one. The film is predictable to the extreme, however, so don't expect any surprises."

We loved the Die Hard movies in the past, and were happy to finally see a movie we could enjoy together, finally, hoping that our dollars would encourage more good movies in future.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was disappointing to see the ridiculous nature of a fighter jet attacking a truck - and losing the fight.<br/><br/>One of the reasons one watches a Die Hard type film is the clear good guy vs bad guy nature of the films. One clearly roots for the good guys, and is delighted when the ultimate demise of the bad guys is carried out - spectacularly.<br/><br/>Having our hero go up against an Air Force pilot forces us to root for or against a good guy - on both sides. It ruins the joy one might have taken in their defeat, no matter who loses.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that Hollywood does not get it. People need to care about the characters in a movie, and one needs to root for good over evil to truly enjoy the fight. Simply pitting two good guys against each other for a spectacular fight is not a good plot turn.<br/><br/>I wanted very much to love this movie, and was so hoping for a more upbeat movie, as the previous Die Hard movies had been. I can forgive over the top, but I'm sincerely disappointed by the depressing nature of the characters, and situations. John never wanted to do what he was forced to do in any of the previous movies, but he clearly enjoyed defeating the enemy, and we enjoyed watching him do it. This time, he was mostly just defeated, out of his element, and the bad guys were unrealistic, and tame. (Really? No terrorists - just computer geeks?)<br/><br/>I still urge you to go, to encourage more movies along this genre, but I sincerely hope Hollywood can get a grip on reality, and figure out how to make a movie with characters we can clearly root for or against. Life is not a bunch of grays, and there really are bad guys out there. We really need to hope there are some real good guys, too, and I'd like to see some in a well produced movie. Anyone Listening?"

","This movie is, indeed, about a man who is addicted to stopping things from exploding.<br/><br/>The problem started back in his youth when, at his 9th birthday party, a friend pulled a party popper next to his ear. McClane was severely traumatised by this and swore never to have ANYTHING explode ever again.<br/><br/>In this adventure, McClane must stop cyber terrorists from terrorising all things cyber. Their first target is Anthony Daniels, dressed as C3PO, who is appearing at a Star Wars convention. The terrorists are about to attack Daniels, clad in his cyber C3PO costume, but McClane arrives and shouts at them. They back down immediately and run off, sulking.<br/><br/>McClane chases them in cars and such and avoids a falling helicopter or two. He eventually stops them as they are about to explode something.<br/><br/>This movie is not as good as the '88 original, which had at least some sort of credibility and no C3PO."

The hero is bigger than life and so are the enemy.<br/><br/>Live Fast or Die Hard is out in DVD after its solid success at the box office. In every way this movie is focused on patriotism and principle of strong character in fighting evil to protect America and everyone's neighbor. No doubt the DVD will be as popular as the movie.

","I don't understand how it is being rated 8/10. I just returned from watching this movie and maybe I just wasn't in the right mindset for this level of cheese. It seemed like it was trying to compete with True Lies for action. The problem is True Lies was intended to be cheesy and never was intended or advertised to be even half-way realistic. At least the first 3 Die Hards had a glimmer of being believable. This one was way over the top.<br/><br/>The problems begin with the thought that a hacker could shut down and take over a country with a few strokes of a keyboard. Military communications and encrypted separately and in many cases disconnected from any computer. But wait, I know. It's Hollywood right? Then there is the action scenes. I don't know where to start, the F-35 or the car jump into the helicopter. Hollywood is great to a certain extent. This movie had a believability rating equivalent to Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>There were some good one liners, and a few moments of enjoyment.

"tobuildahome","5","2","7","6 July 2007"," Blurghh
","I'm kinda half and half on this film. It was entertaining, yet ridiculous. I'm not a computer whizz, but this was the fundamental aspect in the film, but the utilization of computers is really silly frankly. It just bugs me in films when there's a shot of a hacker on a computer keyboard typing really fast and then something amazing happens. However this is made believable by the use of the massive array of LCD monitors and flashing codes and ""security authorizations"". I would like to see anything of this nature occur in real life. It was just gobbledygook really.<br/><br/>I see what many people say about the comparison between this film and the 1st. The 1st one has this proper authentic feel to it, it is well directed, acted and timed. However this one was kinda that John McClain is just super lucky and which seems ironic considering that the main enemy tells him on his headstone he'll have ""Always in the wrong place, at the wrong time"". Without his ability to do this he would be dead with the first bullet.<br/><br/>Do you see my jist here, it just seemed that this film probably did have a long time in the writing and ideas room. However like others have said the cheap, sleek use of post 9/11 security. If the film was brought out at the same time as the first, it would of had no effect. It's the naive audience who will watch this and believe that this could occur, due to the high amount of computers and phones in today's modern life. Trust me this could never occur, it's just the over use of fast keyboard typing and LCD monitors that just ruin the villain and hero aspect to it. I dunno it just really bugs me. <br/><br/>Just how much can the human body take in this film, if you got hit by a 4x4 doing 50 or so, even if it did not kill you it would break your legs, but if you were not dead by then, I think being smashed through sheets of tough glass and then smashed into a concrete wall just might render you unconscious. <br/><br/>OK, the redeeming factors to this film are that it offers escapism, I enjoyed my self, however much I got annoyed at the silly technological or medical aspects of it. I wouldn't say it was a waste of money, it is not the director's, producer's or actor's fault that this film is mediocre, it's the current state of our society. I mean if films such as the first came out today, it's just another story in the news. I believe that the film makers wanted to make a statement that we are living in a vulnerable society, were we take technology for granted. The only reason people enjoy the first today is that it is realistic and a ""classic action film"" which laid the foundations for the Die Hard films. <br/><br/>So yeah I'm half and half on this film. It is completely ridiculous, but appealing to a more ""naive"" society. I enjoyed it to, a good night out, so yeah alright yet completely stupid."
"kowgirl_tina-1","10","2","7","5 July 2007"," wow, a little intense
","I know the Die Hard movies are action packed, but this one was enjoyably so. I took our 15 yr old son to see it, and was pleasantly surprised when he told me he liked it as well. With my son being involved in computer technology, the plot involving computer hackers really kept his attention. I kinda of liked the fact that the other actors are relatively unknown compared with the status of Mr. Willis. I do think the one scene with Mr. Willis driving the semi was a bit over the top, even with the CGI. The young actor who played the computer hacker that John McClane was protecting was excellent. I knew I've seen him somewhere..I looked under his profile and saw he was in the movie, ""Accepted"". I would definitely recommend this movie to any action adventure fan, and especially the Die Hard fans. It was an ""A"" in my book!"
"buddyrandom-1","6","2","7","2 July 2007"," what happened ??
","The villains in the first 3 die hard movies were somewhat believable mostly mercenaries, ex-military men who looked tough. In ""Live Free or Die Hard"" our bad guy is a twenty something computer nerd who happens to be a psychopathic, disgruntled terrorist bent on destroying society. The main villain looked too young and his crew of bad guys lacked personality and character. Another user commented ""Bruce Willis and Justin Long were a great team. They were as good as the 3rd Die Hard with Samuel L. Jackson"" Not a chance man!! give your head a shake. ""Live Free and Die Hard"" was average like 90% of the movies now a days .. the good ones are far and few between."

","I saw this two nights ago at a press screening in NYC. I have to say, this movie was so much fun to watch. Usually press screenings can be pretty dry, what with all the critics in the audience, but 3 or 4 times during the movie, the action got so intense, the sequences were so over the top, ridiculous and great that the audience bust out screaming and applauding. Sure, they were working in the confines of the series and sometimes it shows and sometimes you're wondering why Big Mac is 10 years older yet even more willing and able than in previous installments but that's easily shirked off by how gripping the action is. With a Vengeance is still, in my opinion, the masterpiece of the series but 4.0 is killer fun and delivers the goods unlike most of the other summer blockbusters that have come out so far this year. *cough* Ocean's 13 *cough* Spidey 3 *cough*"
"amf101","9","2","7","27 June 2007"," Live Free or Die Hard...Doesn't Die
","I just saw Live Free or Die Hard at the midnight showing at my local movie house. And while the theater was not packed (it was about fifty percent full) the film actually delivered. John McClane makes his return to the big screen, after a twelve-year absence, on a much more grand scale then we have seen him in previous films. The films central plot involves a countrywide shutdown of all its computer systems. The plot itself is entertaining enough, but lets face people go to a Die Hard movie for the action, and there is lots.<br/><br/>All of the action is over the top and absurd, but going in the audience is fully aware of that fact, and judging by the crowd's reaction could care less. There is a scene at the end of the film where a 52 year-old McClane is riding the wing of a harrier jet. He jumps off the trouble jet to a collapsed piece of freeway 60 feet below him and doesn't limp away, he just scowls and grunts and then gets up and walks away. Thats one of about 6 or 7 inane action related occurrences. But, nobody's going to the movie for realism, they just want to see stuff blow up.<br/><br/>Action aside, the movie does have its flaws. Most of them revolve around the films rating. Since the film was originally shot as an R rated feature it was heavily edited down to achieve a PG-13 rating. There a plenty of shots in the movie when you see McClain's mouth moving but the wrong words are coming out (kind of like a Godzilla movie), obviously covering his usual profanity filled tirades. There is not one single f- bomb in the entire movie; even his trademark line (Yippee-Ki-Yay Mother F**ker) is edited down. But hey, that's the MPAA for you. Hopefully the studio will release an unrated DVD witch should correct the problem.<br/><br/>Over all, the film is worth a look. It's not quite on the level of the first or third film, but it works as a decent entry to the franchise. The plot, action, and production value is all done well enough that the film plays just as well as any of the other summer blockbusters it's competing with. And while the movie may not find the audience it deserves (you can thank the studio for that, giving it a PG-13 rating) its certainly worth the money you pay to see it."

Now we get number 4. This is the best of them all. Get ready to Die Hard. McClane is back.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard is truly one of the biggest surprises of the year. After the first 20 minutes, we get to the action and it unloads a spree of off the wall, unbelievable action, and that was just the start. We get action and tons more to boot and any action fan will be satisfied beyond.<br/><br/>The plot is good. We got a group of people hacking and using their technology to shut down everything in the country at their command. They control almost anything from stop lights to Wall Street. They are a cunning group of people.<br/><br/>The Acting is great. Bruce Willis is fantastic. Forget any nay-sayers, he is great. What is even better is the dialog. The signature Die Hard attitude is here! McClane is still full of attitude. His one liners are everywhere and are clever and funny. Willis and Justin Long have excellent chemistry together and are terrific. We even get some attitude from Justin Long and Mary-Elizabeth Winstead. She is a fine young actress who is quite a treat.<br/><br/>The action.....well let me tell ya the action is truly there and up in your face! Die Hard 4 does not hold back on the action...ever. This movie is a action movie feast, and i'm stuffed, but definitely want seconds! <br/><br/>The Last Word: I Love this movie. One of the year's best.

"adam_evans14","5","1","3","27 January 2013"," 7.5 or something on here.Im really not seeing it
","Why didn't i like this film. I think its an accumulation of factors. To start with the plot just didn't seem very 'Die Hard'. Secondly the story of John McClane in my eyes had run its course and to bring him back again to me was just farcical. I think the original appeal with the character was that while Stallone and Arnie were constantly producing action films with surreal characters that were so hyper masculine it seemed cheesy and well...just not believable, Die hard offered something different. The character of McClane is the everyday cop who happens to have just been caught up in the middle of a mess and feels obliged as a policeman to sort it out. McClane appeals because he's realistic.<br/><br/>Granted with two more instalments it seemed unlikely of wrong place at wrong time would strike again which it did in Die Hard 2 (kind of why die hard 2 isn't really great either in my book), but with Die hard with a vengeance being about revenge i also accepted this. To become embroiled again just isn't believable.<br/><br/>Moving back to my point of Die Hard being realistic in comparison to Rambo, whose destruction of a hundred soldiers with a machine gun single handedly is farcical, Die Hard 4.0 (why not just 4...why the point O at the end. 4.0 is 4...lord knows. This annoys me) demonstrates McClane taking out a helicopter with a car (at will mind...he could do this a hundred times and in his sleep) and muttering ""i was out of bullets"" as though its no big deal. I've seen this film once and as i sit here writing this review i think it was around 2 years ago, maybe longer, but from what i can remember; Die Hard 4.0 (remember when they release die hard 5 now, they have to put the point 0 at the end so that it makes sense and is avant garde)...Not for me thanks."

","If you're into effects-driven action and unwavering heroes with hairy chests, then Die Hard 4.0 will be right up your street. Brainless fun where helicopters are taken down by running cars up an improvised ramp (made out of cars) and computer software makes chirping noises like a teletype. It's a Bruce Willis movie, so you can't really complain about the lack of realism. His co-stars -- Tim Olyphant, Justin Long -- are remarkably good. My only real regret is that the unique premise of the Die Hard movies has been scrapped. In the original run, John McClane is an antihero who just wanted to pick up a pint of milk at his local 7-Eleven (or something along those lines) and then got engaged by international terrorists, a fact which he bitterly and repeatedly contemplated throughout the rest of the movie. That stance made the series so unique and so much fun to watch. To bad it evaporated."

","Much like the Star Wars Prequels and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Live Free or Die Hard, or as I'm just going to call it, Die Hard 4.0 got good reviews from critics at the time of it's release, but fans were a little more cynical. Now this is a review of the theatrical version, I'm not sure how the unrated version differs, but I would like to see it one day. Now Die Hard 4.0 is my least favorite in the series, but that doesn't mean it's bad, it just means the other three were better.<br/><br/>I think the reason this is my least favorite is, and I know I'm going against all that I believe it, that it was made in the 2000's. One of the things I loved about the first three was that they had a certain charm that you can only get in 80's and 90's movies, like a cheesy feel. But there are a few other problems I had, the main villain was only OK, Justin Long was a bit annoying at times. Like I said, I saw the theatrical version, so maybe I'll like the unrated version more because it just doesn't seem like John McClane unless he swears more.<br/><br/>Now while I wasn't a huge fan of the main villain, I actually really like his evil scheme. A lot of people probably hate it because it's about computers, but I actually really liked that whole aspect. Also his Asian sidekick was awesome and way more threatening than he was. It's funny, and the action scenes are really good, not up close and shaky like some other modern action movies. And I'm not sure if the effects were practical or CGI, but if they were CGI, than it was damn good CGI. And of course Mary Elizabeth Winstead was hot, and great. And John McClane hasn't lost any of his charm.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 may be my least favorite in the series, but it's still an enjoyable flick. Maybe I'll like it more if I see the unrated cut."
"fredericksmith1952","10","1","3","26 March 2012"," Twelve years have passed and the franchise proves just as viable as it ever was.
","Twelve years have passed and the franchise proves just as viable as it ever was. Talk about enduring star quality. Bruce Willis is just as flippant and entertaining as he was in Die Hard, still a cop, still in New York (although there was that brief stint in LA), and still fighting with the women in his family, this time with little Lucy Generro, who has grown into a very attractive young lady. The symmetry of the characters is perfect, and Wiseman certainly knew and understood the passion of the Die Hard films (at his age, he probably grew up watching them, he was 15 when the original came out). Justin Long portrays the cyber nerd Matt Farrell, and he does an excellent job in recreating the foil for McClane's character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was certainly the right actress to portray McClane's daughter, as feisty and abrupt in the character as Willis. Timothy Olyphant is exceptional as the cyber genius whose knowledge of the computer systems in the government gives him the background to disrupt a nation. Cliff Curtis is great as the FBI Deputy Director of Cyber Security, and adds a wonderful facet to an otherwise typical role as the law enforcement officer who always seems to be at odds with McClane. Since John is more proactive, he is always a step behind, but at least he reacts more quickly once he sees the problem. The plot moves at lightning speed in this latest (last?) installment of the franchise, and the action is exceptional. Rated PG-13 for violence and a brief sexual situation, this film is a wild ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Absolutely collectible for the set, and for any fan of great action films."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","9 October 2010"," Die Hard for a new, more juvenalised, generation of American action genre movie goers which offers little more than surface thrills and blunt nostalgia.
","John McLane's calm demeanour greets us on the poster for Die Hard 4.0, as sparks fly; chaos unfolds and all Hell breaks loose around him, his pained but calmed expression is a measure of where the man's been and how far he's come since first encountering a hostile situation alÃ¡ of the above. It's a feeling that resonates in the film, we've been here and done this in films not limited to the Die Hard series; that unfortunate and frustrating sensation that the franchise has now been limited to a bankable actioner call-upon feeling ever prominent as 4.0 gradually rolls towards its inevitable conclusion. The Die Hard series, particularly the first, was always about McLane being in the wrong place-at the wrong time, with this idea gradually becoming less and less prominent as, particularly by the time of number three, we saw McLane being used more and more as an action lead ever dependant on being in the right place-at the right time. Here, we are ever-increasingly reliant on McLane as an action lead who is engineered to further plot and maintain his ability to be in the right place and the right time. If there was a time to momentarily weep for the Die Hard franchise, it's here but if ever there was a time to meekly appreciate a well enough made actioner, then it is here also.<br/><br/>I read that director Len Wiseman grew up on the original Die Hard films, going so far as to produce his own amateur Die Hard films as a teen with home-based cameras. He wisely refrains from attempting to go above the first Die Hard; a visual demonstration of this evident in McLane's ploughing through a Nakatomi Plaza style room whilst in a vehicle so as to defeat an enemy in what is a sequence driven more by spectacle and basic action infused thrills than what might have happened in the first, where vulnerability and fear in the lead was more omnipresent. Wiseman instills a certain sense of the building doubling up as that Nakatomi high-rise in having Mclane engage in a fight on the stairs on the way up, one of which is eerily reminiscent of his coming together with Karl's brother in the first.<br/><br/>Wiseman's film is littered with that unprecedented sense of nostalgia; nostalgia which almost certainly resonates within both most of the adult watching audience as much as it is the director himself. While the undeniable sense of pleasingness in observing Willis doing his thing, in a vest, charging around and thwarting terrorists in the process is an unmitigated joy, the question as to what is the point remains. Where the first Die Hard held up the proverbial mirror to both the action genre and the action lead; the fourth film is all too happy to conform to generic expectation, the shark well and truly air-bound by the time McLane is sliding down a fighter plane after having out-driven it in a large truck before picking himself up; dusting himself off and consequently ready for the next episodic fight scene.<br/><br/>The joy is in the nostalgia, and observing a rather basic narrative of heroes and villains duking it out amidst explosions and action; it just so happens this particular episode of good and evil having a right go of it has Willis' John McLane involved. The film revolves around McLane and a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Long), whom he is charged with protecting, following a hacking into the U.S. government's mainframe and the suspicious eliminating of several other hackers capable of executing such a stunt. For grizzled veterans of the series, McLane is your man; that sense of juvenalisation settling in on the Die Hard franchise evident in the inclusion of Farrell whom is for those new to the series and in need of someone young enough and fresh faced enough to identify with. A minor distinction is made early on between the two of them regarding the sorts of rock music they like, with McLane more inclined towards 'classical' orientated rock whereby Farrell's tastes are that of the awful grungy, 'hard' rock we hear him listening to when first observing him.<br/><br/>Their plight involves a disgruntled American computer wizard named Thomas Gabriel (Olyphant), whom once worked for the American government, but now aims to work against them in holding the nation to ransom for a large sum of money - in the immortal words of McLane himself ""All this for a robbery!?"". Olyphant appears to channel Die Hard 2's chief antagonist Colonol Stuart in his mannerisms and behaviour, the tale of his team of technological experts holding a mass amount of people to ransom as the technologically defunct McLane gets stuck in the middle lifted straight out of said sequel. His cold, harsh blues are in stark contrast to McLane's more normalised hues when they face off over a web-cam and one point in which he will call one of his minions only to have McLane answer back serves only to remind you of the time it happens in the first Die Hard; when a sarcastic McLane asks whether Karl and Hans are lonely. With immense technological power at his fingertips and an army of, oddly, French mercenaries at his disposal, he's most certainly acts as enough of a threat. Director Wiseman's references towards the earlier entries is somewhat incessant, his referencing goes down awkwardly at times and even spills off away from its nostalgic purpose into the primary strands of the film. This is particularly evident towards the finale when McLane's prior estrangement from a family member in his daughter Lucy (Winstead), rather than wife Holly, drives the denouement thus consistently reminding us of the first film. Here, much unlike her mother, Lucy is just a pretty face that needs rescuing; something that only aids in illustrating how much the first Die Hard was actually about something. Here, a lot of that has gone and the result is somewhat frustrating."

","Die Hard 4 .... welcome back to the somewhat classic action movie. From the technical perspective (audio dubbing, writing) it simply isn't that good. In fact, anyone (Bruce Willis himself) that claims this film isn't hindered by studio PG-13 rating is kidding themselves. The dialouge takes a serious hit because of it and I think this is one example where strong language is important and needed. <br/><br/>Kevin Smith slows the film down in his rather sloppy acting performance. And the film, doesn't really feel like a ""Die Hard"". But it should be noted that I disliked the third film of the series. Mainly for the obvious tacked on ending and the fact that it didn't put John in that ""tight"" spot. Here, in this fourth installment, the ending isn't tacked on but it's also not even thought out, either. <br/><br/>Call me a purist, but for me a villain has to ""die hard"". In the first outing, we got probably the best ending. The second, not too bad. The third film was el'stinkeroo, but this end..... Jesus titty fuckng Christ. <br/><br/>I think the writers here failed at bringing John full circle on this one journey. Consider this: After the run in with the F-18 and such, John should have understood that all emergency vehicles were lowjacked and one can pin point a location. Gabriel was driving a Hazmat truck and thus John had a chance at surprising the villain AND showing us that John has at least figured out how some technology works. So it didn't matter if John saw where the truck went. He just needed some tech support from a friend with a computer. Instead we are stuck with a rather lackluster scene where John simply turns his head and discovers the vehicles destination. That's just lazy.<br/><br/>Okay, those complaints out of the way... This was a fun film nonetheless. The actions scenes and putting John into one strange predicament after another works. It's over the top but in a good way. It's still a good film, but because of a PG-13 rating and problems mentioned, it falls a little flat."
"thefilmguy7","7","1","3","26 June 2010"," Die Hard or Die Soft?
","While I found Live Free Or Die Hard entertaining, I definitely think that the people behind the film lost sight of many of things that made the series special. Die Hard is like a brand name and like any brand there are certain things that people expect from it. <br/><br/>I know this is all old news. Countless people before me have complained about the PG-13 rating, the toned down language and violence and everything. There are far too many logistical issues like having Maggie Q get hit by a car and smashed into an elevator shaft with out a scratch. Also a big problem is the lousy music in this one. It was dry and boring. The composer utterly failed to capture the pace and excitement that has become a trademark of the Die Hard series. The only times anything resembling quality music occurs is when the composer reuses themes from the previous films, but even then he fails to capture their original intensity. The film also relies too much on popcorn action when the original did a great job of building suspense. An example is the scene where John is trying to smash the glass to get Al's attention while two gun man come into the room shooting. John must get to Al before he leaves but forces are preventing him from doing so. This kind of suspense is totally replaced in the new film for typical brainless action.<br/><br/>These problems are more on the surface but the real problem rests deeper. Die Hard was about your every day guy put into an extreme situation that forces him to become a hero. This guy is tough but at the same time vulnerable and human. Everything thing he did and survived through is unlikely but not impossible. In the new film, they have basically made John into a super human. He takes on a handful of people at a time, rides on the wings of jets, falls 50 feet scraping down a cement road, and all of this with just a few scrapes. In the original, John had a hard enough time just beating a few guys and he always came out of his encounters bloody. He never survived something that was impossible. By making him a super human we have lost the ability to relate with John and imagine ourselves in his shoes. Part of the success of the original came from the great job they did making John relatable and having the audience ask themselves what would they do in his situation.<br/><br/>Again, I did enjoy the film as a summer popcorn flick. It had some great stunts and action set pieces. It was good to see Bruce Willis back in John McClane's shoes. I'd even say that it's better than most of the action crap coming from Hollywood lately. As a typical action film it's not bad, but as a Die Hard film it is disappointing. Though the unrated version corrected some issues, most of the issues rest deeper in the narrative. I hope if they were to make another film that they might try analyzing what made the first film such a classic."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","3","17 June 2010"," Plenty of over-the-top excitement without losing the McClane factor
","It had been 12 years since John McClane (Bruce Willis) last stopped a criminal mastermind's mass terrorist plot and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" tries to make up for every single one of them. John drives three pedestrian cars, a police car, a mack truck and flies a helicopter; he survives at least three long-distance falls and outruns two or three explosions; he saves two lives (including someone close to him) and kills at least a dozen. Well, that last bit was at least expected.<br/><br/>The long-awaited fourth Die Hard film delivers on the explosive and inventive action fronts like any solid action film, especially one in this beloved series, ought to. Director Len Wiseman (""Underworld"") proves he can handle the challenge of a mainstream action flick with ease and considering ""Live Free or Die Hard"" teeters on the edge of preposterous throughout its run time, the fact that he grounds any of this in realism warrants applause.<br/><br/>Mark Bomback and David Marconi's story runs terrifically at full speed, though it is fairly obvious that the script had to be tailored for the likes of John McClane. The cyber-terrorism plot of hackers controlling all the major networks and servers in the U.S. and playing with traffic signals and interfering with police communications is not the first premise that someone writing a film for an old school hero such as John McClane would conceive. I was not surprised to see Marconi's name on the story as the film was highly reminiscent of his 1998 thriller ""Enemy of the State,"" one of the first of what are now way overdone ""techno- thrillers."" <br/><br/>The story has McClane working for Homeland Security and investigating a hacker name Matt Ferrell (Justin Long) after it appears someone has messed with the department's network. Here is where John finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time yet again as someone's out to kill Ferrell. Much like Samuel L. Jackson's role in ""Die Hard with a Vengeance,"" Long gets to be the baggage to play off of Willis and also provide some sense of freaking out seeing as McClane has no reason to do that anymore.<br/><br/>Much of ""Live Free"" models itself off of ""With a Vengeance,"" not necessarily a poor choice considering that film was equally as exciting as far as pacing and action quality. Timothy Olyphant as the criminal mastermind Thomas Gabriel at least has a bit more practical motivation for his crime than Jeremy Irons did as Simon Gruber. In this film, McClane finds himself in the mix rather than the actual target partly a byproduct of making this script a Die Hard film rather that building one from scratch.<br/><br/>Olyphant is solid as a villain although it certainly takes a bit of time to take him seriously. Colorful villain is probably not his strong suit but its nice to see him in a lead. Long works well as a balancing act for Bruce. He's one of few in his circle of comedian buddies that appears to have what it takes to cross into other genres and both play the lead or a character role.<br/><br/>At times, ""Live Free"" is like getting repeatedly hit by a car and not dying (which happens to at least two characters), but Wiseman clearly understands that McClane's character (and all the characters for that matter) is most important in a Die Hard film. You simply can't hinge everything on the action. No, the movie doesn't evolve John as a character in any way, but it doesn't suck him dry of his humanity either, even if he should've died at five different points in the film. Yet again, that's the Die Hard shtick, love it or leave it.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

I loved that he has a new partner where the comedy mixes really good with the action just like the third movie. Although, I honestly thought that Samuel L. Jackson was a better and more funnier partner to John McClane but Justin Long proves worthy. I'd have to say that two of my favorite scenes are where John and Matt head to Freddy's a.k.a the warlock house and they have a sarcastic dialogue throughout about his basement and his posters. Over all the action is great, the comedy is good, and this is a great action film as well as one of the best films in the series."

","John McClane after being tasked with escorting a young suspect becomes entangled with a team of cyber terrorists who are holding his daughter as collateral.<br/><br/>Underworld director Len Wiseman directs the fourth instalment of the Die Hard film series. With a story line that over focuses on today's technology reliant world we live in, 4 is still an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>Almost everything is there, witty one-liners, great action scenes, however, like the third it lacks the 'connection' to the first two films, even though it includes a picture of Holly Gennaro.<br/><br/>Marco Beltrami score is fine and despite Willis getting on in years he puts plenty of life into John McClane. Cliff Curtis is excellent as FBI Deputy Director, action starlet Maggie Q is magnificent and the supporting cast include Kevin Smith and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Justin Long however appears out of place and possibly miscast.<br/><br/>Redeemably Timothy Olyphant's bad guy Thomas Gabriel is perfect. He's calm and less animated than some stereotypes. I feel that without Olyphant's performance and Willis efforts the film would have been less fun. There's some 'free running' action and the effects are great, but the jet scene was an unnecessary piece of superciliousness. In addition, it feels preachy, McClane's son is nowhere to be seen and the end feels very rushed.<br/><br/>Yeap, it's a mixed review, certainly watch for Olyphant's performance, Wiseman's slick direction and Wilis as his best character. Don't expect too much and no doubt you'll enjoy."

","At first glance you kind of say ""A new Die Hard, 12 years after the last, why?"". When I watched this film I felt that way, but quickly I began to enjoy it. There was an interesting plot- more interesting even than the first two Die Hard films. The characters were interesting. The villain was well written and played well- the problem with Die Hard 2. The action sequences were played out to a modern audience but underneath there was still this old-school cop who wasn't fully tuned into this modern world. Unfortunanely it did descend into some action scenes that were stupid even for a Die Hard film and seemed to build to a climax and then not really go anywhere. Still fairly enjoyable though."

","Hi All, I'd like to establish, that I am a sucker for all kinds of movies, I just enjoy relaxation watching any, but I never lost my taste for unique titles, such as this one...<br/><br/>Must say, in this Media affected world it is really hard to come up with a sequel, yet with a 4th instalment of a movie to seriously grab attention...! As far as I am concerned only a few franchises made it this far, like Aliens, Lethal Weapon and this one... We all have our likes and dislikes about these series and the more we watch, the harder we find them energising enough to say ""yeeeeeyyyyyy"",,, This Movie in my opinion was a fantastic comeback, Willis playing McClane better than ever, thanks to introducing him to human interaction with the new young ""attaboy"" Justin Long, the movie just tied me to the chair... Realism?! Come on, fans of the series must already have forgotten the meaning of the word... Wiseman as director before the release had me questioning, but after watching, he definitely had me on his side... Underworld might not have been a public magnet, but his attention to details already were bearing fruit in those movies as well, regardless to whether you enjoyed those films or not, and that kind of focus perfectly presented itself in DH 4.0! I have been guessing after watching DH 3, where else could the series take direction and this movie was an ""in my face"" experience, with all the action, humour and fun escalated to a whole new level in this movie...

","When I first caught wind of plans for Die Hard 4, I was skeptical. By the time a #4 for any series comes out, the series has long run its course. But then I went to see Die Hard 4 (or Live Free or Die Hard, as I prefer to call it) at the theater, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not because it presented any major turning point in the film industry (which every major critic out there seems to expect out of every movie that comes out), but because it took an old hero and an old series, and gave it a serious tune up. Bruce Willis returns as NYPD Detective John McClane, now many years older, many hairs shorter, and much more worse for wear. He's divorced, he's borderline alcoholic, and his headstrong daughter Lucy (played admirably by Miss Mary Elizabeth Winstead) doesn't want anything to do with him. On the eve of Independence Day weekend (note that the series has entirely broken away from the Christmas eve setting), McClane is called on to handle a routine arrest that spirals into a plot to overthrow the infrastructure of the United States, headed by the disgruntled and ruthless NSA agent Thomas Gabriel (cold played by Timothy Olymphant) and his calculating team of hackers and special ops mercenaries. With the sarcastic hacker Matt Farrel (portrayed well by Justin Long) as his reluctant sidekick, McClane has to do his hero thing: stop the terrorists before their 'fire sale' takes hold. As a whole, LFoDH is good. While the basic premise of one determined cop taking on an entire team of terrorists still remains, it's been updated. Gone are high security vault robberies, plane hijackings, and gold bullion stores of old; the war's technical. Yet at the center we have McClane, perfectly described by Thomas Gabriel as 'a Timex watch in a digital age'. He's a little out of his element, thats true, but it serves only to portray a more vulnerable side of him. He's not Terminator, he's an average Joe unwillingly put into the hero position. Providing emotional balance are Justin Long's Matt Farrel, McClanes hacker partner who is more adept at typing keys than duking it out with terrorists, Timothy Olymphant's Thomas Gabriel, the disgruntled NSA hacker looking for his rightfully earned back pay, and Mary Winsteads Lucy McClane, almost a reincarnation of the original McClane himself (albeit, tempered by female attitude). The acting is delivered well, to cut it short. The action scenes are great, with McClane taking on a team of parkour trained mercenaries, a helicopter, and even a military jet. The cinematography, while not anything to write home about, is still worthy of the film, and overall, LFoDH has exceeded any and all expectations. Take my advice, and see this film. It is a more than worthy sequel to the action packed Die Hard franchise"

Bruce Willis returns at age 52 as John McClane and the characters is as wit-cracking and believable as ever. Timothy Olyphant did a fine job as the terrorist in charge.

","Even though I've watched all the movies at least five or six times(including this one) I still don't consider myself a Die Hard fan. Furst movie was great, a true classic, Die Hard 2 is pathetic as a sequel(did they really expect us to believe that John Mcclane just happens to stumble on to pretty much the same situation, identical to Nakatomi Plaza?) The third is my personal favourite, it had the least to do with the first two(no Christmas, John isn't trapped in a building with vents and etc.) and that makes sense, because the point of these movies is to show just how hard John Mcclane can die. The third, by my opinion, was the best of the Die Hard series. Until now. Until Die Hard 4.0. John Mcclane never dies. Willis, of course, is superb in the role, that he was probably born for - like Harrison Ford was born for Indiana Jones. We've got jokes, we've got ""Yippee ki-yay, ***********"", and we've got one of the most brutal dyeing's in the series - he fall's off cars, fighters, buildings, get's shot, kicked and punched and it's all so dynamic, that at the final scenes I was surprised to see just how much Mcclane got his ass kicked in this movie. Still, it's nothing compared to the amount of butts he gets to kick. We've got cyberterrorism on the loose in the USA, with a villain so cunning and devious, you could put a tale on him and call him a weasel. Throw in a Asian chick, who likes to kick people, a rather annoying young hacker, some helicopters, an F-35 strike fighter, John Macclane, his daughter and a ""Yippee ki-yay, ***********"", and you get Die Hard 4.0 - don't miss it!"

","With action films and their aging stars back on the rise thanks to Sylvester Stallone's recent franchise resurrections in ""Rambo"" and ""Rocky Balboa"", it seemed only natural that Bruce Willis take John McClane out of a twelve-year retirement for a ""Die Hard 4"" -- or ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" -- even if it means being hindered by a careless studio and a ridiculous PG-13 rating. Surely twelve years is a long time, long enough for a new generation of action fans to be spawned who are offended by some flesh-wounds and f-words, right? <br/><br/>All fan-boy venting put on hold, ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" isn't as horrible a film as it was set up to be. Despite the fact that Bruce Willis is the ONLY person to make a return to the franchise and it's obvious that 20th Century Fox wanted to make a cheap hit, it kind of worked. With director Len Wiseman (""Underworld"") at the helm, this fourth installment in the once-great ""Die Hard"" series is simultaneously consumable by today's audience and somewhat gratifying for those who remember McClane's glory days. It doesn't look like a Die Hard film -- heck, it barely even feels like one -- but Wiseman injects enough freshness to make it, at the very least, an entertaining and visually pleasing affair. Bruce Willis returns to the title role, and what can be said about that? The role of John McClane is so ingrained in him at this point, that all he has to do is show up, be Bruce Willis and the job is done. This time around, McClane is matching wits with a terrorist (Timothy Olyphant) outcast from the U.S. government, and Hell-bent on pulling a Tyler Durden and re-setting America's system. Justin Long plays a hacker caught in the path, and despite appearing mis-cast, actually benefits from a different role for a change and has a few exchanges with Willis that keep the movie fresh and give it that ""Die Hard"" sense-of-humor that is so sorely missed. Kevin Smith has a brief part as a super-nerd prepared for the end of the world and, in all honesty, nearly steals the show. Had they put Smith in Long's role and Long in Smith's, the film may have been the better for it, but I digress. The rest as follows is business as usual for a ""Die Hard"" movie. McClane proves indestructible, saves the day, so on and so forth. And would you want it any other way? <br/><br/>Despite the action being tamed down to accommodate the more conservative rating, it's still an engaging little affair. Not the best in the series, by any means, but certainly a fun way to kill a few hours with one of the best action heroes Hollywood has to offer. What the movie lacks in originality and story, it makes up for in it's style and in Bruce Willis' charm. A movie that is surely worth a rental, if not more. A solid action film is hard to come by, and despite it's short-comings, ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" will leave the action-junkie satisfied."

You have very intelligent, well-dressed, charismatic bad guys, John McClane getting more beat up and dirty as the film progresses (his distinctive white muscle vest is missing this time round) and thieves posing as terrorists. All of this is fairly familiar ground for the Die Hard movies; however, at no time does it seem unoriginal or clichéd, instead making you feel a little bit nostalgic as you enjoy the watching the unbelievable stunts interlaced with the odd sarcastic comments from the man himself, John McClane and his particularly sassy daughter.<br/><br/>There is the odd nod to the other Die Hard movies to keep the movie geeks happy.

"Slugclub25","10","1","3","14 February 2008"," My Opinion: Die Hard 4.0
","Die Hard 4.0 is the best out of all of the Die Hard movies. Great acting. Excellent story line. This movie has everything. Bruce Willis and Justin Long are just great. Tough Guy and Geek pair up for a superb movie. Funny lines. Virtual terrorists are conducting a Fire Sale and McClane with the help of a computer geek, Matthew Farrell, are trying to put a stop to these terrorists. The movie gets even better when the terrorists kidnap McClane's daughter, who has the same temperament as her father. So McClane has a plan to get her back ""Find Lucy and kill everyone else"" Excellent acting and the stunts are amazing. The best action movie. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did."

","This is a movie that has me conflicted. Len Wiseman is a hack, no doubt about it. His direction is terrible. I don't think he added anything really to the film at all.<br/><br/>And yet there are several things that are at best very entertaining about this film.<br/><br/>In any case case, John McClane ( Bruce Willis) is back trying to stop a bunch of cyber terrorists led by Timothy Olyphant ( Deadwood) hell bent on taking down the country's computer infrastructure.<br/><br/>Olyphant, at times is good, but other times he's a little too wooden. This co-incided with a bit of a weak script at times (usually only when he only had one or two words to say), so I guess it can be forgiven.<br/><br/>If you want wooden try Maggie Q, she is fine I guess in all the stunts and physical scenes involving her character, but when she opens up her mouth and delivers her lines, it is all just terrible.<br/><br/>As far as the action, a lot of it is just too much. Is this really a Die Hard film? At times, it feels like it could be any generic action hero going around with trying to protect some computer hacker. This is where the film failed I think.<br/><br/>That obnoxious ""Spider-Man"" henchman who jumps all over the place, surviving fall after fall. Well whatever, hamster boy. McClane leaping off of a F-35? The fight scene between McClane and the character played by Maggie Q, in the elevator shaft? However, you still have McClane doing what he does best. Kicking major butt. In one notable scene he asks Olyphant's character if he has anymore henchmen left, considering he's messed most of them up and killed them, pointing out that he must have got them from ""1-800 henchmen."" And I'm also surprised Justin Long was only liked punched in the face once. And kudos's for casting Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy McClane. That's McClane not Gennaro!"

","...which is to say, Big Stupid Movie. Helmed surprisingly well by Len ""Underworld"" Wiseman, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" positions itself nicely as what will hopefully be a fitting end to one of the better franchises in Hollywood history. The action is almost non-stop; the production values are excellent thanks to the likes of production designer Patrick ""I am a man of many talents"" Tatopoulos, and art directors Beat ""Star Trek"" Frutiger and James ""Polar Express"" Hegedus; Simon ""I, Robot"" Duggan's cinematography is fluidly enervating, aided by Nicolas ""Terminator 3"" De Toth's precise editing and Marco ""3:10 to Yuma"" Beltrami's fine score. I don't think anyone can argue that the $110mil budget was frittered away, unlike the more recent disappointment, ""I Am Legend."" Acting-wise, our sturdy Bruce ""no longer moonlighting"" Willis hero, John McClane, is in fine form, albeit a dozen years more grizzled and world-weary. Some fans have complained that he's not the same McClane, but I wonder why anyone would expect that after more than a decade since his last brouhaha. People change over time, and I have no problem with fictional ones doing the same. They'd be boring if they didn't. Of course, this McClane has the usual cartoonish ability to avoid bullets and survive bone-breaking falls and beatings, but with the exception of the first film (to some extent), that's par for the course, especially in this age of video game indestructibility. ""LFoDH"" is still, after all, a BSM.<br/><br/>Timothy ""Deadwood"" Olyphant may not measure up to the steely menace of his predecessors, but acquits himself well nonetheless. Maggie ""Mission : Impossible III"" Q. is fetching as his butt-kicking automaton henchwoman. Justin ""Jeepers Creepers"" Long is surprisingly appealing as McClane's unintended sidekick, while Mary Elizabeth ""Grindhouse"" Winstead suitably apes her screen father's persona. The slew of baddies (where did Olyphant's uber-hacker hire all these guys?) and rasher of good guys acquit themselves as expected, with notably limber antics from stuntman/actor Cyril ""The Transporter"" Raffaelli, and some shameless paycheck-taking from Kevin ""I'm not really an actor"" Smith. All in all, a good time was obviously had by all.<br/><br/>Mark ""Godsend"" Bomback's screenplay may be comic book crap, but it serves its purpose, which is to showcase McClane's superhuman durability and dogged determination. Why would anyone expect anything else? Nothing will ever match the original film anyway, at least not in my book, and if by some miracle something does, I'll be the first to admit it. Though definitely a big screen film, ""LFoDH"" translates well to video, especially in its unrated DVD form. Yippy-ki-ay, indeed."
"thebengalimafia-1","7","1","3","3 February 2008"," Pure Die Hard style entertainment for a new generation!
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back in pure Die Hard style entertainment! This time, John is paired with slacker hacker Matt Ferrell (Justin Long) on a non stop, action packed road trip (can't believe all that is in the same sentence) to ""get my daughter, kill the bad guys, and save the country!"" This Die Hard has all the makings of any other Die Hard film. An ex-government computer genius is using a three stage attack on America's computer system to shut down the country (called a fire sail). This is what makes it unique. As the villain (Timothy Olyphant) notes, John McClane is an analog cop in a digital world. The hackers are shutting down the country while trying to kill Matt Ferrell and they are watching his every step as he and McClane race around Washington DC. The movie was something like Enemy of the State meets Bad Boys II with Die Hard elements incorporated into the mix.<br/><br/>John McClane never changes and that's what the audience loves. He gets beat up, he bleeds, he barely escapes the jaws of death and at the end of it all he laughs it off. Add to this that McClane is trying to keep up with Ferrell, a young kid who's leaps and bounds ahead of McClane in the digital world, but has long ways to go if he wants to survive getting shot at. The two of them were much more entertaining than Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in the Bad Boys films.<br/><br/>There were some things in the film that got a bit annoying (not that it takes away from the film overall). FBI agent Bowman (Cliff Curtis) throughout the entire film walks around demanding things he needs from his underlings. The answer is usually in form of a guaranteed negative. Bowman follows up with, ""Get me some (fill in the blank), I don't care how!"" I can't begin to explain how many times in the film he does this. He's supposed to be some sort of big, bad FBI agent and he can't get anything done. He just yells at people like JJ Jameson to Hoffman (Spider-Man movies) to get something done but it's supposed to be serious, not funny.<br/><br/>The other downside is the villain Thomas Gabriel who is oh-so mangled by the likes of Tim Olyphant. I honestly think Olyphant is quickly becoming the worst big league actor in Hollywood, worse than Vin Diesel (and that's a tough position to beat). But who knows, maybe Vin Diesel will come out with some more of his long, drawn out, poorly acted, moronic action-garbage and beat Olyphant for the top spot as Hollywood's most terrible leading man. No one thought Ali could beat Foreman, but the champ still made a comeback, right? Overall, Die Hard 4.0 was summer action at some of the best it's ever been. I sincerely hope there is a Die Hard 5."
"rowain","8","1","3","30 January 2008"," Who would've thought a Bruce Willis action movie could still be so much fun?
","Yeah, it's not deep. Yeah, it doesn't really advance the world of film anywhere past what it was in 1980. And yeah, Willis is getting a little old for this #@$! (his words, not mine).<br/><br/>But guess what? You won't care! Die Hard 4 (as it might as well be called) is so much fun that you will be hard pressed to feel guilty for enjoying it.<br/><br/>First, the plot is actually decent. No, it's not GREAT, or original, or anything notable outside the genre of action movies. But it's pretty solid for what it is. With no glaring plot holes, it moves the movie along at a breakneck pace and opens up a little of ""oh my god, could it get any worse?"" situations. It adapts the Die Hard formula to the modern age very well, opening up several hilarious scenes with Willis trying to get acquainted with the idea of computers and technology. It was easy to see coming but the snappy one liners and balls to the wall Willis performance make for a few cheap laughs. It's often a little hammy, and fairly cheesy, but it's Bruce Willis and he's at the top of his game still.<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise comes with Justin Long as Matt Farrel. Originally, casting a nerdy computer hacker as McClane's sidekick seemed like it would be more annoying that entertaining, but Farrel's a great Yin to McClane's Yang. It helps that this seems like the exact sort of role that Long should be playing.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4 delivers. The action is constant and manages to top itself continually right until the end of the movie, climaxing with the ridiculous but still downright cool duel between McClane in a tractor trailer and a FIGHTER JET. It's just as over the top as it sounds but you'll enjoy every minute of it.<br/><br/>Watch the flick with an open mind. It's a summer action movie, through and through, but it's about the best we've had in quite awhile. Sometimes watching a movie just for fun is alright."

","John McClane's daughter is all grown up. Which makes her the perfect target for international terrorists. So when the computer systems of America (electricity, security and more) go under... John McClane must deal with threats both foreign and domestic! Justin Long joins the cast as a hacker who designed security systems for a variety of questionable groups, also inadvertently giving them access to the things he ought to have been securing. He seems a likely choice, being the face of the Mac on commercials. And he looks like a hacker (much smoother than he is in many other roles -- such as ""Dodgeball"").<br/><br/>Bruce Willis comes back in full force. The older he gets, the tougher he gets. I'd be more than happy for a Die Hard 5. (If Bond can have 22 films, McClane can have 5.) Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the love of my life and the entire reason I watched this in the first place. I wish she had more scenes, but for what she was given she did fine work. (Again, with a sequel, she could be more involved and fight the bad guys directly, you know?) Kevin Smith is what dropped this film from an 8 to a 7. I love Smith's work, especially his earlier stuff. But he's a horrible actor and here only plays a cheesy version of himself. So, boy, that's lame. A balding hacker in his mom's basement? Cast someone else or write it out of the script next time.<br/><br/>Quick thoughts: the cgi effects were okay, which shocked me. I thought they'd overdo it, but even the flying cars were acceptable. The pg-13 rating was very nice. You'd think a violent action film would need an R, but I think they squeezed R-level action into the PG-13. And last: are all computer experts ninjas? It seems to be skilled in hacking, you also have to be a black belt in everything.<br/><br/>Anyway, a great sequel and I am surprised to find myself saying so. Winstead, Willis and Long shine... get this one in your personal library."

Though the first hour or so the dialogue s pretty poor and lacks the cutting edge that the first two Die Hards did, its still engaging and tense, justifying the thriller genre.<br/><br/>Although Long's character can be annoying and extremely stereotypical of teenagers and computer nerds, he does bring a good feeling of tension and anxiety to the plot, which helps the story flow. Willis to is not at his best, especially in the first hour but as the stakes are raised and we are comfortable in the film's presence, do we see the real cheeky and smart guy John McClane that we all love with his smart and funny catch phrases. Not Willis' fault as there could have been more dialogue encoded during the first period to add a bit more humour and a light hearted side to McClane.<br/><br/>As with all action sequences there is always a question of realism in context. But these particular sequences involving planes, bridges, tunnels and warehouses are too enjoyable and tense to criticize.<br/><br/>The audience is kept guessing as director Len Wiseman provides spills and thrills at a regular basis with a mixture of medium close shots and a variety of other camera angles.<br/><br/>Probably the best action/thriller of the year, Die Hard 4.0 brings tension and excitement to a new level with fast cars, helicopters and explosions. Not a patch on Die Hard or Die Harder but a great and exciting thriller nonetheless."

","Wow! I was surprised when I saw this movie from the first time on DVD. I wasn't expecting anything in this movie, just another big budget Hollywood film with no story line and few gun fights but this movie was a lot more then that.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard (Die Hard 4.0 as its called in Australia) is really good and sometimes surpasses the original film in stunts and action. Even though they toned down the swearing it's still violent and the stunts blow you out of the water. Bruce Willis returns as the aging John McClane, Timothy Olyphant plays the ruthless internet con artist Thomas Gabriel, Justin Long plays the computer geek Matt Farrell and becomes McClane's sidekick in the film.<br/><br/>We welcome Len Wiseman to the Die Hard director list along side with John McTiernan and Renny Harlin. Len Wiseman should stick to action blockbusters more then Vampire Movies (Underworld 1 and 2) which were good films but he makes action films so much better. His directing in this film is his best to date. The special effects are great with very little CGI used, the stunts are great, the original Die Hard music themes are used, its action packed and the climax is the best since Die Hard 2 (I since reckon that Die Hard 2 had the best climax in the series) There's also an unrated version of the film out that contains more swearing and the violence is toned up in small amounts. John McClane says the F word about 30 times in this version, even saying his most famous line ""Yippee Ki Yay Motherf--ker"" at the end of film. But overall this film was a great way to finish off the Die Hard Series, even though that Bruce Willis is in talks to make a 5th film with Len Wiseman, but time will tell. <br/><br/>Highly Recommanded"

","Very good :) To begin explaining how much I'm pleasantly surprised with this movie I must say that I'm not a big Bruce Willis fan, I ain't impressed by his acting skills and I'm certainly not a worshiper of ""Die Hard"" series. In fact I was AVOIDING watching this flick as I didn't expect anything but a dull Sunday afternoon action thriller.<br/><br/>But as said, this is a huge surprise. 4th installment of the series is by far the best in my book. Like modern trends obviously dictate it, it's tough and brutal, gritty, action packed and masterfully filmed. Yes the story is somewhat loose and doesn't quite complement brilliant visuals, but hey, it's an action movie. Computer themed movies almost always have those huge gaps in stories, either from original scripts itself, or from those unavoidable simplifications necessary for movie to communicate with wide enough audience. And as this story unfolds it will thin out to the point of breaking near the end, with some overblown transformers-like scenes thrown in... <br/><br/>But that's about all the bad; brilliant filming, impressive stunts and effects, very solid acting, adequate atmospheric score and many little thingies I'll leave out for your personal enjoyment, outweigh bad by far. Coming from someone that was bound to ignore this movie if not just plain hate it, this amount of satisfaction can only be summarized in two words - absolute recommendation :)"

","So many movies are pretentious or have to deliver a ""message"" or the director tries to be clever by starting the movie halfway through and then going backwards or messing around with the scenes or plot to make the film edgy or whatever The producer/director kept it simple here and this is a sheer roller-coaster of excitement from start to finish and for the first time in years i was disappointed a film that lasted over two hours had to finish. This is definitely the best of the genre and the gap between 3 and 4 obviously allowed the producers to get some new ideas, freshen up the image and get hold of the latest technology. The whole internet/cyber terrorist angle was also a great,modernist idea albeit littered with plot holes. Willis looked really good, amazing that he did the original almost twenty years ago and the rest of the cast was excellent. Justin long excelled as the uber-geek, Mclane's daughter also fitted the bill and kevin smith had a great cameo to boot. Also refreshing that the villain didn't have an English or German accent but some of the henchmen were french so I guess you can't have it all! The only reason I didn't give this a 10 as some elements of the plot are unconvincing, some parts of this film could not and wont happen.

I have to say being a massive Die Hard fan, for Bruce Willis to be out of the series since 1995 I think he did a great job playing McClane again, overall I really enjoyed this movie as it went right back to the originals format of pure over the top mayhem with plenty of action.

","Ready. Set. Action! Action being the key word here. LIVE FREE OF DIE HARD (aka Die Hard 4) is an action-fest filled with wonderfully similar themes we've all seen in the first DIE HARD film. Bruce Willis (16 BLOCKS), of course, returns as officer-cum-detective John McClane.<br/><br/>He's beat. He's tired. He's beat tired. But family always comes first, and McClane is first seen spying on his college daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, BOBBY), trying to protect for the wiles of the world. Naturally Lucy despises his attempts to protect her and storms off. Later, she will come to respect her father and proudly announce that her last name isn't Genero, but McClane.<br/><br/>John then gets an assignment as a taxi. He's told to pick up a computer hotshot named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, THE BREAK UP) and bring him to a special FBI task force that's tracking a string of computer crimes targeted at the American infrastructure. Once McClane and Matthew meet, it rapidly becomes apparent that somebody wants Matthew dead. Bullets fly. Bombs go off. McClane, again, is in way over his head ...exactly where Die Hard fans want him.<br/><br/>A computer heist known as a ""fire sale"" is taking place in which everything vital to U.S. survival gets shut down. Traffic. Television and radio. Electricity. Everything that is currently run by high-tech computers is going off-line. Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is the bad-guy who is initially seen as a terrorist but is later found to have financial aspirations (sound familiar?). When McClane becomes a pest, Gabriel soon turns to kidnapping someone close to the detective's heart.<br/><br/>McClane and Matthew race to save America (and a family member) from a devastating computer meltdown. Car and helicopter chases, semi-truck and harrier jet encounters, all build upon the other until the final, fateful end.<br/><br/>The dialogue between the computer illiterate McClane and the gurus of the internet are hilariously pulled off. The geeks can't get to where they need to be unless McClane blasts their way through, and McClane doesn't know what to do unless he's told by the geeks.<br/><br/>A great fight sequence between Bruce Willis and Maggie Q (BALLS OF FURY) is something to watch for, especially since Willis' character ends up back in an elevator shaft (homage to Die Hard 1). It's also entertaining to see Willis' McClane get his butt stomped by the sexy Asian woman ...for a while.<br/><br/>And let's not forget one of the coolest stunts seen on celluloid in some time: a car launch and crashing into a helicopter. Although completely unrealistic, it was amazingly awesome to watch.<br/><br/>This is something Die Hard fans have been waiting for; another film that is overly-audacious and loaded with nonstop action scenes. It's flat-out fun!"
"DrLex","8","1","3","20 November 2007"," Classic non-stop die hard action
","I'm not going to spend too many words on this because most other reviews (like AdnanZ's) pretty much nail down all I've wanted to say. In short, this really is a rare example of a sequel (the fourth one even) which stays true to what made the original so good, even if the plot is very different. Even though the scale of the attack which forms the core of the movie is a multitude larger (the entire USA), we still get the same kind of feeling about it as in the original Die Hard, where all the action was confined to a single building. That really is impressive and a sure sign that the director has made his homework.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is pure hardcore action, the plot is still quite solid. It does even raise some valid concerns, without standing in the way of the non-stop action. The action itself is perfectly executed, I suppose there are loads of CGI effects in this movie but they are so well executed that they will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the few way too impossible things that happen. These do take the viewer out of the immersion a bit, making it too obvious that they're watching a movie. I know, it is an action blockbuster where you're not supposed to think, but seeing a crashing car being flung in the air as if it has jet engines mounted on it, just triggers my disbelief-detector, no matter how sedated it is by the previous awesome action scenes."

It leave out a lot of the rest of the ""fire storm"" plan, but it's good enough. But in any case, it's mainly just a ""what if?"" action movie."

","McClane was silenced for so many years, we lost are hope for a fourth sequel, and there he goes. Die Hard 4.0 (live free or Die Hard) for many people is like a ""last-chance-to-take-money"" job, these are words coming from people who haven't seen Die Hard 4.0. As you all know the first movie was an all time classic, and now we have the fourth movie and as it seems the last one. I don't know where to start from, the great scenario, the amazing action scenes that even if they are a bit ""unreal"", which is something they are not, they can be done in real life with a tone of luck, makes you want to see the movie again and again and again, and finally the fantastic direction of Len Wiseman. The movie is perfectly worked out, also because of the well-known mega-acting of bruce willis. Conclusion, what i said can be explained in one sentence: ""Die Hard 4.0 is at the same class as the first Die Hard is, both of them, masterpieces"""
"geertvdheide","7","1","3","19 October 2007"," A flawed, but great action movie
","The fourth movie in the Die Hard series picks up on its lead character John McClane, who has grown older and wearier since we last met him. His private life has gone down the drain and he's as cranky as ever. On top of this, he is once again faced with a massive challenge, this time involving global cyber terrorism.<br/><br/>The plot is actually pretty well written for an action movie. There may not be much in terms of character development or depth, but the plot succeeds in carrying the movie and explaining some of the hows and whys. The movie has its plot holes and problems, but to me this was all quite forgivable. The one thing that bothered me about the plot was the overload of cyber-talk, nerdy hackers and flashy gizmo's.<br/><br/>The main strength of Die Hard 4 lies in its action scenes, which are some of the best in recent years. The car chases, shootouts and fight scenes are very well choreographed, intensely shot and very cool to watch. I got the feeling of being right in the middle of it, like a good action movie should.<br/><br/>Despite his age, Bruce Willis still does a great job as Detective John McClane. Foulmouthed, rude and without compromise, he rams his way through every obstacle in his path. The main character also brings some genuinely funny dialog, some originality and some heart into the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I rank ""Live Free or Die Hard"" as one of the best action movies of 2007. I recommend all fans of the genre to go watch it. And please, don't be put off by the movie's PG13 rating. The visuals and language are not especially child-friendly, but are actually pretty gritty and mature."

","I have to confess that when i heard about the future release of a fourth Die Hard Movie i did feel that maybe they were milking the series for a quick buck! All i could hope for was an entertaining action flick at best, i'm happy to say i was way off with my assumption.<br/><br/>'Live Free or Die Hard' is an explosive, action packed addition to the series; the stunts are hugely impressive and they come at such a pace, the audience has no time to even catch their breath from one sequence to another. Mixed in with the adrenaline is a pretty compelling plot that unravels at a steady pace, maximising the compulsion to keep viewing; and of course the traditional Die Hard gags are evenly delivered throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This movie has all the right ingredients for a great action movie, and even though it does have a few over used clichés in the plot, it still has enough fresh ideas to make stand up to the original.<br/><br/>Well done Bruce and Company 8/10"
"agent2009","9","1","3","8 October 2007"," Once again John McClane vs Brave New World
","Who says an old fashion guy can't survive technology? From microwave to Nakatomi building, from fax machine to polymerframed pistols, McClane always finds his way to get over it, only this time it is much more large in scale than he could ever imagine: computer network, things that made out of chips and cable. And of course the bad guys. In Die Hard series the world always appears to be black and white.<br/><br/>This is the 4th Die Hard for nearly 2 decades, and fortunately it is a promising one. Absolutely entertaining with loads of explosion, stunt works and funny lines. It starts with hack of computers, which leads to a money scheme behind it. In between cities are totally cripple, and McClane's daughter is taken hostage, making the situation personal to our all-time hero. The story is not complicated to follow, so you could focus on the action and, needless to say, Bruce Willis himself, who portrays the legendary John McClane, a NYPD cop in 30 years of duty.<br/><br/>The downside, if I have to point it out, is Timothy Olyphant, who plays the master mind behind the crimes, may look too young and naive to orchestrate the whole things. It would take more than money to drive his crews to carry out his insane plan. He is just not that evil guy. That makes him less convincing and therefore the weakest link of the movie. And I do wish Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who plays Lucy McClane, would have had a little more character development than merely a bargain chip. Despite of these, you will not be disappointed with this movie. Die Hard 4 is a must see this year."

LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is a success, and that's first thing's first - there ain't too much to say about such a straight-forward action movie succeeding on the terms that it's got the wit combined with the guts, and it truly makes it work. It's a solid piece of action-movie making, and it's a great thing to see Bruce Willis return in the role he does best.

","The book the original film ""DIE HARD"" was based on, and then spawned the sequels is by far the best creation on film I have ever seen. That is saying a lot, since I have a current video library of over 200 DVDs and around 3000 VHS recordings. You could say I am a movie hobby man. Think quickly, every Spielberg, Lucas movie made. Think about oldies like ""Gone With The Wind"", ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". Factor in every love story, comedy, horror, sci-fi, action, and any combination of these, and my vote for Greatest Movie Ever, is ""Die Hard"" . Of course all sequels to ""Die Hard"" are ranked 2,3,and 4, in my book. The character John McClaine is one of my heroes. When Die Hard was released I was in my first serious relationship. She meant everything to me, and the one factor of Die Hard was that McClaine could've escaped the building, but he faced astronomical odds against in order to save his wife. Live Free Or Die Hard represents the classic character McClaine years later, but still the same hero from 1988,Die Hard."
"ExpendableMan","8","1","3","1 September 2007"," Die Hard 4: Revenge of the Nerds
","Prior to its release, Die Hard 4 (Live Free Or Die Hard to you folks on the other side of the pond) seemed like a colossal failure waiting to happen. The bad guys weren't Euro fanatics or Colombian drug lords, but cyber terrorists. The director was Len Wiseman, whose biggest claim to fame are the two Underworld films. Bruce Willis is no longer the sprightly bad ass he was back when he first visited the Nakatomi Plaza and worst of all, the rating was PG-13. PG-13? For a Die Hard movie? The most grimly violent and foul mouthed action franchise of all time? This can't work can it? Well, after months of sitting around with my fingers crossed chanting ""please don't suck,"" it is a tremendous relief to say that Die Hard 4 is an absolute blast. Sort of.<br/><br/>Now, a plot revolving around 'cyber terrorism' conjures up images of fat, sweaty, science-fiction fans sat in their parent's basements typing for two hours, (and true to form, Kevin Smith makes an appearance, quite a good one too). Certainly, there are points where the entire film seems like one colossal war between the good nerds (those with toy collections that still live with their parents) and the bad nerds (those who hire mercenaries to kill the competition) with John McClane stuck in the middle, but nevertheless this is still an action film through and through. Wiseman handles the set pieces with aplomb and there a couple of sequences so utterly awesome that they could quite easily stand toe-to-toe with the fire hose abseiling of the original. McClane's ruck with oriental lady assassin Maggie Q for instance is a riot, an absolutely punishing duel that culminates in an inventive lift shaft/truck altercation. And then of course, there's the spectacular finale involving a big rig and a jet fighter - without a shadow of a doubt, the highlight of the film and sure to be propping up a few 'best action scene' categories in the end of the year polls, even if it does ape True Lies a bit.<br/><br/>Action aside, the biggest reason for seeing this film is to catch Bruce Willis reprising his most iconic character. Appropriately, the new millennium's McClane is bitter and tired. He's still capable of cracking wise and throwing down with the best of them, but he's even more cynical than before. His previous heroism has done him no favours, landing him with little more than a pat on the back, an ex-wife and kids who don't use his surname. Sadly though, he's not quite as vulnerable as the previous entries, coming across more as an indestructible super-cop rather than a blue collar everyman. One scene for instance sees McClane throwing himself out of a speeding car: if this were 1988, it would have been followed by an agonising sequence where Willis pops his shoulder back into place and winces in agony, biting back tears of pain. Now though he simply gets up and proceeds to the next set piece with only a trickle of blood rolling down the side of his head.<br/><br/>And this of course is where serious Die Hard fans will have their biggest complaint justified, as this entry is spectacularly blood-free. People tend to die off screen, blasted out of windows or minced up in turbines, Wiseman pulling the camera away at the pivotal moment to show Justin Long's exasperated side kick gasping in disbelief. The chief villain's death in particular is a huge let down: one hastily edited shot and he's down, no blood, no anguish, no anything. There isn't even any swearing, the ""yippee kay yay"" trademark edited in such a way as to make it a cute buzz-phrase rather than a glorious victory snarl.<br/><br/>That aside, Die Hard 4 is still a hugely enjoyable slice of summer fun. Dave Grohl lookalike Justin Long has a natural charm and Kevin Smith is on scene stealing form. Timothy Olyphant falls short though, stuck in the role of the super-geek bad guy who could only be less threatening if he were made entirely of wet noodles. He's the sort of villain who tries to remain aloof and threatening, but always gets his bigger mates to do the dirty work; a villain for the Ipod generation if you will.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable therefore but not the blitzkrieg return to form it should have been. This is Die Hard for the post-9/11 world: the streets are filled with chaos and the emergency services are overwhelmed as the social system collapses, but it's also a politically correct and serviceable portrayal of modern terrorism that twelve year olds could watch with their parents. Terrific fun yes, but it would be nice if they refrained from smoothing down the edges next time."

","I went to see this movie thinking it was going to be a mediocre sequel that would ultimately destroy the beloved die hard reputation. Boy was I wrong! This movie was probably in the top 2 of the best sequels of the summer. It was a nice departure from the CGI-infested summer blockbusters. Almost immediately you are thrown in the middle of one of John Mclane's worst days of his life. The action never lets up and even though the plot is somewhat unrealistic, the one-liners and jokes poured on by Bruce and Justin suck you in and take you on a wild ride filled with chaos and destruction. For most die hard fans, the basic elements are there: violent fights and shootouts, incredible stunts, leather holster, and a extraordinarily evil villain who can outsmart everybody except the cop from jersey. It even makes quite a few references to the first Die Hard movies. While I was disappointed that John Mctiernan was not going to direct this one, I loved how the movie turned out. John's charisma and sarcastic dark humor is back. The action sequences are extremely fresh and cool. One of their best attributes is that they refrain from stickingto the regular clichés. One of the major disappointments of the moviewas its pg-13 rating. I was anticipating another spectacular medley of brutal fights, bloody deaths,(especially like the terrorists getting shot in the kneecaps in the first Die Hard). But there's a limit when it comes to a pg-13 movie. Now don't get me wrong, live free or die hard is extremely violent for a teen movie, but one of my bigger hopes is that an r-rated or unrated version of the movie will come out on DVD. I think true fans of the series will appreciate this sequel. It wasn't disappointing and it was rather a refreshing visit to one of the best characters in movie history."

","Finally I got to see this film, and boy was it worth the wait! The action sequences hearken back to the slam-bang first three Die Hard movies. The original ""Die Hard"" deservedly was named the best action movie of all time, and this installment successfully carries the tradition of excellence on.<br/><br/>While ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", was sleek and smart, this one is pure brawn, muscular and explosive, all care of its star, Bruce Willis. I have been a fan of this guy since his Moonlighting days as David Addsion. While he surely looked grizzled in this one, only Bruce Willis can play John McClane. He faithfully stuck to the character we all admire for being cool and collected, tough as nails, yet inexplicably melodramatic when it came to his family (his daughter Lucy, in this case). Of course, it's no Bruce Willis film without the smart-ass humor and attitude, and he puts it on thick in this one! <br/><br/>The story is so current and so close to what can actually happen in reality. It dealt with a ""fire sale"" cooked up by a disgraced CIA man, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). A ""fire sale"" is when someone hacks into and causes major snafus in the transport, financial and telecommunications and finally in basic utilities, in so doing, holding the entire USA in his hands.<br/><br/>John McClane gets dragged into the action when he was assigned to protect one computer hack Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) who had been targeted for execution by Gabriel. And wow, their adventures and close calls are as slam-bang as they can ever get. Ingenious action scenes include that inside a tunnel culminating in a car blowing up a helicopter (!) and that where a jet and truck battle on the freeways. The martial arts action between McClane and Mai (played by the fantastic Maggie Q) is breathtakingly exciting.<br/><br/>I'm not discounting a 5th installment, as Bruce Willis is looking still fit and capable as any of the upcoming young guns. A must-watch for action movie fans!"
"tastyhotdogs","8","1","3","16 August 2007"," This movie is full of hacks, literally
","For about the fifth time in my life, headed out solo to go and see a movie. I settled on ""Die Hard 4.0"" at Croydon Cinema for $6.50.<br/><br/>Walking in, the cinema looked OK, good seats, if anything just a slightly overbearing popcorn smell. As I was early played some ""Pinball Delight"" on my phone while waiting for the main attraction. Within 10 minutes we were on.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the theme of what would happen if computer hackers got control of some really important government and financial computers. It sure was a fascinating concept, I just hope computer hackers don't go to see it and get bad ideas and instead of trying to email people viruses try to take over the world. The central characters are Bruce Willis (as John McClane), who looks older but still has the crazy moves and side-splitting one-liners and Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, in his best role since that Windows vs Mac ad series), as a computer hacker who just might be able to help. Behind the hacking is Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant, who looks like a mixture of Vince Vaughn and Billy Bob Thornton), an ex-Government computer brain factor who got peed off when he was fired for being too brash.<br/><br/>The premise is good and the action is outstanding, with some amazing scenes and fight sequences (my favourite being in the power station). It dragged a bit at the end as we waited for McClane to just catch the bad guy already, but overall it was pretty good for what it was. Perhaps 1 or 2 too many totally implausible scenes, plus I got obsessed with watching how McClane's blood marks changed during scenes. I think I speak for myself and my 4 other fellow patrons when I say that as far as action goes, you won't find much better."
"ichocolat","Null","1","3","14 August 2007"," Fast-paced Actions from start to the end !
","I gotta say that the movie is absolutely fantastic! Fast-paced actions from the start go up to the ending credit. The star-studded casts truly lived up to the audiences expectations. Bruce Willis (who plays Det. John McClane), Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q did a great job in their acting. Kudos to them! The actions kept the audiences in their sit, watching every bit of the actions. A police car rammed a flying helicopter is one of the best scenes I watched. There were plenty of other breathtaking stunts that will leave the audiences satisfied.<br/><br/>One may argue that the world is saved by a police detective and a computer wizard from the unfathomable cyber terrorist geeks seems to be far-fetched. And that Det. John McClane did not die even after being thrown out of a fast car, getting shot at and having his arse kicked by the terrorists made the argument all the more convincing. But to me the sheer bizarre-ness of this movie is beside the point. The movie can be way too bizarre and seems to be rather illogical, can still be good. In this case, the movie is very good. Not the best in the Die Hard series though. I liked the first Die Hard most.<br/><br/>While watching this movie, it suddenly occurred to me that the threat that cyber terrorism possessed is quite disturbing. In the movie, it showed how a nation crippled by skilled computer users who uses computer for negative use. It is a reminder to us all that something needs to be done to educate everyone to use computer for the benefit of humankind, and not otherwise."

Does he need the money or something? After watching this film in the theater I went home and broke out my 'Director's Cut Die Hard Boxed Set' and watched them all over again on plasma with surround sound. It amazes me how much better all of them were than this. In this most recent endeavor, there's lots of shoot 'em up, explosions, chases, decent plot, sufficient wise cracks for Willis, scoring and editing were fine. But somehow the thing just didn't fly for me. It may sound petty but I think that it was the little things like the ""continuity"" of Willis' injuries. He gets injured numerous times, and is visibly bleeding yet, in the next scene, or a couple of scenes forward, there is not much visible to attest to his previous, seemingly serious injuries, yet the plot unfolds within a relatively narrow time frame. Bacatracin? Neosporine?<br/><br/>I guess it's all irrelevant, though.

","You know the type of people, who are so interactive with a action flick, that they mimic all the guns and explosions. Well if you did that with this installment of the resurrected Die Hard franchise, you would be hoarse by the end of the two hours. By no means the first film ever to have constant and relentless action thrown at the audience, but like most that do, proceedings turn boring and repetitive by the end. It's a glimmering light shown from Len Wiseman, that Die Hard 4.0 is an exemption and one of the most entertaining popcorn films in quiet sometime.<br/><br/>Twelve years since we have since John McClane, Die Hard 4.0 doesn't play around with the formula, that has become a blue print for so many films from the invent of Die Hard. McClane once again is entangled in the plans of a well-groomed villain, where digital terrorism is our other foe. Based upon an article by John Carlin, the premise see's what happens when an entire country is hit with digital mayhem, and ultimately when that control over the digital world is ripped from its hands. The short answer here, Armageddon. The concepts and ideas presented by Carlin does the ultimate mind boggle on this ""What if"" situation, as humanities dependency is so reliant on this digital age. Sreenplay by Mark Bomback, beefs up the action side and injects the Die Hard formula, along with McClanes wise-cracks and invisible subtitle ""They hurt my family, nows it's personal"" eighties homage, resulting in our John McClane adventure.<br/><br/>Again McClane is the one man army, winding up in the wrong place at the wrong time again on a routine suspect pick up. Willis shows he is McClane, while able to show up all those young action stars he still has the goods, even if he doesn't have the ripped body of yesterdays. Very self aware of itself, instead of an intriguing thriller with dark undertones, director Len Wiseman, of both Underworld films, takes Die Hard 4.0 to bombastic levels of constant action set pieces, but all in the good name of great entertainment. With each set piece nearly an allusive boxing match; John McClane verses a band of armed hit men, John McClane verses a Helicopter, John McClane verses Kung-Fu Chick, John McClane verses a Jet Fighter. Each one raises the bar of ill-credibility so high, on paper its insanity of the highest order. Wiseman likes his films sleek and slick, and to his credit executes each scene with such precision, edited perfectly, to draw out that ""Whoa"" with such easement. Your eyes will binge on so much eye candy, as this defines destruction with nothing left unblown or shot out to the hilt. Rubble should have had a credit, with more screen time than most of the actors.<br/><br/>Relentless in pace and ACTION, ACTION, ACTION to please action flick junkies, Die Hard 4.0 like the predecessors are guilty pleasures. If you were able to take one part from this film, if needed to place a bet on the victor between McClane verses a Jet Fighter, you know where to place your money."
"BJBatimdb","7","1","3","5 August 2007"," the best no-brainer action flick of the year?
","How much more world weary can Bruce Willis get in his role as super-cop John Maclean? How many more times can he survive car crashes, bullets, strafing, falls off tall buildings, kung-fu killers and explosions that demolish entire apartments yet leave him with only a slight, short-lived limp? This Die Hard has thrown caution, reason, logic, human physiology and budgetary restraint to the winds - and is so much better for it! It's like the producers and Willis have given up any semblance of reality and just gone for some of the most staggering stunts and action sequences I've ever seen - and lots of them look non-CGI enough to make you really grip the armrests. The direction of all the action is fantastic, the script is just this side of laughable and the characters are just about human enough to make you give a damn.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is really something, with good old fashioned stunts dominating, but the whole thing takes a turn for the dumb after that with Willis the target of various killers (who always leave him alive just a second longer than they should have), and even more various death machines, big trucks and faulty infrastructure. The stunts then become so over the top that they lose any credibility and the last 20 minutes of the film are ho-hum. But loud ho-hum. <br/><br/>My biggest criticism of this and similar franchises is that characters go through stuff that would leave them crippled in a heartbeat and yet somehow manage to defy death or even hangnails. It severs any illusion of reality and makes what could have been an exciting sequence merely laughable. I certainly laughed more at Die Hard 4.0 than I did at The Simpsons movie. It is truly ludicrous in places. <br/><br/>The hi-tech computer-controlled premise of the film is interesting but, presumably for reasons of billing, had to give way to the low-tech Willis machismo. Still, it made for a different and original backdrop for an above-average action flick."

","I guess one may need to get sentimental to really enjoy this movie. While the action sequences are very cool, they are rather outlandish that make me care more about how the effects would come out rather than to think about their places in the plot. Well, the plot itself is outlandish anyway.<br/><br/>But the most serious flaw of the movie is that the main villain is not convincing nor intimidating. He looks too cute (don't get the wrong idea please!) to be a mad terrorist. It's like, I don't give a damn about who will he kill next. There are spectacular effects, but no tension. How could one really enjoy an action movie when feeling no tension? Meanwhile, even Maggie Q is kicking some serious rears (everybody would expect so), I think the ""hamster"" is the truly cool action villain here (his appearance is disappointingly brief).<br/><br/>In any case, an enjoyable summer movie anyway. Just relax, sit back, and enjoy the violence."
"mysteriesfan","7","1","3","3 August 2007"," An entertaining entry in a very entertaining series
","I am a fan of all of the Die Hard movies, and enjoyed this one, too. No matter how out-sized the stories and spectacular the visual effects, the movies remain grounded in the solid, distinctive John McClane character, so well played by Bruce Willis, and in the concept of a head-on conflict between him and a master criminal with a master plan.<br/><br/>In Die Hard 4, the gritty, smart, resourceful attempts to fight back against the technological wizardry and sheer firepower deployed by the villains is authentic, priceless McClane. So is his banter, especially with the kung fu henchwoman. The character of the young computer nerd who is McClane's sidekick in the movie complements McClane's character well, without duplicating him, the problem to some extent with the otherwise interesting Samuel L. Jackson in the third movie. As did its predecessors, the fourth movie attempts to differentiate the various villains. Of course, there is a grand criminal scheme, even if it is more vague and abstract than that in the gritty, detailed third movie.<br/><br/>That said, and although I always look forward to the next Die Hard movie, I have not liked the third and fourth Die Hard films as much as the first and second. There was something interesting, intense, and masterful about how the first two resolved a complicated, discrete problem in one rich, unfolding setting, with an urgent, direct personal stake by McClane in the outcome. The third and even more so the fourth are so far-flung and grand-scale that much of the sense of a real one-on-one battle in isolated, close quarters is lost. Something is also lost, in terms of accessibility and impact, when an action movie is as dominated as Die Hard 4 is by computers (and I do not mean computer-generated effects but a plot itself dependent on computers).<br/><br/>The lack of familiar supporting characters in the third and fourth films hurt continuity and gave them a colder feel. In Die Hard 4, McClane does not even have around him his NYPD buddies from the third film, though taking him off his home turf does add variety and suspense. Adding the character of the daughter is okay but she is nothing special or familiar.<br/><br/>The first and second films used music far better than the other two (who cares if Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is included in the trailer of Die Hard 4 if it or anything comparable is not in the movie itself?). Finally, the main villain was never better than in the first movie, and, although the second was more ordinary and Jeremy Irons was somewhat disappointing in the third, the unseasoned, one-dimensional man in the fourth movie probably ranks last. Still, the Die Hard movies may be the best series of action movies there is."

","To straighten it out firstly it's as the title said a valuable entertainment flick, no doubt about that.<br/><br/>But and the but is strong, because it's this time obviously overdone and too exerted to top off the prequels.<br/><br/>This slightly damages the overall impression of this movie. The fact that all Die Hard movies were all a tab unrealistic and overdone is beyond dispute but nonetheless this time some sequences appear simply unauthentic. In my opinion this is due to the large gap between part 4 and the ""original"" trilogy. For the recent scenario forced the production to go out of the usual league of effects and action scene.<br/><br/>The jet-scene for example is downright cool and a feast for the eyes regarding the effects but it deprives the story of its intensity at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Indisputably is furthermore that Bruce Willis couldn't have performed any better, that Justin Long played a good part as McClane's companion and that the two of them formed a ingenious couple of different character but this Die Hard remains incomparable to the prequels. It's more like a stand-alone part which assembles some of the old movies' features.<br/><br/>Nevertheless my aim is not to pan this movie, on the contrary I loved it but the flaws, I mentioned above, made it just another Die Hard movie and not the long-awaited highlight of the series.<br/><br/>My favorite Die Hard should thus remain the very first part , Die Hard 1."
"dragonshield","7","1","3","31 July 2007"," One of the coolest characters ever seen on the screen makes a very successful and satisfying comeback
","I went to see the newest installment of the Die Hard series in the cinemas a while back and to be honest I pretty much got what I wanted, so I was very pleased on the overall result the movie had to offer. I was so glad that it didn't suck. First of all, the plot is rather cheesy or at some parts it is, so it's nothing that great but despite that it has a good catch which involves a couple of great twists here and there. When an internet-based terrorist organization attacks the United States by first hacking into the computers at the FBI's Cyber Crime Division to bring down the whole computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the country, no other man than the legendary John McClane has to take them on and bring justice to the world once again. With help of a hacker he fights against the organization through the cyber world and the real world. Sure, it is corny, but it sure is entertaining as well. Blood won't be spared.<br/><br/>After twelve years one of the coolest characters ever seen on the big screen hits back to us and by the outstanding essence of Bruce Willis it is done with style. Undeniably the best thing this movie has to offer is Bruce Willis as John McClane, no other actor could do the same as Willis does. The first time I saw Willis on the screen I felt like applauding, insanely clapping my hands together, that's just how cool he still is. When things naturally go over the top you just realise saying to yourself ""No other than John McClane. It's John McClane, it's possible"" I'm pretty convinced when I say that the hardcore Die Hard fans won't be disappointed, as John McClane still is as cool as he was twelve years ago. Although Bruce Willis is already 52 years old he still kicks ass and when he does it with such credibility you just have to appreciate that. That famous two thumbs up takes place once again. Despite the fact of Willis being the true heart and soul of this movie, the other cast does a pretty flawless job as well. Timothy Olyphant is a spot on pick as the main villain, as having those fierce eyes he does what an evil character should. Even Justin Long is convincing as Matt Farrell, the hacker, as he wasn't even near the annoy level I was expecting. Overall the cast is picked out well and there's not much to complain when it comes to role performances.<br/><br/>The film is throughout a celebration of guaranteed quality action, they don't seem to make action movies like these anymore. The real essence of the old Die Hard's have remained - What those movies were all about and how the almost superhero like but realistic main character affected people, not forgetting the absolute punchlines of John McClane. When the movie has its cliché moments the writers have replaced those moments with the sarcasm of McClane who kind of saves that entire over the top -theme the movie has, clever I'd say. The action scenes are all in all simply mind blowing and the entertain level I was looking for was more than filled. As a movie having so much action; Gun shots, explosions, car chases, fist fights, everything imaginable, it's a must-see for every action fan there is. I went to see the movie with my brother and I remember asking him how many times there will be a moment in the movie where you have to say ""Yeah, awesome"" My brother bet on seven times and I bet on ten times. Even the ten times were probably exceeded. That is how awesome the movie is.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 4.0"" is one of the best action movies I've seen in a while. It offers the viewer a thrilling ride throughout, action packed sequences and most importantly John McClane, who makes an outstanding comeback to the big screen without the movie being just a lame sequel. When I heard that the director was Len Wiseman I was kind of afraid that the movie wouldn't stand out in any way, though Len Wiseman's previous ""Underworld"" -movies have been well crafted out when it came to the action scenes. I didn't like the actual movies though, but as I said, the action parts had potential. I'm glad that Wiseman did a satisfying job as the director. Though this probably final part of the Die Hard series is corny, it actually stays in a pretty tight package throughout and it doesn't lose the pieces as you could have imagined. You'll have a smile on your face, if not because of the absolutely hilarious punchlines by McClane then just because of the fact that you're watching a Die Hard -movie, a fresh new one. Live Free.. or Die Hard."

","My husband and I went to to see ""Live Free or Die Hard"" last night and can't wait to buy it on DVD when it comes out! Usually, movie sequels are panned for never owning up to the original. Not the case here! This was edge-of-your-seat, never a dull moment, ultra-suspense from start to finish! The special effects were great and the storyline and acting was very good as well. Bruce Willis can probably make 5 more Die Hard movies and they'll only get better and better!

","Well, Bruce Willis is still the Man. Die Hard 4 though didn't impress me much. Perhaps I had higher expectations, perhaps I myself being older now, thought this would be some kind of another movie. The action is first class of course. The are few very laughable jokes too. Perhaps if it wasn't for the fact that in this movie all facilities of national importance are conveniently guarded by only 3-4 dummies, I would be more interested in the plot. Again, as in every Hollywood movie where there are hackers, passwords are broken with a few keystrokes and security systems are brought down in seconds. It was nice to see BMWs every few minutes though :)<br/><br/>Overall - this is a movie for mass consumption, built on a famous trade-mark, but far away in comparison in plot, characters and fun from all the previous episodes<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is still one of my favs though :)<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>peace"
"elliott_38","6","1","3","26 July 2007"," It died an honourable death
","The unfortunate thing about sequels is that they will always be compared to their predecessors. I would not consider this movie as a segment in the Die Hard franchise, but more of a movie to stand alone. It carries few of the characteristics of the original trilogy, and lets face it; Willis ain't as young as he used to be. For me it doesn't quite live up to the prequels, although a throughly enjoyable if not fantasmical movie it is.<br/><br/>The Story is essentially about a terrorist, who is punishing the government for what they did to him. He punishes them by stopping pretty much everything including electricity and telephone lines in Washington. This, of course evokes complete havoc within the city, and rendering the government useless. So, it's up to a hacker and Willis to save the day, and it's certainly an explosive journey.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively strong, although completely unrealistic, although it manages to keep an audience entertained.<br/><br/>The script is so so, although people don't really go and see the movie for the dialect between characters. Willis still has a few gems in there though.<br/><br/>The acting is good enough, although Willis of course manages to carry the movie on his lonesome, and the hacker becomes more like an irritating sidekick rather than a co-lead. Disappointed with the villain though; he just lacked that certain pizazz that Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons had. The chemistry between hero and villain also fails to live up to the standards of the prequels.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least; the special effects. This movie has been pumped full of them. Yes, they are impressive, and particularly the helicopter in the tunnel stunt, but completely unrealistic (especially the jet part).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie will appeal to both the hardcore adrenaline junkies, and for those who just want to enjoy themselves. Good on the surface, but lacking in depth. Nevertheless, the end result was not too disappointing"

"bobm5508","7","1","3","23 July 2007"," Exciting, but nothing new here !!
","I cannot say I didn't enjoy the return of Bruce Willis and his indestructible NYPD cop - John McClane. The action scenes are well staged, the acting certainly on par with the better action thrillers (MI:, James Bond, etc.) and apparently many of the stunts involve real stunt work. I do not know which is which (real vs. CGI) as the line between actual human endurance and movie hero endurance has long since been removed. And that is one of the main reasons why these blockbuster action flicks have lost some appeal. How can I ever be on the 'edge of my seat' when the hero, and whoever is in his charge, avoid 2,000 - 3,000 bullets, flying cars, bombed apartments/vehicles, helicopter and jet attacks, collapsing bridges, self-inflicted gun shot wounds and my personal favorite.......the 100 foot fall. Yes, the fall is usually broken by 4 or 5 semi-soft items, but in this movie it happened to 4 different people!! <br/><br/>OK, a bit unfair not to enter without complete suspension of belief. But it gets old to see the bad guys immediately shoot 20 -30 people without a word, then always have John and his troupe ""drop your gun and come with me""!! The movie has some good quips (""enough of this king foo sh--""), a fun comic turn by Kevin Smith and plenty of exciting effects, so still a 7/10 for me. A 1/2 hour less running time wouldn't have hurt (maybe less is more?). But with each passing blockbuster, the thrills are harder and harder to buy into."
"Grant_Price","7","1","3","22 July 2007"," Yippie Kay Yay Mother- No! No swearing for you McClane.
","McClane is back, but not better than ever. After a twelve year hiatus, Bruce Willis returns with less hair, less violence and less believability. The film begins promisingly, with a grizzled McClane observed to be tailing his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) on a date, receiving a routine call to pick up a suspect (Justin Long) in an FBI case, bad guys subsequently popping out of the woodwork all over the place, leading to a high body count and millions of dollars worth of damage. Willis slips back into his signature role with ease, bringing to McClane a sense of bitterness and resentment not present in the previous three films, probably induced by his divorce, estrangement from his children and general world-weariness. This portrayal continues throughout the film and brings a new edge to his character and therefore to the story.<br/><br/>The antagonists are introduced mainly through a plethora of scenes involving them typing on keyboards, wearing headsets and looking at computer screens. Riveting. There is no underlying menace present in a single one of these 'cyber-terrorists,' as there was with Alan Rickman and his band of deutsche Soldaten in the original. There is never a sense that McClane is actually in danger once the action starts, the exception to this being Maggie Q's character in the gas refinery who unfortunately meets a premature end (she was much more interesting than that Parkour guy.) Even the main villain, Timothy Olyphant, having mastered the cold, steely-eyed stare necessary for world domination, deliberates so much over killing McClane's daughter (even though McClane mocks Olyphant for ""ramming an SUV"" up his girlfriend/wife's ass, killing her horribly) that it is difficult to feel as though McClane is under threat. Another antagonist, in the form of a fighter jet, leads to the film's most improbable set piece, in which McClane is forced to jump from the lorry which he is driving onto the wing of the plane to escape a soon-to-be-rubble multi story car park. He then literally surfs on the jet's wing until it nears the ground, at which point he neatly jump off, rolls and walks away unscathed as the plane explodes. It's more XXX than Die Hard, which is clearly not a good thing.<br/><br/>However the other action sequences are excellent, encompassing elements from all the previous three films. The apartment shootout is reminiscent of the claustrophobic atmosphere prevalent throughout the first, the demolition of the gas refinery reminds one of the wide scale destruction in the second and the two instances in which McClane disposes of a helicopter is evocative of the third. Also, the constant reuse of dialogue such as ""Buckle up"" and ""Just hang on!"" serve as reminders in themselves. This is not a bad thing, as it makes Die Hard 4.0 feel as though it belongs with the others.<br/><br/>Regarding the supporting cast, Justin Long seems to thoroughly enjoy his role, receiving some of the best dialogue in the film, though he can get a little annoying during the action scenes. Plus, we don't need to see him working furiously at his computer while McClane is kicking ass. Nobody prefers a download screen to badassery. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a small role but she does the best she can under this limitation. I would say she's more there to take over the babe role after Maggie Q meets her end, but she also manages to help out her father in the end by shooting a baddie in the foot. Kevin Smith plays a great role as a computer hacker living in his mother's basement, who at one point enquires to Long, ""Why did you bring a cop to my command centre?"" and only after being screamed at by McClane through a CB radio, grudgingly assists him to prevent his daughter from being killed. He's like Argyle in the original, totally pointless but excellent.<br/><br/>Overall there are enough real stunts, explosions and deaths in Die Hard 4.0 to warrant it a place amongst the series and, though at times it can seem like an elongated episode of 24, delivers enough action and one-liners, making it worth the wait for any Die Hard fan. Yippie Kay Yay, Motherfu- BAM!"
"akhilgenx2005","7","1","3","21 July 2007"," Finally something entertaining, this summer
","After spending (wasting) number of Friday evenings, finally got to see a true summer blockbuster. Stuff very similar to Rush Hour but this Action-Comedy has more action than comedy. The best part bout the movie is that even though some action sequences look a little overdone, and sometimes the story also looks weak but the chemistry between Bruce Willis n Justin Long (pretty much in the league of Jackie Chan n Chris Tucker) just doesn't give u time to think bout logic. The special effects are what would b expected from a Bruce Willis starer but the F35 shot towards the end is no doubt a clumsy one (MI3 had done a lot better job). Still: Don't watch it at home!!"

Action sequences are great, comedy value is good and there is even a slight trace of tension.<br/><br/>Acting is done well enough to not fall out of style, musical score works well enough, used effects are more than well enough.

","Before going to see ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" I had never seen any other Die Hard films. I have,however, always been a big Bruce Willis fan, not to mention a lover of action films.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard is an awesome movie! It tells the story of NYPD officer John McClane, an older bald man who still has big muscles, who is sent to pick up an Hacker, Matt Farrell, who may have some connections to the breach in the FBI's system. When he arrives at Farrell's apartment, mercenaries are there trying to kill the young computer nerd. McClane steps in, kills the bad guys and rescues the hacker. For the next couple of days, the two of them work together in an unstoppable team to discover who is trying to ruin the United States of America. Along the way, they battle a former employee of the US government bent on destroying America, an Asian woman who loves kicking people with her high-heeled boots, and dozens of other obstacles. McClane races the clock as he hurries to save his daughter(who had been kidnapped by the terrorists) and the computer hacker who makes nerd look hot, Matt, from the men responsible for the terrible events. McClane is back, and better yet!"
"jemps918","9","1","3","16 July 2007"," Super fun!
","Super fun! I agree with some reviews that Die Hard 4.0 is like Rocky Balboa: you watch it not expecting much from the latest regurgitated version of a popular series but you end up enjoying it immensely. This approach works because it sticks to its roots of why people liked the original in the first place: unstoppable, heart-pounding action coupled with well-placed comic relief.<br/><br/>The unsinkable Bruce Willis reprises his role as super-cop John McLane with still the right amount of cockiness. No matter what situation he's in, you can't help but root for the guy and believe in the amazing stuff that he gets to do! While Timothy Olymphant (in his metrosexual garb) isn't much of a scary nemesis for our burly hero (and his able foil, played by the forever geeky Justin Long) compared to past arch-enemies, his partner-in-crime Maggie Q provided enough action for the both of them. There are just too many incredible action sequences in this flick that's poised to entertain. Loads of fun!"
"agmoldham","5","1","3","15 July 2007"," A good film is trying to get out
","Yet another franchise film in 2007 - the year of the franchise. This film suffers from the common problem of the franchise, in that it must tick all the boxes that the audience are expecting. If you've seen the previous Die Hard movies then this does indeed tick all the boxes. This is a bit of a shame however, because I really think the film would have been better if it would have played more on the ageing McClane and the relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>It's John McClane (Willis) plus a few incompetents battling against an army of bad guys. In this particular case he's battling against a group of cyber criminals. The plot is quite interesting and the dialogue isn't without merit, but unfortunately some of the action sequences are a little over the top. It's a shame the budget wasn't capped because I think if you took out a couple of the set piece action sequences and replaced them with a little more character development this would have been a very good film. As it is this is going to appeal to the people that liked the previous Die Hard movies and like plenty of action."
"Rom_Port","6","1","3","13 July 2007"," Yet another typical action movie
","I guess the best line to describe my feeling after watching this movie is, ""pretty much what I expected"". I expected a typical action movie, a sequel (which means there won't be anything new or original in it) and lots of action and effects with a little acting. I also expected some laughs, not because the movie will be funny, but because i was sure there will be some unrealistic and pretty dumb stuff (like in pretty much all the Hollywood action films). Just a couple examples (spoiler): The hero goes through explosions, gunfire, fights and car accidents and gets only few bruises by the end of the movie (how typical), while destroying, at least, a couple hundreds million dollars worth of property. The second thing that i found pretty funny is that some of the most important facilities of the US, that the terrorists took over, were guarded only by 3-4 guards each, and these guards had a mall guard training. In conclusion if u watched 2 or 3 action movies u know exactly what to expect during this one, from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>Finally, you might ask why did i give the movie the grade of 6.<br/><br/>Two reasons: 1. I actually enjoyed watching it. 2. I didn't expect much, so i wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>I definitely won't see it again but i recommend to watch it once, it'll take your mind off your life for an hour and a half :)"
"policy134","7","1","3","13 July 2007"," The novelty has worn off but it still excites and thrills more than most action films today
","Bruce Willis still has some life in him, as evidenced in this competent fourth entry into the Die Hard series. Long gone are the glory days where Willis' fish out of water act was new and thoroughly surprising but the movie still has the quality to entertain you.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the movie's lack of the F-word to avoid it from receiving an R rating. It was as usual to gather a wider audience as was Martin Scorsese's The Aviator but it doesn't really make any difference. The movie still has virtually the same impact. The way, Samuel L. Jackson and Willis used every opportunity to wring out a laugh with the word in Die Hard with a Vengeanse was to be expected, following their part in Pulp Fiction, where Jackson made a contest out of how many times he could say it in one line. Plus, that film had a more strong villain in Jeremy Irons and he was mostly in on the joke. Just looking at Irons' character brought a hilarious disdain for the character he played in that movie.<br/><br/>Here we have a much weaker villain, a computer expert (Gee, has that not been done before) and an even weaker side kick, Justin Long. But to my surprise, Long wasn't as annoying as he could have been and even got me somewhat involved in his destiny to save Washington D.C.<br/><br/>As in past entries to the series, the villain's motivation is totally outrageous and selfish and doesn't have anything to do with destroying the world as we know it. The villain has an eastern sidekick and Willis makes some rather tasteless remarks about her race which I think was totally uncalled for. It is offensive and totally thrown in to get a cheap laugh from the audience. We must have somebody to ridicule so who do we go for, the foreigners whoever they are, be they German or Chinese or whatever. This is the only objection I have about the film and it pretty much soured my attitude towards the rest of it.<br/><br/>Now on to what is good about it. Willis' stunt with a car flying to destroy a helicopter is the most spectacular piece of film trickery I have seen in years. It is obviously CGI but it still looks somewhat possible (not totally) but maybe. The end is also as it should be and Long has one of his best moments together with the actress who play McClane's daughter, without resorting to the obvious of a love scene.<br/><br/>To sum up, it is nowhere near the level of the past three entries but you weren't totally dissatisfied to pay for an overpriced ticket to see Willis near-geriatric stunts towards crushing a bad guy (Sorry, Willis but you asked for it)."

","Fear is something that can strike deep into the heart of anyone for any reason.

Some people seem to be indifferent to these previously said and any assumable phobias. Although now we have substantial reason to believe that that the Hollywood hierarchy can screw up even something as sure fire as this franchise. But enough of that. If you want reasons for what should be this blasphemy I'm spouting, I've got'em. One of the many things wrong is the choice of director. Len Wiseman, or for everybody else, Mr. ""All I know how to make is stoic wannabe goth vampire movies"". And what do you know, the new Die Hard is extremely color bleached and lacks a decent sense of humor, like Wiseman's previous efforts. The thing that hurts most from that last sentence is that all the Die Hards had a great sense of humor, not just I'm John McClaine and I do my job. More like ""yeah, I'm John McClaine, I do my crappy job, and I realize I'm a lucky guy. And they don't pay me enough"". Also, the movie was too over the top. Too many times in the movie it seemed that things could have only happened the way they did if the hand of God came down and rearranged things to McClaine's liking. And the bad guy seemed like he should be doing extremely metrosexual Smirnoff ice commercials saying ""Hi, I'm Timothy Olyphant, like elephant, and after a long hard day of giving a hand to the demise of a beloved franchise, I like to cool off with a Smirnoff ice"". Too cut out any more redundancy, I'll leave it at deep down, or hollering from far away, was a Die Hard movie, fighting, not too hard, to get out. Last thought. Rambo, please come and deliver us from evil. 2008 is not too far away, but couldn't come soon enough. And ""Transformers"" is a great way to get the bad taste out of your mouth."

Now, with the 4th installment, Live Free or Die Hard has almost eliminated character development and is composed of huge action sequences. This is not a bad thing and maybe it's how a 3rd sequel has to be made. But if you're looking for anything other than action you won't find it here.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action. Bodies fly all over the place. I particularly liked the sequence with Bruce Willis and the ""Chinese Kung-Fu bitch,"" -- Willis' words -- in the elevator shaft.

I'm glad to see all the old school action heroes coming back get the nasty taste of Diesel and the Rock out my mouth.<br/><br/>What I was actually expecting from the trailers was a shallow action packed sequel and you know what, I was looking forward to that. I was however slightly shocked and for a while disappointed I didn't get this. That is not the film this is, in fact it's only flaw may be it doesn't know what it wants to be; a serious thriller or an action packed brainless sequel. It hovers between both fairly well most of the time coming off as a Thriller with ridiculous over the top stunts. A lot of people seem to say it's too over the top, I disagree in fact I think a few of the action scenes could have gone on longer. I think of all the Die Hards, Die Hard: With A Vengeance is still the biggest action film due to its constant action sequences it's like T3 and T2 although the chase in T3 is huge the constant action sequences in T2 make it a bigger film.<br/><br/>The plot is very Die Hard in my opinion, in fact more Die Hard than the 2nd film due to those Terrorists actually being what they said they where. (Not that I don't like Die Hard 2: Die Harder) Bruce is back, he is McClane he's a cranky sarcastic un-stylish cop and yes the vest is there be it under a green sweatshirt. Only slight flaw with him is yes the potty mouth is gone although their is some great ""McClane"" lines about Maggie Q the Asian Henchwoman. McClane's usual swearing is replaced by his unique laugh. Yippi Ki Yay, his famous line is said and in my opinion the best use of it not just some line thrown in after a vehicle explodes although I wouldn't rank the Villains demise as the number one way for a bad guy to go. Timothy Olyphant is a pretty menacing villain nothing compared to the Gruber brothers' condescending approach to McClane but still fun.<br/><br/>Oh the sidekick, yep he's a sidekick the is necessary for the plot. Justin Long is pretty good he could have came across as an over grown Short Round but managed not to.<br/><br/>Overall I'd rank this my 3rd favourite Die Hard, under of coarse the Original and Vengeance. I just like the Grubers thing.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Die Hard was released in 1988 and lets be honest it was and still is one of the best action movies out there, so of course some good, but albeit inferior sequels followed and nearly twenty years later we have the fourth Die Hard instalment.<br/><br/>Was it needed? The answer simply - no.<br/><br/>Was it worth the £5.50 to see it? The answer simply - hell yeah! The action was non stop, fast paced, adrenaline pumping action. The set pieces were phenomenal. The tunnel scene was just amazing to watch. The fight scenes, especially the one between John and Mai was fantastic entertainment. The fighter jet -v- truck battle on the bridge was also very impressive.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis may be the wrong side of 50, but the man still looks good in a tight tank top and can still throw some hard looking punches.<br/><br/>Justin Long, a distant member of the Frat Pack, plays the nerdy side kick very well and has some very amusing lines, including one about a grazed knee and his asthma! Of all the actors in Hollywood I never would've picked him for this role but he was perfect.<br/><br/>I was worried about John's daughter as I thought they would turn her into a wimpy damsel in distress but I am so glad that I was proved incorrect (for a change!) The baddies, except an evil Timothy Olyphant, who we don't see enough of, were all the usual stereotypical hairy eastern European were all fun, and all met there demise in all sorts of interesting ways created by the great John McClane.<br/><br/>Also the great Kevin Smith appeared as Freddie the Warlord what more could you ask for? <br/><br/>What's that I hear? You want a plot? Well apparently Timothy Olyphant's character warned the US Government about the failures in their security system and they ""Crucified"" him. He then seemed to go insane, gather a motley crew consisting of Maggie Q, the Eastern Europeans and the Nerdy Computer Guys in a plan to prove to the US Government just how easy it would be to place the Country into the dark ages, and naturally chaos ensues and only John McClane bring them down, protect a computer hacker and save his daughter (all at the same time of course!) People will argue that it is unrealistic, how can one man survive such a beating blah blah blah but who cares its an action movie people!! <br/><br/>If you have to pick faults in the film, I would go for the over use of the word ""Armageddon"" Also Yippe I Ki Yeah Mutha *BANG* doesn't have the same ring to it - that was a bit of a cop out! <br/><br/>Most critics will say - leave you brain at the door and just enjoy the action <br/><br/>I say - bring your brain with you and just appreciate and enjoy a good action movie when you see it and allow yourself to be entertained. You don't need to make an excuse to enjoy the movie people! I give it 9/10 - it loses a point for being a sequel (personal rule!)"
"laci-5","8","1","3","5 July 2007"," McClane is, surprisingly, really back!
","Welcome, John! Before this project came out I had no high hopes. McClane is an old guy, the movies were great back then but time is changing; people want to see something different than old-fashioned action scenes. Luckily, I was wrong. What's more, I was also wrong when I thought 12 years means this movie will have only the name of John McClane as the filmmakers will not be able to make it worthy of the Die Hard title. This is really a Die Hard movie, at least in the most important aspects: action scenes, humor and characters. I don't care if the action scenes are improbable (it's not the reality what we want to see in a summer action popcorn); they are spectacular and also full of ideas (unlike the spectacular-but-boring action sequences in Transformers). The new characters are all right (even if I did not find the baddie that interesting) while the old one really behaves and reacts just like in those old times. This movie is close to being an action comedy as between (and sometimes, even during) the action sequences the audience was laughing a lot; this shift of tone is only a continuation of what could be felt in the previous sequels. Also, nice continuation in opening the space: first a building, the second time an airport, then a city and now the States are the target of the terrorists. But they have to face John McClane...so they don't have a ghost of chance. One of the best movies this summer has to offer."
"Jay_Exiomo","7","1","3","4 July 2007"," Retro popcorn movie that works
","""Live Free or Die Hard"" (or simply ""Die hard 4.0"" as released locally) used to be what summer escapism is about before CGI took over and film marketers targeted younger audiences more. Len Wiseman, director of the two ""Underworld"" films, in all his fashionable tendencies and mannerisms, seems an awkward choice to helm a movie that's geared on nostalgia. Still, Bruce Willis still brings a commanding presence as John McClane even as the ridiculous action scenes and stunts satisfy.<br/><br/>Willis gets into the wrong place at the wrong time after 12 years as McClane when the FBI orders him to bring in computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) for questioning after someone hacked into the organization's computer systems. But something more is at stake, because the real threat lies in the hands of Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a vengeful computer expert, who uses the flaws of the US' system to his advantage. To make matters worse, Gabriel takes McClane's daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hostage.<br/><br/>Despite the silliness of the plot and the preposterous stunts, everything comes natural in the sense that it takes not much to suspend disbelief. The motivation is well-defined and the idea to blend retrospection with modern day technology works. Expertly shot and paced, McClane is also supported by solid performances from Olyphant, Long, Winstead and Maggie Q. Kevin Smith does well in a small role.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 4.0"" is smart enough not to take itself seriously and it gets you going for McClane even when he improbably dodges from the bullets and outrageously walk away from all those crashes and falls with just scratches. It's a summer popcorn movie that delivers - it's bloated, it's silly and it's fun."
"gutterstar","9","1","3","4 July 2007"," Die Another Time.
","Can not even John McClane, in his fictional universe, escape the impact of 9/11? Bad enough that the tragedy is used as an excuse for cracking down on civil liberties in every country with a so-called-democracy, the term crops up in loads of films as some kind of premise  further proof that we live in a ""post nine eleven"" world. In a culture where blockbusters are so worshipped, it's amazing we don't look back more often to the terrorists in the first three Die Hard films and see that they, like in the new film, are not Muslims. The string of oppressive laws that have come in across the Western world have all but made people like Live Free or Die Hard baddie Thomas Gabriel invisible. Of course there's still a glimmer of bad Germans present.<br/><br/>Then there's the title, which is taken from New Hampshire's state motto (sans Hard). In the past 6 years the term freedom has, more than ever before, become a meaningless arrow in the quiver of politicians, and many people have followed them. We increasingly believe in the freedom to act, and not the freedom of others from the consequences of those actions. Our freedom to drive, our freedom to constantly upgrade computers made in sweatshops from rare materials then ship them to ""e-dumps"" back in China. But as the film shows, our reliance makes us vulnerable. It leads to spectacular action sequences inside tunnels when traffic lights are fiddled with and it might involve crashing into a helicopter but it makes us vulnerable. This is beyond oil.<br/><br/>The film doesn't overtly make these points, you'll be happy to know. John McClane isn't the one doing the techno-talk. It's evident his knowledge of computers is limited to strapping explosives to them and throwing them down lift shafts. To help him fight the keyboard-killers he has Matt Farrell, played by Justin Long, and the hacker-genius-in-his-mothers-basement is wheeled out again in Warlock, played by Kevin Smith (doing a dream role, no doubt). What's great about the plot of Live Free or Die Hard though, is that the technicalities are understandable without being unimpressive. In other words, we aren't made to feel stupid, in a genre notorious for being stupid. Further indicating that McClane has aged is the inclusion of his daughter, who's the same age as his teenage partner. Luckily, the film is so exciting by the time the daughter saving storyline eventually begins that it isn't too cliché - we just want to see Willis do his thing.<br/><br/>That said, it's hard to explain the lowered rating as anything other than the ugly face of cinema capitalism. There was so much swearing in Die Hard With a Vengeance that for McClane to have now eliminated the word 'f***' from his vocabulary (even after 12 years) he would have to have calmed his life down so much that he certainly wouldn't still be a cop. When he utters the franchise line ""Yippee Ki Yay Motherf*****"" and the curse is shielded, it's as much because the line has become a throwback to the original Die Hard era - rather than the original throwback to Cowboy America - as it is because of the hypocritical US-rating system. Without the other films it's gibberish, which never would have sold the original as it has done in the advertising for this new outing. Are we really to believe its full inclusion would have made for a better film? <br/><br/>There are a couple of fair strikes against the film that could be overshadowed by the bickering over the rating. Whilst avoiding the option of Islamic terrorists, the script errs on racism with a more than necessary number of lines where McClane calls Mai Lihn (Maggie Q) an ""Asian hooker bitch"" when she just happens to be an Asian terrorist. So McClane might not want to hear about globalization politics and corporate-owned media, fair enough, but if the action film is typified by anything, it's a clear good guy. Such remarks are pointless (although they eventually bite the character in the ass). Also, when compared to the previous three installments, John McClane's motivation to save the day isn't as forced on him (it's only after he becomes a thorn in Gabriel's side that it becomes personal). The FBI & co() contains some well-rounded characters (much like the series' fourth villain), but they don't really do much. But the one-man action show is all right when a third sequel featuring a popular protagonist is this great, avoiding cheese and reliance on legacy with smart-aleck lines and original stunts in all the right proportions. Perhaps a fifth film is not out of the question, although thankfully, in terms of waiting for it, in another dozen years McClane will really be past it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Action, action, and more action. Just when you thought you saw the coolest stunt and most unbelievable action sequence... wait, there's more.<br/><br/>John McClane has found himself in the center of it all again. In ""Die Hard"" it was a high rise in L.A., ""Die Hard 2"" was O'Hare airport in Chicago, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was the entire city of New York, and now he is defending the entire country via the entire east coast. He can only go international from here, or inter-planetary.<br/><br/>The movie has a good up to date story line that lends feasibility and relevance. We are in the digital age, so now it is all about cyber crimes. McClane, like in ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", has an unwilling participant that he is dragging along. Matt Farrell, played by Justin Long (better known for his Apple commercials), does an excellent job as the computer hacking geek that is being dragged around by John McClane until he can get some answers.<br/><br/>As good as the movie was, and as awesome as the action was, it just couldn't quite outdo ""Die Hard"". In ""Die Hard"" he was younger, the movie was a little less destructive, it was more believable, and how could you not like Alan Rickman as the bad guy. Still, LFoDH was very entertaining and had plenty of wow moments. It was exactly what you expect from a summer movie."
"rohan107","9","1","3","2 July 2007"," ...a truly good action movie after a long time!! John McClane! You did it!
","Lately (in 2007) there have been greatly disappointing Hollywood action flicks. All these supposedly action movies were less action and more crappy romance. Most of the time action gave way for romantic unneeded tearjerkers and what not. But the dearth of all the action of 2007 seems to have been taken care by one Mr. John McClane in Die Hard 4.0. Once again, the 'Yippie kay Yay' super cop, John McClane does it in good ol' way in Live Free or Die Hard...or Die Hard 4.0. Saying that this show is action packed would be an understatement. It is 'action every single minute of the movie' would be a more appropriate statement.Let's begin. What happens when a highly skilled team of hackers led by one of the most technically proficient programmer/hacker decides to prove a point. Well, ""Die Hard 4.0"" happensKiddingnah not really. That is the plot of the movie. Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant)  the Black Hat hacker- the bad guy, if you mayand his team of hackers decide to bring US of A to the knees by doing a Fire Sale attack. In hacking terms, a Fire Sale attack means to disrupt the transportation systems, steal financial records and siphon of huge amounts of money and disable public utilities (Electricity, Gas, Water). And as Thomas Gabriel does exactly that in a very well planned manner, chaos reigns throughout USA. Traffic signals stop functioning creating traffic jams all over NYC. Cars pile up in tunnel as Thomas Gabriel plays with the transportation system. Stocks plummet at Wall Street creating panic amongst the traders. Telecommunications networks are jammed and are in total control of the hackers. It gets worst at night. Cities plunge into darkness as USA is taken off the grid, zip code at a time. Everything stops functioning. Big Apple, DC and other cities literally come to standstill and are at the mercy of the hacker.(Too much automation has its disadvantages too) Now for the good guys - John McClane (Bruce Willis) aided by a young computer hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long) decide to take on Thomas Gabriel and Co. It is a mighty task and both of them compliment each other well. John McClane shows why he is a super-cop and Matt Farrell brings his forte of hacking skills to chip in his bit. Not one instant in the movie does one get respite from the action. Crashing cars and choppers, bullets and bombs, acrobatic fights, death defying stunts, high speed chases, zooming F35's and many more make Die Hard 4.0 a true action thriller Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of Final Destination 3 fame) plays John's daughter. And nope, she doesn't indulge in any romance! Thanks Len!She is a cop's girl and she behaves like oneAnywaysI can keep going on and onCan't help itA truly good hacking movie (since Swordfish) and an excellent action movie after a long time. It is a must watch in theatres. I repeatA 'must' watch. Rating 9/10."

","When the Sept 11. attacks occurred, the slam-bam, action adventure film genre seemed in poor taste, deader than a doornail and needed no eulogy since glory-loving politicos and bluenose parents groups crucified films that were over-sized, vile, bloody comic books, without the powers or costumes.<br/><br/>Me? Reality and fantasy need boundaries, despite the violent actions of religious fanatics or alienated young men. Being a budding screenwriter, I find censorship of creative expression a form of social cowardice. Social cowardice is a communal disease that neither discriminates nor halts, and there'll be no one to write a proper, honest eulogy for the human race.<br/><br/>That said, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" has a pretty big window directed at the world today while being the fourth chapter (in 12 years), of the irascible, ""no quitting allowed"" NYC magistrate, John McClane (Bruce Willis). Under orders from the FBI, he's assigned to play bounty hunter, fetching Matthew Farrell (a dimpled Justin Long of ""Accepted""), a shut-in computer hacker (is there any other kind?), since a lot of hackers across the nation are being liquidated, C4-style. The murders are the doing of sacked government IT expert Thomas Gabriel (a sharkish Timothy Olyphant of ""Deadwood"" and ""Catch and Release""), who wants to electronically shut down America's infrastructure. Guess who has to be the fly in the ointment? <br/><br/>At 130 minutes and composed by director Len Wiseman (the ""Underworld"" films) and scribes Mark Bomback and David Marconi, the fourth ""Die Hard"" is something Sam Peckinpah, the late master of modern action films, would helm since Mr. Willis (a recent, fun character actor in films like ""Frank Miller's Sin City"", ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and the maltreated-by-audience gem, ""Grindhouse"") has McClane, while fighting the bad guys, as an outdated ""cowboy"" in the 21st century, scowling rightfully at humanity's infant-like reliance on technology and ""who given a damn"" loss of the human spirit. A surprise and an echo of Ronald Starr's Heck Longtree from Peckinpah's ""Ride The High Country"", Long's Ferrell is a stubborn anemic, a cyberspace lay about, but he has to help end the ""fire sale"" (the computer term of an national infrastructure's shutdown), since it's no flaming bag of poop on a porch.<br/><br/>Like his James-Bond villain-like predecessors, Mr. Olyphant's a dastardly rogue, flanked by martial artists Maggie Q (""Jackie Chan's Gen-Y Cops"") and Cyril Raffaelli (the breathless ""District B13"") Added touches are done by series fan and shameless fan boy auteur Kevin Smith (the View Askew saga, Olyphant's co-star in ""Release"") as a mama's boy hacker who's adversarial towards authority figures (he and Mr. Willis should work together again) and lovely starlet Mary Elizabeth Winstead (also of ""Grindhouse"") as McClane's estranged daughter who doesn't want to play the helpless muse/hostage for the bad guys. She's sweet and knows how to sucker punch.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating's the only true visible flaw, because giving it to the recent chapter of a R-rated film saga is like giving a tiger a baby bonnet to wear. Sure, money must be fleecedI mean earned from the teen audience, but R-rated films, I fear, will be like NC-17-rated films, barely made and unmarketable. Then PG-13 and PG-rated films will fall. Only decent, family-oriented film will be made, and the disease will never stop, unless some people like me will scream bloody hell and a half. Guess I'll wait for the unrated DVD version, but this film, like McClane, has a loud bark and bite.<br/><br/>Is it better than the last three? Nah. Despite the shadow of real terrorism, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is a good, damn fun addition."
"dfranzen70","8","1","3","1 July 2007"," Heart-racing, pulse-quickening fun
","I ask you, could anyone BUT Bruce Willis play John McClane? Of course not. Even twelve years after his last appearance, McClane is still the all-American, G.I. Joe, Bad Guy killah with a soft spot for his family but also for Doing the Right Thing. Here, he's up against a madman (Timothy Olyphant) bent on virtually hacking his way into the U.S. infrastructure to prove some kind of point, or something. Whatever. It doesn't matter. All that matter is that McClane kicks ass. That's all we want to see.<br/><br/>All McClane has to do, see, is pick up a kid in Camden, New Jersey, and schlep him down to Washington in the middle of the night. Sounds like a job for a rookie cop, right, but of course a senior detective was requested. And it seems this kid, Matt Farrell (Justin Long) is some kind of super-sekrit hacker dude person who's wanted for questioning by the FBI, something about a major attack on government computers earlier that day. Of course, other people are looking for Farrell (i.e., the bad guys), and they blow everything up trying to get him and, by extension, McClane. They fail.<br/><br/>Then the madman, Thomas Gabriel, sets his evil, evil plan further in motion by causing all of the traffic lights in DC to go green. Cackling with glee, he causes the stocks at the NYSE to plummet! Mass chaos ensues! Meanwhile, McClain's trying to shepherd his young charge to various government offices, trying to find a safe place for him. There aren't any.<br/><br/>Of course, at some point it gets personal between McClane and Gabriel, so the bad guy nabs McClane's teenage daughter, Lucy. Why do bad guys do this? Do they really think the hero will be all, ""Oops, you win, I give up!"" because his family's in jeopardy? Don't evil villains watch movies? Gabriel's lucky, though, because he has a chief minion who can kick ass, Mai (Maggie Q). Naturally, at some point she goes womano-a-mano with McClane, but the only reason she does as well as she does is that a) she's a woman, so she's not your typical henchman and b) she knows kung fu. I mean, of course she does, she's Asian. They all know that stuff, right? A lot of things blow up. You might have seen the trailer, in which McClane speeds a cop car out of a tunnel, and jumps out at the last minute as the car slams into the side of a hovering helicopter. Pretty nifty stuff, if not even a little believable. Often, McClane will do something that winds up hurting him pretty bad, with blood dripping down his face and all, but he's fine, no, let him just walk it off.. or jump down a flight of stairs, or run down the street. It's all good, because he's the hero. We expect him to shrug off pain and injury to vital organs. But when the pilot of the chopper falls at least thirty feet and is perfectly okay, I dunno, I'm a little skeptical.<br/><br/>But it's okay, because little implausibilities won't bother you. The thing to note is that Willis, his smirk, his I-ain't-taking-no-crap attitude, they're all back. And, good news, there aren't a lot of side comments about McClane's age, mostly because he kicks the asses of people half as old. Willis looks like he's still in tip top fighting shape. He's not paunchy, or graybearded. He looks a lot like he did in 1995, so good on him.<br/><br/>Wonderful visual effects and another gritty, appealing, and above all fresh performance from Willis, who clearly looks into the role - he's not sleepwalking through it, as you might expect an aging action star to do, just collecting a paycheck. I swear, the man looks like he's enjoying getting shot at. He rocks. But it wouldn't matter how into the role Willis was if the plot was too convoluted to follow, or too simplistic to warrant attention, or if the rest of the cast was so wooden that you kind of wished they'd all get mowed down. And that's where Long came in. Part victim, part sidekick, total hacker, Long was perfectly cast, a good complement - useful without being annoying. Tough to find people like that in action movies."
"DonFishies","7","1","3","30 June 2007"," Issues aside, twelve years has done a worthy amount of good for John McClane
","Being a Die Hard fan, I was a bit skeptical about a new sequel coming almost twelve years after the last one. Everything has changed so much, and Bruce Willis has done very little since, and it just did not seem like that great of an idea to resurrect John McClane after so long. But as the trailers and the publicity machine started to unpackage itself, I got pretty excited for it. The PG-13 rating put a little damper on my enthusiasm for seeing the film (after all, the same thing happened with Alien vs. Predator a few years back, and look how atrocious that film was), but I pressed on, hoping for the best.<br/><br/>As Live Free or Die Hard opens, a group of cyber-technologists is rounding up some of America's hackers to write codes for them. Soon after, the technologists (now clearly cyber terrorists) hack into the FBI mainframe, setting off a red flag for the Feds. They ask for senior law enforcement officials around the country to pick up the most renowned hackers, and John McClane (Willis) just happens to be called on to pick up Matt Farrell (Justin Long). As he does, a hit squad is sent to kill Farrell, and McClane of course, saves him. Not knowing the purpose of the pick-up, McClane is soon thrust into a plot that could completely obliterate any ground the United States has created for themselves after 9/11.<br/><br/>Yeah, it sounds like a bit much for a Die Hard movie, but it most definitely pays off.<br/><br/>To start, Live Free or Die Hard truly is a Die Hard film, despite the change in rating. McClane is still a wise-ass cracking jokes and taking out bad guys at every turn. Even after the absence, Willis still has just enough finesse to pull off the role that made him a star almost twenty years ago. He may have aged, but this is still the McClane everyone remembers. Yes, his signature line does get cut rather abruptly, but he still provides just enough kicks for the audience to remember why the character was so popular to begin with.<br/><br/>As well, the action does not let up for much of the movie. I was afraid that the rating meant they had to sacrifice some of the more intense and violent scenery known to the series, but thankfully, it remains intact and just as strong as ever. Thrilling sequences abound throughout the movie (although the trailers do a bit too much of a revealing of one of the best ones), and all are well choreographed and edited onto screen. The use of CGI is apparent, but thanks to some of the clever editing, it is few and far between, making the action look more realistic and energized than ever before.<br/><br/>The story, while seemingly better thought out than other long-awaited sequels like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is far fetched. There are a lot of points that will either make you truly question the realism, and some that just feel tacky and ridiculous. The terrorist threat, no matter how frightening it may sound, has more than a handful of problems in its execution. But nonetheless, the filmmakers do valiantly try their best with the material, and for the most part, do fairly well with it. I did indeed enjoy a lot of the ideas brought to the table during the film, but not all of them gel together like they should.<br/><br/>What also does not work is the padding the film gets between the action sequences. The action is fast and furious, but when the story is being fleshed out, there were more than a few instances where the film just slows to a halt. I like the little character moments the previous three films offered, but here, they really do not do a lot for any of the characters. The extra material is obvious for McClane and helps make his older character seem a lot more useful than he should be, but the fleshing out of the likes of his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the main villain, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), do nothing for their characters. They still seem one-dimensional even as true character-building moments come and go. Their lifeless expressions and dull performances say it all. It is a bit bizarre, but it really damages the smaller character importance the other three films carried.<br/><br/>Long on the other hand, delivers a worthwhile performance as Farrell, and offers some genuine counter-programming to Willis' hard-assedness. He is nowhere near as strong a ""sidekick"" as the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, but he does well for himself anyway. Supporting performances from Maggie Q, Cliff Curtis and the intriguingly well-placed Kevin Smith are all very well done for their small amount of time on-screen.<br/><br/>For all of my liking of the return of McClane, and the balls-to-the-wall action sequences, I feel a small shudder of disappointment in the editing. While much of it is very well done, it is almost blatantly obvious where certain scenes have been stripped of their violence and language. Yes, a surprising amount of both appear on-screen (McClane would not be McClane if he was not covered in blood and not using profuse swearing), but a few moments appear where you can clearly see the words not matching the actor's lips, or where there looks to be more of a scene then there is. It is inevitable that the film will have an R-rated or Unrated DVD, but to make it so blatantly obvious during the film, just stinks of bad film-making.<br/><br/>Editing and character issues aside, Live Free or Die Hard is a solid action flick and a worthy predecessor to the Die Hard name. Anyone who has doubts about it living up to its name will be glad to hear that twelve years of absence has done John McClane good.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

Overall a good action packed summer movie that is down with our times perfect because of the ever growing concerns of terrorism and computer hacking."

","Of the 4 Die Hards I'd rate this no:3, after 1&3. While it's not as good as 1&3 it's way ahead of 2. So much for ranking it! In this latest version John Mclane is older, balder, but still a bad ass! The movie doesn't attempt to fill us in on anything about his last 12 years, other than the fact that he's trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter...by ruining her love life. The action starts right up and off we go. The movie is a delicious ludicrous joy ride, that borrows heavily from every other major CGI blockbuster: True lies; MI 1,2 &3, Terminator3 etc. The plot is paper thin, and the holes in it are effortless to punch, but Willis holds it all together with his wry presence.<br/><br/>They've decided to go with nobody's in secondary roles, or at least nobody's to an older aficionado. The worst casting is of the bad guy, who does not have the acting muscle to compete with Rickman and Irons. He looks like Liotta with better skin, but is as menacing as a California surfer! The lack of a decent protagonist for Willis is a major weakness; and I miss Bedelia. The star is of course the CGI's. Nothing new here; lots of car and truck crashes; the obligatory helicopter crash; and of course the collapse of an overpass; and apparently we now have a fighter plane that can maneuver like a helicopter (the F-35B, which is to replace the Harrier)."

","After seeing the preview, this movie looked interested, but a bit on the over-the-top ridiculous side. I saw this opening day at the 1st show at a nearby theatre and was completely surprised at how entertaining and well put together this movie was for a simple formula action flick. First, the story is definitive Die Hard. It matches well with the previous installments and comes with a cohesive plot. In addition, the FX aren't ruined with CGI garbage. The unrealistic action sequences that occur in this movie aren't warped with lazy computer work. On the negative side, there were two silly sequences in the film, one in a city tunnel with 4 lanes of vehicles on a collision course and another on the top of a marine fighter jet, but it is an otherwise well put together actioner.<br/><br/>The movie was also well cast. John McClane is the character Bruce Willis was born to play. This vehicle works so well for Bruce because he doesn't really have to act to play McClane, it's his own personality amped up a bit. Justin Long was perfect as Matthew Farrell, sarcastic, aloof, overwhelmed, and funny in his helter-skelter sort of way, and provided many well-timed light moments. Cliff Curtis was solid as Bowman, the Homeland Security g-man trying to sort out the mess dropped in his lap, Timothy Olyphant gets better film by film and really proved as worthy an adversary as Jeremy Irons's Simon and Alan Rickman's Hans. If you can survive Maggie Q's beauty yet flat rendition of Olyphant's right hand and the oddly placed cameo of Kevin Smith.<br/><br/>Overall, well done addition to the Die Hard family that sits between parts 1 & 3 and ahead of part 2."

"pawsha57","9","1","3","28 June 2007"," PG-13.... I barely even noticed.
","Some sequels that are edited down to a more family friendly rating (I.E. Robocop 3, AVP, and any number of crappy remakes to R-rated films) simply come off as corny by comparison to the more hardcore, F-word five times a minute entries in the series. Generally it's a bad thing for the fans since rather than stay true to the fan base it already has, the studio wants to make the film less violent and more appealing to everyone. However, this particular film didn't miss a beat. I'll be honest I've been watching the Die Hard movies since I was a kid and know them pretty well, and I forgot all about the fact that it was PG-13. The action is truly spectacular with a lot of explosions that actually happen, rather than CGI. Which I thought was great and kind of ironic being that it's a movie about computer terrorists. Yes, it goes more over the top than ever, with McClane escaping death numerous times in even more impossible ways , but it's not meant to be realistic. It's meant to be entertaining, and it certainly achieves that and then some. Bruce Willis is terrific as an older, bitter, seemingly sober John McClane. His reactions to the geeky computer hackers in the film are hilarious. It would have been nice to see the return of older characters in the film, (every sequel talks about his ex-wife but she's never there, and it seemed that the third film was hinting at them getting back together) but it doesn't hurt it too much. Justin Long did very well as the wimpy comic relief, and the bad guys were, well, clever at least. I didn't think Timothy Olyphant lived up to some of the past villains, but he did fine and he caused more destruction than they did. Overall this movie exceeded my expectations and really didn't feel toned down at all. If anything it seemed like they upped the action and violence. The only difference is the missing F-words and it didn't bother me in the least. It's not like they replaced them with ""gosh"" and ""darn"". Nope, after all these years McClane is still kickin' ass with the best of them."
"DCJerzeygrl","Null","1","3","28 June 2007"," Random thoughts....
","Here are my random thoughts after viewing this film:<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is a class act! <br/><br/>Justin Long has his great moment in an On-Star bit with Bruce. It's obvious Kevin Smith absolutely loved doing this film and he played his part perfectly. Timothy Olyphant, who plays the snarky antagonist, is an all-around good guy. Len Wiseman did well to hire Acrobat/Stunt Coordinator, Cyril Raffaelli (District 13) as a bad guy.<br/><br/>This could have been a perfect 10, but it still delivers enough sarcasm, bullets, explosions, kicks and punches to make it well worth your time. A solid summer flick."
"sullibrandon","8","1","3","28 June 2007"," An excellent summer popcorn flick
","Admit it. When you first heard that they were making a Die Hard 4, you probably thought it was one of the worst ideas ever. I know it's what I thought. Live Free or Die Hard is, of course, not as good as the original (come on, you had to know a lot of Bruce Willis's talk was just hype) but it is the second best in the series, staying absolutely true to its roots and giving us a solid popcorn spectacle.<br/><br/>Justin Long is Matthew Farrell - a genius computer hacker who is the only one left alive after a criminal mastermind and his posse murder seven of his friends and then come after him. Assigned to escort him back to headquarters for questioning is John McClane, the same bad-a** mother****** we knew back in the old days. Kind of cocky, but self-assured and anti-authority like we like him. The action begins about ten minutes in and barely ever lets up from there. The storyline is a bit simple and preposterous, of course - a ring of American terrorists plan a digital Armageddon - but it's a perfect excuse for the spectacular action and believable enough that most people can accept it.<br/><br/>There are two things that sell this movie, and if either of them had sucked, it would have been complete crap. Bruce Willis and action. The best part about the action is that it is refreshingly devoid of CGI. It is hardcore, intense, and pulse-pounding. What you see is literally what you get. Bruce Willis jumping out of a car at 25 miles per hour? Actually happened. Smashing a car into a helicopter? Actually happened. However, the action is only the secondary star - the real power behind this film comes from the one and only Bruce. The film is dead in the water until the arrival of Bruce.<br/><br/>As everyman cop John McClane who forgot his shoes and went traipsing around on some broken glass in 1988, Willis resonated with the audience in his performance. He was not some superhero - his struggles were real, he made mistakes, and he got bloodied, broken, and bruised for it. One of the things I did not enjoy about this movie was how McClane was less of a real character and more of a legend - he's not such an everyman anymore. But even if the script doesn't make him out to be an everyman, Bruce Willis's performance could have fooled me. Nobody can spout out gallows humor one-liners like this guy. Every single one of his lines drew a huge laugh from the audience, and his carefree and fun attitude with everything only made him more endearing. This is a man who has been through hell and back - and it hasn't fazed him. The only reason he's less of an everyman is because we've known him for awhile, so he seems like something of a superhero. But it's not his fault he's lived through some pretty terrible crap. He is simply a man who loves his country and will do his absolute best to protect it - he just does what he needs to do, and why not have fun doing it? This is still John McClane, and Bruce Willis's performance is perfect.<br/><br/>All except three of the rest of the cast is forgettable. Justin Long as the hacker started out annoying, but he quickly became endearing and his great chemistry with Bruce Willis really helped the movie - you can tell that the actor was kind of intimidated by being in a movie with Bruce Willis, but it only helped his performance, because the character would have every reason to be scared of McClane. Timothy Olyphant as the villain was not bad, but he wasn't super amazing either. Alan Rickman, the villain in the first film, was absolutely wonderful and perfect in every way. He relished the role and made it more memorable than it might otherwise have been. For the first half of this movie, the villain is mostly boring and uninteresting, but when he begins to get more screen-time I sensed a genuinely villainous character that was being played with a lot of fun. Sometimes it bordered too close to the typical calm bad guy showing how evil he is because he's so calm, but overall it was a fairly impressive performance, and any performance can seem bad when it follows the incomparable Alan Rickman. The other notable cast member was only a cameo, but it was hilarious and perfect and I won't spoil it for you because the surprise upon seeing this person is half the fun.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard may be the best popcorn flick this summer yet.It hearkens back to simply fun days of action cinema. Movies like Aliens, Raiders of the Lost Ark, or the original Die Hard, were hardcore, uncompromising movies, none of which had the handicap of CGI, but which still stand as some of the greatest action movies of all time. Live Free or Die Hard may not be among them as one of the greatest, but it is still an efficiently executed summer popcorn flick that knows exactly what it wants to deliver and succeeds in every possible way. It's a movie that'll have you shouting, ""Yipee-kay-yay mother******!"""

","Martial Arts, Comic Book Heroes, Athletes trying to become even more famous, Unnecessary Slow Motion, Vampires fighting Werewolves, Video Game Adaptations. <br/><br/>What is modern action become? <br/><br/>It really doesn't matter. Action is dying.<br/><br/>And this is why I was partially excited when I heard that McClane was coming back. The return of Die Hard finally meant some action without the usual crap that drags down modern cinema. It is just too bad that this usual crap fills seats and clears shelves. With his return, McClane would bring us violence, bad language, blood, guns, explosions, quotable one-liners, crazy foreign villains and cigarettes. McClane forgot a lot of stuff when he showed up on Wednesday. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" stars Bruce Willis (Armageddon, Whole Nine Yards)as, the ""always in the wrong place at the wrong time"" NYPD Detective, John McClane. This time around we find McClane trying foil a sinister internet-terror plot overseen by the underrated Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood, Catch and Release). At first I wasn't too excited about watching the hardened McClane battle a madman, but a line from the film actually changed my mind. ""You're a Rolex watch in a digital age."" <br/><br/>Why not follow Det. McClane as he f***s up some Hackers (Seeing as this it's a PG-13 Movie I will restrict my half-ass-ed review to one F-Bomb, too). I've always been fascinated with the battle of technology and human drive. And isn't McClane just an exaggeration of a human being. Flawed, loaded with vices. If you shoot him, does he not bleed? And besides, what else is there for McClane to best? <br/><br/>My two main concerns going into this film were that of the PG-13 Rating and the director, Len Wiseman (Underworld, Underworld Evolution). Did I mention that I hate ""Underworld""? Well, I do. I hate those films. Damn anyone that attempts to tell me they are any good. Now, that I got the mean out, I will move on. I was terrified that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was going to be filled with unnecessary slow motion, bad cinematography and Scott Speedman slapping the camera. I was relieved to see that it wasn't like that at all. I could see the similarities but, nothing too terrible.<br/><br/>My good friend in cinema, Ash, just called me. He just got out of watching ""Live Free or Die Hard"". Ash liked it. He wasn't too negative. He saw the positive. We had a nice twenty minute discussion about it and I once again realized something. Sure action is dying but at least it was going down long before ""Live Free or Die Hard"" came out So, I'm just gonna speed this up and state that I enjoyed ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is was a good movie. Not Great. And certainly not a Die Hard film. But the most important thing about this movie is that it didn't take anything away from the original trilogy that convinced me to smoke, taught me that plane rides and hangovers give you superpowers and remind me to this day that, ""He wasn't lying about Marco.""<br/><br/>I'll be a white knight and give this baby a 6, sorry guys I still need a little language and blood with my DIE HARD."

","The fourth film of this saga is full of action from beginning to end without stopping, with very fast editing and transitions (which has already become the norm in action films) and shaky camera instead of smother shots (a tendency that already begins to irritate), the performances are nothing special and the villain does not convey the threat of the predecessors, while the argument is totally unrealistic (I write this in 2017 - 10 years after the movie - and there is yet to happen a cyber terrorist attack on such a scale) and John McClane (Bruce Willis) looks more like an indestructible superhero with superpowers because he survives situations even more impossible to survive than in the previous films. As if all the action was not too stupid and unrealistic enough already, the way he kills the villain beats all the records of stupidity that has anytime been seen in film or reality. Good action movie to entertain, but easily forgettable compared to the decent predecessors. And I give 3/10 and not less just in recognition of the enormous work that must have cost to make this movie."

He doesn't even have many survival skills. He is just a cop. And an alcoholic cop at that. There's no way he can survive a harrier attack from 200 feet away! Nor would he just duck to avoid getting crushed by a flying car. Very poor writing creates very poor movies. He's not trained like Rambo. Don't make him become one. <br/><br/>This movie is only watchable for Maggie Q, who is quite sexy. I really can't buy her beating up a nerdy teenage kid, let alone an adult male, but I'll let it slide just because I have a crush on her. Besides that, the movie is unwatchable and don't waste your time unless you like horrible movies with plots that are extremely highly unlikely. <br/><br/>I gave it a 3 simply because a lot of movie was poured into making it.

","""Live Free or Die Hard"" is an inept action movie from cinematic ultra-hack Len Wiseman. Like its predecessors, the film stars Bruce Willis as a cranky cop who's having the worse damn day of his life. His problem? Bad guys and doing bad stuff. His solution? Stop bad guys.<br/><br/>The first three ""Die Hard"" movies belonged to a now dead era. An era before your granny had a cell phone and before every bad guy on the planet had a laptop that allows him to hack into NASA. Better yet, they all featured Willis as a regular guy – wisecracking but believable - trapped in a confined space, faced with ludicrous problems and with nothing at his disposal. ""Live Free"" throws out this formula, and instead takes place across an entire country, gives Willis lots of assistance, problems he can walk away from and of course saddles him with a PG13 rating. Throw in copious bad CGI, and an aesthetic which looks like CCTV footage of blue cement, and you have yet another feature-length reason to revoke Wiseman's directorial license.<br/><br/>2/10 - Try harder."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","4","22 February 2013"," Pretty solid movie to the ""Die Hard"" franchise
","This is actually a solid ""Die Hard"" sequel to the franchise. It's probably the 3rd best in the series so far unless ""Die Hard 6"" can change that. This time it's about virtual terrorism where the main villain actually comes off slightly reasonable in some way. Not saying what he does in this movie is right but it's understandable. This movie has some cool action set pieces that is coherent to the plot and doesn't seem all that forced in. Sure some parts may seem a bit too coincidental but that element applies in all the ""Die Hard"" movie so far. It clearly show that the director actually put some effort into what the ""Die Hard"" movies are about. John McClane(Bruce Willis) is at the peak of what he does best in this movie although he is getting old and lost all his hair. And he still is a smartass that knows how to tick off the bad guys. His sidekick this time, yeah this time it's more of a sidekick than a partner compared to ""Die Hard 3"". And his sidekick is played by Justin Long who is this computer wiz that knows a lot about technology and he is one of those pedantic characters. He starts off kinda annoying but becomes somewhat likable as the movie progresses. So it's basically a team up between a tough badass and a weak computer nerd that knows a lot about technology. And they need each other to take down the main villain played by Timothy Olyphant. Who is this technology mastermind, especially when it comes to state security. So it basically becomes a battle between a guy that uses fists and gun and the other using brain and few henchmen, but mainly his brain. Even the main villain's henchman or henchwoman stands out to a degree. One is played by Cyril Raffaelli who is this Parkour genius in real life and shows hist stunts in this movie. And Maggie Q who is this more badass main villain's chick version of the one from ""Die Hard 3"". Overall this is a cool action packed movie and a good enough sequel that is worth seeing. It's a shame that ""Tranformers"" the movie directed by Michael Bay came out the same year and took all the spotlight. Oh and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is in this as John McClane's daughter who is basically a damsel in distress but a tough and feisty damsel in distress. Who is basically kind of a plot device to give John McClane more of a motivation and to bring his father like side out.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

All chrome and concrete, DH4 has jaw-dropping set pieces, improbable but believable stunts and destruction galore. the CGI of stunt and vehicle and even freeway vs plane antics (like from TRUE LIES) is absurdly hilarious and crowd pleasing. Why the bad guys just did not kill Mclane's daughter when they first had her is one of those silly plot holes like you would get in any dopey spy film (as Austin Powers would point out).

It turns out that this is most probably the best action movie to come out of the 21st century. Gone are the movies like Lethal Weapon, Speed or Face/Off. Those movies were popular in the 90s but Hollywood decided to stop making those type of movies entering the 21st century. We rarely see those type of action packed movies anymore where the good guys get the bad guys.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed when i went to watch this movie in the theater. The action got going right from the start and it didn't stop right to the end of the movie. This time John Mclane has a hacker as a partner played by Justin Long. Justin was convincing as the hacker because he does have a nerdy type of look in him and always play those type of characters in his previous movies. One thing i did not like about this movie is the villain. Timothy Olyphant does not look like a villain to me, he did not give a memorable 'villain' role in the movie like Alan Rickman did in the 1st or Jeremy Irons in the 3rd.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was great to watch and i have watched it more than once.

Even the Dad / Daughter line does not convince me too much and the whole movie stands alone like a nice showcase of good studio effects. All those viruses, blown up helicopters, cars and shoot outs are great, but they seem a bit senseless and only serve as a good trap, not making you think or wanting to watch it again. Hope, the 5.0 will not take place in space..."

John McLane--an outstanding figure fighting evil.it is one of my heroes.All the other actors are good too..keeping the spectator entertained and it makes the movie a lot better when u see new (old) faces as well.Some action scenes might prove too strong and impossible but it is just a part of the entertaining ... I would watch it again just for the fun of seeing Gabriel's face when he finds out his girl is....well...that's a spoiler. Go watch it if u haven't ..just great action entertainment !"

","This movie was a great balance of action and comedy. It was a complete surprise for me. I have always been a die hard fan, but this movie great. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. It kept my full attention. It had me wondering what they were going to do next throughout the entire movie. Bruce did his thing in this movie. The bad guys had no chance. I really want to say that this was the best Die Hard yet. This also was the most elaborate storyline. I thought seeing transformers would have ruined this movie for me, but this movie was amazing. Bottom line is, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out big time."

","The fourth Die Hard movie was announced in 2003, eight years after John McClane's last screen adventure. There was no apparent progress for next two years. Rumors abounded, such as Jessica Simpson playing McClane's daughter or the two being caught in a terrorist action in the Caribbean. I had my doubts that this project would ever be completed. Even when filming began I was pessimistic, feeling there had been too much turmoil by that time. I saw the film, and have rarely been so delighted that I was wrong.<br/><br/>I do not recommend two of the first three Die Hard films. The first would earn a nod, but too many idiot characters ruined it, and the third is awful. I wanted to see this one nonetheless because I had become endeared to John McClane (Bruce Willis). Willis returns and does so well it seems like there was no twelve year gap between films.<br/><br/>McClane is once again a detective in the NYPD. He no longer abuses alcohol, but suffers anxiety over the well being of his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Lucy shuns her father and insists she be called by her mother's surname.<br/><br/>When the control center at the FBI is temporarily disabled, Bowman (Cliff Curtis), the director of computers, issues orders that every hacker capable of the attack be brought to Washington DC for questioning. McClane, now a respected and trusted officer, is asked to transport New Jersey hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), but runs into trouble when he realizes that somebody desperately wants Farrell dead. That same person activates the anthrax alarm at the computer center, alters the stock market, and penetrates every computer database in the country. His shadow group transmits its threat to the public and pandemonium ensues.<br/><br/>The leader (Timothy Olyphant) keeps watch from his hidden command post while he conducts the country like his personal orchestra. He can use public surveillance cameras to see anywhere in the country, alter natural gas lines, reroute telephone calls, confuse public service, control traffic and more. When McClane and Farrell flee into a tunnel to escape his helicopter, he floods cars into the tunnel from both sides. Farrell believes this faction is using a three step takeover scheme called a ""fire sale."" He realizes that his help may be invaluable since the terrorists may be using a program he wrote.<br/><br/>I have asserted before that films can violate the laws of physics without harm, but once they violate the laws of common sense they lose credibility. This film is a fine example. McClane's body takes a physical beating and he is still able to fight. It is, after all, McClane's adamantine tenacity that lends the title ""Die Hard."" As for the other token, the villain's scheme is frighteningly well-planned. Olyphant's character, whose name I am withholding since it is one of the film's revelations, makes excellent points defending his deeds. I was almost convinced until I was reminded how much destructive chaos his behavior causes. There is only one problem with his plot, and that is McClane.<br/><br/>Olyphant's villain is intellectual and well spoken, just like Hans Gruber from the original ""Die Hard."" Olyphant grants uncanny life to the page and creates a character even more imposing than Gruber. When he is flustered, we believe him; when he can barely control his anger, we believe him. The villain is just as resourceful as McClane and is a first ballot hall of fame antagonist.<br/><br/>As an actor with stage experience, I look at performances differently than the average viewer. I am less concerned about whether or not it should be Oscar nominated than I am towards success within the demands of the character. Indiana Jones is not as difficult to play as Charles Kane, for example. These people are rehearsed professionals and we are not viewing their rough draft. The average Hollywood acting is better than most people want to admit. With that said, most of the performances are above average. Cliff Curtis looks so stressed out I wonder if he needed relaxation therapy when filming concluded.<br/><br/>It is Willis' movie, but Justin Long comes as close as possible to outshining him. Farrell's expression is suppressed by the overwhelming nature of the situation, yet Long nevertheless brings distinctiveness to each emotion within those narrow walls. Willis has the more gripping screen presence, but Long is clearly the better actor.<br/><br/>The one exception is Winstead. She is the perfect physical casting with her resemblance to the child Lucy, but her lack of emotion is too pronounced. Winstead spends most of her time flex cuffed but seems insufficiently distressed by it. Her acting is below average.<br/><br/>I worried that the action would be truncated when I saw the PG-13 rating, but that is not the reality. The staging and choreography are even more praiseworthy from a technical standpoint than they were in the first three. We all know McClane is wrong when he advises Farrell not to bet on him. He has, after all, killed nearly every one of the terrorists at every type of location by that time. There is even the villain's lover (the attractive Maggie Q) who is even more immortal than McClane. One such encounter involves a car slipping down an elevator in a clever reference to the highlight of ""Jurassic Park 2."" Only a highway scene with a Harrier jet does not quite work, but at least it is fun to watch.<br/><br/>The superb execution helps, but the action's context is equally important to adding impact. Repeating all that was good in its predecessors and omitting the bad, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" entertains far beyond the typical summer action movie It can eat the first three for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and rates a nine of ten."
"MovieAddict2016","8","1","4","1 August 2007"," Actually quite good as far as action blockbusters go - very different from the previous films but benefits from not taking itself too seriously
","I was one of many not expecting much from the newest ""Die Hard"" film. I figured it would be an OK action flick - another forgettable summer fare - and when I read that the film had been rated PG-13 it completely solidified my early thoughts that the movie was going to be more for the teen market.<br/><br/>""Live Free"" is interesting for a number of reasons, actually, and the first is its marketing: FOX clearly didn't know how to sell this film. Early on they marketed it as a new-age action film: the trailer showed lots of bodies getting shot, cars flying into the air and exploding, etc. But there was no real humor, sampling of a plot, and worst of all, no indication that John McClane - the seminal everyman hero - was really back. <br/><br/>It backfired and the fans on the 'net complained. One of the most popular suggestions fans offered for another trailer would be to use Beethoven's 9th over the action scenes, which is how the original film was promoted. A few fans (myself included) edited the teaser and replaced the heavy orchestral score with Beethoven's 9th. The result was more in tune with Die Hard - it gave the scenes kind of a lively kick.<br/><br/>The reason I find this interesting is that it turns out both Len Wiseman and Bruce Willis were actively monitoring the Internet forums on various sites and presumably either they, or someone else involved in the production and marketing, actually took the fans' advice for once - the full-length trailer that debuted a few months later featured Beethoven's 9th! Bruce Willis subsequently joined an Internet forum and started chatting to fans. To prove his identity he started a video chat session using his Mac computer - I find this interesting because the same thing is done during one point in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" when John McClane starts a video chat session over the Internet with the villain. <br/><br/>Bruce's dedication to the movie - and his repeated statement that it was ""as good as the original"" and his dismissal of the last two sequels as being bad films - actually got my hopes up a bit because I felt this was an indication that Willis (who, it must be noted, really helped get the film's production off the ground to begin with) must have genuinely loved the movie. He kept mentioning that director Wiseman had brought the franchise into the 21st century, and I didn't like the sounds of that, but after seeing the film I know what he means: this is old-school Die Hard in a new-age setting. <br/><br/>The character development is not nearly as strong as the first and third films, but it is better than the second film's dealings with McClane. The film is so fast-paced that there isn't much time to emphasize personal struggles, but there are a few scenes where McClane discusses being a reluctant hero and I felt this was clearly Wiseman trying to establish a link with the original movie, because the second sequel in particular (and the third to a point) focused less on this aspect. It definitely seemed like something you'd read in a fan-written script. I was originally skeptical of Wiseman's claims that he loved the original movie (didn't Paul Anderson say he loved ""Alien"" and ""Predator""?) but after seeing the movie I believe him.<br/><br/>I also think this is some of the most accurate representation of computers/technology I've seen in any mainstream film - of course some of what happens is very far-fetched, but the little details - such as actually using a mouse to operate computers, recognizing IP addresses, establishing cam chat sessions, etc. - is more accurate than most films, where the people just sit at computers and start typing wildly at keyboards and all types of animated stuff pops up all over their computer screens. I am only noting this in my review because one of the biggest concerns of mine was the fact that the whole ""Internet sabotage"" hacker plot line was interesting for about a year in 1995 when the Internet first started getting off the ground and I really thought using such an old premise for this film would make it feel quite dated, but it's actually rather well done.<br/><br/>And finally, the PG-13 rating: you can see the edits that have been made. You can see the actors mouthing strong obscenities and other words come out of their mouths. And you know, I was really upset at first that the character's catchphrase wouldn't be able to be said in the film because of its rating, but I got so involved in the movie that I didn't _really_ notice the absence of frequent profanity. I do think the fact that they so blatantly edited words out makes the film feel a bit cheaper and less professional, but it's not a big enough deal to make my opinion of the film lower. Y<br/><br/>It is a Die Hard film but it is definitely of modern times and if you really do compare it to the first film, it's amazing how much has changed in about twenty years. The small-scale action in the first film has ballooned into John McClane jumping off an airborne jet and avoiding a huge fireball explosion and taking out helicopters with cars. But it's handled very well and even though it's hugely spectacular and silly it isn't insulting because it doesn't take itself seriously. And the humor is definitely there, too.<br/><br/>I find it hard to consider this to be within the same series of films as the original three, but it's still - on its own accord - a really good action film and I'm actually looking forward to seeing it again, which I never expected to say."

","What can I tell you? Saturday afternoon and I set out for a couple of hours at the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park but halfway there the weather changes and it starts to rain. So, what's playing at the Multiplex today; Die Hard 4.0 whatever that means. How bad can it be and it IS raining. Actually it could have been worse, much worse in fact. It's all about suspending your disbelief and watching the good guy kick the bad guy's ass, just like Roy Rogers, Gene Autry et al used to do way back when except this is the computer age and instead of the cattle baron who wanted to build an empire enclosed by barbed wire or the crooked banker/mayor we now have certified ding dongs who want nothing less than to control the world. Honcho Bruce Willis has a nice line in dry humor and manages to kill about fifty times his bodyweight without getting a hair out of place which is easy for him given that he's bald. For a rainy Saturday afternoon it's just the ticket."

","Die Hard 4.0 was actually a masterpiece of an action movie, sure there's better movies but for an action movie it filled all the criteria; awesome special effects, insane stunts and incredibly unrealistic that the main actor wasn't already dead 10 minutes into the film. It had some great one-liners and some nail-biting scenes. Die Hard 4.0 to me spells out perfect action movie. Now thats just what I thought of it you need to go and check it out because Bruce Willis truly delivers in this film.<br/><br/>Can't wait for another sequel funny if its called Die Hard 4.1 Written by Shehryar."

I've seen the Underwold movies and they were great. I'm glad that Len directed this installment and this might sky rocket his career. Bruce Willis once again pulls off a great performance as John McClane. With new characters and this time, McClane's sexy daughter is in this one. This new installment is one of the good sequels in the past few years and one of the best films of the year. The plot was great, like I said the direction was awesome and very good, the acting was great, the action is perfect. At least there is not cheesy CGI in this film unlike other films.

","Before I review Live Free or Die Hard I have a confession to make: I've never seen the other Die Hard movies that were made in the last 19 years before this one. So I only know about John McClane's most famous line by reputation (and I'm not going to quote it here). Having just said that, I enjoyed most of the action set-pieces (the one with the fighter jet is the only one that seemed too ridiculous to me) and many of the supporting characters and villains. Justin Long and Maggie Q deserve special mention for their entertaining turns as Bruce Willis' sidekick and fight nemesis, respectively. I previously saw Ms. Q in Mission: Impossible III as part of Tom Cruise' team and she's in better use here with her sexy voice, body, and overall kick-ass stance. It's also nice to see that Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter Lucy isn't a complete doormat here. So since I highly enjoyed this latest entry in Willis' highly successful movie series, I may just check one of his previous entries soon maybe starting with the very first one..."

","John McClane is back! <br/><br/>You'd think that after all these years, and after tragedies like 9/11, we'd be disinterested in movie like Die Hard. Fortunately, I'm wrong.<br/><br/>With that being said, this Summer seems more and more like the 90's more and more. McClane is back in theaters, the Simpsons are becoming big news again, Transformers hits the screen (I know it's more of an 80's thing), plus The Smashing Pumpkins, the kings of 90's alternative rock, are releasing their first album in seven years. It's a Summer of nostalgia, which probably makes it more interesting than previous years. Now back to Die Hard.<br/><br/>Now, McClane is back once again. His job is to take a Computer hacker (Justing Long), to D.C. Turns out, he unknowingly helped a Terrorist group (led by Timothy Olyphant), which plots to bring down all internet and government systems. It's up to McClane (who else?) to bring them down. Things grow much worse for him once they kidnap McClane's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).<br/><br/>Now what makes the movie great is that it rarely tries to attach itself to the other movies. No one from the previous movies returns, just McClane. This helps the movie become its own and not some sequel.<br/><br/>Now the plot isn't nearly as good as the original, but I guess it fits well with the computer-driven society we live in. The lead villain, played by Timothy Olyphant, is neither well-written, interesting, or threatening as Alan Rickman or the other villains. But he carries the role well enough not to be a dull. The lead henchman, played by Maggie Q, is pretty much the stereotype of current films, the hot Asian chick who nows karate. Nicely, she dies half-way through to be much of a hassle (plus the whole idea she and Olyphant are lovers is just a stupid clique).<br/><br/>Another flaw is the role of the daughter. While she plays such a minor part in the film up to the kidnapping, her being thrust into the third act seems a little gimmicky (director Len Wisemen, though, is able to work with it well enough to not make it a problem). <br/><br/>McClane, however, is damn perfect. Bruce Willis returns to the role like he never left it. It's nice to see that even in his 50s, he can kick some major ass once again.<br/><br/>Despite some (minor) flaws, the film is a no-holds-par action flick that is able to be above standard action films of today.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","After a very long wait, and watching the original films on DVD far too many times for healthy eyesight, Bruce returns in the franchise that made his name. People forget that Die Hard was released in 1988, Twenty years old next year and was at the cutting edge for stunts at the time. This time they have gone old school, and all the stunts are the real deal, only the jet shown on the trailer is CGI (apparently you cannot fly combat jets low level in US cities, bet they asked) Anyway, when you see the stunts you will gasp, the pauses for plot are not too frequent or wordy, and you see the original John McClane shining through. Yes he is different to the original wise cracker, but people change. If they just did die hard 1 over again, you would be bored and complain. However there are nods in the direction of the first movie, so watch out for them.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliantly directed by Len Wiseman and the entire crew did a fantastic job. If you think, oh just another sequel, it is not, this movie can stand alone and will probably outlast some of this summers poorer offerings."
"zardoz-13","8","1","4","4 July 2007"," One Big Dumb Fun Action Movie!
","Before he starred in ""Die Hard"" back in 1988 as NYPD Detective John McClane, Bruce Willis' chief claim to fame was playing David Addison, Jr., opposite Cybill Shepherd 's Maddie Hayes for four seasons on the ABC-TV comedy series ""Moonlighting."" ""Die Hard"" turned Willis into a superstar, and he reprised the role in ""Die Hard 2"" (1990) and again in 1995 for the far grittier ""Die Hard With A Vengeance."" In ""Underworld"" director Len Wiseman's anti-terrorist thriller ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" Willis revives the alpha male hero that made him into a celebrity, but he looks nothing like he did twelve years ago. Talk about a makeover, NYPD Detective John McClane has lost his hair, his cigarettes, and his locker room profanity. Unlike the previous ""Die Hard"" actioneers which carried edgy R-ratings, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" accommodates a wider audience demographic with a bland PG-13 rating. (Not surprisingly, an unrated ""Die Hard"" is available on DVD with the profanity that the studio snipped from the film.) This means that McClane cannot give the villains a lead headache with a 9mm. Moreover, it means that anything approaching realism has given way to fantasy. The earlier ""Die Hard"" thrillers relied on realism for their high-octane, adrenalin-laced action sequences, but ""Live Free or Die Hard"" shuns realism for the sake of raking in more bucks at the box office. Indeed, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" often resembles a theme park ride as our indestructible hero performs feats above and beyond James Bond. Bruce flies helicopters; Bruce eludes a jet fighter packing missiles that can hover and take aim under and over an array of bridges; and Bruce wields an automobile like a slingshot to demolish the bad guys in a helicopter. Altogether, Bruce pulls America by its chestnuts out of the fire from an ambitious villain that wants to meltdown the country.<br/><br/>Mark Bomback's moth-eaten screenplay draws its inspiration from a 1997 ""Wired"" magazine article inked by John Carlin about the prospect that hackers could trigger an Armageddon against Democracy by exploiting our widespread reliance on computers to run everything in America. Anybody watching movies before 1997 knew that recipe for disaster before the Carlin article. The 1995 Sandra Bullock cyberspace nail-biter ""The Net"" showed that a hacker could steal an individual's identity. The same year that ""The Net"" appeared with its cyberspace threat to privacy, the first Pierce Brosnan 007 epic ""GoldenEye"" boasted a villain who tried to melt down everything in the UK with his cyberspace terrornauts and steal a fortune! Sadly, then, the premise that pits McClane against a brilliant but insane computer whiz with fiendish plans for America has already been done! Worse, ""Scream 2"" nemesis Timothy Olyphant presents only a minor physical threat to McClane. He is nowhere near as lethal as either Alan Rickman in ""Die Hard"" or Jeremy Irons in ""Die Hard With A Vengeance."" Indeed, the surprise ending relies on the villain's woeful ignorance.<br/><br/>The saving grace of ""Live Free and Die Hard"" is its refusal to take itself seriously. Director Len Wiseman has created the ultimate 'big, dumb action movie.' In big, dumb action movies, forty-seven bad guys with automatic weapons can pin the hero in a phone booth and put a hole through everything except him! Not only does Wiseman appropriate these clichés, but also he exaggerates them to such preposterous proportions that you want to howl at his audacity. ""Live Free and Die Hard"" is the kind of movie where the hero has to beat the living daylights out of a villain because it would be too violent for him to just shoot them. For example, when McClane tangles with the villain's girlfriend, Mai Lihn (Maggie Q of ""Rush Hour 2""), a seductive doll with a Ph.D. in cyberspace terrorism and martial arts, he has no more luck knocking her off than the teens did Jason in the ""Friday the 13th"" chillers. When McClane isn't dealing with this dame, he contends with an acrobatic fiend who caroms off walls like Jackie Chan and run circles around our hero. The secondary villains more than the chief villain give ""Live Free and Die Hard"" half of its best moments. Meanwhile, the chief villain, Thomas Gabriel, is more loquacious than lethal. Ironically, he spends most of his time telling us how dangerous that he is. ""Clerks"" writer/director Kevin Smithnearly bloated beyond recognition--makes a more interesting impression as a hacker who lives with his mom, rather like the Vince Vaughn character in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith."" When McClane isn't swapping words, fists, or lead with his adversaries, he barrels a semi-tractor trailer rig over bridges toppling like dominos behind him while a jet pilot cannot hit him with either missiles or bullets any more than the forty-seven machine gun wielding thugs. Watching Willis recreate the feisty McClane, McClane's bouts with the second-string villains, and the most outlandish feats ever staged compensate for the absence of a memorable villain, the encore use of a hacker plot to destroy a world power, and Bruce Willis's missing hairpiece. Enjoy ""Live Free and Die Hard"" for the PG-13 rated big, dumb action movie that it is."

","SYNOPSIS: John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back as he teams up with a clean-cut computer expert (Justin Long) to take down a hacker (Timothy Olyphant) bent on causing havoc in Washington D. C. on Independence Day. ----PROS: Of all the sequels, prequels, and remakes Hollywood has dumped into cinemas this summer, this one is definitely the most fun. Willis and Long develop an amusing relationship full of sly, snappy dialogue. And of course, this wouldn't be a DH movie without the action. The fight sequences surpass anything in the first three films (or almost any action movie, for that matter). The convincing blend of stunts and CG gives the explosive action a burst of adrenaline missing from, say, Spidey 3.---- CONS: The plot, of course, is absurd. That's to be expected with Die Hard movies, but even for a guy's flick, the story is ridiculous. But once the bang-bang and boom-boom begin, the movie (luckily) loses sigh of the story. Also, Timothy Olyphant was not much of a bad guy. He wasn't in any way menacing or evil. <br/><br/>But overall, if you just dial your brain down to the lowest level, and sit back with a big bag of popcorn, you can't help but have a helluva time at this flick."

","Being a huge 'Die Hard' fan I would rank this my least favorite (or on par, depending on my mood, with part 2) but that aside it's the most entertaining film I've seen this summer. It's pretty much 'Die Hard: The Cartoon' or 'Die Hard: Fan Fiction Fun'. It's silly, over the top (Literally over-the-top: look out for the jet fighter scene) and pretty much a string of exciting action sequences thrown together. Forget plot. Forget logic. This is candy for the senses, if the original 'Die Hard' was some fancy French chocolate 'Live Free or Die Hard' is Pop Rocks. Artificially sweet, cheap and it's only real redeeming quality is that it pops. For those of you who are worried about the PG-13, sure it's a little watered down (less blood, no gore head shots, every swear word minus F-bombs etc) but it's a PG-13 movie bordering on R (let's hope FOX cashes in and gives us the Unrated DVD this December). See it, enjoy it and don't think too much about it. I would recommend watching it with a big crowd. I saw it opening night and the audience loved it (there was no ""That was a disappointment"" lethargic audience exodus I witnessed with 'Spiderman 3' or 'Pirates'.)"

","So ""Live Free or Die Hard"" had many preset factors in my head working against it: PG-13 rating, Justin Long in a major role, a 52 year old action star and an untested director.<br/><br/>I went to see it anyway and well, I was greatly surprised. The action is great (no Paul Verhoveen spatters) but John McClane is not hugging it out with bad guys. Sure he isn't dropping the curse words every other line but it doesn't hinder his speech, maybe as an older gent he is finding a bit more time to express himself without colorful sentence enhancers.<br/><br/>Justin Long plays his part well, considering he is a nerdy computer hacker who occasionally cracks wise. . . not to say he hasn't been playing something like that before. . .<br/><br/>Bruce Willis obviously went at this seriously and it shows, from his delivery to his physique.<br/><br/>And the direction is good enough to make me want to go back and check out the personally previously shunned ""Underworld"" movies that Wiseman has directed.<br/><br/>There are of course some problems with the movie but the sheer enjoyment factor makes you supercede those in favor of the many pluses. The villain isn't Alan Rickman but he's also not William Sadler either. One of the best summer flicks in the official summer sequel fest that is 2007.<br/><br/>Though I needed closure on one thing a semi-main villain didn't get his just desserts in the end, he just disappeared in a ""I guess the FBI got him"" and while a similar type character in the original ""Die Hard"" was at least punched out by Argyle the limo driver.<br/><br/>One final thing is if you call yourself a true ""Die Hard"" fan you have to pick up on the FBI agent one liner when John McClane is first dropping off Farrel.<br/><br/>Go see it if you like action, humor and good ole' bad guy butt kicking movie."
"Lord_Crypto","8","1","4","28 June 2007"," Lacks the feel of a ""Die Hard"" movie
","Live Free or Die Hard is a good film but seems different from the original three movies. It lacks in what made the first one great and the other two good! I was impressed with solid acting and a very interesting story! It has intensity but not as much as the other three Die Hards in my opinion.<br/><br/>Len Wiseman directs this fourth installment. The film is rated PG-13 and not R. That already told me it would not be as good as the other ones. Violence and vulgarity are toned down way low (very disappointed). Violence especially, there is not as many cool, intense, and dramatic killings in this film that the originals had. The film brings back some of the original Die Hard music which really got me excited! I loved the original film's music and too hear them return to that got me excited, not to forget where the film has come from. The action sequences are bigger and better. One with a jet, That is pretty crazy. I dislike the way the film was shot! At times, the camera seems to be all over the place and changing shots way too often! Especially when it is completely unnecessary! <br/><br/>The story is both good and interesting! An interesting concept to put behind a Die Hard film. I liked it. And we spend absolutely no time with McClane's past which is good! Focus on the future story! No need to try and remind the viewer of McClane's past, we focus on his current situation which I like. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis, as usual, fulfills his role of John McClane. Ten years can not change the way he portrays that character. He is as great as ever! His character is just as funny and serious as the originals. Timothy Olyphant does a good job as the villain, Thomas Gabriel. He is no Hans Gruber, but he does come off as being a dangerous threat! Maybe not to McClane, but to the nation! Justing Long does good as his computer-hacker character. I really do not like him and did not approve of him being in the movie but he did a good job. He did not give me something to criticize him for. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lucy McClane and she does a great job. Her character is played just like her father and she does a good job of doing it. She even has her fathers mentality (beyond what you may think of McClane being just a cop). Especially when she is with Thomas Gabriel. Wonderful casting and wonderful characters.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a good film! I do consider it high enough caliber to be a Die Hard movie but it feels different than the other ones. The acting and story is good but I think it lacks in intensity, language, and violence. People do not watch Die Hard for a purpose or meaning. They watch to be entertained! And I feel the entertainment of this ""Die Hard"" movie was not as good as it could have been! A very good movie though!"
"jdesando","Null","4","39","27 June 2007"," ""Reductio Ad Absurdum . . .""
",". . . Or ""How low can you go?"" Live Free or Die Hard, the third child after the original Die Hard and the sequel,Die Hard With a Vengeance, takes to absurdity the suspension of disbelief required of most action/thriller movies. Only in wonder can one watch John McClane (Bruce Willis) survive wrecks and bullets that would have laid low entire armies, taken to the extreme in this edition by dodging a jet's missiles at close range and surviving a falling bridge. His fight with a martial-arts- proficient operative (Maggie Q), with the attendant wisecracks about her prowess, is a humorously satisfying part but still over-the-top action.<br/><br/>Perhaps the saving grace of the film, besides Willis's enormous charm as a blue collar, steely NYPD senior detective, is the central struggle with sophisticated international techno-terrorists over the cyber infrastructure of the USA. While it's all dazzling typing and glittering laptop screens, the real suspense comes from a simple, subterranean fear that too much of our security now rests with computers that regulate everything from electricity to economy. Hackers are harpies or heroes but no longer bit players on the world terrorism stage, fantasy movie or reality.<br/><br/>When the caustic but loving interplay between McClane and his feisty daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), emerges as a winning conflict in an overwrought action film, I wonder if this genre has run its course and returned to a formula that always works: family values."

Not exactly ""Freddy Vs Jason"" or ""Alien Vs Predator"" there, now is it? Complaints involve the fact that most of the dialog sounds literally cut-and-paste from other action flicks, the opening scene is a testament to unbelievable acting and characters, and that several of the actors' deliveries and characters in this movie were so interchangeable that if I directed it, I'd've made the actors trade roles between scenes as a joke. However, I went there to see Bruce Willis blow stuff up, and 100% of this movie's creativity was put into just that. So I'm not gonna complain about paying to see it.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

From start to finish it was non-stop action. The stunts and action sequences were brilliant and some of them left me on the edge of my seat. In most action films you will have most action sequences wrecked by CGI e.g The Marine. Nearly all action Sequences, they used CGI which just spoiled it. I am glad Die Hard 4 didn't do that. I mean the part where the police car flies into the helicopter was unreal. Most people thought that was CGI but no they actually did that. The part at the end with the jet destroying the bridge was brilliant. Timothy Olyphant play a great villain and i am looking forward to seeing him in his new film Hit-man.

I AM SO GLAD I DID. the movie was soooooooo great. It had a lot of action, suspense, and it definitely had its funny moments. The plot would definitely get you thinking about this world and if we are really prepared if even JUST ONE PIECE of the whole story took place in one of our heavy populated areas. The movie was also good because it shows that hott girls can really kick a mans ass if we wanted to lol.

A movie where explosive, gunshot, and vehicles chase take place.<br/><br/>The story start out pretty easy to understand. The bad guy tried something bad, and ACCIDENTALLY, John McClane was assigned to pick up this boy, who is a target for the bad guy. And everything started. The thing I like, is every demolition happen in the movie. It's so real. And the action sequence, that's the best after casino royale. At least, we can still witness, a hero who can bleed and get busted really bad. Unlike some movies, in which the heroes of the movie is like a super human.

","This is by far the best movie I've seen so far this summer. In fact, movies in general have been so disappointing the past couple of years, it was a tremendous treat to see ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and leave the theater with no complaints at all. Yes, it's way over-the-top at times, but it's also incredibly fun and satisfying. It may not be the very best of the ""Die Hard"" films, but in no way does it disappoint (which is why I thought I should give it a 10). John McClane is still John McClane, and he still offs the baddies in inventive ways. The action is high-octane, and the humor is priceless. Go see it on the biggest screen you can find right away!"
"anderscl-1","6","1","5","29 June 2007"," Entertaining but flawed
","**Minor spoilers follow**<br/><br/>The fourth installment in the Die Hard series follows John McClane as he battles a terrorist group who used their computer prowess, and access to government networks, to create mass confusion. These attacks on the transportation, electrical, and other networks serve as steps towards a massive heist, revealed as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis provides a lot of entertainment as McClanewould we expect anything less? And he has a good on screen rapport with his co-star, Justin Long, who plays a computer nerd that McClane is assigned to protect. Timothy Olyphant glares ominously throughout the movie, and could be a great bad guy if given the chance. It's just too bad they didn't have better material to work with.<br/><br/>While entertaining, this movie has some major flaws as an action movie. Essentially it takes the plot of Die Hard 3create mass panic through terrorist attacks, which serve to steal some sort of money reserveand combines this plot with some Independence-day style action and unrealistic computer hacking. <br/><br/>Action movies usually require some suspension of disbelief, but this installment in the Die Hard series abandons any pretense of realism. If you've seen the scene in Die Hard with a Vengeance where McClane takes down a helicopter by shooting the power lines above itwell, this sort of scene is repeated over and over in Live Free or Die Hard. McClane falls on a jet plane, bounces off, and rolls on a collapsed freeway. He jumps of out a car before launching it into a helicopter, and so forth. While he's doing this, half the city gets blown apart, and computer hackers pull up information in seconds on great looking but fake looking screens.<br/><br/>The nonstop cartoon action and borderline lame computer hacker plot line take the edge off the movie. While the action is constant, it lacks somethingperhaps originalityand leaves this movie feeling too much like a generic action flick. <br/><br/>The characters also lack depth and are fairly boring. Compare this film's villains to its predecessor: Hans Gruber (the villain in the third movie) had charisma, several motives, and a slew of distractions hiding his true motives. Thomas Gabriel, the villain in this movie, is just mad about his job. Maggie Q, cast as the bad-guy love interest, sputters off flat lines of dialog, and is totally unbelievable as a tough villain. Compare her to Gruber's love interest in the third moviean East German, whose history is actually given in the movie, and whose loyalties are slowly revealed. There are none of these characters or plot lines in Live Free or Die Hard. Instead we get a crew who, for pulling off the most audacious crime of any of the movies,lack depth, personality, and seem (with the clear exception of Olyphant) surprisingly non-threatening. <br/><br/>If you like action movies, this is worth checking out, but it doesn't live up to its potential. Oh, and when the linethe one that everyone is waiting foris uttered, it is definitely worth it. Revealing how and why the line is said would ruin the movie, but it's one of the too few scenes that live up to the Die Hard tradition."

Now I have seen every one of the Die Hard movies, & some may say that nothing is better than the originals most of the time. Well, this is one of those times that it is better than the original. Justin Long, (Accepted), really, really did a great job along side Bruce Willis. This is one of the best performances I have seen out of Willis since the last Die Hard movie.

So blatant in fact that they chose a radio frequency - even written down for 'all to see' - as 66.6. How's that for subtle? The director and people involved in this movie really are antiChrists.

","(Spoiler alert-This comment has numerous spoilers) <br/><br/>If this were titled like the last one I'd say this was ""Die Hard without a Plot""<br/><br/>Disappointing go round for John McClane has good performances, spectacular action and a plot that makes no real sense.<br/><br/>The plot has someone hacking into the US government computers. The feds suspect something is up and they try to bring in known hackers who could do this. At the same time some is killing off the same hackers. McClane is sent to pick up a hacker (He's a NYC cop who's in NJ looking for his daughter-just don't ask) and bring him Washington. Of course he gets there as the killers do so we have the first of many action sequences.<br/><br/>McClane is tracked by the bad guys-please don't ask- and delivers the kid to the FBI. The kid is then sent off for questioning- but he recognizes the voice of the woman who hired him to write a code breaking program on the radio and we get another set piece.<br/><br/>What follows is McClane and hacker trying to stay alive and stop a bunch of ""terrorists"" who want to shut down everything in a ""fire sale"" so named because everything must go-everything run by computer is to be shut down. Of course we think its terrorists, but no its for revenge---well maybe not maybe its for the money.(Don't ask).<br/><br/>The scale of whats going on is frightening except we don't really see that much of it, total chaos is reduced to some crowds and a few parked cars. Worse what the bad guys are doing makes no sense especially since its clear from some statements that they really didn't have to shut the whole country down. Even worse is the fact that for the most part all of the villains- Maggie Q excepted- are cartoon cut outs-they seem to be as McClane jokes, from 1-800 henchmen. Even the boss of bosses just sorts of wanders around a control room doing---nothing. He has no stature like Jeremy Irons or Alan Rickman or William Sadler. A challenge for McClane? Oh please. Only in the last 20 minutes or so does he really begin to measure up- but then again he's pretty much put in his place by McClane's daughter (he was beaten by a girl?).<br/><br/>This should have been a classic movie. Hell the action is there. The set pieces are spectacular with several scenes not in the trailers that make you go ""WOW"". This is a movie that ups the action ante for all films to come. I just wish it had a solid plot instead of a piece of embalmed vermicelli to hang all of these excellent explosions on.<br/><br/>If you are an action fan you will want to see this movie, though maybe not at 10 bucks a head in the movies."
"regex_1","10","1","7","30 June 2007"," One of the Best
","I would half to say that this Die Hard is one of the best and I will be holding out until the unrated release to say whether or not it is the best. <br/><br/>The movie starts out kinda slow, but that does not last long. The action is extremely intense and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The McClane we all know and love does not show right away, life has taken a toll, but do not worry, once the sh!t hits the fan we once again get to see him rise to the challenge, right there ready to win.<br/><br/>The movie also is very tech oriented, full of computer and everything else hacking, though John has nothing nor wants anything to do with the tech crap, he stays focused on kicking @SS. I found the tech stuff cool, just because it is something that John does not understand, so he must rely on others to take care of it, which makes for a fun partnership.<br/><br/>Do to the PG-13 rating the cursing and blood is taken to the minimum, but there is plenty of killing and explosions. This is the only thing keeping this movie from being the best and can not wait for the unrated version.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a must see for any Die Hard or action fan."

","I just returned from the 2:00 show and while the rating issue did bother me I was willing to give it a chance. Chance given, film didn't deliver. Len Wiseman has pussified John McClane. yeah he still kills people, and tries to save the day, but Bruce Willis wasn't being John McClane. he was some toned down, anger management treated version of John McClane and to be frank it was really sad.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis always had a fire when playing the part of McClane and here in Live Free or Die Hard he plays a toned down version of him. There was no anger in him, no fire. It felt like he was just collecting his paycheck and moving on to the next project. McClane would never be calm with someone doing what Tim Olyphant's character was doing, especially when the guy takes his daughter. Instead John speaks to him in a clear and calm tone... maybe the battle hardened years of being an NYPD detective has caught up with him, I dunno, but the John McClane on the screen today was not the same McClane from 20 years ago, hell even 12 years ago. John is the type of person when he doesn't understand whats happening or its moving faster than he can think he usually blows his top and thats when he is at his best. Here you will find nothing like that.<br/><br/>This is a sad excuse for a film, it really was, I mean I wanted this to be good, and while some of the stunts and set pieces were nice to see they were totally off the wall, the entire F35 sequence was laughable. I'm sorry but even if this was Rated R I would have been slamming it for not living up to the Die Hard Legacy.<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the cast, Justin Long was pretty funny and very likable, even Mary Elizabeth Winstead did great... actually when you watch her you see the old John McClane just screaming to get out. Tim Olyphant was OK as the main baddie, but he will never live up to the villains of previous Die Hard films. I will say two things positive... Len Wiseman can do action, and the score by Marco Beltrami was passable and close to the original films style and vibe.<br/><br/>If you want action, you will get it. If you want John McClane... go to your DVD collection and Pull out one of the three original Die Hard films.<br/><br/>And for those asking, or curious... The Line is done as follows.<br/><br/>Yippie Ki-Ya Mut(Gunshot) He mutters MUT! then a really loud, I mean obnoxiously loud Gunshot rings out.<br/><br/>It makes me sad to write a bad review for a Die Hard film, they are a staple of action cinema.

"davidmvining","8","0","1","2 June 2020"," Unpopular movie opinion: Live Free or Die Hard is the best Die Hard movie.
","It's the only one that makes a series attempt at a thematic point. It's not about some deep relationship between the viewer and the world, or even the viewer and movies, but about the change in the nature of action in action movies over the decades since the original Die Hard. It also has the best villain since Hans Gruber going for it.<br/><br/>Some hackers have delivered code to a shadowy organization and then started getting killed off one by one. John McClane, for slightly unclear reasons, is sent to New Jersey to pick up Matt Farrell, one of the hackers on the FBI's list, for questioning. So begins John McClane's next foray into combatting terrorism and thievery, and I think it's the smartest of his adventures. It really begins with the introduction to Farrell for McClane. It's pretty typical generational stuff with the old man who doesn't get all the young person stuff that Farrell spouts out of his smart mouth. That's not the interesting part. What quickly manifests is the fight that breaks out between the terrorists out to kill Farrell and McClane.<br/><br/>As Thomas Gabriel says later in the film, McLane is a ""Timex watch in a digital age."" He's outmoded, and that extends into a meta commentary about the nature of action movies. McClane is a punch and shoot type of action hero. He doesn't do acrobatics, but in the 2000s, that's the sort of thing that was dominating action movies thanks to things like The Matrix, parkour, and some French imports. This wasn't the age for John McClane's brand of action, and yet here he is in a film in that time period. Do the filmmakers treat it as a throwback to another time? No, they bring the creaky old McClane into that era and have him fight that era itself. The French unit sent by Gabriel has a freerunner who uses motion to get where he needs to go, and McClane needs to figure out how to deal with it.<br/><br/>The visual nature of the conflict is at its height, though, during the chase through D.C. McClane has taken Farrell to the FBI who then redirect them to the NSA for questioning. As they progress through the city, Gabriel sends his helicopter of French mercenaries after John and Farrell in the car below. So, it's McClane, using tools he can only access from the ground, fighting the representation of the new style of action movies that use a helicopter and never come to the ground. McClane uses the car to overturn a fire hydrant that shoots water into the sky, knocking one of the mercenaries out of the helicopter. At the end of the chase, McClane uses the actual car to take the helicopter out of the sky. He's using the tools on the ground to take out the new antagonists in the sky. I love that.<br/><br/>The other major thing that I love about this movie is Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel. Gabriel is a really good bad guy. He's got a strong motive. He warned the Joint Cheifs of America's openness to attack on the digital front, they destroyed him for it when he tried to go around their backs. So, he's there to make his point (with promises that he could fix everything that he broke), but also to enrich himself, all stemming from his sense of bruised ego, actual harm, and sense of righteous anger. On top of that, the way Olyphant plays him is great. Gabriel is completely in control, reminiscent of Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, and alternatively sardonic and threatening when those around him screw up.<br/><br/>I really like the rest of the cast. Bruce Willis is somewhere between trying and giving up, but he still manages to make the role work. Justin Long is fine as Farrell. It's Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy McClane that stands out for me. She's strong and pig headed, just like her father, and when she gets re-introduced late in the movie, the way she fights back against Gabriel instead of playing the helpless victim is great.<br/><br/>The action is well filmed and actually carries a point beyond the mayhem. The acting is quite good, especially from Winstead and Olyphant. The antagonist has very solid motivations and his plan is both large scale and understandable (if, like most movies about computers, it overstates what computers can do). This really is the most complete package of a Die Hard film."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","1","21 April 2019"," Die Hard 4.0 hacks through a generic plot and grants access to exciting set pieces.
","The fourth Die Hard film, or as I like to call it ""the last good Die Hard instalment"", sees John McClane do what John McClane does best. Singlehandedly saving the country from terrorists by being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The ultimate in plot conveniences, for the fourth time around. Inevitably the procedural plot is wearing thin since the masterful original graced Hollywood, but name another film that sees a badass cop drive a car into a hovering helicopter in the middle of downtown rush hour. Exactly, you can't! Which is why I'll always find blockbusting enjoyment in this outrageous sequel. McClane is tasked in delivering a hacker to the government, but is caught up in a national crisis when a virtual terrorist takes control of the country's computer systems.<br/><br/>Financial controls, communication satellites and even America's greatest technological advancement yet...traffic lights. On a surface level, it's just another Die Hard flick with Willis portraying the infamous policing cowboy for the last time (because the fifth film did not happen, ok?). Dig a little deeper, and you'll find it's still a mindless action film that has, unlike McClane, evolved into the 21st century. It's the same old shenanigans, hitting standard plot points beat for beat. McClane is accompanied by an insufferably talkative hacker, banter is exchanged, everybody's laughing until an F-35 intricately positions itself under highways whilst in pursuit of a rigged truck that sees McClane fall onto the plane's wings as it circles out of control and crashes into a big fiery explosion. All in a day's work. Director Wiseman threw the damage reports out of the window and spent the entire budget on exhilarating action set pieces. And my word, it worked.<br/><br/>The first act kicks off almost immediately and does not stop for thirty solid minutes. The proceeding hour slows down indefinitely and over-elaborates on Olyphant's antagonistic motives, whom of which is severely underrated, allowing him to get personal with McClane. Only to then conclude in an outrageous thrilling finale. And if you're worried that Willis has lost his touch, do not fret. The script is layered with witty quips and remarks that made McClane the memorable character that he is today. Even when he is just talking to himself sarcastically, it's enough to put a smile on your face amidst the crazy action.<br/><br/>The premise is incomprehensibly absurd, and the series has clearly come a long way from taking Nakatomi Plaza hostage. But if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and enjoy the ridiculously entertaining action sequences that Wiseman presents, well you'll be shouting ""yippee-kiyay"" by the end of it. Not the best of the series, but definitely not the worst. Maybe release a software patch to remedy the pacing issues, believability and over-explained plot. Die Hard 4.1?"

"MaximumMadness","8","0","1","27 May 2017"," ""Live Free or Die Hard""- An explosive return for the legendary cinematic hero John McClane.
","""Die Hard"" is pure cinematic gold. Upon release in 1988, the original film in what would soon become a franchise was met with critical acclaim and went on to be an instant classic of action and adventure. Audiences were in awe of its spectacle and sharp writing, and to this very day, it remains a cherished and beloved masterwork that few are able to compare to. Two sequels followed in the 90's, and while not quite able to come close to matching the high bar set by that first film, both were strong and wickedly exciting chapters that continued the series well and maintained its integrity.<br/><br/>For a while, it seemed that the series was finished, with the third film having capped off the series while also giving a sense of completion to Bruce Willis' legendary action-hero John McClane. More than ten years passed before we heard the murmurings of a fourth film. Years of anticipation and dreams of a new film would finally be answered. But there were some snags along the way. Most troubling being a studio-mandated PG-13 rating, which betrayed the hard-R tonality set by the previous entries. Some also took issue with the choice in Len Wiseman as director, with his previous directorial efforts in the ""Underworld"" series being exciting but a little light on story. But even still, we held onto our hope that the newest chapter would be a worthy installment.<br/><br/>And oh boy, was it!<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" (also known as ""Die Hard 4.0"" in some territories) is a darned-good modern take on the franchise, that skillfully mixes the best of both old and new-school cinematic techniques and storytelling to deliver yet another grand installment in the series. While there are some inherent problems with the film (particularly in the tamed-down PG-13 theatrical cut), it was like seeing a dear old friend again walking into the theater. McClane was back. The explosive entertainment was back. The attitude was back. And it was a pleasure to behold.<br/><br/>The FBI is tracking a potentially dangerous situation, as a number of highly skilled computer hackers have been assassinated. When it appears hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who is on the FBI's watch-list, may be a potential new target, New York cop John McClane (Willis) is dispatched to collect him for questioning and protection. However, McClane soon finds himself a target for murder upon collecting Farrell when he comes into the sights of deranged former Department of Defense official Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who is seeking retribution for his dishonorable termination. Together, McClane and Farrell must do whatever they can to stop Gabriel's ultimate goal- to cripple the US by initiating a devious scheme known as a ""Fire Sale""... where every computer-based network will be eliminated, throwing the country into utter chaos.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is that it is pure, unadulterated ""Die Hard"" in virtually every sense, only given a fresh spit-and-polish with modern day effects and a contemporary storyline. Director Len Wiseman masterfully weaves a tale that takes McClane out of his comfort zone and puts him into a worst-case- scenario where his hard-boiled wit will again be put to the test. Together with writers Mark Bomback and David Marconi, Wiseman delivers non- stop thrills and thorough entertainment from start-to-finish, with some of the most mind-bending action set- pieces of its decade. It's over-the-top... but over-the-top in all the right ways that only ""Die Hard"" can pull off.<br/><br/>Willis is phenomenal as always in his trademark role, and its nice seeing that the script gives him a bit of development as he's struggled in the years that have passed. McClane might be doing things no other man could reasonably survive, but there's a humanity beneath the surface. Olyphant makes for an adequately menacing villain, even if he's far more hands-off than previous foes. He's got a good look and voice for the part of such a treacherous baddie, so I didn't mind that he was more of a behind-the-scenes figure. But the stand-outs here are the delightful Justin Long, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Kevin Smith in supporting roles. Long might just be a sidekick to McClane, but he's a ton of fun and is never grating. His attitude compliments and contrasts with Willis quite nicely. Winstead, a delightful young actress, portrays McClane's daughter Lucy, and she's a welcome addition, as her small role helps ground McClane and give him a bit more heart. And Smith is just a ton of fun as an underground hacker known as ""The Warlock."" He hams it up well and gets some good zingers.<br/><br/>However, this is not a perfect film, and it loses a few points for a few big issues I have with it. To start, Gabriel might be a decent villain, but he is very underdeveloped. Despite trying his hardest, Olyphant's good performance cannot overcome weak motivation and a lack of screen time. Hans Gruber, he ain't. The film also pushes the boundaries of believability a few too many times, which bugged me. And oddly enough, the problems I had don't lie in a certain sequence involving a jet that I will not spoil. No, to me, it's more that there's a bit too much CG work and inorganic wire-stunts in the earlier half of the movie that feel out of place. And a few too many moments of McClane and Farrell being saved by unlikely circumstances. And finally... the edits made to get the film down to a PG-13 are very obvious. It's blatant where dialog has been redubbed with lighter language and where the film had to cut so they didn't show too much blood. It's a tad irritating. Thankfully, an R- rated edition was later released that corrects these issues.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" is a complete blast and re-invigorates the franchise after a prolonged break. It's exciting. Entertaining. And pure ""Die Hard."" It's a very good 8 out of 10."
"supergamer125","9","0","2","17 August 2015"," An overlooked gem
","Live Free or Die Hard was the only Die Hard film to be released with a PG-13 rating. This angered many fans and it did make it seem a bit watered down. However they soon released a unrated cut restoring it to a R rated film. Even though a couple of hard core fans of Die Hard would not think much of this movie. I personally love this movie. Never really got the hate.<br/><br/>This time John McClane is going up against some cyber-terrorist led by Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) who have taken control of the US infrastructure and economy. Now it's up to McClane and a hacker now wanted by the terrorists Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) to stop them.<br/><br/>Mostly new cast. Matt is OK as a sidekick, not as good as Zeus but still good. He and McClane work off each other well. McClane is the action hero; strong, brave, and heroic but totally lost when it comes to computers. Matt is the opposite; he works well with computers but isn't good with the whole shooting and fighting thing. Another new face is Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) McClane's grown up and estranged daughter.<br/><br/>The villain is also pretty good. He is similar to most of the other villains that would lose in a fist fight with McClane. McClane fights with guns and his fists, but Gabriel fights with technology. Yet again McClane and the villain have a very entertaining relationship. They do the usual; taunt, insult, and threaten each other. He seems like a decent guy, probably the least psychotic of all the villains. But looks are deceiving as he is truly diabolical and is the only villain that kills some of his own team after they've finished their use. And he starts to deteriorate as the film goes on. He starts off relatively calm, but by the end, his sadistic and cruel personality begin to surface.<br/><br/>The action is as always, amazing. Some of the best in the franchise. Some may say that it might of went a bit too over the top (most notably when McClane is chased by the fighter jet). That may be true, but I personally didn't mind it too much. Some other scenes like the tunnel scene are just awesome.<br/><br/>Another reason I like this movie is that it raises the stakes. Near the last act, Lucy gets kidnapped by the terrorists, which makes it more personal. In Die Hard with a Vengeance McClane had no family with him which didn't make the stakes as high. This is similar to Die Hard and Die Hard 2 in which his wife became a hostage. Also unlike Die Hard with a Vengeance the ending did not feel out of place or rushed.<br/><br/>The action isn't the only good thing about this movie. One brilliant scene is when McClane and Matt are driving and McClane talks about being a hero and what he got for being one. It's a very good scene that shows John McClane as a reluctant hero that becomes one because no one else can.<br/><br/>In short Live Free or Die Hard is to me, the best Die Hard sequel out there and doesn't deserve the hate it gets from some of the fans. You can hate all you want, but I'll be too busy watching this great film that I won't hear it. With four good films under its belt this is a great franchise to watch if you haven't watched it yet."

","Live Free or Die Hard (2007): Dir: Len Wiseman / Cast: Bruce Willis, Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Cliff Curtis, Mary Elizabeth Winstead: Mindless action farce about risks and consequence. Agent John McClane must protect a young computer hacker from an Internet terrorist group. Standard setup leads to bang, bang, crash, boom, blam until climaxing with more bang, bang, crash, boom, blam. Director Len Wiseman stages impressive stunts against no consideration for civilian life. This is the fourth in a series that continues to go down hill in terms of quality. Bruce Willis plays McClane with usual sarcasm but that only goes so far. He spends much of the film doing implausible action where he narrowly avoids death. He also blows up a whole lot of stuff. Justin Long as the hacker is basically there to be saved. He will also take interest in McClane's daughter in a joke that isn't as funny as the filmmakers believe it is. Timothy Olyphant plays the standard moron villain who will dominate and destroy until Willis kicks his ass. Cliff Curtis appears in the F.B.I. So his role is obvious and a standard waste of time. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's daughter whose role is the standard issue lack of understanding from parent mode. It has been twelve years since Die Hard With a Vengeance was released. Filmmakers were living free of originality and dying hard for pure crap. Score: 3 / 10"

","Ugh. It wasn't even like the first three movies were THAT cool (even though they were pretty awesome for the late-1980s–mid-1990s), but John McClane returns after a 12-year hiatus like we missed him to stop cyber terrorists who hack into government and commercial computers. Timothy Olyphant does a good job as the villain, but is nowhere near as memorable as Irons or Rickman from the previous films. Fans complain about the PG-13 rating—though, aside from the language, it's not too tame even compared to its R-rated predecessors.

","This one really was a lot of fun. Maybe it's because they added the extra interest of seeing how a giant nation might be brought to it's knees. I loved the hacker kid and his droll patronizing retorts to Mclain and his innocent concern for the aging warhorses health as he gathers massive crunchy contusions along the way. I lived the villain and his sneaky crew of blackhats. And the daughter was perfectly cast and did a great evocation of Mcains hot grumpy daughter. But most of all the sheer scale and audacity of the action set pieces was too good to be true. There was not a single moment when the CGI team did not deliver, It was all so bone-crunchingly authentic, and cool looking too. Careful lighting and cinematography turned them into modern pieces of chaotic balletic mayhem. And there was little of the really nasty sadistic stuff too. No torture or gory beatings, at least not more than necessary. Grateful for that. A really good days work."

"Jedi_Critic_Master","6","0","1","11 January 2013"," Eh, It's really not that good
","Yeah, Len Wiseman managed to restart the Die Hard franchise after twelve years, but he has removed what made the original so Die Hard - The way the plot was bloodily challenging for John McClane (Bruce Willis) himself. Live Free or Die Hard recycles plot-lines from the originals and turns it into an incoherently-plotted rehash that adds some great explosions, but seriously silly plotting. Its predictably ridiculous and not Die-Hard challenging enough. John McClane fighting a computer-hacking girl was really incoherent and silly, and some of the dialogue is pretty bombastic. And honestly, Timothy Olyphant isn't enough of a brutal villain to justify a plot of computer-hacking. Why send a cop to stop him? Send an FBI agent next time! Bruce Willis and Justin Long don't have that good chemistry together and the dialogue can be bombastic at times. Ridiculous! ~6.5/10"

Everything iks controlled by them and their goal instead of killing people is to bring down the government.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely the best of the Die Hard franchise.

","Live Free or Die Hard truly uses all of today's greatest technology and actors to show how far and how deep movies can go in 21st century. This is Bruce Willis at his best, but his character is really brought out thanks to a equally amazing cast of protagonists and antagonists. In the past Die Hards, it seemed like John McClaine's personal life was really kept at bay, and although we watch his family fall apart, Die Hard 4.0 really dives into the head John McClaine, and we watch him go from washed-up father to awe-inspiring hero. The acting is amazing, everyone really brought 200% to the table, the camera gets the absolute best view of whats going on, especially one of the last scenes where John is desperately fleeing from a fighter jet on a overpass in a 18-wheeler. The storyline although seems simple, is told so well that you can picture the dis-stress a actual Fire Sale would cause in modern day America. There are just way way way over-the-top moments in this movie that left me speechless. If Bourne watched this movie, he would curl-up into a ball and put his thumb in his mouth and watch as a hard-boiled NY cop took his throne from him.

"saulpetra","9","0","1","23 January 2011"," John McClane as archetypal hero
","Eclipsing the first ""Die Hard"" and easily breezing past its first two, good-but-not-spectacular, follow-ups, ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" is one of the most exciting, most fun, and overall best action films to come down the pike in a long time. This one takes quite a different tract than the first two, which confined their action to a skyscraper and an airport, respectively, and shoots, chases and slams its way over much of the northeastern U.S. seaboard. When a series of precisely co-ordinated computer attacks start bringing down systems and power grids all over the country, Bruce Willis (returning as John McClane once again) finds himself drawn into the thick of it - largely by coincidence as usual - and in his best race-against-the-clock yet. Sidekick role this time goes to Justin Long, a small-time hacker initially arrested by McClane and subsequently helping to piece together all the clues as to the villains's identities and ultimate intentions, Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's daughter Lucy and is as great as always, and Kevin Smith has a couple of brief but scene-stealing appearances as cyber-wizard 'Warlock'. The whole cast does great in this and makes a few scenes that might have otherwise been just Too unbelievable manage to work.<br/><br/>Speaking of brushes with the unbelievable though, those who like their action movies as realistic as possible might find that the forth Die Hard goes overboard a couple of times. There are some darn close calls even for McClane in this one, and probably nearly as many as in all three previous Die Hards put together! Most times, this kind of thing, with disaster constantly being averted by uncanny combinations of sheer coincidence and plain luck, will send an action movie skidding right off the tracks. Live Free Or Die Hard was one of the few where it didn't, and may have actually turned out to be a boon, adding to the fun and larger-than-life feel of the movie. At times it's reminiscent of the 2003 Denzel Washington movie Out of Time, although that one is more dark and intense, and Live Free Or Die Hard more of a grand roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>Overall, unless you just dislike action/adventure movies altogether, Live Free Or Die Hard is one of the safest bets out there. Those who find it a bit too over the top are still likely to enjoy it for the most parts, while those who don't think it went too far will just be blown away. Before they did this one I thought it would be a bad idea to do another Die Hard. After this I hope they go ahead and do a fifth. When you can deliver this kind of a winner nineteen years after the first one you've got something really good going. Scores around 9 or 9.5 on a ten point scale."

"koojaho13","7","0","2","2 October 2010"," Yippie kay yay! Great addition to the series.
","First of all I've watched both the PG-13 and the Unrated versions. I have to say that there's very little difference yet a lot at the same time. Most of the difference is the dialog rather than the violence but this connects better with the previous installments.<br/><br/>This is one crazy action flick. The scale is larger than any of the previous Die Hard films and the action breaks the law of physics in every way. This is not a stealth movie. John McClane is hungry to kill and he announces his plan to the villains throughout the whole movie and still ends up accomplishing his goals in the most satisfying way. If there is one movie where one-liners don't bother me, it's this one.<br/><br/>The writers did insert a few dramatic moments here and there and adds more character to the John McClane we all knew and loved. It's a moment of reminiscing of the previous Die Hard films. The movie is a tribute as well as it's own stand alone film.<br/><br/>As crazy as the action is, the special effects support this. I've seen movies that use the silliest special effects (such as Transformers 2) to support the action. The fourth Die Hard has good special effects. It's not the effects that make the scenes unbelievable, it's the action. Yet it's all very good fun. This is a non-stop ride of explosions and some at-the-edge-of-the-seat stunts.<br/><br/>Justin Long is funny as well as likable. He makes a believable performance and is a great sidekick. He was worthy of Samuel L. Jackson's replacement. His character contributed some comedy and it was interesting to see such a different character interact with John McClane. McClane's daughter, Lucy is back in this sequel and is the perfect action star's daughter. She is spoiled and independent towards her father. Only, I do feel that something is missing in the transition of the change of her character. It feels a little rushed and if it was a little bit more rushed it would have been as if Lucy just wanted help from her father at troubled times.<br/><br/>Overall it's an enjoyable movie that you can watch at a weekend night. It leaves you feeling good, entertained and rested after work. It's over the top action scenes are something you've never seen before and you should definitely check it out.<br/><br/>As a last note, I know that there are some rumors floating around about a fifth Die Hard movie with it's supposed title to be ""Die Hard 24/7"". I would love to see another Die Hard but let's hope they just call it Die Hard 5, not Die Hard 5.0 but Die Hard 5."

","'God, this movie is so stupid!' was the main reaction I had while watching it. I have to admit that the first 30 minutes are quite exciting. It goes completely down hill after that. I haven't seen a pure action movie for some time and it might be that I'm getting too old for this crap but watching stuff like this just makes me despair over the spiritual and mental state of mankind. How can a huge team of people work on projects as stupid and useless as this? What kinds of values do you people pursue? How can supposedly successful and hard-working people come up with this kind of garbage? This doesn't go for this movie specifically but all waste that this sad bunch of humans are dedicating their sad pathetic lives to create. It is an insult to and a negative influence on our collective intelligence. It's no wonder that the world is in such a sorry state. Shame on you all."
"elshikh4","6","0","2","9 November 2009"," Less Magic !
","I'm a big fan of (Die Hard). The first 3 movies are about great action, and they all deliver. This late sequel is nice. But in the same time, it has to be not the worst, let's say the least interesting one in the series. So why is that?<br/><br/>While the plot is smart when it deals with the computer's stuff, the digital disaster, etc. it isn't the same with the rest. It managed to give us action all the way, but not with much of surprises or twists. The previous movies raised the bar so much that this one seems lower in comparison. The character of the hacker wasn't funny or catchy. I didn't know what was the evil guy's agenda when he showed the image of distorted Capitol? Or how the computer's Warlock knew all of these government's secrets? And the whole sequence of the plane was absurd, not even good absurd.<br/><br/>The action is well-made yet without the same attractiveness of the past 3 movies. (Len Wiseman) executes more than creates. I didn't feel any personal touch or special appeal. Save smashing a flying helicopter with a speeding car, I don't recall one sequence that I want to see again. And there wasn't any striking fistfight (one of the series' trademarks). The image's quality has nothing to do with (Die Hard)'s legacy. It's, at best, close to what any high TV show achieves, being like a ""24"" episode for most of the time. For instance, the gunfire sequence in the hacker's flat was so TV-ish (aka: poor!).<br/><br/>The soundtrack: OH MY GOD! Die Hard movies always had remarkable soundtracks. This time, surely it missed a sign of singularity, to be as any other action in the market. It's the first one without the music of (Michael Kamen) who died in 2003. And they got the nerve to hoax us with Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" but only in the trailer!<br/><br/>The dialogue. My comment is: Grrrrr! This is the worst dialogue ever written for John MacLean EVER EVER EVER. It could be the movie's first defect and main crime. I can assure you; some of my friends watch these movies for MacLean's unforgettably sarcastic remarks. This time, it's official: the cat ate his tongue! I imagined that the old, more lonely, MacLean got to be more sarcastic. But the fun was dry. So dry. The rest wasn't better either: ""On your tombstone, it will say always in the wrong place at the wrong time/ No, I'll write Yippie-ki-yay..""?? It seems like someone writes out the past movies' taglines!<br/><br/>As for the evil guys, the mastermind was cool and young, but uncharismatic and un-mysterious. Just one look at him and you'll know that (Bruce Willis) will finish him and so easily as well! His henchmen, the acrobats, were kind of new, but totally not memorable, or that menacing.<br/><br/>The CGI shook the cornerstone of these movies as old-fashioned action. For me, I pray for one big fine action without it at all. Hence, I promised myself that this movie would be the one. I was wrong! True that the CGI wasn't so much or flamboyant. But it was bad and cheesy. Let alone seeing it in a (Die Hard) movie in the first place!<br/><br/>The climax was disappointing; being short and unsatisfying, fitting more for a TV episode's end. Plus, I couldn't understand why the evil guy didn't kill John or his daughter while he was having them?! I know, it's one of the cinema's most unquestionable, and unanswered, questions. But here it was just that provocative and weak!<br/><br/>It takes place in more than a day too. This is something which, out of all the people of the world, bothers me the most!<br/><br/>It's the usual (Die Hard) movie, while these movies are anything but usual. It had good success, simply because it was launched among 2007's many less strong blockbusters (Pirates of The Caribbean: At World's End), (Spider-Man 3), and (Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer). Anyway it's, as it is, still one of the best movies (Willis) has made in years.<br/><br/>Finally, a lot of viewers hated, just hated, that this is the most *family* Die Hard movie without the ultra cursing or violence, feeling something deficient especially when the lead didn't complete his: ""Yippie-ki-yay.."". But while I didn't care about that at all, I felt something was deficient. And when it comes to the movie's magic; IT IS really deficient!"
"guitarblues","4","0","2","25 August 2009"," An explosion filled action movie, yes. A ""Die Hard"" movie, not quite.
","Lets get this first out of the way. Die Hard 1, 2 and 3 were all awesome. They were really great in their own way. 2 is seen by many as the lesser film, but I think was also good, at least it still had that rawness that part 1 had. It just had a lot to live up to, since part 1 is considered one of the best action movies of all time. Part 3 was radically different, but it was executed in such a great way that it just worked. I haven't seen a movie yet where the way they used New York City as the theater for the action is done so well. It was still the same guy, getting his ass kicked and kicking the bad guys asses in the end. It had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. Probably the best intro (music) I saw ever for a movie, by the way.<br/><br/>But part 4, not so much. The reason why fans of the first movies don't like it, is because it just goes too far with everything. The thing that made the first 3 Die Hard movies so good was like it (at least remotely) felt it could actually happen for real. Part 1 did this the best. You saw a normal guy in the wrong place and the wrong time. He got hurt and at times he felt like he wouldn't make it. He was vulnerable had had to struggle to bring things to a good end.<br/><br/>Part 4 is like most action movies today. Tons of explosions and a million computer generated effects. No more realism. Especially part with the jet fighter ruined it for me. McClane escapes from one of the most technologically advanced war machines man has created while driving a big, slow truck. The way the jet fighter is defeated is also just stupid and really unrealistic. In real life the jet could destroy that truck from 30 miles away.<br/><br/>Actually, they already had lost me during the car crash scene in the tunnel. The car that flies through the air where they duck under two other cars. It just all happens thanks to luck. But the main problem is that there is too much bull**** going on. The bad guys jumping from a helicopter and surviving it. They also survived getting hit by a car that did at least 40 miles an hour. If that doesn't kill you, it sends you at least to the hospital. After the first few action scenes I had that feeling a lot of mediocre action movies give me. The feeling that the main guy is just indestructible. And having that feeling, it takes the suspense away.<br/><br/>Another thing in this movie, the bad guy is a p**sy. He was just not evil enough for a Die Hard movie. I would expect nothing less from a Die Hard movie for Mc Clanes daughter to get a knee-cap for giving the guy s***. In part 1, 2 and 3 we saw cold-blooded murder of innocent people. In part two we even saw a whole jumbo jet full of people crashing and some guy's throat getting slit. In this last part, well, he offs his own personnel, but we don't really care about them because they're the bad guys anyway.<br/><br/>The movie industry really ruined this one. It could had been so great. They had the budget and the main actor. I can't believe they hired someone like Len Wiseman to do this movie. They had the budget... Hell if they had left out all the useless CGI that the first 3 films also didn't need, they could had gotten maybe Micheal Mann or Martin Scorsese to do it. <br/><br/>The thing that pisses me off the most though, is that they actually made a PG13 version. I couldn't believe it when I first saw it. A Die Hard movie... PG13... It was a true ""face-palm"" moment for me. ""No."" I wasn't mad, I was just confused. It messed with my reality because my brain knew it wasn't possible, yet my eyes saw it.<br/><br/>Good job Hollywood, you turned one of the most awesome, respected and loved movie series into another one-hit-wonder. Don't worry though, it will be forgotten as soon as the next explosion-filled, mediocre action movie comes out.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4=FAIL.<br/><br/>Note: I do like explosion filled action movies, as long as they are ridiculously over the top and turn into comedies. Like the old Arnie movies and Steven Seagal. Or recently, Crank 1 and 2."
"giftofgodoflove","7","0","1","12 August 2009"," great action, but sometimes preachy
","I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it twice in the theater, and I now own the DVD.<br/><br/>I was so nervous about this movie because I thought it would have the 'Rambo-effect'. If you're old, you're not going to be able to do what you used to. You were cool when you were young; but now that you're old, you need to grow up and start doing things your age. I was just waiting for this feeling to crop up in me, but it never did, thankfully.<br/><br/>As far as sequels go, it was good. The 'Yippe-kai-yay-mother-######' part made me cringe just a little, because I thought it was a little too self-conscious. I don't think there's a rule against putting it in, since I think Willis can pull it off - I just thought the timing was off.<br/><br/>McClane's personality is in full force. What I love about the character is the element of self-reliance. We all know people who seem to have it all together, who march to a different drummer, who don't go by the book. Sometimes they get in trouble, and sometimes they don't. But what they all have in common is the almost super-ability to get the job done no matter what the obstacles are. These people define their own meaning, look within for direction, and they act spontaneously, intuitively, and they end up being people who are very smart - on a practical level, a genius.<br/><br/>You see this personality in a lot of movies. For instance, I'm thinking of Dr. House, a very strong character, who, again, doesn't go by the book, gets in trouble with superiors, but invariably gets the job done! A lot of times these people aren't very likable if you actually met them, but that's not the point. These people are hard-wired to be guardians, as Plato would put it. They are physically and mentally wired to have this common sense that they can tap into at will to plow over the obstacle.<br/><br/>I like the scene where McClane admits he doesn't have computer-smarts. He's not up to date on all the latest advances in technology. But he does know how to load and fire a gun, probably any gun, engage in hand-to-hand combat, have a no-non-sense way of talking to people. He has a touch of the bully in him, but you know he is ultimately out for your good, if you happen to be under his care. I guess I'm trying to say that McClane is your quintessential 'superman', in Nietzsche's sense: a self-reliant guy who doesn't care what you think, but loves whatever he loves with a passion, even if he isn't perfect in the way he shows it, which is why a lot of these guys (or girls) can't keep a relationship; or if he can, then there's usually strain.<br/><br/>I didn't like the villain that much. Of course, you can't match the villain in the first Die Hard, but I just don't like this character in the role he was in. He played a Sheriff in the HBO series Deadwood, and I can't get that character out of my head; I think he'd be better at playing good guys - and I can't see this character undergoing the kind of transformation Denzel did in Training Day.<br/><br/>The action in the movie was awesome. There never was a boring moment. The fight scenes were very well choreographed, the car hitting the helicopter was great. The scene with McClane picking up Matthew and then protecting him from the French hit men was well-paced and entertaining. I love how McClane keeps his fighting style (which is really no style at all - just do whatever you can to kick their butt kind of style) even if you're fighting some guy who's flipping in and out and over and under various obstructions, or some kung fu, Asian chick.<br/><br/>I did feel like the movie was preaching at me sometimes. You had the scene where Matthew thought - before - it might be fun to cause a 'Firesale' which disrupts everything controlled by computers. McClane - all of a sudden - starts scolding him about how serious the whole scenario is, and how we have - everyday - brave people protecting us from stuff like this. It just seemed like it was sloppily stuffed into the script as some sort of post 9/11 tribute to the New York Fireman. The firemen are brave - no one's disputing that. But in terms of art, or success in art, if you're going to preach, don't be so obvious.<br/><br/>In the same vein, you had the scene where McClane's talking about what it's like to be a hero, how you don't get thanked, you get divorced, how you get shot at, and on and on. That was waaaaay too self-conscious; it was like McClane wasn't McClane anymore; he was a symbol for America's military, policeman, fireman, etc . . . And again, these guys deserve all the praise in the world! But in terms of Art, in terms of what drew us to McClane's character in the first place, that mysterious aesthetic quality that makes the first Die Hard an action classic, those kinds of scenes just need to be cut.<br/><br/>In sum, the Die Hard flavor was there, even if there was a little too much nostalgic indulgence on the part of the movie's makers. The good stuff over-shadowed the korny."
"sa_pagan","5","0","1","30 July 2009"," Pure action
","I was expecting a lot more out of this. Yes, it's got action, sometimes even great chase and fight scenes and stunts (""You've just killed an helicopter with a car""...), but there are no characters and no story (and lacking a good story, a movie really can't build up any suspense and tension) - nothing that would make this a ""real movie"", Die Hard 4 seems more like a video game. Nothing that happens doesn't actually has to happen, nothing is motivated - just a bunch of guys trying to kill others and get rich, and one superhero eventually saving the day. I have nothing against the actors: they do a great job as far as the script lets them, but there's no actual dialogue or conversation or even emotion - most lines are attempts at making a joke or trying to frighten someone. When Justin Long asks Bruce Willis why is he doing this, why he plays the part of the hero, Willis answers: ""Because no one else does it, i'm here, so I do it."" The movie seems a lot like this: Why? Because there wasn't yet a fourth one."

","What better line to describe 'Live Free or Die Hard' (or Die Hard 4.0) than ""You're a Timex watch in a digital age"" for ""old"" and ""old-fashioned"" John McClane. I do admire book (or computer) smarts, a la Justin Long and a band of new-age terrorists. But, honestly, I'll take someone just simply smart, in survival, the streets and in reading humans over someone simply focusing all their talents in one area. I feel that can take you further in life. Enter the perfect reawakening of John McClane 12 years after his last adventure in NYC. He returns to DC (from Part 2) with a new unwilling partner, his young cyber-connection to post-9/11. And speaking of which: yes, the previous films were before 9/11, and were almost blue prints for real life terrorism. This one embraces it. I loved the new script. I loved seeing McClane doing what he does best despite his so-called ""old-way of thinking."" The action was intense, the lines were hilarious, Kevin ""Warlock"" Smith was awesome, as was his and Long and Willis scenes, and another great villain from a very favorable actor, Olyphant, who I've admired since 'Broken Hearts Club.' Olyphant's lines were also hilarious, especially when dealing with a certain female hostage. Sure, as any 'Die Hard' film, you'll have to suspend your disbelief, such as when McClane's ""out of bullets"" helicopter attack – though, if you let your critic guard down, it was a great scene. Unfortunately, what nearly killed the film was the closing where a single military jet simply destroys a stacked freeway, followed by a leap frog escape, though more believable than McClane's out of plane experience in #2. Other than that, this was the best since #1, intelligent, fun and I hope for a 'Die Hard Already' part 5."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","1","5 May 2009"," ""Another day in paradise""
","Before I say anything about Die Hard 4, I just want to remind everyone that anything that has anything to do with computers in the movie serves no purpose other than to drive the plot and to provide for some surprisingly effective comic relief. There is tons and tons of nonsense about hacking into this and hacking into that and how only 9 guys in the world could do such and such with a laptop and blah blah blah blah. Don't take the time to try to figure out exactly what they're talking about, even if you're a computer expert (actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a computer expert), because it's just going to distract you from the rest of the movie, which is a pretty powerful argument that there is still a place for an old-school NYPD officer in the 21st century. <br/><br/>Let's review, shall we? Die Hard is still among the dwindling list of movie franchises where the original movie is still the best one. Part 2 was a cartoonish mess, and part 3, despite essentially plagiarizing the first Dirty Harry movie, was not the same thriller as the original but was still a great action movie. There have been many complains about casting Justin Long alongside Bruce Willis as his sidekick in this movie, because he's so well-known as the guy from the Apple Computer commercials. Maybe I watch too many movies and not enough TV, but to me he will always be known as the phenomenally idiotic Darry Jenner from Jeepers Creepers. Good God I hated that movie.<br/><br/>McClane has moved up in the world from reckless, irresponsible New York Cop to reckless, irresponsible absentee father who has little to do with his teenage daughter's life until some jerk drives her home and gets a little too pushy with her. John saves her from getting groped by some meathead, but she's still pretty unappreciative. Their relationship hasn't been so great over the years. Soon John is called to duty to pick up some kid named Matt Ferrell, who is on a short list of computer super-nerds wanted by the U.S. government due to a recent glitch in the national security computer systems.<br/><br/>John thinks nothing of the assignment until a high-tech assassination attempt is made on the kid, and he discovers that he's not the only person trying to track him down. It seems that everyone else on that short list has been executed by some shady organization, and John has to keep his cool trying to figure out who and why while they're trying to kill him and while, in the meantime, they manage to kidnap his daughter. <br/><br/>There is tons of great action in the movie, although detractors can easily call attention to the fact that the plot-line is clearly designed to set the stage for the next action pieces. Personally, I thought the action pieces were awesome, so I could really care less if there isn't exactly an Oscar-worthy script underneath it all. There is also the issue of the epic over- the-topness of some of the action pieces, such as the pilot of the fighter jet who can't seem to hit a lumbering SEMI truck, but can pilot his machine around under freeway overpasses, dodging bridges and whatnot. <br/><br/>But again, I feel like the over-the-topness, while not a huge part of the original movie, was introduced in part 2, explored a bit in part 3, and now has developed to a point where it is one of the most appealing parts of the movie. Put it this way – there is a scene in the movie where McClane takes down a helicopter, and if you are unimpressed with how he does it (and his reaction, which I would argue is one of the funniest parts of the whole movie), then you're either in the wrong frame of mind or this is just not your kind of movie. <br/><br/>Justin Long didn't have much to do in the film except crack jokes and pop out his handy roll- up keyboard and hack into anything that needed hacking within a few seconds, although he didn't detract from the movie as much as you would expect, given his iconography. Kevin Smith is purely hilarious as Long's super-geek buddy, and later the two teamed up again with Zack and Miri Make A Porno, in which Long was the star of one of the movie's funniest scenes. Timothy Olyphant is perfect as the movie's main villain, Thomas Gabriel. He's a little too clean-cut and flawlessly dressed and groomed, but he looks like a cross between Christian Slater and a young Jack Nicholson, and that's not a bad place to be if you're a Die Hard villain. It's just too bad that he's saddled with ancient action clichés like ""You have no idea who I am and what I'm capable of""<br/><br/>But the biggest problem with the casting is Maggie Q as Mai, Gabriel's crazy hot assistant. She's not only a super-genius computer hacker who can bring down national communication mainframes with a few strokes of the keyboard, but she's also a martial arts expert who, if Jason Statham and Jet Li were in this movie alongside Bruce Willis, she could hold them all off for a while, too. Hell, she might even have the pure, unadulterated ass-kicking know-how to make Steven Seagal bleed his own blood. Can you imagine? <br/><br/>The villain's main plot also falls apart pretty thoroughly (his plan to download the country's financial data from a ""backup"" location is feared to throw the nation into irreversible chaos – what does ""backup"" mean again, exactly?), but this is a nearly perfect summer action blockbuster."
"GodsPrototype","7","0","1","12 April 2009"," Eighties hero still cuts it in a digital age
","I loved this film. It's big, loud, brash, exciting & big! I have seen action films that are better conceived & believable than 'Die Hard 4.0' but this is just damn good huge-budget fun. You can see where they spent their money making this movie. I must admit that I'm writing this review after a second viewing of the film and it got better.<br/><br/>John McClane is one of the best original action heroes still going and this film has the responsibility to hark back to action films of the eighties in the form of dragging John McClane into the 21st Century & the Digital age. It works very well. Looking at Bruce Willis performing his most famous character is like looking at a time capsule in the wrong film but he makes us believe in him again.<br/><br/>He gives new style cyber terrorists a taste of a good old-fashioned Eighties action thumping and wethe audience loves it. Hints of the original soundtrack litter the film in places and the inclusion of John's daughter into the script is much needed to give him a personal reason to continue to the end.<br/><br/>John McClane speaks of being 'That man' and he proves himself to be one of the greatest action heroes in the history of film whether you like the films or not. Obviously this is not as good or pioneering as the first 'Die Hard' but it is better than 'Die Hard 2' and on a par with 'Die Hard with a Vengeance.' There are so many more stunts and explosions in this film and that's why we love it, we don't necessarily love it for the storyline or the logic of the whole thing we love it because it looks damn good and the spectacle is a great one.<br/><br/>Suspend your common sense & logic when watching this film and see what John McClane provides us with. He gets thrown through windows and out of buildings, shot at by numerous henchmen, fights with a 'Ninja Asian chick', has bombs going off all around him and has cars thrown at him! But coming from the eighties style action films, naturally he survives to fight the good fight.<br/><br/>Where else would you see a car being used as a missile to take down a helicopter and McClane driving a juggernaut being chased and attacked by a Fighter Jet as an entire freeway system crashes down all around him. Okay, obvious comparisons to True Lies & other high-budget action films but it just looks so damn good on film.<br/><br/>This may not be a hugely worthy successor to the Die Hard Trilogy, even the filmmakers mention that the script was not written as a Die Hard film, but it is proof that Hollywood can still make good big action films and excite audiences with what we see on screen. (A jeep sliding down an elevator shaft...very cool)<br/><br/>It's quite funny in places, action & stunt packed, good fun and harks back to an era where an Eighties cop wouldn't think twice about hitting his commanding officer. Not a perfect film by any means and slightly incomprehensible but just good fun! Not the best action movie ever made by a long shot but a very worthy addition to the DVD collection. 8/10"

Bruce Willis played his role really well - I can't think of a better actor to play John McClane.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't see this in the cinema (I really wish I did considering how good the movie is) - but even at home it was a really great experience watching it.

In all seriousness, though, the direction was far from predictable, with interesting shots which managed to keep the untold thousands of explosions meaningful, and good use of cinematographic resources.

","Die Hard 4.0 or Live Free or Die Hard (I think many one should called it Die Hard 4 rather than the 20 Century Fox name, may be their executives think the movie should have the great name but people still call it Die Hard 4) is the new sequel since Die Hard with a Vengeance which was ended very silly in 1995.<br/><br/>After I watched this movie, I think this sequel was not really ""Die Hard"" way, even many one liked it but not me. I was OK with the first 90 minutes of the movie but after that, it made me disappointed with it. Die Hard 4 had a very good plot for using the computer hacking subject in this sequel and they showed how the villain could get over the computer system in the U.S.A.<br/><br/>Despite the very good plot and extreme action, I didn't like the way of Thomas Gabriel in this movie. Gabriel is really the one of my heinous villain in many movies I watched. His devilish thrilled every one to see how he is end but it was very silly for his death. I didn't know who made the direction for Thomas Gabriel's death in the movie. That's not Die Hard. If you had seen ""Firewall"" starred by Harrison Ford or ""The Marine"" starred by John Cena, WWE Superstars. Die Hard 4 is the same as my example. ""Yippee Ki Yay Mo"" and then kill Gabriel! OK! it was very amazing shot but it is too easy and corny. I was very surprised how Maggie Q showed her skill in the movie but the henchman must has the worst death rather than their boss? Is the Die Hard 4 crew think about this fact? Oh my god! Why they didn't kill Gabriel by stabbed the quill through his eye? If you saw Die Hard 1 and 2. That's the way Die Hard 4 should be. The blast of action, the reasonable plot and the great ending. Why Die Hard 4 forgot the last one? John McClane did himself like ""The big old cat"" in the last 10 minutes of the movie. For God Sake! McClane is the hero! He is the great! for 105 minutes but in last 10 minutes. Oh my god! he looked very weak! We didn't see any silly like this. Die Hard 1 - 3 didn't show how John McClane weakened but Die Hard 4 do it. Thomas Gabriel could be happy that he is the only man who can make John McClane ""The big old cat"". Did our IMDb viewer understand my explanation? The weak McClane and the silly death of Thomas Gabriel is the reason why I told you this is not really ""Die Hard"".<br/><br/>I accepted that the blast of action and the reasonable plot still in this Die Hard 4 but the great ending is miss. Maybe Len Wiseman or the production crew, especially the scriptwriter or screenplay writer forgot this fact. They use intense of action, drama and thrilling at first but use the silly, corny and unreasonable at last. I have to tell everyone I voted 5 out of 10 because they have the blast of action and the great plot. If you have the great ending, it will not at 5 points!"
"formala44","3","0","2","1 February 2009"," A waste of time and money
","I generally like the Die Hard franchise. Number one was fantastic and to this day enjoyable. Number two was a little less believable but it was still a class movie. Number 3 had a bad plot but Samuel L. Jackson was a great cast vs Willis. But 4.0 didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, Die Hard one was the first of the average joe turned savior. The fail able hero Bruce Willis vs a bunch of robbers.<br/><br/>The problem for any sequel seems to be the action always needs to be better, the bad guys badder, the amount of money they want to steal even more huge. I think that is where 4.0. fails to convince.<br/><br/>A car launched into the air taking out a helicopter, another car crashes on top of two other cars whilst just missing Willis and Long. Willis on top of a slowly spinning pilot-less jet fighter. Willis driving an SUV blind through a wall and manages to take out one of the bad guys in an elevator shaft. It is too much to make it enjoyable.<br/><br/>Then there's the plot. For about an hour you have absolutely no clue what the bad guys are aiming at but eventually their goal is revealed. The bad guys are trying to steal billions by taking some computer files. These bad guys are led by a brilliant software engineer who, for some unknown reason, decides to ask several hackers to write a hacking code to get into a system he himself has designed. Uhm? If he designed that system himself, why didn't he himself write such a program? After these hackers have written such a code for large sums of money, for some strange the bad guys decide all these hackers need to be killed. Mcclane is tasked with protecting one of them.<br/><br/>In Die Hard one the bad guys take over a building, in two an airport and in three a city. And now in 4.0 half the U.S. You wonder what will be next in Die Hard 5; the world? The galaxy? I wish it would be something oversee-able. A mall. A factory. A Mcdonalds for all I care. But i really wish Mclane would be Mclane again. A likable ordinary guy, without special fighting techniques, trying to beat a few ordinary bad guys. And without overdone special effects or boring sidekicks.<br/><br/>I bought 4.0 on DVD for a few bucks but after watching 60 minutes I stopped the play because i got bored. Finished it after a few days but I still conclude my money was wasted."

","Let me tell you that I really like Bruce Willis and most of his movies. I liked the original Die Hard-movies, I'm fan of the Last Boys Scout and The Last Man Standing. These are awesome action movies! Well, I really wanted to like the new Die Hard-flick as much as I loved the old ones, but I just couldn't think of it as a Die Hard-movie. Why? Because it's PG-13. And that's a serious problem my friend, if you ask me. If I wanna see a pg-13 action-flick, I go and see the Bourne Supremacy. Good movie. But if I want to see a good old fashioned balls-to-the-walls action movie with Bruce Willis - well - I'm afraid that's not the right movie to see. This is truly Die Light. The only thing remind me the other chapters of that series is Bruce Willis, but I think he looks a bit tired. And what about the villain? There is NO villain in this movie! Oh, yeah Timothy Olyphant plays a guy who want to teach America a lesson. He's so weak. He's so not good. And what kind of villain is that who doesn't kill anybody? I mean, come on, remember Alan Rickman? He WAS the perfect Die Hard-villain. He has balls, he has voice, he was evil and that's it. Sorry, Tim, you failed! You are a crappy bad guy! Let's talk about the action. Good. I have to say that the action is good. Not awesome, not terrific, just good. Nothing more, nothing less. Nothing special.<br/><br/>The one-liners are not bad but...I think that the writers tried too hard to find a good one-liner and...Some of it feels so un-natural and un-authentic. But that's just my personal-opinion.<br/><br/>The weakest of the Die Hard movies."
"long-ford","Null","0","1","8 January 2009"," excellent action thriller, worthy entry in Die Hard series
","Live Free or Die Hard is an excellent action thriller and a worthy entry in the Die Hard series. The plot has Bruce Willis as John Mclane bringing down a terrorist who is trying to destroy the nation's infrastructure in a 'fire-sale'. There are very few lulls and the action goes on virtually nonstop. The stunts and CGI work is very good and the film is strongly recommended as a thrill ride. The only weak points are a couple of lame one-liners by Bruce Willis and a somewhat weak villain played by Timothy Olyphant. Maggie Q, his hench woman is much better and should have had a bigger role. Profanity is however less than usual for a Die Hard film and that might be an issue for some(!).<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"
"ksundstrom","6","0","1","6 January 2009"," Die Hard Action Extreme
","For action unrelenting a vote of 8/10. But for a film for those who like a story of human breadth, like me, then only 4/10. Die Hard 4 repeats the warning, repeated during the last 15 years or so of the vulnerability of a society dependent too much on computer information systems. Thus, if any societal computer system crashes to politicians surprise one will have to conclude that they never learnt from all the Hollywood films warning them of the risques. Die Hard 4 slams the vulnerability issue really hard into those responsible for national security. The film makes a quick direct reference to FEMA/US Administration and its failure to handle the New Orleans Katrina disaster! Another issue in the film is the Big Brother surveillance of private people that is increasing rapidly in the US. So Die Hard 4 offers nothing substantially new. It reemphasizes the problems with more exasperation and fear. No need to think anew, just sit back and admire the pyro-technics of Hollywood's creativity. Computer games and internet amusements appear to be the food for thought for an increasing share of the population. Maybe this increasing public don't care much for political issues nor have time to understand world events - though this public likes to comment in blogs, etc. Unfortunately American security efforts abroad, repeat abroad, seem way behind what one should expect from the professionalism of Hollywood on security actions films. Die Hard 4 is also a warning to the US Government: reliance on super technology fails against mans ingenuity on the ground. Witness Afghan fighters in 2008 proving a match for American super military technology - like Bruce Willis surviving the onslaught of the latest super US Air Force fighter attack! Therefore, Die Hard 4 has an important political message. Bruce Willis and company all act exceptionally well. The computer boys are faultless. No other country can compete in this genre."
"predator_silver77","8","0","1","16 December 2008"," Die Hard 4 My Spiel
","The Plot: When a criminal plot by ""Thomas Gabriel"" (Timothy Olyphant) to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States (and the world), it's up to a decidedly ""old school"" hero, police detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), to take down the conspiracy, with the help of a young hacker ""Matt Ferrell"" (Justin Long).<br/><br/>My Spiel: Live Free or Die Hard was something special to many Die Hard fans have been waiting for and thinking they would never see another. Non-stop action and bits of comedy along the way. Die Hard is back with a mega bang, with John McClane this time completely out of his element and doesn't care or understand new technology is right in the middle of it. But that doesn't stop him from knowing how to kill bad guys the old fashion way. ""You have got to be running out of bad guys by now""! One of my favorite quotes of the movie. The action is spot on, but the only part I had to say I disliked about this non-stop joy ride was the semi truck vs. F-35 Lightning 2. I can understand john escaping from all his past adventures. But a state of the art jet flying that clumsy is just insane and a little ridicules. But shaking off that insanity. This movie is truly something of a rare site to see a good 4th installment into the already great Die Hard history.<br/><br/>End Result: If you haven't seen this I urge to to see it fast. Also seeing as we are starting to go all computers, the story is original, and flashy. Then you have a old school hero who hates nothing more then new technology. The scenes with Bruce Willis and Justin Long bickering is something that makes this stand out. Easily tied in my book with the first Die Hard.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard (2007) Review: 8/10"

","The Die Hard films have always had a great vibe about them.There is always a wonderful sense of scale and a great blend of humour and I'm glad to say both are still evident in this fourth outing in the series.Bruce Willis still looks the part as John McClane,age certainly hasn't slowed him down and he cracks as wise as ever.The slight let down with this entry is Timothy Olyphant as the main villain.Hes about as threatening an sinister as David Attenborough,yes,not very.Maggie Q however,as his kung-fu kicking partner in crime is great to watch and the set piece face off between her and McClain is one of the films high points.Die Hard 4.0 isn't the best of the series but it holds its own against part three in my book and continues the series respectably.Willis' action man days may be numbered but if this is his sign off for the Die Hard series then he has gone out on a high. 8/10"
"Petey-10","8","0","1","10 October 2008"," John McClane- back in action
","20 years ago Die Hard (1988) introduced us detective John McClane, played by Bruce Willis.He fought against terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza.Two years later we saw the same cop in Washington D.C. at Dulles Airport fighting for his life.In 1995 the New York cop goes back home and goes all over city looking for bombs.Those were all good action movie.The first part is an action movie classic.I saw it for the first time in 1994 and was amazed.After seeing the third part I started waiting for the 4th part and last year it finally happened.Yippee Ki Yay! John McClane is back and he's still the cowboy! I saw the film a couple of weeks ago, September 28th.It was Sunday.I may not be as exited of it as I would have been in the late 90's but it's still pretty cool.Now McClane is fighting against cyber-terrorists that are hacking into FBI computers.That is an unknown world for this analog cop.With him he has this young guy, hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long).Bruce Willis is bald and a little bit older this time as John McClane.But he's still as tough.Justin Long is good as his young and scared partner.Kevin Smith is Warlock.Maggie Q is the female villain Mai Lihn that kicks.The main villain, Thomas Gabriel is played by Timothy Olyphant.He doesn't quite have what Alan Rickan had as Hans Gruber.Or William Sadler as Coloner Stuart.Or Jeremy Irons as Simon Gruber.There's also John's daughter Lucy in this part, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.It would have been great if Bonnie Bedelia would have reprised her role as Holly Gennero, I mean McClane.But that didn't happen since they're divorced.Len Wiseman, a director I didn't know previously directed Live Free or Die Hard (2007).In Finland and in some other countries it's known as Die Hard 4.0.John McTiernan and Renny Harlin did steady job with the previous parts.This time there's this younger fellow in charge and the movie is also for the younger audience.It's rated PG-13 instead of rated R.That's a little disappointment since after all this is Die Hard we're talking about.Why must pretty much everything be for the young teens today? But it does have some great action scenes.Take Bruce Willis and the truck for instance.Or the car colliding with the helicopter.And when he's in the elevator shaft with Mai.He was in the elevator shaft also in the first part, except this time he's there with a car.This is a nice addition to the Die Hard franchise.I guess all we can do now is wait for Die Hard 5."

First rate special effects where the hero cop is called in to tackle some nasty ""baddies"" in their plot to destroy America via the internet. All the actors give convincing whole hearted performances, some interesting geeks on display especially the one played by Justin Long who has super screen presence and charisma. Bruce Willis seems made for the lead in these kind of films. The picture is full of high tech stuff and plenty of car chases etc too. Thus the real winner in the movie is the action which rattles along for about 2 hours with hardly a pause for breath.<br/><br/>8/10."
"kyle-cruse","8","0","1","20 August 2008"," Second best in the series
","It took me over a year of watching this film to decide that it is my second favorite in the ""Die Hard"" series (I rank them 1st, 4th, 2nd, 3rd). ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is still inferior to the original, but this part four has become a favorite of mine. I honestly wasn't sure how good this film would be. I felt Bruce Willis was getting too old to play John McClane anymore, and I thought this concept of bad guys virtually shutting down the U.S. would be too serious for a somewhat humorous action film like this one. Nevertheless, this film works really well. It's better than parts 2 and 3 because it has a greater amount of character development. The action scenes are some of the most memorable ones you will ever see (the helicopter scene, the chase with the jet on the freeway, etc.). Justin Long proved to be a way better co-star than I would have expected, and he adds a more hip type of humor to lighten up this film. Bruce Willis plays his role nearly as good as he first did 20 years ago. It's not nearly a perfect film, however, since the bad guys lack the humor and brilliant acting that Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) had in the first film. Fortunately, the violence and language in this film are far less than that found in the first three films. A fun film, and the best ""Die Hard"" since the first one, but not nearly as monumental as that one.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"andrew-lyall","9","0","1","3 August 2008"," brilliant action, few clichés
","As an action film and a piece of story-telling it grips from first to last. As such, it is brilliantly done. It is also absurd in that the heroes seem indestructible, but that is a convention of the genre. The Bruce Willis character is practically a hospital case after about the first 10 minutes, but gets back up and survives several violent explosions and landing from a collapsing overpass onto a crashing aeroplane, and walks away again. The acting is excellent, especially the young nerd played by Justin Long, and the interaction between him and Willis is well realized, as a growing relationship. In Die Hard the bad guys were just criminals. Now they are terrorists, though disappointingly not motivated by ideology. Maybe jihadists would be too obvious. The central concept of a cyber firesale is brilliantly realized, with a bit of suspension of disbelief. How did they assemble all that equipment and hardware without anyone noticing? or is the FBI really that bad. Some clichés were irritating. How many times are they going to do the bit about Willis' gun being just out of his reach?"
"cherold","8","0","1","15 July 2008"," turn off your brain and enjoy!
","First off, this movie is irretrievably stupid. From little things like a cop that doesn't call for backup when he's in a fire fight to an evil plan that insists on such remarkable stupidity of every branch of national and local government (true, as someone points out, it took five days for the government to get water to Katrina victims, but that doesn't mean the country is protected by keystone cops) to the remarkably stupid actions of both henchman and hero, this movie shows a general disdain for reality or common sense.<br/><br/>What the movie has going for it though, is witty dialog, effective performances, over-the-top action scenes and a lot of ""whoah!!!!!!"" moments, most involve cars and trucks (the best of which is a fight in a car dangling in an elevator shaft).<br/><br/>I debated with myself a bit over whether to give this movie 7 stars or 8. It's so stupid it really should get seven, yet by the end I was having such a blast that it didn't seem right to give it less than 8. Sometimes a movie is enough fun to get away with gross illogic; this is such a movie."

Good Things: I like how it shows the relationship between McClane and his daughter now, it was pretty funny in the beginning.

","As with any big franchise, the follow-on films always turn out to be a challenge. It is very rare that a sequel will top the original, but films like ALIENS and GODFATHER PART II are two examples that prove the exception.<br/><br/>DIE HARD 4.0 has had to misfortune of being released when the very genre it's original film inspired and created has evolved to even greater spectacle with little or none of the intelligent dramatic punch that personified the 1988 film. The Bond series reinvented itself throughout the subsequent decades and CASINO ROYALE has paved the way for potential follow-on films.<br/><br/>The fourth film sees John McClane brought in to escort a computer hacker to the FBI after a series of mysterious computer-related explosions kill off some of his ilk. It transpires that a crazed Bill Gates type figure is holding the US and world to ransom by shutting down the computer systems. It's a theme that has already been explored to some degree in SNEAKERS in which the film focused on whether it was the holders of information that control the military and political landscape.<br/><br/>Cue big stunts, visual effects and that trademark humour that is fluid throughout all three films. Whilst the fourth film still lacks some of the punch and some script logistics raise an eyebrow (how on earth did they allow a drunk ex-cop like McClane to hold a pilot's licence - but it is the movies - suspend your disbelief!!) there is still much to enjoy.

First, after McClane is separated from the van he is following and the Jet scene ensues, it is hilarious to me that he just happens to look up and lo-and-behold, that van was just going around the block. If you have seen the movie, you will know what I am talking about.

","My Take: This effects-laden stroll-down-memory-lane is fun, mostly thanks to Willis' return as McLane. <br/><br/>""Why can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?"" That's what John McLane asks, and after 12 years, until now John McLane is still having a bad day. Back at the wrong place at the wrong time, Bruce Willis is thrust back to play one of his most beloved characters in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD (or simply DIE HARD 4.0), a long-delayed sequel to the highly successful DIE HARD franchise. Back as McLane, Willis proves that, even if he lost most of his hair, he hasn't lost the ""Yippee Ki Yay""'s and all.<br/><br/>So far, the series has been healthy. The first three DIE HARD movies have been successful box-office hits. I liked the first three DIE HARD movies (the first and the second as the best), but does this big-budget effects-driven fourth entry measure up. The answer, it's just about as good as the third film in the series DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE, but I don't think it's as good as the first two. Still, during these days where sequels all but promise a bigger more promising sequels, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD lives up to its legacy.<br/><br/>Back fighting against terrorist in every way, McLane is pitted against a maniacal computer genius named Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a surprisingly competent villain who's nearly up there with Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, who took over the city's power and computer systems, who ransoms for a large amount of money to give it all back. McLane aids help from computer hacker Matt Ferrel (Justin Long) to stop the mastermind and save his daughter (the stunning Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who's been captured, but not without any style, action, stunts and all those yippee Ki Yay's.<br/><br/>Since CGI has already taken advantage from many other action films to date, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is not about to get left behind. Director Len Wiseman (whose recent resume is the UNDERWORLD films) put in a lot of excessive flashy unbelievable stunts triggered with CGI, much like those stunts in XXX and the Bond film DIE ANOTHER DAY. Due to its use (or more overuse) on special effects, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD loses the solid impact of its predecessors. The stunts are unbelievable, and t6he CGI makes it look more exciting, but not any more believable.<br/><br/>Still, what an impact. It ain't the best in the series, but it's a worthy effort and a terrific successor to the first three pictures. Fans won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","By far the worst film in the series, I'm amazed that it's rated so highly here on IMDb. True, it does have a lot of action but it goes overboard with it. OK, one could argue that all Die Hard films are a bit overboard with action but at least you didn't have to turn off your mind to watch those. You'll find more realism in Bugs Bunny cartoons. This film is sort of True Lies meets Rambo in that regard.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the cast is good. Willis, Olyphant and Long play their parts perfectly. It could be said that the cast is the only good point in the movie.<br/><br/>I don't wanna say that you shouldn't watch this film, it's decent if you need to kill two hours of your time, but it doesn't change the fact that the film is mediocre, especially compared to the other films in the series..."

","I just watched this movie on DVD and I find myself, yet again, holding my breath while watching most of the action scenes. I agree with some of the other people who sent out comments that it's not as gruesome as the 3 previous flicks but McClaine still got beat up pretty badly. He still kicked a** on this one! I liked one particular car scene, ""throwing"" the car at the helicopter that was chasing them. nicely done! The truck chase is also a great part, not really excited about the plane chasing him though. It looked too fake to me. I wish they gave John's daughter more fight scenes, just for a change. She looked really though."

","Isn't is interesting to see how a series will morph over time. Take the Death Wish films, for example since they've been on TV so much lately. In the first film we are introduced to a simple man taken to the brink by incredible circumstances that force him to fight. By the third of those films, the ordinary guy had become a legitimate action figure; killing an entire army of punks in the streets. The Die Hard films have taken the same route. In the original, we are introduced to a tough and resourceful cop named John McClaine. He is forced to fight for his life and that of his wife and he is able to survive one dangerous situation after the next. But the guy was HUMAN! Remember him crawling into the bathroom after his bare feet were cut to ribbons by broken glass, and the agony as he pulled some pieces out while he talked to the cop over the radio? Remember him pleading, ""please don't let me die!"" as he was about to jump off the building with a firehouse tied around his waist? That John McClaine is just a memory by 2007....<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard if nothing else is an exciting film. That's good, because any logic to this plot of cyber-hackers shutting down our nation's infrastructure just cannot be found. The story takes place over the 4th of July holiday weekend. A former web designer for our government has hacked into all government computers and basically shut down the entire country. I'm no computer geek, so I won't say something like this would be impossible, but it doesn't seem likely. John McClaine now is an agent for the Dept of Homeland Security and he tracks down Justin Long who unknowingly helped the bad guy hack the system. The bad guy (Timothy Olyphant) now wants Long dead, and it is up to McClaine to keep him safe and of course save the entire country from this manic and his army of henchmen. Since the plot would seem preposterous on many levels, it is a good thing the film is packed with incredible stunts, violent deaths, and massive explosions. There are also plenty of funny one-liners, as you would come to expect from a Die Hard film. Kevin Smith has a hilarious cameo as a computer hacker type of guy known as the Warlock who helps the good guys out.<br/><br/>Taken as a pure action fantasy, this film works quite well. Maybe one down side is Timothy Olyphant as the mastermind. He is just too bland for such a role. A film like this needs an Alan Rickman, or even an Eric Bagosian (Under Siege 2) for some humor. How can a villain in a movie like this not be having any fun? In the film's defense may be the fact that this guy was supposed to be a government bureaucrat type who may not have had a colorful personality. The film did some good business last summer. Bruce Willis looks pretty good for his age, but some of the stunts his character goes through are simply preposterous. And Maggie Q is pretty hot! Taken for what it is, the movie is really a lot of fun. 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","Revival of the Die Hard franchise sees Willis' McClane up against Cyber terrorists.<br/><br/>It's been a while coming - the Die Hard trilogy seemed to be the neat conclusion of a very engaging and enduring action story, featuring Bruce Willis' legendary McClane as the cop who all bad things seem to happen to - but rumours began to spread that a fourth offering was in the works, and here we are in 2007/2008 and a shiny new Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>First things first - yes, it is called Die Hard, and yes it has Bruce Willis as John McClane - but those are basically the only real aspects this one has in common with the other 3 bar the obvious genre attachment.<br/><br/>This McClane is older, wiser, a little less wisecracking, but also more charming than he used to be. And that's not the only difference.<br/><br/>To sum up the story, a terrorist organisation headed by Olyphant's fairly mediocre villain (not really the actor's fault, the character just wasn't that good, certainly compared to the previous Die Hard villains) is trying to shut down the USA - public services, national security, computer systems; these are being targetted for incapacitation.<br/><br/>Long's computer hacker genius Farrell is being targetted by this organisation for elimination - but McClane rescues him and the two set about trying to save the day.<br/><br/>First and foremost, a movie has to be entertaining - and Die Hard 4 is absolutely that. It is 100MPH from beginning to end, and manages to engage the cyberpunk world without totally confusing the viewer. The direction is simply not noticeable at all, such is the pace the whole thing moves at.<br/><br/>The action sequences are a lot of fun; big explosions, fights, gunfights, and the odd car chase or two. Die Hard 4 has it all and manages to fit it all together without it seeming disjointed.<br/><br/>However, as hinted at in my title, the action sequences (and most of the movie, being honest) is just so implausible and utterly ridiculous that suspension of disbelief is entirely required.<br/><br/>Truth is though, you won't much care - it's just a fun blast from beginning to end which never takes itself remotely seriously.<br/><br/>The reason this feels removed from the rest of the trilogy is because it doesn't have the same grit - it's a lot more smooth and hi tech, and fun. And as mentioned, this really isn't the same McClane as he once was.<br/><br/>That doesn't matter though. It does what all movies should do - entertain, engage, and captivate."

","Nowhere near the original, but a fun watch anyhow. I enjoyed the action sequences even though many of them were ridiculous but the PG-13 rating doomed the many gunshot battles. What always made the Die Hard movies great were the brutal slayings and blood splattering effects. They blew a lot of stuff up though, so thats a plus. I'd say this one was fourth out of the four Die Hard Movies, but at least it was in the same vein. I like how McLean's accomplices have changed over the years, the Cop (Urkle's dad) in the first one, the janitor in the second one, Samuel L, in NYC, and now a computer geek from Camden. I thought the best terrorist was the Asian woman. I got pretty much what I expected out of this one."

John Mclane doesn't need to play by the rules, and some of the things he does in the movie are just not physically possible, but i didn't care. the one liners never got old, and Justin long brought some fresh comedy to the table. half way through the movie i completely forget that Bruce Willis was like 50. i was just so immersed in the action and what was going on. if you got nothing to do one night and your just looking to chill i would pick up this movie. its a lot of fun, and just a great action movie."

","There's only one word that can describe the latest Die Hard movie ""Action-Packed"". Or is that two words?. Who cares all I'm saying is this installment deserves the Die Hard name. I didn't think it would but it does deserve it's place in the greatest action movie series of all time.<br/><br/>It's been over ten years since the last Die Hard movie and after seeing this John Mclane is still the best action hero. I have seen both the theater version and the uncut version. They are both worthy of a 9 out of 10 but I would see the uncut version. Or see both and make your own choice.<br/><br/>I have seen this getting bad reviews because it has unrealistic action. But I think that suit's the Cyber terrorist theme. It may be the most unrealistic Die Hard but it is still awesome.<br/><br/>Now we come to the actors. Bruce Willis still holds the John McClane role tight and brings back the greatest action hero ever. He still has the great one-liners and still swears (in the uncut version). But he is missing his cigarette and white singlet. Don't worry he is still our great John McClane. When I first looked at the actors for this movie it had Justin Timberlake as John McClane's son. I was like don't do this to me please. But they luckily killed that idea and put Justin Long (the guy from the Mac computers ad) as Matt Farrell. Even then I was like what?. Don't worry he pulls it off very well. He was funny and witty. Then there was a girl villain played by Maggie Q. She was like a ninja or something and she brings us a great fight. You probably already know who it is between.<br/><br/>Now I come to the villain. The big main villain I mean. He is played by Timothy Olyphant. Most know him from Deadwood. He is also playing agent 47 in the movie 'Hitman'. His character Thomas Gabriel seemed to be a bit wimpy. He isn't the worst villain to be in a Die Hard movie but he comes close.<br/><br/>This is a great action flick and is one of the best Die Hard movies.<br/><br/>It goes: Die Hard (10/10) Die Hard 4.0 (Live Free or Die Hard in America) (9/10) Die Hard: With a Vengeance (8/10) Die Hard 2: Die Harder (8/10)<br/><br/>Anyway all the Die Hard movies are must see's and even must owns.

John McClane fighting a F35 jet and flying a helicopter? What next a duel in space!?! What did they do to the bad guy? What kind of thread he was?

It would have been much better if they had kept it more realistic. It's a great idea about cyber-terrorists and all that but if they don't even TRY to make it believable, then it's really not that interesting.

"refresh_daemon","7","0","1","17 January 2008"," Slick and generally enjoyable entertainment
","This latest entry in the Die Hard series isn't bad. In fact, it's a rather fun summer blockbuster action film. While it still suffers a little from the general problems that plague the rest of the Die Hard series, it also retains most of their strengths, leading to a rather entertaining, if empty, watch.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is again John McClane. The character has hardly changed, although he shows more bitterness. But, generally, McClane is completely in McClane mode throughout the whole thing and there's very little variation from it. His accomplice this time is in Justin Long as a computer hacker. Justin's character is generally reactive and not a particularly strong character, but at least his personality is more dynamic than McClane's rock-steady determination. The villains are a bunch of combat ready computer nerds and while some of them do make for kinetic displays of action, they are still rather uncharismatic and consequently, uninteresting, although still not as all-out boring as the villains in Die Hard 2.<br/><br/>The story itself deals with some computer hackers that basically bring the nation to its knees. While the disaster it causes is one heck of a headache, because of the nature of the threat, it all feels rather distant, lacking the urgency of direct people-killing, crashing planes, or blowing up chunks of Manhatten. McClane rescues the hacker and they go off trying to stop the big bad. All rather ho-hum, but Live Free takes the route of the first Die Hard to keep the stakes up by involving McClane's daughter, Lucy (who is written humorously like a young female John McClane). However, since the actual threat over the course of the film doesn't escalate, the overall sense of suspense is a little diminished.<br/><br/>The action pieces in Live Free are spectacular. Whether the tunnel with the crashing cars, the fighter plane versus a big rig, or the many fist-fight/shoot-outs that occur, they are all exciting and keep the suspense fairly high. Unfortunately, the action pieces in this film also show highlight the extreme improbability of everything that McClane does. He frequently gets by solely on luck, which isn't as compelling as when he makes good decisions that lead to his success. It stretches the believability factor almost as much as Die Hard 2.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a slick piece of entertainment. The core story primarily appears to exist to string along a bunch of action and McClane-style badassery, with a tiny little bit about what it means to be a hero. While in the end, it's not greatly compelling, it serves its function well in sticking the action together and provides an enjoyable enough popcorn flick. And while it doesn't quite reach the level of the first and third of the series, it's not as ridiculous as the second and has higher production values than all of the rest to boot. So, a slick, enjoyable action film with not a whole lot more going on. And sometimes, a little junk food is okay. 7/10."

","Live Free or Die Hard is an intense action film and the 52 year old Bruce Willis does some extraordinary stunts, stunts that would floor your average 52 year old cop. But when his side kick complained that he had low blood sugar and needed food, even mentioning a fast food place in sight, they didn't stop. Now all this frenetic action takes loads of energy and fuel but our hero and his charge never stopped to eat, to replenish their souls and bodies. Yes, there were over the top action sequences and that's why I wondered whey they got all that energy. I like action movies, I have dozens of them and like them for their over the top action but I still want some kind of reality in them, hence, the food. I remember that even my hero, Sean Connery, in The Rock, mentioned that he just might be too old for all the foolishness they were asking him to do, I liked that touch because it showed him as being human, Willis and his antics were super human and didn't fit the body of a 52 year old cop. Still, I wanted Live Free or Die Hard for my collection and will probably watch it a couple of times. I did find it intense. And that's what these action movies are all about, aren't they?"
"dead47548","8","0","1","8 January 2008"," Loses some of the classic Die Hard appeal, but thrilling nonetheless.
","One of the main appeals of the Die Hard franchise was always that it wasn't some super-spy or big badass cop taking on some superhuman bad guys. It was just an ordinary man in a small, but deadly situation. Slowly the setting has gotten larger and larger (from an office building to an airport to New York and now it's the entire nation) and that takes a little bit of the fun out of it. Also the fact that McClane is more superhuman than human (the original John McClane wouldn't have survived everything this one went through) takes a bit of the classic Die Hard feel away.<br/><br/>It's all a little over-the-top and some of it is just too contrived to stand (the jet vs. rig was pathetic) but it still manages to be one of the most entertaining, action-packed and completely engaging action films of all time. It really perfects the type of stuff the genre has been trying to achieve this decade (the massive-scale, apocalyptic fear, technology based kind of stuff). In fact, off the top of my head only this and Shooter are the only really admirable pure action films of the decade. McClane is such a fun, mantastic character and his aging charisma makes Live Free or Die Hard an insanely enjoyable picture.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis was born for this character and he just brings a grin to my face every time he plays him (that laugh is just perfect). Justin Long, surprisingly, is the perfect sidekick for Bruce in this one. Timothy Olyphant is a pretty lackluster villain. Too young, too dull, too annoying and too...lame. The real badass villain comes in the form of the seemingly-robotic Maggie Q who kicks a hell of a lot of ass before making her leave in my favorite scene of the entire film. All in all, it's pretty contrived and doesn't really stick to the Die Hard formula I love so much but it's still wicked entertaining and one of the best purely action films ever made."

","Giving Die Hard 4.0 a 7 is flattering it. I think it only deserves a 6,5 and I think the current 7,7 average is well too flattering. THe reason for this is that the action sequences try and top everything McCLane ever had to endure in the other Die Hard movies. They do succeed in doing this, but bigger is not always better. Sometimes Willis, Wiseman and Co. just try too hard to include bigger bangs and it makes some of the scenes seem ridiculous.<br/><br/>I think this is a letdown from other Die Hard movies and Willis seems nothing more than a tired hero. He does also seem more human though, which is something I enjoyed. A few scenes were quite touching and I must admit, that in that perspective Die Hard 4.0 made a good impression.

It makes a big difference, because profanity and violence is as much a part of the Die Hard movies as singing is a part of musicals. Die Hard are not action movies for kids and it was ridiculous and an insult to the fans, to try to get a wider audience by making a TV-version of Die Hard.<br/><br/>Timothy Olyphant is still a lame, not scary villain and had Thomas Gabriel met Hans Gruber, he would have messed up his pants. He can't measure up to Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>But Bruce Willis himself is still the coolest action hero around!! <br/><br/>But some of the bad guys, working for Thomas Gabriel, what language are they speaking and why can't they be Americans like their leader? Is it Len Wiseman's preference for European characters like in his Underworld movies?<br/><br/>But the unrated version is almost as good a Die Hard movie as the previous ones.

","Die Hard (1988) started it all. I hope this one finishes it  the John McClane franchise...<br/><br/>That's not to say that this story and film are all bad. <br/><br/>Look, I like Bruce Willis as an actor; he's done some fine work  e.g. In Country (1989), Pulp Fiction (1994) and, yes, Die Hard, already mentioned, and many others.<br/><br/>But, with each successive chapter in the McClane saga, the stories just get worse. This last one (I hope) is saved from going down the toilet completely because, for me, it was more a comedy than anything else. Honestly, I nearly fell off my chair laughing at the great one-liners in the script and the absurdly comical and out-of-this-universe action sequences that defy physics and the imagination. For pure action fans, it's manna from heaven, no doubt; for serious cinema-goers, who want a modicum of reality to the story, it's utter tripe.<br/><br/>But, as a story, it's entertaining to a point.<br/><br/>What's more interesting and entertaining is the subtext of this story: the real probability that, one day, some very smart extremists may in fact succeed in wreaking havoc throughout fundamental services that keep the engines of American political economy working. Now, that is a very scary prospect that could happen.<br/><br/>Hence, the need to reduce the whole scenario to comic book proportions so that the mass market can be suitably indoctrinated  and have a bit of fun also. I'd venture to say that the entire Bush administration is gung-ho about the whole production, as are DHS and TSA nationally.<br/><br/>Bruce, once again, is the (almost) indestructible tough guy who's caught up in the (home grown) terrorist plot to have a ""fire sale"" across USA: everything must go, man, everything. And that means all the money too, as the bad guy boss, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) overacts shamelessly as he begins to shut down all the vital services in the nation. Why? Well, he wants the money because he feels slighted: yes, because the darn Pentagon brass didn't listen to him when he told them what was wrong with national defense and, well, by golly  he's just gonna show them all what can happen, all right?<br/><br/>Ably supported by yet another female terminator, Mai (Maggie Q), and an army (almost) of real tough guys  because they're Frenchies, okay, and therefore real baaaad  little Tommy spits the dummy and slugs when John turns up to spoil his party. Wouldn't you just know it?<br/><br/>Now, there are some truly spectacular stunts and I have nothing but admiration for those stunt people who put their (real) lives on the line to bring about breath-taking action. Watch, particularly, for a couple of those tough baaaad Frenchies and what they do; almost unbelievable.<br/><br/>And, of course, with such a fast-paced story, the editing is stunning, with so many shot-reverse-shot sequences, you just can't keep up. But, hey, it's a Bruce Willis action flick, so it has to be good --- er --- great, right? Pity the producer and director had to copy so many action sequences from other movies  like Jurassic Park 2 (1997), for example. When you see John trapped in a car hanging over an abyss (almost), you'll know what I mean. <br/><br/>However, having said all that, is there any action fan who will miss this one? I don't think so..."
"kurtdavies580","8","0","2","27 December 2007"," Unbelievable
","When I saw that this movie was a PG-13 in America I was immediately put off, as what did it for me in the previous Die Hards was the almost constant hard-hitting action. However, the film still keeps the violence, its just less graphic.<br/><br/>A 52 year old Bruce Willis is on top form in this epic, and the feel good factor that comes from watching the amazing stunts and special affects is truly terrific. When action isn't occurring, the deep and intriguing plot keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Supporting characters, including Mclanes daughter, also play brilliant roles, which are only topped by Willis' superb acting.<br/><br/>In comparison to the previous Die Hard films, I believe this film tops Die Hard 2 & 3, and for those who enjoy the special affects more than others this film is better than the first Die Hard. However the first film was original, had more adult content in and had a marginally better plot.

","this movie delivers awesome and stunning action sequences which are going to impress even the most veteran action movie viewers. that being said...some of the events are very unrealistic past the point of any credibility. also this is one of those movies where every things going to happen at just the right moment and its like whoa what are the odds...well gee now the plot can continue!!!...but despite being a kinda weak movie...the score is still high due to the sheer awesomeness of the action...I'm really serious here. also..great acting on Willis's part. all the supporting characters were pretty solid and i liked the sorta character twist on the military professionals, how it was sorta real life and not all like tons of technical jargon and straight faces."

","On the first meeting of the two main characters, McClain and Gabriel talking to one another over the radio, a clear mistake is made in regards to the characters of the film and franchise, as Gabriel is looking over McClains file and sees that he is divorced, is an NYPD officer of so many years, Gabriel asks McClain about his children Jack and Lucy. This is the mistake, according to the first film McClains son is not named Jack but in fact John Jnr. This is stated in the first film when Richard the reporter attends the McClains family home while they are trapped in the building, he asks John Jnr how he feels. This is a pretty obvious mistake which i'm surprised when unnoticed."

","The key to understanding and liking these Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" movies is to accept that nothing is to be taken seriously. You find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all, as the invincible John McClane almost single-handedly hunts down and disposes of the bad guys. How about using a car as a projectile to shoot down a helicopter?<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is back as John McClane, pressed into service as the security of our national systems are being hacked in ways they never have before. Behind it all is disgruntled Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel who had designed the data systems, post-9/11, and whose warnings were not taken seriously. So he is out for revenge in his own way, shutting down everything in what hackers call a ""fire sale"", as in ""everything must go."" Go into disarray, that is.<br/><br/>Justin Long is known hacker Matt Farrell who McClane attempts to take into the offices for questioning, but they never get there. It soon is clear that some one is out to dispose of Farrell, and it is Gabriel who knows Farrell is the only one who can salvage the nation from the hacking.<br/><br/>So most of the movie is a series of chases and improbable escapes by McClane and Farrell. Very entertaining.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The ""fire sale"" was not the goal, just a means to an end. Gabriel knew, from his design, such a massive hacking would trigger a secret data dump into one location, and Gabriel was out for that data. With it he could copy it, then destroy it to cripple the nation, while using the copied data himself for untold wealth. The situation at the end was complicated because Gabriel had McClane's daughter as an unwilling hostage, but in the end she proved to be as tough to kill as was her father. Gabriel and all his men were killed, and after the movie ended we presume systems will be restored."

","It wouldn't be stretching it to say that the first DIE HARD installment has been hailed far and wide as one of the best action-thriller films ever made, having garnered a following of rabid fans worldwide and rightfully so. Few heroes have ever been as resourceful and resilient, yet reluctant and vulnerable as John McClane and Bruce Willis has worked overtime to develop the character beautifully over the span of twenty-something years. <br/><br/>Sadly, I can't say the same for the series itself. DH2 was still pretty good, but DH3 (DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE) left me feeling curiously unmoved, in spite of the potentially promising teaming of Willis with Samuel L. ""Action"" Jackson, and the sneer-rich reliability of Jeremy Irons as the necessary ""big baddie"".<br/><br/>So how does LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD stack up to its predecessors? Well, I was so convinced that the fourth installment would be an absolute mess, that I didn't even bother with it until it hit DVD, so I could at least see the ""Unrated"" version as it was intended to be shown. I was not as turned off at the news about the casting, unlike other fans were: Tim Olyphant can do evil pretty convincingly, and I happen to be a fan of Justin Long's back from GALAXY QUEST and JEEPERS CREEPERS.<br/><br/>What didn't have me jumping for joy was the fact that Len (UNDERWORLD) Wiseman was directing. Though both films in that series looked and sounded impeccable, they also played like what I imagine XBOX 360 games must look like, and left me just as cold as DH3 did. I was not optimistic to say the least.<br/><br/>It sure is nice to get surprised! Wiseman takes a few pages from the John McTiernan playbook and keeps the action sequences taut and brutal, without resorting to rapid-fire MTV-type cutting, which is a welcome relief. As McClane, Bruce Willis at 50-plus seems to cut an even more impressive, world-weary and cynical figure, showing off his physical prowess in some unbelievable stunts that would wear out guys half his age. It's also nice to see him given a situation that's more of a challenge than ever before, as he is tasked with taking down a group of domestic cyberterrorists led by Olyphant, who are determined to bring down the entire electronic infrastructure of the United States."

","The DIE HARD franchise returns bigger and better. Bad-ass New York City detective John McClane(Bruce Willis)is back and delivers. Cyber terrorist put a ""fire sale"" in play; its intent to collapse the United States government into chaotic dysfunction. Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olyphant)is the mastermind behind this attack and instead of paying computer hackers who helped him, he is having them all assassinated. The killings have already begun when the FBI assigns McClane to collect and deliver hacker Matthew Farrell(Justin Long)to the FBI's Washington DC headquarter. The no nonsense McClane saves the young hacker's life and both become targets of the terrorists; for Farrell has the ability to block the computer mayhem. Gabriel's right hand man is actually his lover Mai Lin(Maggie Q). Systematically the government is shutting down and with McClane in defensive mode the body count continues to accumulate; so does damage to anything around him.<br/><br/>Willis brings with him his genuine humor and excitement. I really liked the scene of the massive traffic jam when the terrorists take control of the city's traffic lights. The scene of McClane knocking out a chopper with a police car is cool. Heart pounding action, well placed explosions and use of Creedence Clearwater's ""Fortunate Son"" sustain this outrageous ride. Also in the cast: Cliff Curtis, Kevin Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Jonathan Sadowski."

","Why is someone shutting down the power grid on the entire east coast and causing chaos? John McClane (Willis) is escorting Matt Farrell (Long) a known computer hacker to DC to help stop the madness. Will they be in time?<br/><br/>I have no idea how this movie was made. Was it all CGI or actual stunts that were the most impressive of any I have ever seen. I had to duck more than once to get out of the way of cars flying thru the air or bridges crashing down. Yes, this was all non-stop action, but wait a minute, there was time for actual conversations so I didn't feel like this was a computer game. No, this was as close to being real as I have ever seen. Most impressive. This just might be the action movie to judge all others by. I haven't seen Transformers yet, but I believe that is mostly CGI and yes, that is impressive as well from the promos I've seen.<br/><br/>Flaws? Well, yes, there were a couple but this is not to take anything away from the overall effort. Besides, these flaws occur in all action movies. For instance a man with a machine gun cannot hit another man about 10-feet away from him. You see this all the time. One more classic example. Instead of putting a bullet into the enemy to end it all for that moment, the hero gives the opponent more screen-time by trying to see who knows more Judo or Karate moves. See? Movies could be shortened considerably by a well-placed bullet at the right time, but..<br/><br/>Still, this is a very impressive movie. The acting, dialogue, cinematography were all outstanding, and the pace is perfect. But, make no mistake about this. This is an action-movie and is probably the best you will ever see.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Not really, not the hard stuff anyway."
"Alex_DeLarge_Is_Here","5","0","2","22 November 2007"," For an actioner is it is... for Die Hard....
","Alright, I'm going to start this review off with a confession. I was one of those people who worried that the PG-13 rating would hurt the series. The bottom line is that YES IT DOES.<br/><br/>I can say I'm one of the lucky ones who waited for DVD and watched the unrated version. I enjoyed it. It wasn't anywhere near Die Hard or the ingenious Die Hard with A Vengeance, but for the most part it was an entertaining movie where Justin Long and Bruce Willis worked well together. Despite what some people may say Justin Long is a likable actor and Bruce Willis always manages to bring dimension to John McClane. Even if Len Wisemen and crew think they're working on a new Underworld film where almost everone is indestructible.<br/><br/>As an actioner, I enjoyed it. It doesn't hold a match to ""Crank"" or the even better ""Shoot Em Up"", but it does manage to have it's moments.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Live Free or Die Hard"". It's not Die Hard, and by that I mean that this is what happens when the name Die Hard is placed before an overblown Hollywood actioner that suits more the name of Michael Bay then a successor of John McTiernan. Is Len Wiseman a capable director. The Underworld series had me wondering. However, I think ""Live Free or Die Hard"" shows he can direct. He just shouldn't direct ""Die Hard"" films.<br/><br/>Watch the first three and then pop in this one. You'll see what I mean. Die Hard had a gritty feel to it. That feel, the edginess, the unabashed coolness is lost here.<br/><br/>Timothy Olyphant cannot hold a flame to Hans Gruber, the original and still best, Die Hard villain. He throws henchmen out at McClane and McClane dispatches them all in fights and shoot outs that range from thrilling to over-the-top. Olyphant's ""Thomas Gabriel"" looks like a boy trying to do a mans' job. Here's a man trying to pull off a ""firewall"" (as Justing Long explains: A firewall is a fourstep shut down of ""the system"" or America by attacking it's infrastructure) and much like a guy throwing internet threats, we're not imposed by him. To make my point, even his girlfriend last longer then him against McClane. And to the people who think I'm being sexist, McClane beats her up, hits her with a car, runs that car through a wall and like Kate Beckinsale from Underworld, she just keeps fighting. Olyphant on the other hand... while Bruce Willis takes him out easier then James Bond takes out assassins.<br/><br/>On a base level, I liked this film. Compared to the first Die Hards, I was sorely disappointed. People who were fans of the original might be hard-pressed to like this. Fans of Len Wisemen's work will enjoy it. The younger generation and the teen crowd might get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>If you do by chance rent this, watch the unrated, not the PG-13 cut. The film released in theatres was a trimmed-down joke. And yes, they did cut out McClane's signature line.<br/><br/>Yippee-Kai-Ya-mother*bang* While it has it's problems: the unrated version redeems itself to a degree."

","What really frustrates me at times is, that some people seem to have a sort of upper-class relation to movies. Even though, it's something they are so interested in, but they always seem to have the right words to express ""the feelings of the director's dog, which is reflected in the pale clothing of the... blah blah blah"".<br/><br/>This is one of the movies, that has to be seen for what it is. And what is that exactly? That's John McClane kicking some ass. And he is very good at doing it.<br/><br/>The casting for the various characters are sublime, and especially Justin Long is doing a very good job. He reminds me a bit of ""Rat"" from 'the Core' combined with ""Justin"" from 'Dodgeball'. The writers also did a fine job, of keeping all the ""hacking expert-talk"" out of the movie, which give us the feeling of seeing it from John's side, and absolutely not understanding anything. Left with the feeling of just want to blow something up.<br/><br/>It is by far, in my opinion, the best of the four movies. I remember seeing the first one on TV some years ago now, and i fell in love with it. I am not a die hard /he he/ action-genre movie fan, but when I am. It is movies like 'Die Hard' I love to see.<br/><br/>And that it because, you have to see them for what they are. They are not big dramas, character-driven, historical correct movies. They are for people, who just wanna see some action.<br/><br/>That's why 'Die Hard 4.0' (Danish title) is so good. There are only two things that were a little over the line. And that was the scene on the jet. Where he falls from the truck and lands on the jet... And then the scene where Bruce is (it's nice to see John's feelings, but I liked the balance from #1, #2 much better) telling Matthew how it's not cool, to be 'the hero'.<br/><br/>That's a bit of a shame, because that's why I like these movies.

","Internet Terrorism. Sounds scary don't it? I mean what would we do without the internet? We'd be forced to actually talk to people and get social lives. Thank God for John McClane who is once again in the right place at the wrong time messing things up royally for super baddie Gabriel played by Hit-man to be Timothy Olyphant and his bit on the side Mai played by Maggie Q. It all starts well enough with a whole load of suits panicking over their computers powering down, apparently this is bad so therefore they have local cops go and collect well known hackers who could have done it.<br/><br/>Enter McClane, who just so happens to be building the oh so obvious you're a terrible dad, father/daughter relationship when he's called to collect young and bearded power-nerd Matt Farrell played by Justin Long. McClane is a technophobe you see which is a cause for all kinds of predictable hilarity along the way. Things get interesting though as it's revealed that the hackers that helped Gabriel are also being picked off by him one by one. McClane does his thing and eventually the corpses start to pile up. The film keeps a good pace, slowing down to tell the deep-as-a-paddling-pool story at the right moments without coming off as a sudden cut of pace for no reason. The main action pieces are all vehicular based making for some marvellous spectacles but it's all too over the top to be taken seriously, luckily enough though, it doesn't want to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Pretty much all the actors did a good job with the slight exception of Olyphant who just seemed like a generic bad guy saying all the right stuff at the right moment without doing much else, he did however get better towards the end. The charm of John McClane has always been the way he has fun whilst going about his business with wise cracks, trash talking and some memorable lines that keep the character alive and fresh for the new audience thanks to Bruce Willis who comes off so happy to be back with the character that made him famous all those years ago.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 (I still would have preferred Live Free or Die Hard to be honest) is a good addition to the franchise but it might lose it's edge on repeated viewings, however it's better than the second film which didn't have any emotion at all, just McClane in a forgettable situation doing what he does best. 4.0 is a big film with a great finale and memorable ""Yipee-Ki-yay Motherf*cker"" at the end combined with a very novel way of disposing of the Gabriel which suits McClane so much and makes him that much cooler. It has its faults and comes very close to being the self-parody we didn't really want but it's so much fun it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I must say i had low expectations for this film....in fact most of the time i go into movies i allow myself to forgo my need to be impressed and instead sit back and enjoy the ride. And if you're like me then no criticism of a film can really deter you. But i went into this movie with some sense of discontent right from the start. PG-13 die hard? Bruce Willis in his age these days? come on...the trailer alone was ridiculous enough to be laughed at. But i went into the movie and watched every minute of it, and by the end, i was thoroughly impressed. From the balls out plot, to the crazy fluid camera action, to the brutal (yet completely bloodless) fights, i was put into the die hard 4 world. <br/><br/>The first thing you'll probably think after seeing the movie is that its so detached from the original die hards and so much more outlandish in so many more ways that it comes off as more of a James bond from the 70's with Bruce Willis in the lead role rather than a bare knuckled simple action film like the first 3 of the series. And this is what it is. A film made to be outlandish, a film made to give the visuals, and a film made to see with friends to have a good time and cheer and snicker at all the right moments. <br/><br/>The movie in no way tried to be the resourceful ""how the hell do i get into this crap"" style of the first three, and instead opted for the big budget crazy action, and the salty sardonic dialogue of Bruce at his finest (and crustiest). This is its single merit that it dances with for the hour and 50 minute run time, and it succeeds gloriously, and impressively.<br/><br/>Its by no means a classic but its a damn good time, fun to watch, and worth its weight in butter drenched popcorn to say the least."

","Great action, good storyline, interesting side characters. Still, the feeling is that John McClane is a little old for all this. Don't get me wrong: Bruce looks still great and evidently takes care of himself to stay fit, but it didn't quite feel the same. Having said that, this is definitely one of the favorites in the saga, and it enjoys a particularly well structured screenplay with more plot points that an episode of ""24"". It was a good idea to team McClane up with Justin Long and Timothy Oliphant is a great villain, although he didn't look as bad as he wanted McClane to believe: Maggie Q was far worse, and it would have been great if she were kept in the story a little longer. Kind of a wasted character, really. I couldn't believe it when I saw Italian soap star Edoardo Costa in the role of one of the villains! Marco Beltrami's orchestral score is absolutely fantastic and so are the special effects."

","Why does EVERY sequel have to try and one up it's predecessors? Die Hard took place one night in one building. Die Hard 2, one night in an airport. Die Hard 3, a one day in an entire city. Now Die Hard 4, a day spread over a few states. What's next, an international Die Hard 5?<br/><br/>Bruce Willis has aged parallel with John McClane, older, balder and more bitter--a great performance. Justin Long does a good job playing opposite Willis, keeping up the humor and providing that much needed exposition, try to get the audience (and McClane) to believe that the cyber-terror plot is plausible. Maggie Q's ""smokin' hot"" presence alone is worth the price of admission. Even Timothy Olyphant can't ruin this ride, but his performance lacks that much needed sense of irony that the truly great bad guys must have--can one be truly menacing without that ""I know more than you"" smirk?<br/><br/>Anyway, the film has some great McClane moments, some really decent old school stunts/action, and a good amount of humor and suspense. The plot is utter nonsense, just like DH2 and DH3. But if you want plot you not going into a Die Hard film anyway.<br/><br/>P.S.: Having seen both the PG-13 theatrical U.S. cut and the ""unrated"" cut, watch the ""unrated"" cut when it arrives on DVD. Both versions are essential the same film, but Die Hard isn't really Die Hard without the uncensored profanity and violence. Also, I think the few added F-word laced one-liners are pure gems."

An organisation of Internet-based terrorist led by Thomas Gabriel. They are taking control of everything in America from their computers and slowly taking over the country. Accompanied by Matthew Farrell, one of the hackers who accidentally assisted the villains in setting up the system, McClane must both find Gabriel and help prevent him from taking over America completely. Gabriel knows McClane's on his way, and will make it as personal as possible, which means involving McClane's daughter, Lucy.<br/><br/>12 Years since 'Die Hard:With a Vengeance' was released is a long time, and times have changed in the movie business. So can John McClane still survive in the 21st century. Well, yes he can and he's as good as he has ever been. It's Die Hard in a new age. Technology has grown hugely since 1988, and what's so fun in the movie, is how John McClane has no knowledge of all the new technology. He is more like a real human hero. He gets hurt, is getting old and doesn't always know what to do. All the rest of the cast are great. Timothy Olphant plays a good villain, but can not beat the feel that Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons gave you. Justin Long was a great comedic parter to McClane and Maggie Q brought a caught who hasn't really been seen before in Die Hard. The action is amazing with some wonderful stunts, which show that you can still make a good action film these days.

","I watched the UK preview of Live Free or Die Hard/Die Hard 4.0 on 4 July to get ahead of the crowds and I really enjoyed its old-school, slam-bang action. Unlike any of the other long-in-tooth sequels this summer (Shrek/Spider-Man/Pirates), Die Hard 4's editing was good enough that I wasn't bored and the movie didn't drag in spite of its length. It's the best translation of 24's atmosphere to film since MI-III last year but with a lead character you can care about and root for - Willis manages to sympathise with his/the character's age and burnout and the need for the sidekick to be computer-literate for him to stand a chance. <br/><br/>It's a less claustrophobic and contained action film than the first two DH movies which, by definition, couldn't go anywhere but the one location. Also, the A-plot could happen, further linking in with 24 from the same firm. I liked how they injected a kind of embittered, older,even meaner Jack Bauer into John McClane's character, the whole chaos-causing plot reminded me of 24 before it snapped back into Die Hard with the set-piece action that basically ramps up from five minutes in and doesn't stop until the end. Unlike Die Hard with a Vengeance it's not a completely abrupt full stop that implies almost going bust on the budget. The two female characters aren't window dressing and the first of the two chase scenes involving differently matched vehicles is the best stunt work I've seen since Tomorrow Never Dies (but it will have been spoilt by any trailer).<br/><br/>12 years between the third and fourth movies have only resulted in quality. It's fast, funny with a good cameo, the snappy one-liners you expect which hit more often than they miss and I will see it again. It was the best action I'd watched in summer 2007 before The Bourne Ultimatum arrived in the UK five weeks later. Can't wait to buy this on DVD.<br/><br/>My Sole criticism? Critics may whine because it's unashamedly aimed at men in spite of those two strong female roles. After 12 years and three other films you know whether you like Die Hard or not, but if you preferred 24, then still give Live Free or Die Hard a try, whether it's the cinematic or rumoured unrated cut."

","Die Hard 4.0 has been the best summer movies of 2007. After 13 years waiting it definitely delivers. Non-stop action, thrills and jokes. The story is great and the characters have been well cast. Timothy Olyphant is fantastic as the villain, Thomas Gabriel, who is hell-bent on shutting down the entire US Computer Network. Although Bruce Willis is about 60 he's still brilliant as one of Hollywood's greatest movie heroes.<br/><br/>The movie is superb but the only problem is the editing. It's all over the place. Luckily its only the talking scenes that are badly edited.<br/><br/>Apart from that technical hitch, Die Hard 4.0 is a brilliant movie. Check it out! Thanks for reading."

","When I first walked into the theatre I was a bit sceptical but being a big fan of the original I felt it was my duty to at least give it a go. One reason for me being sceptical was the fact that it has been 11 years since Die hard with a vengeance. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The plot was decent but it was the stunts that got me hooked into the film.Some of the stunts were just so fabulous, especially the one in the tunnel where the car goes up in the air and explodes the helicopter.<br/><br/>This is the only Hollywood film I have seen in the cinema this year that has delivered. I thought Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer was OK, Spiderman 3 was a slight disappointment and Transformer was trash. After a very long time have I got so involved in a movie. Was it worth the wait? Hell yes!!!."
"dotmrt","4","0","1","21 October 2007"," A silly movie
","The movie started off quite awesome and I was already beginning to get the McClane-vibe. For example the scenes like Farrel/McClane after driving into one of the assassins who hangs on a fence and then they catapult the guy to a wall with comments like ""Did you see that?""/""Saw it? I did it."" Nice. Also we get the feeling that the bad guys are quite a handful and not your standard-action-movie-cannon-fodder. Then comes the US-president mixup, which I thought to be quite clever and fun. But it all collapses for me with a ridiculous scene in the tunnel. The lights go out and no car has headlights on? WTF? Isn't it required by the law in US, it is in EU. And begins the silliness - I could believe the fire hydrant stunt (even if the water pressure is never that high in real and guys in helicopters are clipped to it to avoid falling off), but the flying car in the tunnel and the police car+helicopter is ridiculous. It really annoys me when a movie starts out serious and then turns out to be a bs-silly. Talking about characters, then McClane is no more the hard-breathing hot-blooded John from the first movies. He's a bald old tough guy called Bruce Willis who doesn't remember how to be John McClane. I wouldn't buy ""he's just old"". But from another aspect in the Die Hard series - I have always loved the ""I'm just a human"" feel. That feel is somewhat compromised with the ""fire at the good guys, but they cannot be hit"" cliché.<br/><br/>Couple of quick notes to summarize my attitude: Is the Nokia 9300 really capable of satellite communication? What kind of a hacker (especially uber-1337) leaves his webcam open to wide world and lets others to control it? Furthermore, what kind of a hacker leaves his webcam on when he is not using it? And furthermore, what kind of a hacker actually uses a webcam? And what kind of an hacker lets to actually trace himself? Tech-bs continues with hi-tek computers with unknown operating systems with 3d windows and alerts like ""connection breached"", contrary to usual ""unknown error has occurred"" etc. It's just stupid to wear 9-inch heels on a military operation. Was the parkour/free running-villain idea straight from watching Casino Royale?<br/><br/>All in all - I loved the dialog (or in cases it's absence), the fast pace, not at all Die Hard like political/anti-government 21st century plot. Because it deals with some real issues, perhaps it even points out to some guys in the gov, what might happen. I didn't like the stupid action scenes where Wiseman goes bananas (in addition to above mentioned, the F-35 on the highway circus), the hacker silliness, Bruce Willis being all calm not-McClane, not at all Die Hard like political/anti-government 21st century plot. The latter is here also because so much is left unanswered (like who are the bad guys/hackers/french assassins and such - we have been introduced only to Gabriel. McClane's 1-800-henchmen?) and there is nothing surprising to the flow of the story. <br/><br/>So it isn't all bad, but I'm glad I won the tickets to cinema. I'm not sure if I would have wanted to waste my own money on something as silly as the 4.0."
"RResende","Null","0","1","7 October 2007"," New action, old memories
","There are interesting elements here.<br/><br/>. This film is inserted in a recent tendency for action movies, which i believe started with the first Bourne (but i may be mistaken, i'm always checking for the origins and many times i find routs in older projects i didn't know). That tendency (influence) has much to do with style, and it features usually a kind of blue toned photography, i an apparently hard way to perform action/fight scenes. It has also to do with camera work, which is most of the time hand held and chooses not to make the whole action completely clear to us, as if we were intervenients, and makes us look elsewhere even when the action is not there. This ""style"" has been used (with more or less similar elements) in recent features such as the Bourne series, Syriana, even Casino Royale and this fourth Die Hard. <br/><br/>. The funny thing here is: The original Die Hard was very original in the way the audience related to the hero (Willis is responsible for this) but also in the way he performed his (apparently) uncoreographed action scenes (though this kind of fight probably started with Harrison Ford's Indiana). So here in this one, after so many years of degeneration of action fights (badly) interpreting oriental moves, we have Willis fighting in his ""clumsy"" way the girl very ""kung fu"" oriented. This is a turn of the page. Interesting<br/><br/>. The theme was well chose in this logic of producing a new film starring an old hero. This computer dependent world is what changed in practical terms in the last 20 years. So, beyond the basic idea of the ""old hero in a new world"" we have another interesting device which is how the ""bad guy"" fights the good one, no physical action. Did anyone found strange that our PC physically developed geek didn't die after a hard core body fight with our McClane? This is just curious but it becomes interesting when from here we get to understand that our mind changed in the way we expect the action to develop. Oh and this paranoid about terrorist global incursions is not new, but gained new forms after September 11th, obviously, in real life and film (film not also follows life, but also helps creating the paranoid, power institutions use these mechanisms, especially among Americans, so that sequence with American presidents talking and being edited is ironic in the sense that even though we think they are being manipulated, it is in fact us, the audience, specially the American audience, who is being manipulated).<br/><br/>. Anyway, the film is not without flaws, and i really miss the internal dialog that the ""old"" McClane used to establish with the audience. This old man who calls himself MacClane is almost a cartoon of the other one. We get the flavour (that's the basic demand for most of the die hard ""fans"", but it's very far from the type of device that established new patterns for action actors, so fully appreciated by action flicks since then (Cage repeatedly copied this, watch the ""comedy"" Con Air).<br/><br/>My evaluation: 3/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"rdoetjes","7","0","1","12 September 2007"," Nice action but nothing new
","It has been 10 years or so since Die Hard 3, which personally I still think it's the best.<br/><br/>Die Hard 4.0 was a thrill-ride of action scenes and some superb special effects, the one scene in the tunnel comes to mind when Bruce launches a car over the crash barrier into an awaiting helicopter.<br/><br/>But the story was a bit too far fetched, okay cyber crime is generally the biggest threat to western society although Mr. Bush still thinks that this would be men wearing turbans and beards hiding sticks of dynamite attached to their bodies under their jumpers. <br/><br/>But the cyber-terrorism as dangerous as it is, was a bit too over the top in true American fashion; as an IT consultant and security engineer I trip over these sci-fi scenarios the real thing is just as scary and could've been a great ingredient for the movie as well.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with this movie is the fact that it ends in an anti-climax. In all the Die Hard movies the baddie dies in the most horrible gruesome way and here he's simply shot dead. At least the infamous online ""Yippy-ka-yee...."" is still in there.<br/><br/>So in short: An amusing movie but not the best Die Hard and I guess now it's enough and I'd like to see Bruce act in an emotional role such as 6th Sense or Unbreakable again."
"inkblot11","7","0","1","4 September 2007"," Forget Spidey and the Giant Bat, if the world is crumbling, let's call John McClane
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) has been attempting a somewhat lower profile as a detective for the New York City police department. His wife has left him and his beautiful daughter, who attends Rutgers, won't even use his last name, preferring Genero. Yet, one day, the Feds ask him to escort a skilled, young computer hacker named Matt (Justin Long) to DC for questioning. McClane bellyaches at this trivial assignment but soon learns that the Feds got it right. As he is ushering Matt out of his apartment in Camden, NJ, all hell breaks loose. A lethal gang of conspirators use some mighty fire power to try and eliminate the duo. But, they don't know McClane, that's for certain. When the world is going down the commode, he's our man. He gets Matt to DC but its not a ""drop off and leave assignment"". Even the Feds don't know what to do when this gang takes over cyberspace in an effort get to their hands on the country's money supply...and more. But, they didn't count on facing McClane. This is a nice bookend to the Die Hard series, for Willis can hardly play this character from a wheelchair, right? From running a car into a helicopter to besting a karate-chopping female terrorist (Maggie Q) McClane is one of the most physical superheroes ever put up on the screen. As such, Willis is great, as he knows how to throw a punch and a punchline at the same time, with ease. The rest of the cast is superlative, too, with Timothy Olyphant just wonderful as the main heavy, and Maggie Q, Kevin Smith, and Justin Long very entertaining. In fact, Long could be the second coming of Keanu Reeves, as his pretty boy looks and throw-away humor are very similar. Naturally, the special effects are top of the line, while the costumes and settings are worthy, too. If you loved the first three films, your wait is over. McClane is back in town and you should see him ASAP. But, even if you just want to sit back and smile while a true American hero kicks behinds at every turn, here is the flick for you."
"Antagonisten","7","0","1","3 September 2007"," Better than i thought
","I had heard a lot of bad things about this installment in the Die Hard-series. That the good old catch-phrase was even deprived of it's ""f-word"". While that did sound lame, i decided to give it a fair try. And it was a lot better than what i expected.<br/><br/>It's not an easy thing following up on the legacy of the first Die Hard-movie. It's one of my absolute favorites in the genre and a classic action movie if ever there was one. It was action-filled, mean and filled with loads of the dirty action scenes that i came to love. Also John McClane was the ultimate action hero. Bruce Willis wasn't filled with steroids like most of the action stars of the time, but he made up for it with loads of attitude and mean spirit. Die Hard 2 and 3 were not as bad as one might have feared, but something was obviously lacking. This fourth movie is also lacking seen from the perspective of the first movie, but it's still a good action movie that doesn't suffer as much from it's rating as i feared.<br/><br/>The positive points here is that the pace is quite high through the whole movie. The action scenes are generally very well done and look expensive. Also they don't look too ""plastic"" like they tend to do in some movies that rely too heavily on obvious CGI. Also the Die Hard-feeling is quite well preserved, with the fact that McClane is not really your typical omnipotent hero, rather someone who gets the job done even if it's not pretty or sometimes even intentional.<br/><br/>I felt the movie had two major cons. First of all, I don't dislike Timothy Olyphant, but i feel he was seriously miscast here. He doesn't have the charisma nor the looks to make a good villain. Die Hard has come to depend on charismatic villains. That is what raised both the first and the third movie above the crowd. The lack of a charismatic villain in the second movie was very obvious, and it's very obvious here too. He's just not evil enough. The second con is the rating problem. It becomes a problem especially because the previous movies were ""all-out"" when it came to violence and profanity. I'm not the kind of person who demands gore and blood in movies, but when it becomes very obvious such things are cut out, it does ruin the experience somewhat.<br/><br/>There are a few other minor problems in this movie, like a few extremely unlikely scenes where all plausibility is left behind. I won't say what they are but one of them involves a helicopter and a car, and it's very far from any reality. All in all though, i found this to be a quite enjoyable movie. More so than i thought i would. It's not a classic, nor will it ever be, but it's a pretty good continuation of the Die Hard-franchise and also a pretty good action movie in it's own right. I feel that i can recommend it. 7/10."

","When Die Hard came out, we hadn't seem anything like it. One loud mouth cop against the bad guys (where bad guys are unstoppable international terrorists).<br/><br/>Oddly enough, every sequel since has carried the same theme. A bunch of foreign dudes with a lot of henchmen and a slew of artillery decide to rip off a bunch of money. And somehow, just somehow, we know that John McClain is going to stop them. We know he's going to get beat up a little bit. He will probably have a fist fight or two. Things will explode. You get the idea. Yet, the past two Die Hard films have left me limp. When the credits rolled at Die Hard 2 I thought ""well there goes the franchise!"". When I was done with Die Hard 3 I thought, ""great, we turned John McClain into a buddy-cop series"".<br/><br/>But Die Hard 4 was special. The director seemed to encapsulate what we liked about the first film. John is just a cop who seems to get himself into a nasty situation. He bleeds, he hurts, he nearly passes out. But it's John against the bad guys, and he's gotta do what he's gotta do. And we are with him on this adventure.<br/><br/>Expect to see a lot of ""digital John"". Obviously Bruno can't take a spill like he used to. Expect some cheesy one-liners when bad guys get what they had coming. Expect John to have absolutely no remorse. Expect to stand up and cheer, because John McClain is back.<br/><br/>There were some inconsistencies with this film. Some plot flaws. Even a bad cameo (sorry Kevin Smith). And heck, some plain out cheesy expected results. Yet it still stands out as the best action movie I have seen in the past couple of years, so you allow it. I give it a full 9 and 1/4 out of ten stars. Welcome back John. We actually look forward to Die Hard 5."
"clivey6","7","0","1","21 August 2007"," Ageing Bruce gets a blue rinse
","This latest Die Hard instalment is shot through with a blue filter, perhaps to hide the formulaic nature of it.<br/><br/>I'm being unfair, I mostly found this a gripping action flick. I enjoyed the banter between Bruce and the young actor, but I miss Bruce being a lone guy up against it. This is more a buddy thriller. Then again, even in the first film he had the black cop on the walkie talkie outside.<br/><br/>Credibility went out the window as soon as Bruce chose to jump out of a speeding car onto concrete to fling it into a helicopter. Reality would see his brains smashed across the road. It's similar to a scene in Casino Royale when Craig flings himself off a baggage handler onto a runway. I know these guys are bulked up but still...<br/><br/>Sadly the intrigue of the movie fell away. The villain's McGuffin (plot premise) I couldn't quite fathom. He aimed to show the weakness of the US systems, but how much money was he trying to nick? Any at all, or was that a bluff? At times I almost sympathised with him. He wasn't out to blow up Congress, that was just a 'what if' scenario. And when he doesn't off McClane's daughter immediately, we can see this is a fun/silly action film.<br/><br/>Much in the manner, in fact, of True Lies. Except, we can't have the fundamentalists as villains in a film like this, after all, they did take out the Twin Towers and are consequently no fun any more. Wait for Michael Mann's new film if you want a take on that.<br/><br/>Fun stuff, but I'd mostly forgotten it by the time I was home. It's no Jason Bourne."

","This movie was much more entertaining and enjoyable than I was expecting. For any fans of the previous three movies it's required viewing: for anyone else who just fancies a couple of hours of escapist action fare, this is well worth the price of the cinema entry.<br/><br/>To my mind, action movies need two key ingredients to work - firstly, and clearly, great action scenes, but also humour. Die Hard 4 (or whatever its ridiculous official title is) has both of these elements.<br/><br/>McClane's sidekick Matt Farrell (played by Justin Long) provides nearly all of the comic relief. He is given some good lines but delivers them with panache. And as my wife said, he was well cast as the computer geek in that he looked skinny and nerdy enough to play the part, but also had some sex appeal in a young Keanu Reeves or Matthew Broderick kind of way.<br/><br/>The plot is verging on the ridiculous, although the writers neatly manage to conjure up a villain, Thomas Gabriel, played reasonably one-dimensionally by Timothy Olyphant, with no real religious or ideological motivation. His henchmen/bodyguards are of the indentikit European variety, although it is not clear why this is so. (The exception was the under-used Maggie Q character, Mai Lihn.) Computer expert and former government employee Gabriel is trying to shut down the whole of the USA in three stages (a ""fire-sale""), while McClane tries to protect Farrell, the only hacker/computer expert who remains alive with the expertise to help stop Gabriel in his tracks. The chemistry between Willis and Long works well and is the source of almost all the good comic moments in the film.<br/><br/>But the implausibility doesn't really matter - the action is fast-paced and insanely OTT at times, and Willis reprises the McClane role with his customary panache. Any criticism that the plot is barely believable misses the point about a decent action movie - it's about the stunts, the CGI, the humour and the violence."

","The first Die Hard movie was (and still is) a classic. Die Hard 2 was just downright humiliating. The third one was slightly better but still slightly ludicrous (Jeremy Irons with that idiotic fake ""German"" accent). So you could say that I had pretty much written off the Die Hard franchise as a ""one-hit wonder"". But Brucie Baby has proved that, just like a good bottle of whisky, it really does get better with age. He may be older (and balder) but he sure still remembers how to kick ass.<br/><br/>The plot is basically the same - old-fashioned bank robbers out to score the heist of a lifetime, but who try to make themselves look more glamorous by pretending to back a cause - this time though they have updated the franchise to reflect the growing intrusion of computers in every-day life, and who better to tackle this new technological age than old-school Detective McClane? <br/><br/>McClane is ordered to bring in a computer hacker for interrogation by the FBI. Little does anyone know that this hacker has already been targeted for assassination by some people he did some illegal work for (the same matter the FBI want to talk to him about). When Brucie turns up to arrest the hacker, the assassins start shooting and from there on in, it's one big blood-fest as Brucie tries to keep the hacker alive while at the same time, bring the baddies down.<br/><br/>As usual with these types of movies, the plot's credibility does get stretched to breaking point (going head to head with a US Air Force fighter jet?). But if you're prepared to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours, you'll find this movie very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Oh and after seeing the hacker in his lair, I've decided that this is no longer my computer room - it's my ""command center"". When you've watched the movie, you'll understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Look out for Tim Russ (who plays Tuvok in Star Trek Voyager). Instead of a humourless Vulcan, he here plays a humourless Federal agent."

","This afterthought, coming a full 12 years after the third Die Hard movie and 19 years after the original, was destined to be not as good as its predecessors. I mean, after the first one, the people responsible for the sequels were obsessed with packing them more and more full of action. In the new one, the strategy of its filmmakers is to make a movie about 100 times as action-packed as the original. With this much augmentation, the action sequences cross the line from gripping to just plain ridiculous. In this one, guys shooting automatic weapons at John MacLane are just a joke. Easy stuff, really. The only challenge there is to keep the computer hacker (Justin Long) he's protecting alive, and even that's not much of a challenge. It only gets decently difficult when a jet fighter is chasing him, firing missiles and super-duper machine guns at him while he drives along crumbling elevated highways in a lumbering semi. Yeah, it's silly. But that doesn't make it bad. It's at least amusingly silly. Bruce Willis hasn't lost any of the charisma he brought into the first three movies. Justin Long is the comic relief, and at first I thought he would be really annoying. But he's fairly funny most of the time. I absolutely loved the main henchman and lover of the villain, played by icy half-Asian Maggie Q, last seen in Mission: Impossible III. There's also an amusing cameo by Kevin Smith. I'm not sure what to think about the villain, played by Timothy Olyphant. At first, he bugged me, but as the film went on, I started to like his demeanor and shiny white teeth. I think he was suitably creepy. However, I think they missed a golden opportunity to make a better movie: since Justin Long is probably best known as the hip kid playing the Mac guy in a series of entertaining television commercials, they really should have cast the PC guy as the villain. Sure, it would have been ultra-jokey, but the film is already so silly, I think it would have been especially awesome."

This time he's got a teenage daughter in tow who's rebelling against him and he's just learned of a successful hack-in to a top government agency's central computer. But the authorities are convinced they've caught the culprit, young cyber-nerd Justin (Matt Ferrell.) So McClaine's sent round to apprehend him- only to be nearly annihilated in a barrage of bullets along with his charge. And so begins a relentless and deadly chase around New York city, with chases, bullets and mayhem in tow- and as they move along, they start to learn of a much deadlier conspiracy than any of them ever imagined.<br/><br/>Resembling, as others have noted, with his bald head and notable paunch, Homer Simpson more than your average action hero, Willis returns in the latest entry into the Die Hard franchise since 1995's less than scintillating entry Die Hard: With a Vengeance. With a topical plot line involving terrorism and technology controlling us, the fourth instalment copies it's most recent predecessor by throwing us headlong straight into the action rather than establishing too much of a story first.<br/><br/>It will probably come as no surprise to most to learn that the plot is just an excuse to make one big gun battle happen after another, the script isn't much better, the characters (especially the villains!) are as cardboard as a display stand and the less said about the dialogue, the better. Unfortunately, to start with, aside from a few tasty scenes, there isn't a lot of exciting action either, causing you to start to write it off as a failure early on in (not a good sign!) But if you stick around long enough, trust me you won't be disappointed, as the ending builds up to some truly spectacular action scenes, one involving a bridge, that will make you glad you gave your time and money.<br/><br/>By the end, you're satisfied with the brilliant action and the tense thrill ride that got you there. And, while everything that may have made it an Oscar contender leaves a lot to be desired, if you're happy with the action, you can come away and say you saw a pretty damn fine Die Hard film. ****"

The storyline was something to be questioned, and was very far-fetched in terms of depth and linguistic jargon that was used throughout. This was however, completely cast aside, by some of the best action sequences I have seen in such a long time. At last, stunts and explosions that used limited CGI to great effect.<br/><br/>Right from the word go, its typical Die Hard. McClane gets caught up in crossfire from an Internet terrorist group exterminating hackers, whilst trying to escort a ""top"" hacker to the FBI for questioning. Its literally from the first 10 minutes, that you get your first shell-shocking apartment blast up. Quality stuff.<br/><br/>Like all the Die Hard movies, the villains are cool (and pretty bad!) and the action is slick, gritty, tense and brilliantly executed. I have to say though, Thomas Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant) was pretty poor in comparison to some of the other bad guys, but gave a decent (but in some cases, damn cheesy) performance. Justin Long played the nerdy hacker to perfection, with one or two minor blips in performance, but he was passable and gave the film a funny edge with his quirky one liners and gags.<br/><br/>One thing I will say though, Willis wasn't ""classic"" McClane, he wasn't as blasphemic as usual. But he made up for it in the action sequences. You did get the Yippy-Kay-Ay, but not right until the end. For a 15 certificate, you actually didn't get a lot of bad language or violence for your buck. This didn't matter though, because this films pace kept you focused and ready for the next action packed sequence.<br/><br/>At times you felt as though it would let you down, but then it would throw down a gauntlet right in front of you.<br/><br/>I honestly recommend though, you go in with an open-mind and enjoy it. Its an action flick. But a damn good one!"
"poem","4","0","1","15 July 2007"," Good Action, but lacks a bit in respect to the basics
","The fourth ""Die Hard"" movie is certainly OK as a pure action movie. Tons of explosions, cool stuns, etc. And its quite funny, too. And they have Kevin Smith !<br/><br/>The problem I had with it was that I couldn't sympathize with the people in the movie enough, as they totally lacked any deeper characterization. They have no mentionable motives, no habits, and no faults. Besides being sometimes hungry, being interested in girls if they are boy and vice versa, and being angry if you hurt people they love, etc.<br/><br/>In movie one there was a policeman from new york where coming to ""fucking California"", made fists with his toes, etc. There where a lot of details that describe the people and make them complete and real. The evil guys also had a lot of characterization, and there where a lot of psychological battles going on between them and the cop.<br/><br/>In movie four all these basics are missing. As a result, one never really has any relation to the people on the screen, dialogs are shallow, and many scenes simply don't work.<br/><br/>A final word of criticism: when will Hollywood ever make a movie about computers thats even only decently realistic ? Most people have computers now at home but Hollywood movies continue to be absurd whenever computers are mentioned.<br/><br/>All in all, its a nice mainstream movie, but its certainly not another classic."
"Panterken","7","0","1","15 July 2007"," Amazing Action movie that Lacks the Trademark Die Hard Charm...
","Die Hard 4.0 (USA title: Live Free Or Die Hard) is the eagerly awaited fourth in the phenomenal Die Hard series. For the people who are not familiar with the other Die Hard films...stop reading this comment now ( yes I mean NOW !!) and go rent the other ones. ROFL.<br/><br/>The Die Hard films are a brilliant mix of original action-scenes and witty humor. They are widely appreciated by action film and non-action film lovers both( I'm the latter). Now...could the fourth in the series top the other films or at least equal it...?? I'm afraid the answer is...NO, although it was a lot better then I expected. It's definitely one of the best films of the year. Let there be no mistake about this: I am a huge Die Hard 4.0 fan. There are tons of fantastic action scenes. They're completely over-the-top at all times but If you know the other three films you know that's what Die Hard is all about. We get to see astonishing scenes with helicopters, planes and trucks. Yes, they really spared no costs or efforts to make the action scenes work. All of this can't make up for the fact that Die Hard 4.0 lacks the charm and wittiness of the other ones. Most of the humor used was a bit cheesy...whatever happened to 'This is what a TV-dinner must feel like...'? or the hilarious Mclane ramblings? Add this flaw to the flawed script and you'll see why Die Hard 4.0 at no time lives up to the other ones.<br/><br/>There's also been a lot of criticism on the casting, I however liked the cast very much: The relatively unknown Justin Long get's a huge part. I only know him from Jeepers Creepers and didn't like him that much in that film...but I have to admit he did a good job in DH 4.0. Also the casting of Olyphant brought up a lot of contradictory reactions but I think he was great. He's no Jeremy Irons but he pulls it off.<br/><br/>My conclusion: Die Hard 4.0 is cursed by the Die Hard name: the other films are hard or impossible to top...but Die Hard 4.0 still makes a fantastic summer action film and will be one of the best films of '07."
"mdinfo1","9","0","1","14 July 2007"," Pleasantly surprised
","I would give this a 10 but I'd like to see it a few more times to see how it holds up. First off, I wasn't expecting much from Die Hard 4. I thought Bruce Willis was too old and too bald to play an action hero. I didn't think Len Wiseman (whose only done ""Underworld"" movies) could direct something this huge. I was afraid it would be a ""Rocky Balboa"" type nostalgic trip. A swan song to a great film series. <br/><br/>I was wrong. This is my favorite Die Hard in the bunch. Even better than ""Vengeance."" This is the action film they don't make anymore. Non stop thrills and over the top entertainment. Its not supposed to be believable. It's just supposed to be fun. Those blockbuster action films in the 90's weren't about plot or realism. It was about escaping the real world and seeing things you'll never see in real life. <br/><br/>That's why movies like this and ""Transformers"" succeed. They don't take themselves too seriously. But they also give the audience characters they can care about. Instead of just nonsensical violence that looks cool but has no soul. <br/><br/>Len Wiseman and his editors do an incredible job with the pacing of Die Hard. There's so much camera movement, multi-angle coverage and POV shots it's mind blowing. They say the key to good directing is moving the camera around a lot and Wiseman really takes that to heart. The film looks like a video game. In a good way. <br/><br/>(Possible spoilers ahead) The supporting cast is top notch. Without stealing the show from Bruce Willis. Justin Long is great. Always liked himn in ""Dodgeball"" and he shows he can play it serious too. TImothy Olyphant is a great villain. He truly is an evil sociopath. No internal conflict or moments of doubt about his twisted scheme. His interactions with McClain's daughter are like a black comedy. Doing double takes about how strong she is. <br/><br/>Maggie Q is fantastically over the top as Mai Linh. A marvel to watch. Only problem is they turned her into a type of Terminatrix. During her battle with McClane I started to wonder if she could actually be killed. Willis' reaction to her footwork is priceless. You can tell he's baffled by how quick she is. <br/><br/>Kevin Smith is the weakest link IMO. He's just not an actor. And he's typecast as Silent Bob. His appearance was sort of an inside joke. I didn't know that was Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter Lucy. I'd heard she was just another Maxim hottie. She was a really good actress. Not just eye candy like Megan Fox in Transformers. <br/><br/>I hate to say it I was sort of hoping Ms. Wisemen (aka Kate Beckinsale) would be in the movie! Maybe make a cameo as one of government agents. Of course if Len did that the critics would say (he can't make a movie without his wife). She could use the career boost after those 2 bombs she made with Adam Sandler and Luke Wilson. And she's proved her mettle in action movies. <br/><br/>In the end, you definitely get the feeling Bruce Willis knows what he's doing with this whole Die Hard franchise. He waited for the right time, script and director. And he was right. Can't wait for Die Hard 5."
"socrates99","8","0","1","14 July 2007"," Bruce Willis is one irreplaceable guy
","Sometimes when I wonder who's really having the most fun, I think of people like Antonio Banderas or Clint Eastwood or maybe Gary Oldman. Why I seldom think of Bruce Willis is hard to explain, but I'm beginning to think he's got an edge on them all. I remember admiring the guy's easy way back in his Moonlighting days. Somehow he made a seamless transition to serious action from light-hearted adventure-comedy, and, at this rather more advanced age, shows no real signs of slowing down, despite the references to his aching body in this film. Like Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman, I can't imagine anyone wishing this guy ill, male or female, rich or poor, American or Al Qaida. He's almost impossible to dislike. When I consider that he was also in one of my favorite films of all time, The Fifth Element, I kinda wonder if the Die Hard films aren't just an elaborate way of glorifying this unusual actor."
"Pavel-8","7","0","1","14 July 2007"," Best action movie of the year.
","If you're worn out by the relentless parade of movie heroes sporting tights or transforming into robots, good news currently awaits you at the theater: ""Live Free or Die Hard"", a physical, action-packed antidote to comic book movies, which is the fourth chapter in the cinematic adventures of Detective John McClane. Having already survived Germans at Nakatomi Plaza, revolutionaries at Dulles Airport, and more Germans in New York City, McClane (Bruce Willis) is once again in the wrong place at the right time, as his simple task morphs into yet another odds-defying assignment.<br/><br/>Willis brings back his familiar character with a pitch-perfect blend of world-weariness and cocksure attitude. While he's saving the country, McClane has an innate ability to blend comedy with capability, willingly hurling unsavory nicknames and spewing determined anger rather than blandly yet skillfully executing his mission. Live Free separates itself from traditional action/adventure movies by organically working the humor into the fabric of the movie, rather than lazily relying on comic relief characters or contrived situations. Justin Long, perhaps most recognizable as the Mac guy in Apple's television ads, plays off Willis well as he is sucked into the chaotic events, with a defensive sarcasm and semi-rebellious side that effectively embody his role as a twenty-something computer hacker.<br/><br/>The comedy isn't the selling point of the ""Live Free"" though. The trailer promised huge effects, and the movie delivers in a BIG way. Over-sized vehicles ranging from semi trucks to fighter jets are involved in adrenaline-pumping confrontations, and of equal importance, they bob and weave in relatively sensible ways. As opposed to the incomprehensible massive chaos of ""Transformers"", there is an elegance to the action here. It's still over-the-top, but in an linear, choreographed manner that is easily followed and relished. Even though many of the stunts undoubtedly use CGI, the old-school physicality provides a sharp and enjoyable contrast to the digital attack the enemy is unleashing on the United States, as well as the cartoon-ish nature of many comic book movies.<br/><br/>""Live Free"" has its share of improbability, as characters survive dangerous falls and endure endless physical abuse, and the technology sometimes seems all too easy. But in a movie like this, such conveniences are accepted if not expected as part of the genre. This isn't a serious Oscar contender with grand themes or undertones; it's summertainment, a popcorn movie designed as a diverting escape. In that regard it succeeds wildly, inducing winces, yells, and cheers from the audience.<br/><br/>One interesting note is that this rendition of Die Hard is rated ""only"" PG-13, no doubt in an attempt to lure the lucrative teenage demographic. Some will be outraged by this apparent neutering of a franchise that was largely defined through the the R-rating earned by the pervasive vulgarities of the first three installments. Even the signature line (Yippee-ki-yay...) is obscured by sound effects. On one hand it's disappointing that Hollywood acquiesced to the almighty dollar. On the other hand the absence of a constant barrage of language is scarcely missed, as McClane's aggressive attitude is still intact, accompanied by plenty of derogatory terms that are not quite as profane. Maybe he mellowed with age.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The best action movie so far this year. A rock solid 7 of 10."

","I haven’t seen any of the Die Hard movies for the past decade so I don’t quite remember anything but what I remember is watching this movie Die Hard 4.0 and it was very entertaining and I had fun watching it.<br/><br/>Synopsis: As usual this movie will always involve terrorist. This time they are back for more as they planed to destroy and shutting down the whole security network of the USA.<br/><br/>Well like most people, I didn’t plan to see it at first, my reason to see was I was force by my cousin. At first I thought it was going to be like those movie created to make money. But I was wrong; this is pretty damn good action movie, perfect for what it is! Die Hard! Bruce Willis has still got it in him as the detective John McClane, he is still great but his age is taking its toll as time to time he is not as hip and arrogant as he used to be. Surprisingly the casting of Justin Long was more than anyone has bargain for, he was awesome, play along very well with John, plus he added more youthfulness into the movie and some comedic situation. Plus this movie have Maggie Q and Mary Winstead, they both hot! Timothy Olyphant did a pretty alright job as a bad guy.<br/><br/>As for story it was as any body expected, full of action!!! From the first minutes to the very last second, (though, not very realistic it was really fun to watch). I am happy with it; the only problem is the movie unlike the previous one they used some CGI to enhance the effect. And that CGI is horrible (talking about bridge scene), it does added more action but it didn’t quite work.<br/><br/>Overall it did deliver what it supposes to delivered, a great fun ride of thrill and action. It worth every penny and it was it will leave you wanting to see more of John McClane.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Must See In Theatre.<br/><br/>Reason To Watch: Action and more action, John McClane and Matt Farrell.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Action Scenes Is Too Unbelievable Sometime.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B).<br/><br/>Rate (Y/N) After Read."

","OK. I'm going to make this short and sweet, with absolutely no spoilers! I will NOT give out any spoilers. If you liked or loved the first 3 Die Hards (although I withhold opinion on the 3rd, it was pretty good. A little reverse racism, but that happens), you will LOVE Die Hard 4. It was everything a Die Hard movie is expected to be. 2 hours and 20 minutes go by quickly! Humor and drama. The character of John McClain does not disappoint. I do miss Al and Holly, but other than that, it exceeded my expectations of enjoyment.<br/><br/>I saw an interview with the director, and he says he was 15 when the first Die Hard movie came out (boy do I feel old!), and was a fan. He didn't want to direct action movies, but said even though he said that, he also said ""unless it was a Die Hard movie"". He got his wish. He also said that in some instances Bruce Willis would point something out and say that John wouldn't do that, this director would tell him that not only WOULD he do it, but he'd already done something similar in this movie when that happened. Bruce stood corrected and understood that this young man was a true Die Hard fan! I highly recommend this movie. Don't buy any concession drinks or drink a lot before going to see it. You don't want to have to take a break for any reason from it! It keeps you on the edge of your seat as always, and does not disappoint! <br/><br/>OK, so it wasn't so short!"

Not only that but being driven through a series of walls and obstacles would cause some damage! Even after all that. shes plummeted into a concrete wall of an elevator shaft and comes off without a scratch! Anyone else, in the world, would have died or at least been unable to move their lower limbs, as they have been crushed into a million pieces.<br/><br/>I got over this and saw is as ""drama"" and continued watching, i knew that the inevitable plane crash scene which is present in to many modern movies was approaching.<br/><br/>I watched this and kept an open mind, knowing that a lot of work has been put in to make these, particularly difficult scenes appear realistic. And yes, it does appear so, well, as far as a man being chased along the highway by a plane can.<br/><br/>But the climax of this scene, where he's standing on the back on a spinning aeroplane, as if he's having a leisurely surf was ridiculous! My heart stopped racing and dropped! Literally. from that moment on, the film held little promise.<br/><br/>The film, in my opinion regained some credits, and for the first time in about 8weeks, i feel as though i haven't wasted my money in the cinema, trying to find a decent film to watch.<br/><br/>Call it die hard, but when do the people die?

","Die Hard is probably one of the most known action movie and Bruce Willis most famous role. I have never seen a Bruce Willis role that can influence me into speaking most of his lines in Die Hard. Die Hard 1 was a classic. 2 was a good sequel. 3 was good but not as good as the first two. And when I heard 4 is out, I thought to myself. ""How is a man who is in his 50s going to make an action movie? It's probably going to be a bad sequel."". But I take it back. Die Hard 4 is the first runner up to Die Hard. It shows that there is still some ass-kicking in Bruce Willis. Rock on Bruce Willis! The story is simple. John McClane(Willis) is called to pick up a hacker, Matt Farell(Long). While John is talking to Matt, action starts. Then after that, a hacker(Olyphant) bring disasters to the city of D.C. And now John and Matt must stop this hacker. From here on, it is jam pack action.<br/><br/>I love the style of the movie. A cool and fast movie. Keeps you awake even thought you are sleepy. An action/comedy script which works pretty well. The warlord(Smith) scene is my favorite. This is a very good example of a good action movie.<br/><br/>One thing I hate is some parts are unrealistic. John McClane never seems to gets hurt. That is one thing I hate about action movies. Hero never gets hurt. And not forgetting that how damn good the villain is, he is a unless guy when facing John. Another thing action movies fail in. No matter how good the Villain is, he is unless when facing the hero. Beside all these, everything is OK.<br/><br/>This is the best movie to come out this month. It is a tough battle between Tranformer since they have such good rating. If it is possible you can watch both movie within a day and judge it by yourself. For me?

"jamesdisnow","4","0","1","12 July 2007"," Utterly fantastic
","Movies these days, most of the time, are complete rubbish, or they just don't even come close to expectations. The 40 Year Old Virgin for is a perfect example. The trailer made it look hilarious and fantastic, but in reality, the trailer showed every funny scene from the movie. The rest was, in a nutshell, was a cure for insomnia. I was about to give up on movies, but all of a sudden, everything seems to have turned around.<br/><br/>In the past couple of weeks, i've found out that the movie industry hasn't exactly gone to the crapper.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard, I thought before seeing it, would be, I dunno, alright. I've only really seen the first Die Hard, and when I say i've seen it, i've seen small bits and parts. It was decent, but it wasn't a movie I could exactly love.<br/><br/>But Live Free or Die Hard, the forth in the series (Over here, it's called Die Hard 4.0. 'DIE HARD TO THE MAXXX XTREEMEME' would have been better) was a breath of fresh air. First of all, the plot is bang up to date and very relevant in this day and age. The atmosphere is fantastic. It's dark and gloomy for the most part, which fits perfectly.<br/><br/>The action is just fantastic. It's over the top, but that's the whole point of the thing. The scene where John McClane drives his 'borrowed' Ford Explorer into the elevator shaft is a perfect example. In reality, he would have been killed, driving that fast. But when all the action is just that satisfyingly awesome, you don't care.<br/><br/>My only complaint from this movie was the sometimes forced dialog from Justin Long and the rest of the 1337 haxx0r dudes. But at least the dialog was written by someone who actually made it sound genuine. Some movies are pathetic in this respect.<br/><br/>But apart from that little fault, Live Free or Die Hard is a very satisfying, action packed movie. It just has a great feel to it - there's nothing else to it. I just love this movie.<br/><br/>If you're skeptical towards seeing it, don't be. Pay the admission price and have a hell of a time."

","It's been 12 years since the last Die Hard, and now he is back. What does it bring to the table. Over the top action, some nice one liners, Bruce, and a very good time. As pretty much everyone else I was extremely disappointed over the PG-13 and for a moment I had serious doubts about the film. The only reason I decided to watch it is because after all it's still a Die Hard and a solid entry to the series at that.<br/><br/>The story I think is really not that bad. Better than Die Harder but not as good as 1 and 3. This time around McClane is facing a digital attack on the USA. He's having personal problems with his family, and all he has to do is pick up a kid and drive him down to D.C. But it's just another one of those days and thing are about to get messy.<br/><br/>Len Wiseman I think did a very good job considering he had to go with a lower rating, but he did have a bigger budget and a solid story. He goes over the top quite a few times (the so talked about F-35 scene) but he kept the spirit of previous DH's and you can see he's got a lot of love for the series. Sometimes you can see this is still something newer and not really that 80's action anymore, but it is what it is, and he did a good job.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis again does what he does best. Killing, beating up, and screaming at people. He does it with such style you wanna join him. Anyone who missed seeing him on the big screen won't be disappointed, although the F-bombs aren't dropping.<br/><br/>To sum up it's a solid entry to DH, it's not as good as the first one, but it's one a pair with 2 and 3 with Vengeance being slightly better. If you're looking for a good time this is it. In t he summer of disappointing sequels, Live free or Die hard does what it was set to do and John McClane is back on a high note.<br/><br/>7.7 out of 10"

","I went and saw this film a couple of days ago (by myself, everybody else went and saw transformers). It was great. The action (and signature Die Hard humor) started in the very first scene and never relented. The film explored more deeply John McLane's desire to be a little less Rambo and a little more Cliff Huxtable. Justin Long delivered a hilarious performance as a pansy computer geek who must man up a bit to save McLanes daughter, McLane and, himself. The ending of this film is great and the film certainly has the re-watchability of the first three. Basically if you desire action, laughs, a plot that is strong enough to make the action not have to stand on its own and some hardcore Bruce Willis wit, than this is the movie for you.

","Live Free or Die Hard was without a doubt a great addition to the Die Hard series. Even though this is the only one of the series that did not obtain an R rating, it still delivers with intense action scenes, and the extremely humorous wit of the great John McClane. Justin Long does a great job as McClane's ally, as he assists him in trying to stop the bad guys. One of the most important things in any of the Die Hard movies is the reactions that McClane expresses during and after the action sequences, and Bruce Willis nails it, with the character that he has made so popular over the years. The movie pretty much put a new-age spin on the series, but still maintains the excitement and entertainment of the previous films."
"damian-129","7","0","2","11 July 2007"," A worthy sequel
","This third sequel of the Die Hard franchise was most effective. I was happy to see that there were some elements in it that gave it a true Die Hard feel. It wasn't a random action script with Bruce Willis playing the hero. This was an adventure worthy of John Mclane.<br/><br/>Like the other films the villains are well funded, well trained masters of their work who, in the end, just want tons of cash. Thats what Die hard is about. John Mclane thwarting their billion dollar, ingenious plans of becoming rich through elaborate schemes and red herrings. If it wasn't for John Mclane, his first nemesis Hans Gruber would have been ""sitting on a beach. Earning 20%"".<br/><br/>The script does a good job of bringing the former 80's action hero into the modern era. We get the feeling that he's getting old and rusty. That is until the fit hits the shan. The survival instincts of the man jump into overdrive once again and obstacles that would kill most people, John Mclane thrives off of.<br/><br/>The internet was pretty much a government plaything when the first Die Hard was made so placing an old relic into the thick of modern computers and other hardware was entertaining. John's hacker sidekick provides a lot of comic relief but proves invaluable whenever their adventure involves technical manipulation.<br/><br/>Our new chief villain is played by Timothy Olyphant and although he did a good job I found myself wanting someone more 'Gruberish' for the part. This is mainly because I'm a big Alan Rickman fan. Since the only other thing I had seen Olyphany play was Seth Bullock off of HBO's Deadwood I kept expecting him to put on a big black hat in every scene.<br/><br/>I would say this movie ranks as high as part 3, better than part 2 but doesn't even come close to the original. The original was a pioneering action flick which broke the mold for its time and I doubt anything will succeed it until a truly genius script is written.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good movie. Tons of action. Its got good Willis one-liners, great baddies and holds true to the other Mclane fantasies where the character starts out nice and clean but by the end of the movie his appearance is a testament to the strife of being the hero one more time.

","You bet... Bruce Willis does look old in this movie but doesn't look like 50+ years old. What was he thinking trying to do a action movie at this age. Well I suppose he was thinking of an Oscar.... I would not care if the academy gives him one or not. I am already giving him one for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a great thriller which shows that size does matter. A huge hit. I was watching this movie in a theater near a country side. I have gone to this theater and has a bad attendance level, for example the latest bond movie had like 20 people in the theater on the second day. I go to this theater on a weekday (Thursday), and lo!! what do I see - the theater is jam packed and I with my friend have to search for space... well we ended up sitting in seats far apart. This movie was so action packed, fast paced and thrilling that at the end of the movie I even forgot that I came with a friend to the theater.<br/><br/>This is another of those movies which I would have preferred to watch at the theaters and not on a DVD. It has been a long time since raw action has been lost from the American movie industry and this movie just tries to bring it in. I think the last movie I had the similar adrenaline rush was in Rambo III.. but believe me this is much more better and bigger than the older die hard movies."

","Die Hard 4.0 or Live Free or Die Hard is a great action packed movie. It's probably the best summer blockbuster so far beating the likes of Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3. Bruce (as always), Justin Long and Maggie Q gave great performances. The villain however, Timothy Olymphant, was mediocre, nothing compared to Alan Rickman in the first Die Hard. Kevin Smith gave a very funny comedic performance as 'The Warlock' lives in his 'commanding station' aka basement. The story was abit unoriginal as times i felt like i was watching Mission Impossible 3 meets Terminator 3.<br/><br/>Overall, superb entertainment that you shouldn't miss. Better than Die Hard 2 and 3. 8/10"

","Reviews I read about this movie, expectedly, panned it. I saw it 7/11/07 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Was it believable? Of course not, but you don't go into a movie like this expecting it to be. You go to this type of film to laugh, to be entertained, and to have a good time. LFDH gives all of these in abundance. One reviewer slammed it because an old cop like McClain teaming with a young hacker like Farrell was not believable. Why not? If you are in a situation, and there is someone that is an asset in getting you out of that situation, would you not use that person's help regardless of age, race, sex, etc? A foolish reason to put a movie down. LFDH was a hell of a good movie that kept me entertained for its entire running time. If you want believable, read the newspaper. If you want to be entertained and have some fun go see Live Free Die Hard."

","It has been 12 years since we last saw the vest-wearing, humorously rude and action loving hero in the wrong place at the wrong time, and this was the anticipated return. The first film was brilliant, the sequel was okay, the third film was better, and personally this is the much more enjoyable sequel that is just as good as the first. He may have lost his hair, and not completely the same streak of humour as before, but John McClane (Bruce Willis) is still a great hero. Basically, after a brief introduction of McClane's daughter Lucy (Final Destination 3's Mary Elizabeth Winstead, cyber-terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel (Scream 2's Timothy Olyphant) threaten to hack America (nowadays almost all things are run by a network). The only thing stopping them is all other hackers in the country, including Matt Farrell (Jeepers Creepers' Justin Long) who was unexpectedly rescued by McClane, and they are now both on the run from the bad guys, and with Matt's help (McClane hardly knows about computer technology) hack the computers to stop their plan. Also starring Maggie Q as Mai Lihn (Gabriel's lover and partner), Cliff Curtis as Bowman, Jonathan Sadowski as Trey, Andrew Friedman as Casper, Kevin Smith (aka Silent Bob, and director of many films he appears in) as Warlock, Yorgo Constantine as Russo, Cyril Raffaelli as Rand and Chris Palermo as Del. The odd-couple partnership of McClane and Matt, and the villain are good, the action, special effects and stunts never disappoint, the story of computer-hacking is cool, and it is ultimately a great thrill-ride. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"

So how did I see ""Live Free or Die Hard"" on opening weekend and without having seen its theatrical trailer? My friend and I chose it ""cold"" out of a dozen other movies, and we've been talking about this terrific motion picture ever since.<br/><br/>""Live Free or Die Hard"" brings to mind ""Cirque du Soleil"" or ""Mystère""; it has an uncomplicated, entertaining story line with amazing stunts and performances. What a bizarre, fascinating journey; those gymnastics scenes; what great physical strength and endurance! ""Live Free or Die Hard"" grabbed my attention, and refused to let go. I'd highly recommend it."
"Boloxxxi","7","0","1","10 July 2007"," Computer lunatic and his crack team of muscle and egg-heads cause pandemonium.
","Action-packed as usual, but oddly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>My problem: The sh*t hits the fan too quickly and we are not properly re-introduced to McClane. Here's an old friend we haven't seen in a long time and we don't get a chance to say hello, so to speak, and see how his life has been and what he's been up to lately. Where does he live? How does he live? Who are his friends? -You know, stuff like that. A major blunder in the making of this movie, I think. A proper re-introduction would have re-connected us to the guy; made us sympathize with him and care about him more.<br/><br/>Another reason I couldn't re-connect was that McClane seems to have lost his innocence: Ordinary ""Joe Shmoe"" (a cop) with no special training or affiliation who accidentally finds himself in the midst of something a lot bigger than himself that he's forced to deal with. He's one of us. And like we would be, he's scared to death but deals with it by being a wise-ass. Mclaine in this movie seems more like a ""veteran"" and though he confides that he's afraid I didn't believe it. In fact, the evil mastermind seemed more scared of him.<br/><br/>So I didn't care about McClane as much as I should have. The real star of the movie as far as I'm concerned were the terrific stunts and explosions. All of that was good eye-candy. Speaking of eye-candy, another thing that would have made this movie better for me was if the good looking kick-ass Asian chick in her snug black outfit had been given a larger role. In fact drop the guy who plays the evil computer mastermind and make her the mastermind. The free-runner guy -or ""monkey man""- could be her number 2. He was pretty good.<br/><br/>I give this movie 7 stars for the action and stunts. Could have gotten 2 more with better story telling. Finally -this is a side issue, I know- I have to ask the question: Do macho guys have ""sons"" anymore? A trend started in Hollywood possibly with 1985's Commando wherein the macho hero always has a daughter. In fact, now that I think about it, it is usually a daughter in the movies these days and not a son. One reason, I suspect, is that it knocks some of the hard edges off our macho hero. Modern women instead of feeling threatened can say ""Look, he has a daughter who he adores and is protective of. This must mean he's sensitive and likes women."" The other reason I guess is the woman (or girl)-in-peril thing which is more interesting to us than man (or boy)-in-peril. In fact I have come up with what I call our ""society's sympathetic order"". First children, then the elderly, then women, then animals, and then men. How did I come up with this? I imagined a sinking ship. Love, Boloxxxi."
"chrichtonsworld","8","0","1","10 July 2007"," Old school action with some modern touches
","It has been a long time since an action movie of this caliber has appeared! Most of the blockbusters that came out recently are based on comics or fantasy novels! Don't get me wrong I love the super heroes stuff! But like many new successful projects made in Hollywood it has become an overkill! It is refreshing to see a movie like they made in the eighties and nineties! Bruce Willis as John Mclane is back and how! He still seems fit to do these types of roles! And to be honest he excels at it! Most of the action is considerably old school (no CGI) mixed with some very unbelievable stunts! But done in such a way that it is entertaining! I would like to mention the french actor/stuntman Cyril Raffaelli (Most famous for his work in ""Kiss of the dragon"" and ""Banlieu 13"")! He shows some moves that seem to be a mixture of martial arts and free running (or Parkour)! You have to see it to believe it! Even Maggie Q (Naked Weapon,MI:3) is kicking some serious ass! If you have the feeling you are let down by ""POTC 3"" or ""Spiderman 3"" than ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the movie for you! This movie just does what it promises and delivers!

","now now now an action movie that makes sense rather makes more sense than the stupid action movies that we usually see. i watched this movie about one week after its release and i am repenting why i dint watch it earlier, i have already caught on two shows and still cant get enough of it. the beauty of this movie is the placement of the characters, everyone fits perfectly well in the movie, no unwanted crowd that confuses the people, everything is justified. the stunts are not only beautiful but brilliantly executed. watch out for the part where Willis takes down the helicopter. the camera work is nothing short of brilliant and is very effective. Bruce Willis as usual is the typical hard ass guy he has been and justing long, he does show he can do more than just teen movies. the chemistry between Willis and long is definitely a high point of the movie wont be surprised to see them again. overall an excellent movie which will make u stand and applaud for at least one scene in the movie a must watch"

My guess is no and Die hard 4.0 (as its better known over here) is no exception. Pulling in at around 2 hours and a bit, it never seems like its never ending and the action sequences are all great. I especially liked the reference to what eventually happens to the xbox360 at the start if you keep getting the 3 red lights LOL. I know this is no masterpiece (even by action movie standards) and neither is it the best of the 4 (2 is still the weakest (I refuse to use the word worst in this case)), but buy some popcorn and juice, sit back, relax and enjoy the action."
"stryker1121","Null","0","3","5 July 2007"," Fun but forgettable action sequel
","Live Free or Die Hard is pure action movie fluff, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's not much of a good thing either. After all these years the franchise feels a bit played out and generic. High-tech gadgets, over-the-top stunt sequences, CGI cars flipping around like tiddly-winks, henchmen dying elaborate deaths--some of this stuff is pretty cool, but none of it is terribly original. Action fans have witnessed these same scenes innumerable times since the first Die Hard kicked out collective asses with its genre-bending awesomeness. Unfortunately, the genre is watered down to the point where this fourth iteration is indiscernible from the hundreds of films that copied and expanded the first Die Hard's template.<br/><br/>LFoDH is not terrible by any means...Willis is still cool at 52 and Justin Long makes for an amusingly snarky sidekick. It's just that the movie feels strangely ""safe."" The action sequences are fun but you probably won't remember much about them once you leave the theater. The lead villain is a bit bland as is his plot to disrupt America through cyber-f@ckery. The strongest epithet our profane hero gets to use is ""jerk-off."" And as for McClane's famously vulgar catchphrase? Forget about it, cuz this is the land of PG-13.<br/><br/>By the end, there's no defining moment that separates this film from others of its kind. That's more a reflection of a dying genre than a bad movie. We've seen it all before."
"Aaron1375","9","0","1","4 July 2007"," An old fashioned summer action movie.
","Yes, this is a throw back action movie when action movies in the summer meant lots of explosions, cool chases, and big name stars in the lead role. Granted you get explosions these days, but then you also have some super powered hero to save the day. Not here, here we get our old buddy John McClain. Who gets the rather simple job of escorted a known hacker to some Washington bureau, no problems right? Wrong, we get action right away and the film rarely lets up. Multiple shootings, car chases and fights...I am amazed actually that this film managed a pg-13 rating. So the plot? Internet terrorist are systematically disabling such functions as traffic, the stock market, and our utilities. A hacker hired by them to partially create this havoc unknowingly is now no longer needed and must be eliminated along with all the other hackers they hired to help create this meltdown. Well, unfortunately for the bad guys this particular one has a cop sent to get him and that cop is McClain. Amazing action ensues with a great gun fight to open it up, a cool copter chase, a fight with a kung fu babe and the explosive final showdown. It is nice to see Willis still in form, as it seems it has been awhile since one of the old action stars has done a movie of this caliber. His supporting cast is good to as I enjoyed the interaction between McClain and the hacker and the bad guy was good as well. Like I said this movie never really lets up, though still did not have quite the fast flow of part three or the amazing intensity of one, it is still a very strong entry into the Die Hard franchise."

","Movie was really good for fourth time around. Don't believe any of them could outdo the Nakotomi Tower and the awesome suspense that movie had along with the relationship between the black cop and John Mclain. This Die Hard was pleasantly surprising and the guy playing the supporting actor to Bruce was really very good along with Bruce's daughter in the show who didn't get as much airtime. The bad guy was really believable and evil acting and added more suspense to the movie. The only real let down to me was the tractor trailer chase and the F37 or whatever that could just come down and stop in mid air like a helicopter and fly between the freeway. Get real and not make this a total science fiction with this action even though it was fairly cool. <br/><br/>Overall, good job and waiting on Die Hard 5,6,7,..............."

There also weren't periods of time where there wasn't action, it continued throughout the entire movie. There were a few problems I saw with this movie as there is an utter chaos in the Country but you never see a ""current"" president. Other presidents such as Kennedy and Bush were in this movie, but not directly. The overall movie is good and kept the viewer on the edge of his/her seat throughout the entire feature.

"lagriff05","9","0","1","4 July 2007"," Exactly what we expected, and nothing more or less
","Die Hard. The name that comes to mind whenever you think of a stereotypical action film. The original Die Hard became extremely influential almost 20 years ago upon it's first release, and now, 19 years later, the fourth sequel of the series has finally come upon us. While people were skeptical as to whether or not they could match the greatness of the original trilogy after such a long break (the 3rd was released 12 years ago), and while they grew even more skeptical upon learning that the film was PG-13, I daresay that Live Free or Die Hard definitely lives up to the franchise name.<br/><br/>This is a Die Hard for a new generation, and I kinda like that aspect of it. While the elements of the classic films are there, this time it's given an upgrade, with lots of the technological exploits that plague other modern action films, and a much sleeker, cooler feel. The fights are just as wild and crazy as ever, Bruce Willis has not lost an ounce of his charismatic action-hero energy, and the performances all around are good overall. The directing is good, and the special effects are definitely something to be praised, with explosions all around. In this movie, everything blows up. My one criticism is how Timothy Olyphant makes a pretty lame villain, and he dies way too fast. Most of his henchmen put up much more of a fight than he did. Just a minor quip, though.<br/><br/>While they may have lost the genuine '80s/90s gritty action flick' feel with this one, it's still incredibly badass, and something to see if you're an action movie fan. This one destroys Paycheck, Thoughtcrimes, Wake of Death, and every other mediocre action/thriller movie in the past couple of years. Recommended."

"andrej-zupanic","6","0","1","3 July 2007"," A Great Die Hard Movie but ...
","John McClane is back and he is still in top shape. No, let me rephrase this, he is in an excellent shape. The Movie is full of breathtaking action, funny dialogs and it has a good storyline. It is almost Die-hard at its best. Well, almost.<br/><br/>First of all, what bothers me the most is the PG-13 rating. Some scenes cold have been better if the R-rated version hit the cinemas instead of the money-thirsty PG-13 version. In some scenes you can actually see that they have been cut and it still keeps you think how did the scene look in the original cut. I won't say there aren't any bloody scenes in the film, but still it is not shown in the amount as it should be.<br/><br/>Secondly, the bridge scene is awesome, but it still is something that is a little too much for such a film. Why? Because such a thing is almost impossible and of course there were a few impossible scenes in the first three films, but none of them was so far fetched than this. But like I said it is still an awesome scene and brings the whole thing on a different level.<br/><br/>But this is enough of the negative things. Let me say why this film is still a great entertainment. First, we have been waiting for John McClane to return for 12 years and now he is finally back and he really doesn't disappoint at all. Together with Justin Long, Willis has made quite a great performance. The funny moments between Willis and Long are just great. It is like old school meets new school. It is just too funny. You just have to laugh at certain points.<br/><br/>If we go on, Timothy Olyphant really shows a great performance as the main villain and he really gives you a cold shiver sometimes. He did a good job, if we think on part 1 where the main villain was played by Alan Rickman and in part 3 by Jeremy Irons, who are both great actors, but Olyphant really was shining in his role.<br/><br/>Another plus is McClane's daughter Lucy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. In her you can really see the reflections of both of her parents. She has a big mouth like her father and is stubborn like her mother. And both of this put together gives us quite a toxic combination. Just see the boyfriend scene at the beginning and you will get it.<br/><br/>The storyline like I said is good but not perfect. It is something like we have seen in many different movie and series, like 24 or 16 Blocks. Well, but the writers really managed to put the best of different films together and have created a cocktail that is very tasty. It is more than just this, it's delicious. Where there are holes in the screenplay the director, Willis and Long really managed to fill the gaps with great wordplay and awesome action scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a Great Die Hard film, but it could have been even greater. So, I hope Fox will see that the fans still want more from the film and they will deliver us the R-rated version on the DVD or even better on BluRay Disc. One more advice, if you are making sequels to rated R-movies, don't downgrade them again. I really hoped you had your lesson with AVP, but I guess I was wrong. Well, still, Live Free or Die Hard is way better than AVP, but it is still missing some important ingredients."

Aided by reluctant hacker Long (making as the damsel-in-distress and tweaking his Mac TV ad character to the hilt), his trademark cool- under-pressure, quippy alpha male brio and street smarts, McClane is at his best resorting to some sharp, smart improvised bits of business to stop the bad guys. As the ""Timex watch in a digital world"", he just keeps on tickin'!

","this was an amazing film, worthy of the die hard title. granted, it took like 15 minutes for bruce willis to stop doing his john mcclane impression and leave the movie so john mcclane can step in and take over, but it happened right before john knocked down the helicopter, when he was talking to himself ""all you had to do was take a kid from jersey to dc, whats so hard about that"" or something to that effect. let me tell you why this was a die hard movie, but this explanation only makes sense if you think that the original trilogy is incredible. first, every die hard gets bigger, and if i need to spell it out for you, its first a building, then an airport then a city, and now half the eastern seaboard. it just gets bigger and bigger every time. second, every movie, except for the second, which is the worst of the trilogy but still is one of the top 3 action movies of all time, has mcclane and his personal problems with his marriage, which would obviously transfer to his children, namely his daughter in this movie, so people complaining that it was too personal mcclane and not ass kicking mcclane just don't understand what die hard is. third, how can he survive these things? that is what peole are saying, and they are saying that it is unrealistic. if you watched, enjoyed and believed the first three movies, then this should have no problem to realism. in the first movie he took a lot more punishment than he did in this movie. he walked on glass, bungee jumped with a fire hose, got shot in the arm, been knocked over by a huge ass explosion, jumped through an elevator shaft. that was the first movie, so why are people so quick to judge this movie. i repeat, if someone were to say, well, then i have that complaint that its not realistic for the first movies also, then they are not die hard fans. die hard fans know that john will take these punishments and keep going. in fact, in this movie it was more realistic, because during the time he had to travel from place to place, he could bandage himself up and stuff. fourth, the pg13 rating. what i think happened, and this is just a wild guess, was that the editors, producers and whoever else, watched the movie, realized that the blood was within pg13 tolerance, and the f word was said only a dozen times at most. they were thinking, why don't we just dub over those dozen or so f words and open this amazing franchise to a slightly younger crowd. you could tell when the words didn't match with the lips, but all in all it was a forgivable judgment call on their part, and who cares because there's probably gonna be an ""unrated"" DVD anyway, with those beloved swear words right back in. so, if you like the original doe hards, then there is no reason to not like this new addition, and frankly iwould be very happy to see another chapter or 2 in the mclane sage, so long as the sixth one isn't called ""live free or die hard 2: live free or die harder."" <br/><br/>ps- any real die hard fan should know that all odd die hard movies have to do with the grubers and all even die hard movie have to do with shutting down a well protected system and taking it over. if you didn't know that, then you got watch the movies a few more times"
"SoulfulFX","8","0","2","1 July 2007"," Live Free Or Die Hard
","'Live Free Or Die Hard': A great action film in the traditions of the 'Die Hard' series. Lots of explosions, John McClane taking out the bad guys, and good guys winning the day. This movie introduces his daughter character I believe you do glimpse in the first movie as a child as well as a hacker kid McClane has to keep alive while the U.S. government (mostly the FBI) tries to thwart cyber terrorists that have shut down most of the nation's key systems ...transportation, communications, financial, utilities, etc... That being said, the plot is pretty progressive and straightforward, no real twists or surprises... just a lot of cool explosions and stunts (the taking out a helicopter with a car scene is worth the admission!). So, no Oscar here for best picture, but a good couple of hours of popcorn popping. And yes... he does say THAT line at least once !"
"headfulofghosts126","8","0","3","1 July 2007"," Second best in the series
","It was with extreme cynicism that I entered the fourth Die Hard film. The original is a classic, the second is late 80's/early 90's over indulgence at its guilty pleasure best, and the third left me horribly disappointed. Twelve years later and I'm seeing pictures of a bald McClane, reading that the Underworld director is helming this, hearing all this talk of a PG-13 rating, watching lackluster trailers, and wondering why of why are they further desecrating this franchise? The film started and I began to worry that all my fears were not irrational. Something was a little off. From the under-whelming opening titles to the awkward introduction of John's character I thought it was true: it was going to be a Die Hard film that felt nothing like a Die Hard film.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes later and this baby finally found it legs and delivered an intense and gratifying ride that literally left me exhausted by the time it faded to black.<br/><br/>It wasn't without its flaws. I'm a fan of Timothy Olyphant but his casting as the lead villain was a mistake. In the pantheon of Die Hard villains he ranks as the blandest. This is due in no small part to the script which never bothers to make him anything more than a cardboard cut out with a cliché motive and long expository chunks of dialogue. There is no hint of a personality, just endless spurts of information.<br/><br/>And yeah, it gets a little bit too over the top at some points. I personally took little issue with this but I can certainly understand where some might feel that they've turned McClane into a superhero without a costume.<br/><br/>The music is nothing to write home about. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's certainly no better than average.<br/><br/>As for the PG-13 rating... I didn't mind it one single bit. I'm surprised they got it. The lack of profanity is apparent but honestly- it's a strange thing to complain about. And an easy fix once the unrated DVD is released. The violence on the other hand is sufficiently brutal. The blood doesn't spray as explicitly as it did in the second film but truth be told it's more violent than the third. It's definitely a Die Hard film in that capacity.<br/><br/>Len Wiseman... I was not a fan of this guy. The Underworld movies are boring and unimpressive. But he really delivers here. You don't understand how surprised I am to be admitting that. The action sequences in this film are nothing short of spectacular. The tunnel, the elevator shaft, Matt's rescue... not only are these scenes busting at the seems with adrenaline but they also manage to incorporate something sorely missing from action films these days: genuine suspense.<br/><br/>But for me the best part of the film was that John McClane was BACK. It was always so obvious that the third film was not written as a Die Hard film originally and they just changed the names of the characters. It didn't feel like John. His sidekick in that film was more of a bad ass than he was and that was just wrong. But this is McClane in all his familiar glory. It was nice to have him back.<br/><br/>I loved Justin Long as Matt. A popular criticism is that his character is whiny and annoying but I disagree. I'm a big fan of that actor and his style of humor so it completely worked for me.<br/><br/>I'm not as enthusiastic about Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy. Here scenes were pretty hit or miss. The ""That would be my dad"" line was probably the worst one in the movie. And she goes from hating her father to having him be the only person in the world she wants to talk to with no explanation. But for the most part she was pretty good.<br/><br/>Kevin Smith. I don't know. He seemed out of place and he's definitely not an actor. But I didn't find him as awful as some people seem to.<br/><br/>Overall, this was the most fun at the movies I've had yet this summer. I'm anxious to see it again. I know Die Hard fans are all over the board with their reactions but face facts: if you're a fan you know you're going to see it eventually. I'm just hear to say that if your experience ends up being anything like mine quit waiting."
"sveinn_th","7","0","2","1 July 2007"," Die Hard should be Die Hard
","I am a huge fan of the series. I was looking at some scenes in the first one recently. I really love that scene with the Asian guy making sure that nobody's watching him steal a candy bar. There are so many fun characters in the first movie, also in the second and third. Even the ones who don't even have lines. A good example is the Asian guy. All these small scenes are important. It makes the characters more real.<br/><br/>Of course everybody knows that. Right ? <br/><br/>I'm sad to say that Live Free Or Die Hard does not deliver the characters. Justin and Bruce are a good duo. Kevin Smith is funny but the rest is not worth talking about. Of course Maggie Q is hot ! We don't know what Timothy Olyphant's character wants until late in the movie. Thats just bad writing and direction. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that. If you don't know what the character wants there is no conflict, and without conflict there is no drama, and without drama there is no action. <br/><br/>This is the first film I see directed by Len Wiseman. He has got a good eye for visual style that's for sure. But to me, what makes die hard 'die hard' are the characters, great plot points and larger then life action.<br/><br/>I also really miss Michael Kamen's score. To me that's a huge part of Die Hard."
"bittersweet-me","9","0","2","1 July 2007"," Live Free and Date Hard
","During my July 4th holiday, I got to see LIVE FREE AND DIE HARD the latest in the DIE HARD series.<br/><br/>I can usually watch BRUCE WILLIS in anything. He's funny in the TV show FRIENDS, great in action movies, science fiction like THE FIFTH ELEMENT, great in most comedies, but can he pull off being tough guy John McClane one more time at his age? Or will he be like Clint Eastwood, trying one time too many to be DIRTY HARRY in the lame DEAD POOL or Charles Bronson putting out way too many DEATH WISH movies.<br/><br/>Happily, Willis succeeds in this DIE HARD after a 12 year layoff as the character. The action is incredible, and it's not just all some movie technician computer-generating it from their cubicle somewhere, when they fly a car into a helicopter, they actually do it, and you can see and appreciate the difference on screen.<br/><br/>Of course the plot and stunts are outlandish, but the film makers keep it believable enough it doesn't spoil the movie. Kind of like the better James Bond movies where the villain is trying to take over the world, and instead of saying HOW STUPID, you pause and say MAYBE THAT COULD HAPPEN.<br/><br/>Willis jumps, punches, crashes and wisecracks his way through the movie. And he has a great cast to support him. Timothy Olyphant is a great menacing villain even though its hard to top Alan Rickman from the first DIE HARD. Justin Long, who is excellent in comedies like DODGEBALL, THE BREAKUP, and even Apple computer commercials, surprised me on how well he does in this serious dramatic/action role. And Kevin Smith and Maggie Q fans will love them in the smaller roles that they bring to the movie.<br/><br/>I wish I could say more, like what happens to a tractor trailer, the elevator scene, but then I would be spoiling the movie. But sufficient to say, action movie afficionados will love the new DIE HARD.<br/><br/>It kind of reminds me of the last JULY 4TH movie I went to see, which was Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to be the TERMINATOR one more time in TERMINATOR 3 JUDGEMENT DAY. He made it work, and BRUCE WILLIS you nailed it too!<br/><br/>KUDOS BROTHER, I'm OUUUUUUUUUUUUUT."
"Astralan","9","0","2","1 July 2007"," Kaaboooooom.
","Sometimes you get a little tired of the ""Follow The Money"" good guy/bad guy theme. Movies are riddled with them lately. But you must be aware that movies like the Die Hard franchise will always be around. In the 60's when my television viewing started taking on a wider scope that expanded beyond Saturday morning cartoons, movies were a great way to pass the time, and you had pretty much the same things then as you do now: Westerns with bad guys, good guys, horses and guns; Space movies with good guys, bad guys, space ships and ray guns; War movies with good guys, bad guys, tanks and guns; Cop movies... yeah, you can guess the rest.<br/><br/>And Live Free or Die Hard is no exception. Good guy, bad guys, cars and jets and motorcycles and semi trucks and guns. When put that way, it doesn't sound like something worth going to see, but if you like fast moving over the top stunts, at this moment there is none better. Bruce Willis resurrects his role as John McClane, and I don't use resurrect lightly: He's old, he looks tired. He's destitute pretty much with a divorce and kids that don't want to have anything to do with him. So, seeing where we left off with Die Hard with a Vengeance, it seems McClane had just about done everything to screw up anything that would be considered a social life. So what else is there for him to do but save the world. Johns not nearly as self-mumbling in this movie as in previous movies, and in light of that, much of the levity that he usually brings to the screen is subtle and the tone gets pretty serious. The bad guy he is pitted against starts out like he just wants to ""upset"" the US Government off, but in the end, and I'm sorry if it spoils it for you, all comes down to money again.<br/><br/>The story is predictable in the sense you know something in the way of some incredible stunt are coming, but the stunts themselves are pretty damn cool. Not quite as gross as a zombie tearing your limbs off, but still, McClane slowly chips away at the bad guys resources until there is nothing left but to ... Well, I'll stop there.<br/><br/>I still like this for what it is: And Action Movie. And just like many of its older counterparts, they are merely there to entertain. So, on entertainment alone, I give this a thumbs up."
"ianriley","9","0","4","30 June 2007"," better than the first 3 put together!
","wow. the action scenes were as good as it gets. Bullets and bombs right from the start, and it never lets up.<br/><br/>The premise is a nice twist on the traditional terrorist attacks. I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of seeing movie after movie of some extremist group planting bombs in buildings. Attacking all the technology we rely upon, now there's a scary situation.<br/><br/>The story moved along at such a great pace, that it felt very unpredictable. Sure, you know the outcome in the end, but everything in between is a wild roller-coaster of intense chase scenes and massive shootouts.<br/><br/>If you've never seen a die-hard movie yet, you might wanna watch some of others first, and leave the cream of the crop for last. It couldn't have been done any better in my opinion. OK there was one scene involving a car and a helicopter that is quite far fetched, but hey, it's die-hard baby! yippie kai yay muther suckers!"
"exden","8","0","3","30 June 2007"," Best action movie in recent times. True to the action movie genre of the 90's
","Not as good as Die Hard 1 or 3 but better then 2. Too much emphasis on computer hacking. The villain in this movie is younger then the other villains in the Die hard movies but he does an excellent job. I couldn't watch this movie without being reminded that I was watching the guy from the Mac commercials, so that aspect bothered me as well as the fat ""clerks"" actor as the warlock (totally miscast but probably called a favor to get the role). The worst thing about this movie was the beginning for those who saw the movie I am referring to the cliché father daughter boyfriend car scene. For 12 years in the making it could have been better though. Nonetheless, there hasn't been a better action movie then this one in a long time. While watching this movie you get the sense that this is how action movies were meant to be made."
"tpaladino","9","0","3","30 June 2007"," Best action since 'Casino Royale'
","I didn't think this was as good of a movie as 'Casino Royale', or the original 'Die Hard' (which is the gold standard of modern action movies) but this is certainly one of the best action flicks to come along in a while. Not the most believable plot ever written either, but it's not entirely outrageous, and provides a reasonable stage for Bruce Willis to act out his John McLane in a way that is extremely entertaining and memorable.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis maintains all of the John McLane wit and attitude that fans love, but he's an older, more confident version of the character in this film. He's obviously been through this a few times before, and a lot of his self-disbelief that was a hallmark the first film is gone here; he's seen it all before, and goes about his ass-kicking in a very straightforward and almost businesslike manner this time around. Mind you, he's never the stereotypical cocky action-hero, but he's clearly much more accepting of his situation, and his role in it.<br/><br/>Justin Long is also very enjoyable, providing a humorous foil to McLane's machismo, with complaints about his blood-sugar and asthma contrasting to John beating and shooting his way through bad guys. I was worried that it would get tiresome, but it never really did; I have to say that Long is a very good actor, and he and Willis have great chemistry.<br/><br/>As mentioned in another review here, some of the hacker/tech scenes were a little hokey, and a lot of people these days have a pretty good understanding of technology and realize that some of the feats the super-hackers pull off aren't exactly possible, regardless of their skill. But this doesn't really hinder the entertainment value of the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastically choreographed and shot, and have a level of brutal realism that reminded me of Casino Royale, which is a very good thing. Personally, I could have done without the scene with the fighter jet, but oh well.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a really good movie for what it is; a fun summer blockbuster action sequel. Worth every penny of the admission."
"powerfull_jedi","8","0","1","30 June 2007"," John McClane is back to kick yet more terrorist butt, and Die Hard stands the test of time
","Age is a strange thing when it comes to movies, some actors at a young age were perfect for a certain role and years later the same actors find themselves playing the same role that put their names on the map. Stallone, Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone and Harrison Ford once again play the same characters that made them famous in the first place, didn't work for Sharon Stone, worked for Stallone in Rocky and the upcoming Rambo, Harrison Ford just started shooting this week, how does Bruce Willis stack up as the hard boiled detective John McClane? Pretty good, actually. Live Free or Die Hard(Die Hard 4.0 overseas) is a great action movie with a few good laughs(save for some stale computer-related jokes) and loads of explosions, much like the original Die Hard. I'm quite surprised this movie got away with a PG-13 rating when violence and profanity abound(though attempts to tone it down are clearly visible throughout the film). The movie starts out with McClane just wanting to pick up a seemingly harmless computer hacker, seems like a regular assignment, which quickly turns sour as McClane and the hacker Matthew are being stalked and hunted down by an unknown group of terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel who seem to have gain complete control over every network in the country basically putting the entire country into a modern-age technological doomsday scenario(it also makes it more frightening when the terrorists broadcast videos of monuments exploding and a montage with various US presidents mixing their quotes to send a scary message). It's up to McClane to track down Gabriel and his gang before it's too late. I enjoyed the plot of this movie, despite some minor setbacks, it's an enjoyable emotional ride that truly delivers, and as an added bonus some nods to the original Die Hard. Bruce Willis, who I have last seen in another blockbuster, which was Ricard Donner's 16 Blocks, doesn't disappoint. Despite John McClane now being a little older, he retains much of his witty jokes, rudeness, his headache-inducing(for the villains, that is) sarcasm and his vulnerability(though this one is a bit over the top). Justin Long also performs well, but I'm not too crazy for the main villain Timothy Olyphant(he was awesome in The Girl Next Door, by the way, but I'm curious how he'll do in the upcoming Hit-man movie), who sometimes gets out shined by his multi-cultural henchmen(namely Maggie Q). Mary Elizabeth Winstead also performs perfectly as McClane's daugther and the rest of the cast do their jobs(even Kevin Smith's brief role). My complaints about the movie are few, the soundtrack which underperformed in my opinion, I can tell you that. Didn't get me hooked up as much as I wanted to but thankfully the action and the dialog made it all worthwhile. Stale computer tech-support jokes and some lame social commentary kinda spoil the fun to some degree(I don't see why some people laughed with US flags everywhere, it is the Fourth of July in the movie's. What's up with people nowadays nagging about the US flag showing up in a movie? People have been jumping over this since Spiderman 3. What gives?). Again, the main villain has some cringe-worthy lines once in a while and that's about it for all my nagging. My advice: Go see this movie. It's well worth it."

","It's been so long since I've seen a good action movie outside the comic book stories and Harry Potter, and here is one of the first action movies which brings back and old hero that we all loved. It's been a long time since we saw John McClane (Bruce Willis) in his most famous role, but even after 20 years since his debut in the first Die Hard, the character still works. He may be older, and he may have taken on different roles since Die Hard With A Vengeance, but he hasn't lost his touch as everybody's beloved hero in one of the most famous action series ever.<br/><br/>It's July 4th, and suddenly there is an attack on the United States infrastructure through computers which begins shutting the entire country down. The person behind it is a man by the name of Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). He is working with a group of people which also includes his Kung-Fu kicking girlfriend (Maggie Q). They are so certain they have control of the country, but they didn't count on our scruffy hero (McClane) who with the assistance of a young computer hacker, will stop at nothing to bring them to justice. That's the plot in simple terms.<br/><br/>Like all the Die Hard films, this film is loaded with extraordinary stunts and explosions as well as almost non-stop action which keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The director Len Wiseman never seems to let up for long, and though some scenes make McClane look like an indestructible machine that keeps coming, they work because of the dialoque and Willis himself. Justin Long, who plays the young computer hacker helping McClane, even has a few of his own snappy lines which never sound lame and seem to mix well with McClane's.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard has helped me to once again embrace all the old action films that starred Swarzenegger, Gibson, and Willis himself as well as others which became so popular in the eighties and on into the nineties. It's good to see that Hollywood is still capable of giving us real action films that aren't all CGI like todays action films are. I gladly recommend it even if some of the scenes are way over the top and are borderline impossible for a human being to survive. After all, it is fiction."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Bruce Willis reprises his role as NYPD's supercop, John McClane, in by far, the best of the series since the original. Director Len Wiseman brings a fresh look and young eyes to the franchise and wisely and cleverly incorporates a story line that appeals to the Gen Y audience.<br/><br/>Rising star Timothy Olyphant (""Deadwood"") makes a wonderful virtual bad guy who was disrespected by the federal government when he dramatically demonstrated how insecure the U.S. systems were. Cast aside like Lex Luthor, he attempts to gain his revenge by shutting down society and bilking billions from Americans. Olyphant is aided in a most beautiful way by the lovely Maggie Q (MI:III) who gives Willis a run for his money and is the subject of some of the film's funniest lines.<br/><br/>Ultra-hacker Justin Long gets dragged through the mess by Willis because he is a target of the bad guys and because he is smart enough to stop the bad guys ... oh, and also because Wiseman wanted some appealing youth to accompany Willis on this mission. Along the way, Long and Willis encounter uber-hacker Kevin Smith in a terrific segment that almost allows the viewer to catch his or her breath.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not least, Mary Elizabeth Winstead appears as Willis's daughter and the casting couldn't be better. Ms. Winstead was last seen in Tarantino's segment of ""Grindhouse"" and is obviously ready for meatier roles. Look out for this girl.<br/><br/>The ""Die Hard"" series has always been about action and heart with a dose of comedy. Director Wiseman takes the special effects to a whole new level and the scenes with Willis and Long are really good. As for the comedy, it is probably the funniest in the series. Check this one out for a truly good time at the movies!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","1","30 June 2007"," Thoroughly entertaining action-film
","Granted, it's not *that* much of a Die Hard film... but were any but the first, really? Yes, it is one of the new action films... infamous for their overwhelming and often noisy action and pacing, the dialog's constant attempts at making us laugh, and the martial arts(well, OK, that last one, I, personally, really don't mind). It's an acquired taste, and many don't care for it. However, what makes this considerably more watchable than the bunch is that the action really only gets to be downright overstimulating for the very last bit of the film, that the pacing, whilst by no means slow, isn't overwhelming... and that aforementioned attempts, by the dialog, for the very most part *work*. The theater I watched this in was almost constantly either impressed by the action, or in stitches from the last line or exchange. This may not be the same Die Hard we know, but it's still a pretty good effort, and McClane is about the same(if his language has been toned down noticeably, due to the producers going for less than an R), and he's always cool to watch. He's joined this time by Matt Farrell, as portrayed by Justin Long, who played a dork in Galaxy Quest almost a decade earlier. Long has grown up(and is now playing a big dork), and he plays off Willis very well(there could maybe have been one or two less jokes regarding the difference in physical fitness between the two, but that's about it). Some of the funniest exchanges are between those two. Long's character could easily have been a cliché, with how many of the traits commonly associated with computer-nerds and dorks in general, but he really feels like a full character, and it's great to see Long get this opportunity to prove himself, and he definitely pulls it off. The bad guys don't let us down, either, with good acting capability on that end, as well(I won't reveal who portrays them here). The film is entertaining and thrilling from start to finish. I wasn't bored for a second. The action is exciting and well-done, and it maintains much of the realism of the earlier films(though it is kicked into high gear). There were a few bits where you could tell that Wiseman started directing with Underworld, but it never felt as though McClane should have been fighting fantasy creatures. Wiseman definitely knows how to do action, and I would say that his abilities within story-telling are improving. I will most definitely keep my eyes on his work in the future. Kevin Smith's role is short but good. The casting and acting is all quite good. The plot is good, and the concept is reasonably relevant(and definitely involving and interesting). There are some nice nods to the original Die Hard in this film. All in all, I liked it, but I also only liked the first films(excluding the third, that one, I did not care for much at all), so the fan-base might not particularly enjoy this. I recommend it to anyone who likes Die Hard as a franchise and/or the character of John McClane. The hard-core fans will probably find this too far a stretch from the first film, and the previous two sequels. 8/10"
"jaredmobarak","7","0","1","30 June 2007"," Is the circus in town?Live Free or Die Hard
","Since I don't consider watching movies on edited TV as really watching the movie, I have never seen an installment of the Die Hard series. As a result, the fourth film, Live Free or Die Hard has been my first foray into John McClane's one man against the world antics. Now this is actually somewhat ironic because in order to get the PG-13 rating that the producers wanted, there has been a lot of overdubbing of lines, and it's noticeable. So in effect, my first experience with this action series has been an edited theatre viewingI'm sure I'm not the only one to find that humorous. Despite the cleaning up of language, however, this film really delivers on all promises. We are given non-stop action, explosions galore, a somewhat intelligent screenplay, and terrific one-liners to lighten up any overwrought moments. Like Mission Impossible 3 last year, this film really opened my eyes to how entertainingly good action flicks can be.<br/><br/>Now, what I know about the first three films is that it is always a European baddie terrorizing the US so that McClane can save the day. Here, though, we have an American leading the destruction in order to show how vulnerable our government is. I found this an intriguing way to freshen the concept while commentating on current events and the need to look on all sides for the enemy. Because we don't get the outsider foe, we in effect don't get a one-man show to pit against Bruce Willis' McClane. Sure we have Timothy Olyphant, doing what he does best as in films like Go and Girl Next Door, leading the crew, but as Willis cracks, he has many henchmen at his side doing all the dirty work. As a result, the enemy by committee doesn't quite succeed in holding terror over the audience. Instead it is the total annihilation of all computer and electronic devices in the country that is the true feared entity, although Maggie Q does do a nice job at showing some martial arts activity. The fight between her and Willis is at once awesome, funny, and brutal. (Is it just me though, or is it weird that all the computer geeks on the good side are nerds and those on the bad side are built for war once their keystrokes are complete?)<br/><br/>Because of the high-tech storyline, Willis can't do it all by himself. He does try, very admirably, and shows that age is not a factor in him still being one of the best action stars around. His comedic delivery is right on and he just knows how to kill and destroy with brute force. John McClane is definitely a guy that punches first and asks questions later. But I guess if he's been on the other end of craziness like this for three past films, he has the right to do so. This old-school mentality can't succeed alone in a film of this era of electronics and because of this we get the Mac himself, Justin Long, to help out. I will admit that although a fan, I really didn't think any good could come of this casting. Thankfully I was wrong because he really does a good job at playing off Willis and getting it done as far as what is needed hacker-wise.<br/><br/>Besides Willis stealing the movie with his charisma, the film's action sequences are fantastic. Len Wiseman, of Underworld fame, has really upped the ante and infused this movie with explosions left and right. Between a helicopter being killed by a car, an on-ramp bridge being destroyed by an F-18 at close range, and an elevator shaft sequence perfectly orchestrated, we also get Cyril Raffaelli doing acrobatic fighting and contorting in order to fall from huge heights and yet able to get right back up. The bells and whistles rarely interest me enough to keep from being bored, but I must say this one fired on all cylinders to great effect. Even Kevin Smith's small cameo brought a smile to my face. Again like MI3's Simon Pegg role, Smith delivers a gem of a comic relief part at just the right time to lead into our final car chase/utter destruction sequence. If this is the fourth installment and it is this enjoyable, I can't wait to finally visit the originals, because if they are better, I'm in for a fun time."

","If you are going into this film expecting the same outing as the last three, do yourself a favor and at least keep an open mind. I have loved Die Hard my entire life, it's my favorite action series. I own them all, I grew up with them, I can nigh repeat every line. So of course, I go see this as early as I can on opening day. To put it short: I am not disappointed. The film does what it does extremely well. It preserves the character of McClane albeit watered down for the rating. This 52 year old McClane is a lot more far gone from being a rather clichéd alcoholic on the edge. He is a lonely old man. The one scene that really stuck with me is when Farrell (Justin Long) and McClane are driving to West Virginia and Farrell talks about how he can't handle what's going on, that he's not brave like McClane. McClane says no one throws you a parade for being heroic, you get divorced, your kids hate you and you get to eat a lot of meals alone. He basically boils his life down to a series of incredible moments that put him on the front cover of Time, but never gave him his family. A lot of critics of the series have reacted poorly to this new found drama, but if you really go back and watch the others you'll see it there too. McClane is not Rambo, he is a very normal person caught up in extraordinary situations. And like a normal person, if you get shot at for 20 years, you might not be the happiest camper either. Long was cast well as this character Farrell. He brings obvious comic relief but at the same time gives McClane a pseudo-son figure, which we can only assume that McClane's real son wants nothing to do with him. Lucy McClane was cast well also. And finally the cornerstone of every Die Hard flick is the villain. Olyphant does a very good job as Gabriel who is basically another super-idealist who still has very monetary motives, which McClane points out they're always in it for the money.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I've seen a lot of crap action movies and this is not one of them. As a film, it is good. As Die Hard, it's worthy of the mantle."

He's covered in blood from start to finish, you know, the usual image we have of him.<br/><br/>You have to suspend disbelief at some points, but nevertheless, it just works out somehow.

"ryanrvogel","8","0","2","30 June 2007"," Great like Die Hard...except on basic cable
","I'll start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the ""Die Hard"" movies and the character of John McLane so I evaluated the film first as part of the series and second as a singular summer action film.<br/><br/>As the summary states, I found this entry in the ""Die Hard"" series to be extremely true to the characters and situations of the previous films. However, in the studio's apparent desire for a broader fan-base (if that's possible), they decided to produce it as a PG-13 outing. I constantly felt like I was about to see some blood splatter on a wall or an amputation, just to be teased by a quick cut-away as if portions of the movie had been cut for a basic cable broadcast. The same goes for the typical foul language of the series. I'm not saying that violence or cursing makes a movie worth watching...but it just seemed as though the movie was originally written and filmed to be a full-blown R-rated sequel, only to be cut down in post-production. The tactful cuts just seemed unnatural for a die hard movie. On the other hand, John McLane's humor and general badassitude was true to the character. So, hopefully they release a director's cut DVD that makes the brutality more in-line with the previous films.<br/><br/>Aside from the comparisons with past films, I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable 'summer blockbuster'. The action was virtually non-stop and employed plenty of car chases, gun battles, and explosions, all while using what appeared to be minimal CGI. I definitely sensed some computer special effects...but they all seemed pretty low-key and at no point did anything look obviously fake. As far as the acting...Bruce Willis was awesome as usual, delivering constant one-liners in classic McLane style. Justin Long, who I personally hate from all the Mac commercials, actually seems to be perfectly cast as the grungy computer hacker and I found myself enjoying the back-and-forth between him and McLane enjoyable for the most part. Maggie Q was hot and had some good fight scenes but didn't really add anything significant to the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, I felt, had the most unused potential. She was very believable as the junior McLane but unfortunately had limited screen time and the role mainly seemed to be used as a vehicle for a few more action scenes. Everyone else played their parts well, with Kevin Smith's Warlock being the most notable of the smaller parts. Director Len Wiseman shows that he can take the reigns of an established franchise and evolve the story and situations while staying true to the original films. He gives us Michael Bay sized action while actually telling a story that the audience wants to hear.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a highly entertaining film with great production value. Despite the lack of gore and cursing feeling forced, Die Hard purists should still be able to enjoy this one as a continuation of the McLane legacy and with the lower rating, hopefully a new and broader fan base will emerge and keep this great franchise alive."
"kosmasp","8","0","2","30 June 2007"," Balls to the wall ..
","... or through the wall ... One thing is for certain here and you should be aware of that fact: There is no such thing as a story/plot that is noteworthy. John McLane - Bad Guys and speaking of the former, it's amazing how smoothly and to the point Bruce Willis is, in one of his (if not THE) trademark roles! He's jumping right into it, as if Part 3 was shot yesterday! <br/><br/>I've got to give out Kudos to the rest of the cast, too. From the bad guys/gal to the sidekick Justin Long. I was afraid, he could ruin the movie, but he fits the bill and plays his role good (of course you can't compare him to a Samuel L. Jackson, but that's not the point here). What is the point though, is the action on display. And the action is pretty d*mn good! There are things/stunts that you might have seen in the trailer, but even if, you'll be equally amazed by them! <br/><br/>You couldn't tell from the action on screen, but the movie is PG-13. From what I heard (rumors), there will be a longer version on DVD, which I'm looking forward, too. Is it still worth watching in a theater? If you're a McLane/Willis fan, the answer will be yes and you'll love the movie. But even without any knowledge of the previous installments in the Die Hard series, as an action fan, you'll enjoy this movie! Yippie-kay-yay ...<br/><br/>EDIT: I have to admit, that seeing Bruce Willis as John McLane, made me oblivious to the fact, that the villain was kind of non existent. Or at least, not that impressive and/or threatening ... still good action though!"
"samuraisuave","9","0","2","29 June 2007"," It's PG-13, but it's still Die Hard
","(may contain possible spoiler in plot outline, but nothing major)<br/><br/>I just got back from Live Free or Die Hard, the new Die Hard flick with the utterly convoluted title. What's with that? Why not Die Hard 4? Why wasn't it Rocky 6? Are they ashamed they made so many sequels? They probably should be.<br/><br/>As I shuffled into the jam-packed theater, I was beset by a certain apprehension that the Internet made clear was shared by legions of Die Hard fans: that this movie wasn't going to be Die Hard -- but instead that the uncharacteristic PG-13 rating would denigrate this movie into Die Feeble or Die Frail.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the demotion to PG-13 did NOT affect the level of violence or testosterone too much. The only thing notably missing from the flick is the F-bomb, which gets substituted with ""shit"", a suitable replacement that ranks only slightly below than the F-bomb on ""The Big List O' Words Your Mom Slapped You For.""  The plot line revolves around a greasy hacker kid who unwittingly writes a line of code that's hi-jacked by a group of rogue terrorists who intend to wage technological warfare on the United States by shutting down power grids, causing the stock market to collapse, and creating anarchy. The main baddie's motivation stems from the fact that he tried to convince Homeland Security to pay more attention to easily exploitable holes in their computer networking. They didn't listen to him, so, to prove a point, he hacked into their system and gave them a preview of the havoc that could be caused. The government's response was to vilify him, so this time, it's personal, and he's out to do as much damage as possible.<br/><br/>John McClane's mission this time around is to protect the hacker kid, whom the baddies are attempting to kill. Why are they trying to kill him? Because he is the only person with the knowledge of how to stop the technological chaos.<br/><br/>What follows is a series of cliff-hanger moments and heart-pounding action scenes rendered with believable and breathtaking special effects that are amazing to behold.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is on top of his game. His McClane is older, wiser, and balder. Willis does a marvelous job of generating empathy for his character; the audience in the theater I attended was putty in his hands, clapping and cheering when he spouted his soon-to-be-classic one-liners.<br/><br/>Live Free or Die Hard can almost be called a buddy flick. Much of the humor stems from the contrasts between McClane and hacker kid, Matt Farrell. It's cool that the punchlines are generated from the differences in age and temperament, rather than tired racial quirks explored by so many other forgettable buddy flicks.<br/><br/>The movie is suspenseful, packed with action, and despite its PG-13 rating, lots of dudes (and some dudettes!) get wasted in brutal fashion. They perhaps spent a little less time actually showing the baddies suffering from their wounds, but I didn't really notice it.<br/><br/>The story is a bit crazy, and one gets the sense that the incredible feats that McClane pulls off are unlikely to happen in ""real life"", but hey, it's Die Hard. It's not meant to be micro-analyzed for realism. It's meant to be enjoyed for what it is. A kick-ass, balls to the wall action flick. I definitely felt I got my money's worth, and I can, with relief, assure you that the PG-13 rating didn't really tarnish the movie in any major way. The majority of the acting is passably good, but Willis's charisma shines brightly. He was born to play this role. The CG effects are really fantastic, and none of them looked obviously ""computerized"", which is something I feel really detracts from the immersion of a lot of movies.<br/><br/>If you're up for some laughs, some thrills, and some ""holy !@$%, that looks amazing!"" moments, go see it."

It may disappoint the true Die Hard series fans. May...<br/><br/>John McClane is doing his thing. But he seems this time around to be on a leash. He's there, all attitude. But who told him not to swear? I just read that the other films in the series averaged 200 F-bombs each. So why the red tape? I know what some people will say... thats a lame thing to complain, or even note. But truthfully, I am tired of studio's laming up action movies to get PG ratings. As if this movie was gonna tank if was R-rated. Please. Give us a little swearing and blood. We can handle it. If we are paying to see Bruce kicking ass, we can afford a few ear invasions.<br/><br/>The action sequences are great. It was awesome to see what appeared to be actual stunts and not just CG oriented blue screen explosions. (I'm sure some are, but it looks great.) The pacing is great. The story is great. Yes, thats right, as opposed to the fifty other lame action movies you might watch in a year, this one has a decent story teamed with the action, acting and characters. <br/><br/>I was not disappointed in the film.

"Matt_Layden","8","0","4","29 June 2007"," ""The Best Action Film Of Recent Years""
","In the year 1988 there was a man running around a high rise building with no shoes on. In 1990, this same man was running around again, this time in an airport fighting a guy who likes to pose naked in his hotel rooms. Then in 1995, this same man drove around NYC trying to solve numerous riddles. Now the year is 2007 and this same man now must stop hackers corrupting the United States Government and the entire country. Sounds pretty rough to us, well it's just another day in the life of John McClane.<br/><br/>Before the release of this film, many die hard DIE HARD fans (like that one eh?) were up in arms over not one, not two, but numerous things about this flick. One, would be the absurd PG-13 (14A) rating, whereas all the other DIE HARD films had R ratings, this was the first film in the series without it. Two, McClane's so called sidekick was a MAC...sorry I mean Justin Long. Third, the man behind the lens was Len Wiseman, whose resume was UNDERWORLD...and it's sequel. Finally Willis was old, pass his 50's old, could he still have the McClane charm and make it believable? No, things were not looking all too well for the next DIE HARD film, that is until it was finally released and blew everyone away. Myself included.<br/><br/>I will admit I was never head over heels in love with the first Die Hard film. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the be all to end all action film that everyone made it out to be. I give it credit for what it did, which was start a trend of films that would later be called "" Die Hard On A.....Die Hard In A...."" Those titles go for films such as SPEED or Sudden Death. I prefer Vengeance to be honest. Throughout the series to settings grew bigger and bigger, from a high rise building, to an airport, to a city and now the entire country. Live Free Or Die Hard is ambitious, violent, funny, and clichéd. So what I'm trying to say here is that it's the best action film of recent years. While CRANK tried it's best to inject live into a dead genre, it's this film that finally did it.<br/><br/>First off, the PG-13 rating will have no affect on your views for this film. you're too busy being blown back into your seat to even notice. The film has dropped the F-bombs, but has thrown in more bombs itself. Live Free or Die Hard is the most violent of the Die Hard films, and yet it probably shows the least amount of blood. It's the 'action violence' that sets it apart. Everything is taking place on a grander scale, making everything seem more significant and bigger then ever before. Die Hard was the one of the first films to be deemed the ""Ultimate Guy Flick"", Live Free or Die Hard is one film that is challenge that role. It so desperately wants to be the ultimate guy flick and it almost succeeds.<br/><br/>This film does what it does best, entertains. I guarantee you, that you are going to see this film for the action. You will not be disappointed. It is above and beyond in action. It even plays on the old tired action film clichés, which brings it into a self parody, but that's okay because will all know that no one is taking anything seriously here. Just listen to the plot to know that, don't even have to mention the car crashing into the helicopter scene. It's the clichés that actually bring the film higher. You know from the beginning that his 'partner' is going to be the wise-ass, guess what he is. Long serves as the comic relief, the young and hip kid to Willis' old and tired McClane. His daughter, who wants nothing to do with him will need her father in the end, as she will be kidnapped and the dad must do what he does best to get her back. The main villain being in love with a woman who is also one of the main villains. Not to mention the series famous catch phrase.<br/><br/>No one in this film is getting an Oscar anytime soon, but they play their roles to their beat. McClane is his joke spewing self, who shoots more bad guys in one day then most cops do their whole lives. Long plays his comedic young counterpart with just enough humour and just enough fear to play into the old/young relationship clichés. Winstead as the daughter who hates/loves her father and even Olyphant as the bad guy with the cold dead menacing stare.<br/><br/>I don't know what it is about the old beloved character, but with Stallone's Balboa and Willis' McClane, it seems that old things never die. It's up to Ford and his fedora to see if we can make it three for three. The film is about 30 minutes too long, but with all the action on the screen you won't care. This is a summer flick that actually delivers on it's promises. Boom, Boom, Boom. One gripe I have though is that there is so much action going on that not one scene particularly stuck out in my mind as the ""DIE HARD"" scene. In the original it's the jump from the explosion, with hose wrapped around him. The sequel is the cockpit ejection and third is the cable jump to boat. This film, even in it's jet-plane climax, has no real ""DIE HARD HERO SHOT"" that I wanted to see. Other then those minor gripes that I personally have, this was a big surprise to me. Other then Grindhouse and 300, I had the most fun at this film this year."
"hantonr","10","0","5","29 June 2007"," Must-See Die Hard for Fans
","This movie was great at keeping you on the edge of your seat and in the thick of the action. There is always another explosion blowing McClane through a wall or a bad guy shooting at him with a really big gun. <br/><br/>The only problem I had was that the bad guys weren't just thugs like in the other movies. The writers seem to have decided to up the ante by making some of them almost superhuman. I was reminded of X-men by Mai Lihn, who refuses to die and Rand, who looks like Toad (X-men) reincarnated. That ruined the legacy a bit, but you still must see the movie. <br/><br/>Also FYI, when hacking computers the likelihood of F-35 diagrams and graphical demonstrations of traffic crashes coming on screen is very low."
"Diplodocus55","8","0","3","28 June 2007"," Strong DIE HARD movie that never quite punches through...
","I'm a huge fan of this series. The original DIE HARD was probably the single greatest movie experience of my life the first time I saw it (and I ended up seeing it 7 times in the theater -- a personal record). I prefer the second one to the third because the 2nd seemed to retain more of that DIE HARD feel. This fourth one was a worthy follow-up, very entertaining, and probably as good as 2 or 3 IMO... but still fell short of finding that old DIE HARD (1988) magic. <br/><br/>The scope of these films have widened with each entry and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is no exception. After seizing a building in the original movie, an airport in the 1st follow-up and then a city, it seemed the logical choice was for now our entire country to be seized by terrorists (and for McClane's battlefield to encompass several states). In this respect, the film feels like it belongs in this series. <br/><br/>There were some truly cool scenes involving the terrorists mucking up the country (including a very clever video piece of U.S. Presidents that the bad guys fired into every home in the country).<br/><br/>I did find the movie lacking in certain areas, causing it to fall short of the original masterpiece that it stems from: <br/><br/>*The villains didn't have the personality that the villains of DIE HARD did. Comparing Tim Olyphant's character to Hans Gruber is laughable, but I think the even the henchmen of LFODHM could have been thought-out more. In the classic DIE HARD all 12 henchmen were very distinguishable... the henchmen in this film were basically HARD GUY WITH GUN #1, HARD GUY WITH GUN #2, etc., Asian GIRL. Give the henchmen just a little personality--it would be so much satisfying when McClane kills them! I remember cheering in the original DIE HARD when certain henchmen were killed... here, not so much. <br/><br/>*The movie played it a little safe with the violence, and even went as far as showing a pilot land safely with his parachute (just like the ol' GI JOE cartoons used to do to erase the possibility of violence). I wanted more of McClane pounding bad guys with his fists. Really the only significant fistfight in this film was vs. a 101-pound girl.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty solid, not outstanding. A lot of nice touches, including some warm moments with McClane and his sidekick character."

","I read the e-controversy of Die Hard IV and it's PG-13 rating, and I was immediately disappointed in the rating. However, I decided that I would be neutral and not judge the movie until after I had seen it.<br/><br/>Trust me, Live Free or Die Hard is amazing.<br/><br/>In a year in which disappointing sequels such as Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are bringing untold pain on massive audiences, Die Hard fans and noobs alike can enjoy John McClane's latest romp.<br/><br/>While all of the other Die Hard movies have had humor, this one is definitely the one I laughed at the most, and the audience laughed a lot as well. When the action simmers down a bit, expect to be entertained even through the other parts, as the characters are so enjoyable.<br/><br/>As expected, the government people and enemies are decidedly stereotypical (Die Hard 1's villain was the exception), but this does not detract from the movie.<br/><br/>The Cyber-Terrorism plot seems a little far-fetched, but it creates a lot of cinematic moments that you will have to see to appreciate.<br/><br/>I realize that I have rambled a little bit, but stick with me a little longer.<br/><br/>The bad: There is some wince-inducing dialog. There are a couple of unbelievable stunts as well for the ""reality-type"" viewer. Finally, while the PG-13 rating does not detract too much, it makes it a little weaker, but hopefully the lower rating will appeal to an audience who has never been introduced to our ""Yippey KiYay"" gun-toting hero."

","I was excited going in to see Live Free or Die Hard. I had to sneak around my house to watch the original two without getting in trouble from my parents (I was 8 at the time). I think I might have been 12 or 13 when with a Vengeance came out, so this was my first Die Hard theater experience. The short review: It is a very good action film, but is a little too generic for a Die Hard film and falls short of the first film. The PG-13 rating isn't terrible, but there are a few times where you can tell lines are dubbed because the words don't match up with the mouths, and some hand to hand fight scenes seem like they are cut a little short.<br/><br/>Overall the film is good but lacks some of the things that made the original so good. While in the original Die Hard we had the great back and forth banter between Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman (as Hans Gruber), and saw McClane's wit, and how he could really get under your skin; in Live Free or Die Hard we get a number of scenes that try to mimic this, but the dialogue just isn't as good. (I.E. compare Die Hard's talk of John Wayne/Roy Rogers and McClane's first yippee ki-yay mfer to LFODH's generic ""McClane you're annoying me"" and ""Yeah, I tend to do that."") Another problem I had was the fact that this film was not confined to one area for McClane to go berserk in. In the first we had a skyscraper, in the second we had an airport, the third NYC, but in this McClane actually jumps back and forth between states! (Albeit he stays in about a hundred mile radius after the action truly starts and the plot unfolds.<br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining movie, Bruce Willis really delivers as his alter ego, although I felt he was a little short on screen time actually. A worthy entry in the Die Hard series, but just a little more generic than the rest."

Killing helicopters and F-35B fighters with cars and trucks is pushing the realms of fantasy a bit too far. The hacking skills of the goodies and the baddies appear also a bit far fetched as is the fact that although most of the leading hackers were being killed off, one of the very best was safely, and quite unnoticed, at his mum's home merrily hacking away.<br/><br/>Yes, in the end an enjoyable action movie, with some of the tricks and jokes of earlier Die Hards, but nothing really special to shout about."

","John McClane does it again. Die hard is full of fast paced action and the comedy you would expect from this movie. The only thing that really bugged me was some of the effects they put in there. Many times during the movie there were guns such as the m-4 or UMP 45 that shot about 100 shots at a time without reloading. Also there is the thing about trained federal agents missing pretty much every single shot with a bunch of henchmen hitting everything they want except of course, John McClane. They also made the impossible happen with the F-35 scene, which didn't really need to be in the movie anyway.

Cause then you'll hear from me that it's a kick ass Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>And one thing I gotta say too, I complained about Len Wiseman many times, but the guy did a good job with the movie I gotta say.<br/><br/>I give it a 7/10, but if I would've seen it without a lot of language getting dubbed over and with the bloodiness that was obviously there but just cut out. I'd give it an 9/10 easy."
