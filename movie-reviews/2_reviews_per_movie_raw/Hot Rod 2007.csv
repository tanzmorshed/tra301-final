","I just saw the first screening ever of Hot Rod at the Los Angeles Film Festival.<br/><br/>As a fan of The Lonely Island, I went into this movie with high expectations. I can happily say that not only were they met but they were exceeded. This is by far the funniest, strangest and most ingenious comedy of the summer. The movie has some of the most random gags ever seen on film. This film is not for everyone: it has no stars and the comedy is very strange. But give it a chance and you will not regret it. The directing and editing of the film is both stylish and fast paced. Andy Samberg is hilarious as always but the supporting cast truly shines, particularly Bill Hader, Will Arnett and Ian McShane. Also look for an INSANELY hilarious cameo from director Akiva Shaffer. If you love the SNL digital shorts this movie is for you. Hot Rod is destined to be a cult comedy classic."

","Few movies in recent cinematic memory have fit into the category of ""Love it or Hate it"" as well as this one. Its humor is so varied, oftentimes so random, that you either find it hysterical, or you think it's stupid. Me? I'm going with the former... I think this movie's completely hilarious.<br/><br/>It possesses a goofy, charming quality, and has a lot of moments that left me laughing while asking my wife, ""what the hell the was that?"" It seems to echo a Family Guy style of humor in that regard. I personally found the characters all pretty likable...the kind of characters you enjoy watching. There was an obvious (and effective) effort to give each character a real personality, quirks and all.<br/><br/>In the end, I suggest you keep an open mind, sit back and enjoy the utter ridiculousness this movie affords you...and I'll bet you find yourself laughing, even if it's in spite of yourself."

","My wife and I saw a screening of Hot Rod. From some the comments posted here I thought we were going to be bored. Nothing could have been further from the truth. This film was really funny! So funny, that I'm wondering if the people who say they hated it actually saw the same film. No, its not fine art, its a summer comedy, and it delivers plenty of laughs. I am middle-aged guy whose not into early Adam Sandler, or Napoleon Dynamite type comedies, and this movie had me laughing hard. Sure, not at every single joke, but at most of them. If you are into absurdest humor, or enjoyed movies like Hot Fuzz, or Super Troopers, you'll find plenty to enjoy. P.S. My wife liked it too."
"boneheads","10","85","121","17 August 2007"," listen to this mother...we all loved this movie!
","Our family consists of a fiftyish dad, a fortyish mom and two teenaged daughters. We all saw this movie during a sneak preview just before it opened, and I (the mom) laughed so hard I could barely breathe sometimes. I had to stop laughing so I could hear what I was missing. One of my daughters said it was a cross between Napoleon Dynamite and Talladega Nights...maybe. It was completely improbable, I mean, who's going to be doing stunts on a moped? But it was so sweet. The characters never over reached who they were or tried too hard. It never felt forced, like so many movies like this do. The best part was when Rod went to his ""Quiet Place"". I saw one summary that said it would have been better with Will Ferrell...I've enjoyed everything Will Ferrell has done lately, but Andy Samberg was perfect for this movie. The ending was pretty predictable, but it was like taking a trip...you knew where you'd end up, but it was so much fun along the way. We definitely loved this movie and recommend it to all our friends (and you!)"
"colin-mcarthur","7","32","43","5 November 2007"," A Triumph Over American Comedy Trends
","I watched Hot Rod for the same reasons i've watched any of the generic American comedies that Hollywood seems to churn out. Because i had nothing better to do, i didn't want to have to think and i expected to be very mildly amused. I was very pleasantly surprised when Hot Rod turned out to have a bit of heart. This movie seems to occupy a middle point between the fairly predictable but fun Blades of Glory and the rather more charming and oddball Napoleon Dynamite. Most recent American comedies seem to function like early Tom Cruise films : Take a vocation and run with it. Blades of Glory had the fairly ridiculous world of figure skating to draw from, and i guess you can't really go wrong with a grown man in lycra on ice skates, but it's humour relied heavily on that. Hot Rod is a film about a (pretty terrible) young stuntman who's objective is to raise enough money to save his dying step-dad by means of a life saving operation. His underlying reason for doing so, however, is because he wants to earn his respect by beating him in a fight. This little quirk and more are what make Hot Rod a little more satisfying than other films in its genre, and, despite some rather obvious jokes and a criminally underused Will Arnett, it's well worth watching."
"brandnewthursday3","10","90","134","6 August 2007"," The Jerk meets Billy Madison
","Andy Samberg is the hero of the internet age. Through SNL digital videos such as Lazy Sunday and Dick in a Box, he has managed to coral a fanbase, score an emmy nod and land his own starring role in a movie. Being that sly, witty and subtle comedy is taking over the box office(The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc)it's safe to say that plain old silly farce is having a hard time reaching the same audience.<br/><br/>Steve Martin made The Jerk a hit, with his genius way of creating a character who was so naive and stupid yet easy to relate to. Samberg is trying to recreate that same character type, but it seems as though audiences aren't having it. Be that as it may, he does it successfully and with such a delightful awkwardness that it may put Martin to shame(no offense Steve).<br/><br/>Although Hot Rod starts off a bit slow, with those watching feeling that it may not come out of its slump, it progresses into a laugh out loud comedy that will have you literally howling. For instance, in one scene, Samberg takes out his frustrations by, as he puts it, ""punch dancing"" in the woods. This is followed by one of the longest and funniest falls in cinema history.<br/><br/>Most critics probably feel that the movie is just youtube videos strewn together, yet they aren't taking it for what it is: A blatant farce on 80s under dog stories. There was not one serious moment in this movie. And that is a good thing. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to laugh their asses off."

","This is by far in my top three best and funniest movies!

","Its been a while that i have come across a comedy movie as light hearted as this one.I think this movie caters to all genres of audience and the best part is that you don't have to drag the movie storyline home and ponder over it.Its got a feel-good attitude to it and has got a simple storyline. I recommend this movie to one and all.. A great release of 2007 !!! The directors done a good job and so have the actors.. haven't heard of them before but if its their debut, then well done ! The soundtrack is a mix of techno and 80s music which again adds a brilliant touch to the movie and they are very situational, which does not happen in most of the comedy movies.."

","I saw a free screening of this in CT. I wasn't sure what to expect at first... but I laughed a lot more in this movie then any comedy to come out in a long time. Expect a bunch of randomness that will make you laugh out loud. The movie is definitely a movie for a certain type of viewer..IE: People who enjoy a ""silly/stupid"" genre of comedies. A very SNL-derived movie. Laughs are frequent,everyone at the cinemas was laughing. A good performance, a Hilarious Andy Samberg and cast, and the beautiful Isla Fisher is always nice to watch. Be prepared to leave the theater knowing your friends will be quoting this movie for a while. I highly recommend this movie to other viewers."

","This film screened in Minneapolis last night (at which they also distributed free T-shirts, pins and fake mustaches) and I have not laughed this hard in a very long time. I laughed so hard it made my stomach hurt, and that hasn't happened to me in a movie in years. <br/><br/>It reminded me very much of Will Ferrell's ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights,"" but even moreso it seems like a throwback to the kind of movies Adam Sandler used to make. There's a lot of ""Billy Madison""-inspired randomness and absurdity that just cracked me up, and the stunts look truly dangerous. <br/><br/>I will not say anymore about this film except I can't wait to see it again when it opens August 3rd and I think Andy Samberg could explode after this film. Not literally, let's hope."

","I'm a ginormous Will Ferrell fan... and the fact that this wasn't advertised as much as a normal Ferrell movie would have been; I had no clue what it was about. Will Ferrell was intended for the main character's part (Rod Kimble) but he then only decided to be executive producer. My friend and I went to watch SuperBad which wasn't even in the theater yet... so we decided to watch Hot Rod. It exceeded my expectations!! I was laughing so hard tears were rolling down my cheeks... It was awesome!! Great fun, comedy filled, stunt movie. I LOVED IT!

","If you're looking for THE ground-breaking cinematic achievement this summer, look no further than this hidden gem. This movie is chalk full of cool beans! It is destined to have a long life as a cult-classic. Sissy Spacek plays an extremely strong woman with unending patience and the emotional strength of Hercules. Don't be surprised if she garners a lot of support come Oscar time.<br/><br/>Our hero is surrounded by a devoted team of friends that double as his stunt crew. In the spirit of Evel Knievel, each stunt is meticulously worked on until perfected. The characters are well developed and the writers and directors go to great lengths to demonstrate the difficulty in being raised by a step-father and winning his respect, especially when your younger, half-brother is of his blood line. The dramatic tension at times got so thick, I constricted into the fetal position and caught fleeting glimpses between my fingers covering my face.<br/><br/>When discussion of great directors comes up, the names like Scorcese, Coppola, and Spielberg are bandied about. Well, it is time add the name Akiva Shaffer to the pantheon of Hollywood Heavyweights. The plot twists keep you guessing, until an ending that I just didn't see coming.<br/><br/>Let me be the first to congratulate Andy Samberg for his ascension to SuperStardom. He is officially a MegaStar.<br/><br/>Honestly, this movie is Napolean dynamite on steroids. My eight-year-old son, my wife, and I loved it. And, I'm not as think as you dumb I am."

","Seriously this is the funniest movie I have seen since ""Wedding Crashers."" The trailers do not do this film justice...in fact, although I am a huge Andy Samberg fan, I did not want to see this movie because the trailers looked utterly ridiculous. But I was proved wrong. This movie is wonderfully random, witty and just an all-around entertaining movie. If you're a fan of Samberg's website with SNL writers, Jorma and Akiva you will totally appreciate the crazy humor.<br/><br/>It has great memorable lines that I'm sure people will be quoting for years to come and laughs non-stop. This is a movie for people with an off-kilter sense of humor. A lot of people in the theater in which I saw the advanced screening made frequent ""This is too weird!"" comments...an yes, the movie is weird. I'd compare to ""Arrested Development"" or maybe even ""Happy Gilmore"" to the extreme. I'd say a lot of people won't get the random humor. But if you like strange things, then you'll love this film for sure!"
"SophieKowalski","Null","20","39","23 July 2007"," Funniest movie in a long time
","I saw Hot Rod a while ago at a screening and I have to say it is the most funny movie ever. This is the way comedy should be. Free, Silly and Funny. The jokes are just fresh and the actors are great. Andy Samberg is great as the leading man but the supporting cast (Bill Hader, Ian Mcshan, Chris Parnell, Jorma Taconne and Will Arnett) also really stand out. Besides from the jokes the action is enjoyable too. I heard people comparing it to Napolion Dinamite but I can't see that. It has his own vibe and is not really comparable with any movie. The style is a bit more rawer than the usual comedy and that makes it original. I highly recommend to go see it if you want a good laugh! If you are a Lonely Island fan you will not be disappointed. It has the same silliness. Nothing but Love for this movie!"

The lonely islands Akiva Schaffer directs while Jorma Taccone and Andy Samberg star, this dream trio completely perfects the movie.

","I've come across many people like the previous reviewer in my time - calling things dumb, brainless, witless, etc. It is because of people like that that beautiful comedies like STELLA were cancelled and others (AESOMETOWN) never even aired. And yet, somehow this comedic style persists. I believe that it is because the humor or not, in fact, brainless, but takes wit to another level by making fun of clichés and reminding us all that at one point in all of our lives, before we were conditioned to laugh only at black & white jokes or reasons why dates never work out, poop was funny! I mean, come on, its disgusting! I think that if certain people were to pull the stick out of their.. behinds, and come off of their high horses, they may find a certain beauty in simplistic humor that makes us think twice about everything else we laugh at.

"shaneo632","6","12","24","27 November 2007"," Dumb fun with rousing performances...
","Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):<br/><br/>Hot Rod, quite simply, is one of the strangest, most offbeat comedies to come our way since Napoleon Dynamite (a film which, I hasten to add, I wasn't terribly fond of upon first viewing). Filled with irreverent gags, and so-called ""random"" interludes of ""humour"", Hot Rod is a curiosity of a comedy.<br/><br/>It becomes clear early on that much of the laughs to be sought in Hot Rod are physical, beginning with an impressive, and surprisingly funny (considering how often it was shown in trailers) instance where our protagonist fails a stunt and pays for it in rather brutal spades.<br/><br/>Whilst I did end up ultimately enjoying Hot Rod somewhat, I must admit that I was incredibly apprehensive that this would just end up as another offbeat screwball comedy that, were you to show even a pinch of contempt for it, you would be lambasted for ""not getting it"" (see: Napoleon Dynamite). Hot Rod didn't grip me right away - whilst the humour was notably different from most of the romps you'll see this year, it really didn't seem to work to begin with. It was almost as though they were trying too hard to deliver a different, edgy brand of laughs. Perhaps this was just the warming up stage for me, as there were parts of this film later on that had me laughing heartily.<br/><br/>The basic premise of Hot Rod is that Rod Kimble (Samberg) is an amateur stuntman, and is suddenly informed that his abusive step-father Frank (McShane) is in dire need of an extortionately expensive heart-transplant. Whilst Kimble and Frank have contempt for one another, Kimble is determined to beat Frank in a fight some day (so as to finally be deemed ""a man""), and so wants to ensure that Frank doesn't die (although surely fighting a man who's had a heart-transplant can't be too healthy either). As such, Kimble hatches a plan to perform a jump over 15 buses in an attempt to raise money for the heart transplant.<br/><br/>Continuing from that point, we have Ian McShane, who by far brings the strongest performance to the table as the bitter, acerbic and down right thoroughly dislikeable step-dad. His first line - ""never sneak up on a man who's been in a chemical fire"" pretty much says all you need to know about him - he's an aggressive madman of the highest order. This character really wouldn't work if it wasn't for the great chemistry between McShane and Samberg - McShane plays a great tease whilst Samberg, conversely, makes a convincing frustrated chump.<br/><br/>From here, we also meet the predictable love interest, in Denise (Fisher). As with McShane, Samberg gels quite well with her, and it makes the emotional cripple that Samberg plays all the more convincing. One notable instance of this is when he tells Denise that she looks pretty, and when she says ""What?"", he nervously returns ""You look shitty!"", much to my laughter. This was a man I could sympathise with.<br/><br/>Soon enough, Will Arnett shows up as Denise's rich, egotistical boyfriend. His character is one giant cliché, but Arnett has fun with the role, and next to McShane, provides the most enjoyable performance of the film. His character is one you can love to hate, and they gave Arnett some of the best lines of the film, such as, after running over a raccoon, proclaiming ""the raccoon wouldn't have stopped for us"", before laughing heartily. This isn't his best work (that honour would be bestowed to Mitch Hurwitz' brilliant Arrested Development), but it's still a good turn.<br/><br/>The rest of Hot Rod is essentially a dense collection of wild set pieces, from impromptu dance numbers and money-making montages, to faux poignant interludes, to a curious Asian man appearing virtually out of nowhere. More often than not, they all end with our protagonist being injured in some way, be it falling down an extremely long hill, flying through some sort of building, or being hit by a car. I felt that the dance number came a little too early in the film to really inspire much of anything, but the ridiculously violent ending to this and other skits were surprisingly funny. I still attest that physical humour (particularly that which is in this film) is a lower form of wit, but with a film like Hot Rod, I took my victories where I could find them, and these just happened to be the continual violent torture of our protagonist. It is worth noting, though, that these moments get very, very close to becoming tiresome by the film's end, and by the time the ""cool beans"" montage comes around (by which the characters utter these two words over and over until they lose all meaning), I was close to holding my head in my hands. Furthermore, gag-wise, an entire exchange regarding the pronunciation of ""wh"" seemed to have been poached from a Family Guy episode, much to my dismay.<br/><br/>There is the occasional injection of superficial emotion into the film, where our protagonist experiences a number of ups and downs, and ultimately begins to doubt himself. This almost appears to be a turning point in the film, and just as the viewer may be able to feel something for this character, he's hit by a van. I'm not complaining about it, mind, just noting that the instances of emotion are generally just padding for the comedy.<br/><br/>Everything eventually sets up nicely for the finale, and we have further ups and downs, and ultimately the film ends exactly as you'd expect. Yes, Hot Rod is very predictable, but that didn't stop it being an entertaining ride, with some great performances from Arnett and McShane, and some hit and miss humour, but when it hit, it hit hard. It won't be the best comedy you'll see this year, but it's dumb fun and I'm sure that's what the creators were going for."
"PoisonKeyblade","8","11","22","3 August 2007"," Hilarious Comedy that is Consistently Funny
","There are so many ways to make a good comedy with some substance, so why does Hollywood fail so many times? From Napoleon Dynamite to Evan Almighty to Delta Farce, it is quite clear that some recent comedies are lacking in not just one category, but virtually every category. And then a movie like Hot Rod comes along. It is not one of those kinds of movies. It is not one of those fake, manufactured, lesson-teaching comedies. Hot Rod is genuinely funny throughout its entire runtime, and it might have even had more laugh-out-loud moments than The Simpsons Movie. The very first thing that needs to be stated, however, is that Hot Rod is the most random movie of the entire year, and it might be the most random movie of all time. Hot Rod has a very awesome cast; Andy Samberg from SNL plays the lead role, the gorgeous Isla Fisher from Wedding Crashers plays Rod's love interest, and the amazing Will Arnett plays the stereotypical vile boyfriend.<br/><br/>His whole life, Rod Kimble has wanted only one thing his entire lifeokay, well maybe two things; to become a stuntman, just like his father and to defeat his stepfather in battle. When Rod's stepfather becomes ill, Rod devises the ultimate stunt and a plan to raise money for his stepfather's surgery. Meanwhile, his crush Denise is back in town, but she has a boyfriend of her own. Rod sets out, with the help of his friends, to earn the money for his stepfather's surgery and win over Denise.<br/><br/>The plot is really nonsensical, and the movie is stupid, but what was anyone expecting? Being stupid is what made this movie funny, and it is stupid on purpose. For once, a stupid comedy actually delivered what it promised, unlike the extremely disappointing Napoleon Dynamite, a film that still holds its rightful place as number one on my list of the worst movies of all time. The script is written so well that all of the characters are easy to fall in love with. Rod is that innocent underdog who truly believes that he can accomplish something great, and Samberg brings great life to the character. The humor never falls flat, and most of the jokes are just hysterical. There are so many gags, memorable scenes, and random moments that anyone who sees this film won't be forgetting it anytime soon. From its hilarious opening scene to its strangely random and satisfying conclusion, Hot Rod never loses a bit of steam and manages to be a very consistent comedy. The cast is perfect, from Sissy Spacek to Will Arnett, and the directing and writing are pure gold.<br/><br/>Hot Rod is a movie that I definitely look forward to seeing again. It had so many great one-liners and completely hilarious random moments that it's hard to NOT love this film. Sure, the plot is barely coherent, but that is the point. Unlike Napoleon Dynamite, however, Hot Rod actually had a satisfying conclusion and, most importantly, it was actually funny. Whatever you do, don't miss one of the best comedies of the summer! 8/10"

"ironhorse_iv","6","6","11","22 January 2014"," I dare you not to like this movie! Hot Rod is indeed funny!
","While, this movie isn't a Saturday Night Life skit turn into a movie. It's feels like one that works. Hot Rod is a sports comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer, written by Pam Brady along with Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, who were uncredited. Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg) is a man-child daredevil stunt man, who is aspire to follow in his father's footsteps and become a famous stuntman himself. Meanwhile, his stepfather Frank (Ian McShane) fails to respect Rod as a man, often going out of his way to beat him in sparring sessions and mocking his stuntman dream, but when Frank is in urgent need of a heart transplant. Rod find the strength and courage to win his heart, by raising the money by doing a jump over the length of fifteen school buses, and give the proceeds to his stepfather's surgery. The movie's jokes, both physical slapstick action humor & dialogue humor, at less for me, hit me like the hard ground after a fail stunt. It really broke my funny bone. It's weird that Rod, despite the many accidents he's involved in he never receives any long lasting injuries. Great use of a brick joke. Brick jokes are a joke that introduce in the beginning of a film that have no punch line, until late in the film. A good example of this is the Taco VS a Grill Cheese fight. Great use of retro humor, but it is 2007 when it was film, not 1980s here. So, some of the jokes, the audience might not get. Still, there is a lot of Youtube type jokes that younger audience might find interesting. I have to say, while some of the jokes seem old, stolen, or recycled. Hot Rod gives a new spin to it. A good example is the dancing out of rage, sequence which is loosely based on the movie Footloose. While other comedies like TV show's Family Guy spoof it already, this version end up being a lot funnier, because you don't what happen next, coming. Another joke, people think Family Guy or Hot Rod stole is the mispronouncing of words gag. According to the producers, this was inspired by a skit on Gang Starr's album Moment of Truth. I wouldn't say it was stolen as revamped. It seems like the humor, here is updated and adapted well to the surrounds. It knows that the movie is supposed to dumb, and they over top it everything to the extreme. It's aim for those with high toleration for idiocy humor. It goes without saying, that this isn't a sophisticated comedy movie, but somehow, it works as being funny to me. Andy Samberg works both in the charm of the man-child character, and making up new jokes at the spot. I can't see, the original actor, it was written for, Will Ferrell in this type of a role. Already, at the time, he seems a little bit too old to be playing this type of a character. The supporting cast is just as easily as funny as Andy Samberg. All his friends Rico (Danny McBride), Dave (Bill Hader) and his half-brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone) gives out some really funny scenes of their own. Even side characters like AM radio station host Barry Pasternak (Chris Parnell) and boyfriend of Rod's love interest, Jonathan (Will Arnett) nearly steals the movie from Rod. Will Arnett plays such an over the top over the top, jerk off guy, that it's serves a continuing inside gag of over acting. Indeed, he was more evil, than Evel Kenevel. Adding Denise (Isla Fisher) to the mix is great as Isla gives some really need, beauty to the group, even if she seems like a not- realist girl character in real life. It's still kinda weird to see, such serious actors like Sissy Spacek, and Ian McShane playing minor characters in here. They really get lost in the film as they don't bring that much humor to the mix. At less, Sissy's character, doesn't. I hardly remember, Sissy at all in the film. The music is great, and well-use in the film. I love Swedish rock band Europe. The band called Gown that plays at Rod's final jump is actually Queens of the Stone Age if you wondering. The best use of music for me, is 'You're the Voice"" by John Farnam in the town scene. That scene alone, got me laughing my head off! Now, to the faults of the film. One thing, I wish wasn't there was the potty humor. It wasn't because it was gross, it's the fact that it wasn't funny. That whole tai chi Chekhov's Skill poop joke is stupid. The whole Acid trip scenes weren't that great. The whole scene with Rico going crazy on a guy was just pointless. Pointless violence play off like that as humor isn't my cup of tea. For a PG-13 film, there was a lot of raunchy jokes that clearly the movie got away with. Sexual dialogue is present, but it's nothing too explicit. There is very mild language in the film, and few crude humor. Overall: While the movie was a bomb at the box office, in the years following, it has gather up a number of cult fans due to its off-beat humor. If you go into this movie with an open mind, you should enjoy the heck out of it. It's really hard not to like this film."
"editor-299","6","8","17","31 July 2007"," 'Hot Rod': Stupid, silly, cheap and hilarious
","This silly, pointless and almost plot less production  sort of a cross between ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and an episode of ""Super Dave Osborn"" (despite the ultra cheap production values and ham-fisted acting)  is nonetheless one of the funniest films of the summer.<br/><br/>Story basically has self-proclaimed stuntman, Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg, ""Saturday Night Live"") attempting to better Evil Kenevil by jumping over 15 school buses. He is doing this to raise $50,000 for a heart transplant operation for his violent stepfather, Frank Powell (Ian McShane, ""Lovejoy,"" ""Deadwood"").<br/><br/>This would be all well and good, however, if Rod were a legitimate daredevil. Instead, he can only afford a moped while his other jumps (over a mail truck and a local swimming pool) end in complete failure. It seems he was led to believe his real father was a real stuntman who died while testing a jump for Kenevil.<br/><br/>It turns out, though, that his dad choked to death on a piece of pie. Thus the movie's silliness is established.<br/><br/>As in all films like this  which blend lowbrow comedy with the raw isolation and humiliation of its protagonist  a group of goof-ball buddies revolves about for any number of reasons.<br/><br/>In ""Hot Rod,"" the doofus friends include the quasi-gay stepbrother, Kevin Powell (Sandberg's high school bud, Jorme Taconne); the semi-retarded Dave (Bill Hader, ""Superbad""); and the psychotic Rico (Danny McBride, ""The Heartbreak Kid"").<br/><br/>There's also an unrealistic love interest, Denise (Ilsa Fisher, ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""The Lookout""), who leaves her rich, handsome, successful, jerk of a boyfriend, Jonathan (Will Arnett, ""Blades of Glory,"" ""Grindhouse""), for the shaggy-haired nerd.<br/><br/>This, of course, only happens in ""reel"" life. In real life, girls stay with guys like Jonathan forever and losers like Rod end up eating alone at Denny's at 2 a.m.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, despite his attempts to earn money and save his step-dad's life, Rod is constantly berated and beaten up by McShane (who gives a hilarious, deadpan comic performance), while his mother, Marie (Oscar winner Sissy Spacek, ""Coal Miner's Daughter"")  a bizarro twist on June Cleaver  makes token efforts to stop the abuse.<br/><br/>Rod wears ridiculous 1980s retro clothes, sports a tacky fake mustache and listens to songs from the hair band Europe (""Carrie,"" ""The Final Countdown""); he is also dopey and lovable, representing all of use poor saps who can never reach even our most attainable goals.<br/><br/>As Rod goes through various efforts to raise funds (he performs ""stunts"" for local birthday parties and corporate functions, rents himself out as a piñata and produces an ill-fated documentary on his training techniques), he finds himself woefully short (about $50,000) of his goal.<br/><br/>That is until he convinces a local AM radio station, run by the delusional Barry Pasternak (""SNL""'s Chris Parnell) of the worthiness and stupidity of the endeavor.<br/><br/>With laughs coming from the lowest common denominator and silly pratfall gags, Hot Rod delivers the goods. This isn't Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder, but it's funny in its own stupid, pathetic way.<br/><br/>And after a summer of sex, violence and explosions, that's not half bad at all."
"Def_Man","6","10","23","26 July 2007"," Pure Slapstick Fun in a Time of Thinkers
","I am a huge fan of comedies. In recent years (with few exceptions) the comedies I have seen have been highly intellectual. Sure, they're witty and have a complex plot and I love them, but still... I am an avid supporter of slapstick: a genre I felt to have slowly shriveled to death in recent years from those witty comedies (and bad slapstick in general i.e. Jack Black). It seemed like everything was making you think about the joke before you laughed. Sure, I love it... but I wanted good slapstick. And then, I got to go to a preview for Hot Rod starring Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live. Now, I have faded away from SNL in recent years... but that didn't stop me from seeing this. It was free and in convenient walking distance. Yes, this comedy does not make you think... but very few slapstick ones do. But what it makes you do if you do it right... is just enjoy yourself. Samberg may in fact be the next king of slapstick as long as he doesn't get typecast. He pretty much controls the screen by crashing into everything and spouting lines with nervous perfection. You could actually feel for him throughout the movie... a feeling that may have seemed odd with original choice: Will Ferrell (who is good, but kind of boisterous for this role) I was relieved to see the return of slapstick to it's glory. This is more of a tribute than an insult as they make every move their own with every stitch worth a laugh. I definitely recommend this people who will take it for what it is: pure slapstick enjoyment."

","I got up and walked out. And I saw it on an airplane. OK, I didn't literally walk out, but I unplugged the head phones and stopped watching. Sitting in total boredom during the flight was preferable to this feeble attempt at a film. I had just seen the predictably asinine romantic comedy ""License to Wed"" on a flight the week before and thought that it couldn't get any worse than that. It most certainly did with ""Hot Rod"". Amateurish best describes the film. It looks like what a film might look like if a group of high school kids got together and made a movie. I stopped watching after about 30 minutes and there was nothing even remotely humorous in that time. Based on the silence on the plane and comments from the few who actually listened to the entire film, nobody else on the flight found anything amusing either. The rave reviews found here for a film so obviously flawed and deficient are extremely suspicious. I suspect many of the reviewers are the same person, likely involved in the film. Check the reviewers history and see how many have never written another review for the answer. The rest are mind dead teens who think ""Snakes on a Plane"" was a great film."

"TOMNEL","1","13","38","20 August 2007"," I don't see how this qualifies as a movie!
","""Hot Rod"" is a very strange film. At first it feels like a comedy about a nerd who tries to be a stunt man. But then you realize that this is like a spoof movie, in that nothing makes sense and fast paced gags that would actually kill or injure a person, now are just there to make sure the audience isn't bored. And along with that, many jokes come out of nowhere and make no sense as to why they're even in the film, along with really obscure scenes that are just simply there to make you laugh, serving no purpose. The plot of this film was very basic, and could've been more funny if the movie was trimmed down by cutting the stupid jokes and putting more character background, or development. In the movie, Rod is a wannabe stunt guy who is trying to take after his dead father stuntman. His step-dad shows him no respect, and is dying of a heart ailment. In order to keep his step-dad alive long enough to beat him up, he needs to raise 50,000 bucks. Can he do it?.....who cares. The characters are too dumb and strange to be likable, and every joke, except for one very odd scene featuring ""cool beans"", was taken from other movies. Even the ending of the film seems oddly familiar, similar to a certain 2004 film that was much better. In the end, this got a couple genuine laughs, a few laughs with the audience and a blank stare for the other 90 minutes.<br/><br/>My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for language and sexual humor."

No one raises 50,000 bucks to get their step dad a new heart. Just to try and beat them in a fight. Doesn't happen. This movie is terrible, nothing funny about it. I set in the theater for the entire movie and didn't laugh once. The only sound was probably a mumble under my breath as to how someone could actually pay money to make this. Stunts were horrible everyone was horrible. I was very surprised to see ""Carrie"" playing Rods mother. How she lowered herself to this is beyond me.

Man, what a massive disappointment. Andy Samberg just doesn't have the charisma or the talent to carry a movie. He's just annoying, boring and unlikable. The lines weren't delivered well and often the scenes were really drawn out (cool beans anyone?). The over the top laughing wasn't that great either. Most of the time it relies on physical comedy (Samberg failing a stunt) which is too obvious and unfunny. Then there's a lot of stuff which is just way out there, maybe they were some inside jokes between the production crew? I don't know. The film just tries too hard to be absurd and moronic to be funny. Also, what's up with that Asian guy humping the air? There were too many scenes where he was doing just that. I'm not sure who finds that funny.<br/><br/>I also don't think there was any chemistry between the actors. I could really see that they were acting and therefore the characters didn't seem real.

It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him, he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a $50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a children's birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump?

Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments (the fall down the hill), no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way. 'Schindler's List' was funnier (and felt shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, a college dropout, or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, in her worst choice of roles.

Sure, there are certain types of humor that just don't do it for me, but I can't imagine this so called humor doing it for anyone. It's just a really bad style that completely falls flat. Even extremely stupid, far-fetched comedies find a way to rope in small amounts of believability in their characters, so the viewer laughs when they do or say something funny. This is just extremely stupid and far- fetched with no believability even when accepted as a stupid comedy. A good friend of mine referred this movie to me. I think I will just take the denial route and pretend I never watched it. Spoiler I did laugh at the part when Rod went tumbling down the hill. Not because Rod went tumbling down the hill, or the scene that led into it, but the visuals of him tumbling were well done. That's really the only way this movie is capable of producing a chuckle or laugh.

","When viewing a movie as silly as 'Hot Rod,' one must sit back, relax, and alter one's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is, in this case, a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy. With a brief runtime of 88 minutes, this film was long past drawn-out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and weren't even funny in the first place. 'Hot Rod''s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004's cult hit 'Napoleon Dynamite,' though it's much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter. In fact, the movie's blatant desperation to be compared to 'Napoleon Dynamite' is scornful and offensive, and left me ticked off, instead of just being annoyed.<br/><br/>The movie, if one were compelled enough to call it such, poses a paltry story that puts self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us, with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses (one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped, so we're told by Rod) and raising $50,000 dollars for his stepfather's impending life-saving heart operation; all so that he can fight his stepfather, once recovered, and gain his respect because in order to gain one's respect, one must first fight them. Huh? Whatever. Each character is no more interesting than Rod's stick-on mustache, and from the film's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion, each scene played like a nonsensical, and terribly unfunny, SNL skit  which, with the addition of an extra 85 minutes, is, essentially, what 'Hot Rod' strives to be.<br/><br/>The film's star, Andy Samberg, contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip-drop of his comedic capabilities. Unfortunately  rather, realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five-year-old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee-pee gags. And if that's disappointing, pull a chair, hide your face in your hands, and brace yourself for the real blow: he IS the film's humor! To rescue them of their mortification, I'll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg's co-stars' roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team, director Akiva Schaffer, to his non-existent talent as a director or a comedian. Basically, every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash-course comedy is perfectly portrayed here; and done so arrogantly, as though the film would be funnier that way. Trick yourself into believing that there's even a single laugh in this heap, or treat yourself to another movie  ANY other movie."

","Arguably the saving grace of this misguided imitation of Napoleon Dynamite (itself an empty, contrived series of try-hard sketches) is the presence of the delightful Isla Fisher. Andy Samberg is sadly lacking in any of the attributes needed by a comedian, and top of that list is charm. There are a couple of funny ideas that are not badly directed, and made me laugh, but why make a movie apparently based on YouTube sketches that once again glorifies the tragedy of the American suburbs and their neanderthal inhabitants? Once again we are in a kind of never-never land somewhere between the 1970s and the 1990s where life as it is only portrayed in the movies is parodied by another movie.

This film is pure garbage and one of the worst ""comedy"" films I have seen. Those saying this film is ""so funny/hilarious"" are probably under the age of 20 (possibly majority of teens). I tried watching this film on a positive note and open mind and was truly disappointed. I really don't see what the others who rated this a 10 saw in this film. It was terribly written, has a poor plot/storyline, bad acting and really lame jokes, also jokes that were really annoying and they continued to drag on. The characters were unfunny and unlikeable especially Rod. Also I noticed that the way Adam Samberg acted, he tried way too hard and tried acting like Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite. Adam's acting was horrible and way over the top. The rest of the cast acting wasn't all that great. The film is pretty boring considering its about a stuntman, and its really mostly idiotic and stupidly silly. Also very predictable. So I really wouldn't recommend any one to watch this trash. And for this to be currently rated 6.5 is a massive joke"

The rest of the cast put in likable performances, and the script has some laughs, but it's divided between low brow and clever humor.

The result is that right from the start, there's the understanding that nothing of what will be seen would make sense - and that helps the audience in embracing the ridiculousness, thereby finding the whole script rather funny.

","Although it's not for everybody, there's a significant amount of charm running through this harmlessly juvenile comedy. As he would later prove with ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" Andy Samberg proves to be a charismatic, generous leading man, willing and able to cede the spotlight to his equally talented co-stars, who each manage to have a number of stand-out moments. As a matter of fact, the cast is largely why so much of this movie works: There seems to be a lot of natural rhythm and warmth among the players that it establishes a sense of trust between the movie and its audience.

","The movie ""Hot Rod"" is a great movie for stupid thrill seekers. The movie depicts a 20 something stunt man who loves what he does and would not give it up for anything. He has a crew of his brother, two friends and his childhood crush he is not over yet. His stunts do not end up well but they do make for great laughs. That's why this movie is a funny action packed movie that you should go see. He gains popularity amongst his town when his step father needs a heart transplant and he decides to raise money for ""one big jump"". He goes around the town doing birthday parties and stunts to raise money, they all turn out to be total failures but that does not stop Rod from doing everything he can to help his step dad. Although some older people could look at this movie and not see any point in this film but those people don't know true humor. If you really want a good laugh this movie is for you. I have showed this to numerous people and it is all laughs from them. And one of the best parts of this show is that it combines visual comedy and dialogue to form amazing jokes and failures of the team. Andy Samberg portrays Rod Kimble and is genius in acting out his character, all in all the actors really work together. Some people might think that this was a pointless movie because of the stupidity but if you truly appreciate comedy then this is the movie for you. I would give this movie a solid 4 out of 5 stars."

","With a pal about to go and study business at a university,I asked if there was any kind of movie that she was keen on seeing,and got told that she was keen in watching a ""Zany Comedy."" Looking at lists of Comedy movies from the 2000's,I stumbled on a delightful looking Comedy which has somehow completely passed me by,which led to me jumping on the hot rod.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Lovingly holding onto the photo his late dad took with Evel Knievel, Rod Kimble dreams of following all the tales that his mum tells him about dad,and become a legendary stuntman.Whilst he has big dreams,Kimble suffers one major problem:he is accident prone.Making sure that he is aware of his flaws,Kimble's step-dad Frank Powell beats him up,and tells Kimble that he will never have the guts to beat him in a fight. Returning home after another ill- fated stunt with his friends Rico,Dave,Denise and his half-brother Kevin,Kimble finds out that Powell needs a heart operation which he can't afford. Wanting to keep Powell alive long enough to beat him in a fight, (what heroic motivation!)Kimble decides to raise funds by becoming the ultimate stunt man.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Washed with a synch score from Yes band member Trevor Rabin and pure Power Pop tracks from Europe,director Akiva Schaffer & cinematographer Andrew Dunn soak the title in an 80's atmosphere, glistening as the sun sets down on Kimble's failed stunts, and lighting each of Kimble's failed set-pieces with bright blues,yellows and green that give the flick a wonderful animated appearance. Jammed from driving off via years in development,the screenplay by Pam Brady sets the film ablaze with an amazingly fresh zest,juiced from hilariously off-beat one-liners rolling with sharply cut aggression.<br/><br/>Lining up with the dialogue, Brady rocks Kimble's ambitions with excellent physical Comedy set-pieces,driven from Kimble's near- deadly mishaps to perform successful stunts,and a burning rage to put the old man in his place.Knocking Kimble down with every shot, Ian McShane gives a great barking mad performance as Powell,whilst Bill Hader, Danny McBride and a cute Isla Fisher give energetic turns in pushing Kimble on.Smashing into every wall put in front of him, Andy Samberg gives an excellent performance as Kimble,thanks to Samberg giving Kimble a cape of ow-shucks 80's sense of adventure with a very funny, unhinged anger,as Kimble rides off on the hot rod."

Will Ferrell was suppose to take the lead role of the high-flying, amateur stuntman, instead the task goes to Andy Samberg, who's decent enough, if not a little unimaginative. Alongside on-screen brother Jorman Taccone and friends Bill Hader and Danny McBride, there's fun to be had, but not enough to propel the story. Some moments outdo others, mainly the ones involving the unwell Ian McShane, whom Samberg is trying to raise money for. They fight and they squabble, and Samberg's only doing this good deed so he can finally beat up his step-dad. Hot Rod is mildly funny, somewhat enjoyable, doing little harm in the process."

I wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80's, but with the majority of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass.

","Firstly I want to say that I'm a fan of the Lonely Island, these guys' website. I've seen a lot of their videos and I really like their humor. And their stuff on SNL is great. Having read a few reviews, I can't say I had high hopes for Hot Rod, but clung to the chance it would be good. Nonetheless, I was incredibly disappointed. It was, as the Lonely Island guys would say, not-Kablamo.<br/><br/>Hot Rod never quite found it's feet, switching tone every couple of minutes. They would set up sentimental moments and then undercut them with a joke, which is often great comedy, but these jokes always fell flat, so the reversals never worked, nor did the sentimentality, missing the opportunity to make the audience feel something or laugh, a double strike-out. At times it seemed like a Napoleon Dynamite rip-off - the dance sequence, the non-jump over the curb, a guy named ""Rico"". I'm surprised there wasn't a llama that Rod had to jump over.<br/><br/>I truly felt sorry for the lead girl, Isla, if you could call it a lead. She had no jokes, no character, no depth. The love story wasn't there. No one cared. She was infinitely more utilized in Wedding Crashers in a smaller role. Andy Samberg was a little scattered. To make a movie like this work, you need someone like Will Ferrell, who makes you laugh at every scene and puts so much conviction into the role. I couldn't tell if Samberg had a lack of conviction or was just an actor struggling with continuity in his character. Granted, there wasn't a character formed through the writing, an added challenge. Honestly, I think what it is is he's good on the SNL sketches and Lonely Island sketches, but can't carry a movie. I'd be interested to see what happens with him in a good script.<br/><br/>In the best of my estimation, here's what I think happened: you take three kids who are amazing at short format sketches, you hand them a script, they chop it into short sketches that they think are funny, the story is sacrificed, and the audience gets 90 minutes of an unrefined collage.<br/><br/>The theater I sat in had 10 people who groaned through some parts, laughed at a few, and mainly sat in silence. I wanted to like it so badly. I think these guys are talented. Perhaps movies are not their right medium. I'd give them another shot. But land the jump next time."

Could have been a good comedy, and the actors would have had it in them, too. Unfortunately, good actors, the Eighties (or was it the late Seventies?) and a funny premise alone don't make it a comedy. The main problem here is predictability. You can watch the first and final ten minutes of the movie and draw the lines. And the dialogue is equally predictable."

","Well I liked the flow of this movie and I think Andy Samberg is a funny guy, but the thing is this movie just isn't funny and most of the humor comes from acting awkward and trying act retarded as possible. Maybe this wasn't my type of comedy, cause I didn't laugh a single time, maybe a little chuckle than and there but that was about it. I actually really tried to enjoy this movie, but was left disappointed. Just about some guy than wants to be a dare devil who is a grown man but acts like a 6 yr old and most of the humor comes from the fact that he acts like a 6 yr old.

"dunmore_ego","2","4","12","22 November 2008"," Snot Rod
","Here's one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell wouldn't be in it.<br/><br/>There are two laughs in HOT ROD.<br/><br/>1. The Punch-Dance. Rod ""needs to go to his quiet place"" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of Europe.<br/><br/>2. John Farnham's You're The Voice. In one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A major Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it leveled mountains in Switzerland.<br/><br/>Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit.<br/><br/>Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, someone actually thought that was funny.<br/><br/>Without one jump under his starry belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever... who watches these movies for plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), he scores a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser.<br/><br/>Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must've lost a bet to be here."

Isla Fisher who take the beautiful/funny combo to a new level is, in my opinion, miscast as I don't think this role really let her be a truly funny as she can be. There are some really funny lines (Why do you call yourself Voltron?) but the stunts are bad to the point of being utterly ridiculous and too contrived. The physical humor could have been more ""almost credible"" instead of completely inconceivable to make them have more comic impact.<br/><br/>If the movie is on cable, it's worth a watch.

Apart from a few exceptions they used several songs from the eighties that certainly will trigger some happy memories to some! These songs aren't simply background music! They do illustrate what the main character is going through! But the main reason is the extremely likable main character Rod portrayed by Andy Samberg!

","So I'm with my friends right, and they say they want to watch Hot Rod. I was pleased because I ""thought"" this movie was going to be sick. Although, from beginning to end, Hot Rod was a huge failure. In my opinion, the writer Brady really let down the crowd. Maybe not so much the writing but the lead character wasn't realistic and meaningful. Sandberg acted as if he was ""acting"" and not in the movie. In your next feature film, try method acting, play your role outside of your role. Although Brady is such a good writer with early South Park episodes and with Team America. This movie Hot Rod was just another one of those dumb comedies but really didn't reach it's potential. I'm sad to say, but Sandberd didn't fit the character because the writing for his acted personality wasn't enjoyable at all."

"jkennedy-4","9","2","5","18 November 2007"," Best Comedy this year!
","It's not very often i feel compelled to document my opinion on anything i watch,read or listen to,but Hot Rod is an exception to the rule. This movie was a hoot from start to finish.... With movie newcomer Andy Samberg at the helm this film is a roaring success. The film has a great foundation and story from the quirky relationship between brothers Rod(Samberg) and Kevin to the highly amusing love/hate relationship between Rod and step dad Frank(Ian Mcshane)and then there's Rod's crazy buddies! . The film basically follows the pursuit of Rod's 2-bit Stuntman career trying to follow in his belated real father's foot steps. I won't elaborate on the story too much but the journey involved is highly amusing,engrossing and emotional. All of the cast put in a solid performance with Samberg & McShane steeling the show. The pace and quality of content barely dips through out. Although a lot of this film has a familiar layout to other comedy's such as Billy Madison and Nacho Libre and has the usual clichés such as Rod competing with a rich, highly successful jerk for Denise's hand, the film still manages to offer something different, a new energy a unique blend of humour and the strange. For me it had echoes of Ghost World, Nacho Libre, Freddy got fingered amongst others. With a great sense of the 80's present from the soundtrack(Europe,John Farnham) to the attire, it's wonderful personality and side splitting humour i urge everyone to give this Film a chance you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Samberg the new Sandler?"
"dbborroughs","6","2","5","14 October 2007"," Amusing tale could have been great shorter or with a more daring director
","Rod fancies himself a stunt man in the Evel Knievel mode. He also has a stepfather who doesn't really respect him because he doesn't fight (the step-dad) well. When the stepfather needs a heart operation Rod comes up with plan to raise the money so that he can get him well and then beat him up.<br/><br/>Amusing film from an SNL alum that either needed to be about an hour long or directed by a more daring director willing to make it something more original. Its an amusing movie that has couple of big laughs, several smaller ones, and a charm that some how keeps it a float. Ian McShane as the stepfather is a hoot and the rest of the cast is pleasant. The problem with the film is simply that it never reaches very far past the premise nor does it strive to be anything more than run of the mill. This is a film that has a plot you can pretty much guess once its set in motion and characters, that while amusing, were all taken off the busiest shelf in the cliché store. That would be fine for a movie we see on cable, but you're asking us to plunk down ten bucks to sit in a theater and watch something that, while amusing isn't original enough to be worth the cash outlay. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie and it made me laugh but had I paid big bucks to take my family to see this I'd be very angry.<br/><br/>Worth a look on cable or as a rental (it will amuse you), just don't pay ten bucks a head for this."

","Andy Sandberg and friends are just not ready to make a feature. It's a problem here, because they don't quite understand what it takes to make a movie. It's also obvious in their interviews. The movie had so much potential, but the humor was all over the place. It didn't know if it was a farce, a spoof, and slapstick romp, etc. Further, the characters all sounded a lot a like, as there are few, if any ""voices"" in the dialogue. You could interchange just about anyone's dialogue, and nobody would notice. This comes from bad writing and actors who don't know how to make a part their own.<br/><br/>These guys needed a few more years on SNL first, and it's a shame that they may not get another chance in the future, since this movie will lose money (due to an over-sized budget). And the weird thing is that they could have made it for $2 million, and everyone would be saying something different then. it would be profitable, but also, they would have been forced to make choices, instead of just ""doing whatever they wanted"" which in this business, is a recipe for disaster..."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","2","6","7 September 2012"," In spite of its talents, the comedic tone of ""Hot Rod"" is all over the place
","Andy Samberg is a funny guy, but if he wants to be a funny guy who makes movies, he'll need to figure out exactly what kind of funny he wants to be. <br/><br/>""Hot Rod"" is a mess of comedic styles, and though that falls a lot on writer Pam Brady, who has written many ""South Park"" episodes among other solid gigs, Samberg doesn't quite pull Rod Kimble together into a cohesive character.<br/><br/>The movie has its moments to be sure, but ""Hot Rod"" mixes together Adam Sandler humor and Will Ferrell/""Anchorman"" humor into a neo-'80s movie parody. If director Akiva Schaffer tried to blend all this into its own tone, it didn't work. Every other scene feels as though its attempting to win laughs by another set of means.<br/><br/>At its core ""Hot Rod"" is a Saturday Night Live movie as it was produced by Lorne Michaels and the members of the Lonely Island group behind the show's popular digital shorts all have their hands on it: Samberg as the star, Schaffer the director and Jorma Taccone in a supporting role as Rod's half brother Kevin. Bill Hader, Chris Parnell and Will Arnett also have roles. Danny McBride is the lone black sheep as he has his own comedy nucleus.<br/><br/>Samberg's Rod is a stuntman, which you could say about his hobbies or his maturity. Of the two stunts we see him attempt early in the film, he fails both, but that's neither here nor there. At home, he wrestles literally and figuratively with his stepfather, Frank (Ian McShane), desperate for his approval having lost his father in a stunt accident when he was little. When Frank takes a turn for the worse, Rod vows to jump 15 school buses to raise enough money for Frank's heart transplant.<br/><br/>Rod rallies his stunt team, which includes Taccone, McBride and Hader, plus he recruits the girl next door (literally) who he hasn't seen since high school (Isla Fisher). Together they do all manner of strange things to both train and raise money.<br/><br/>It's tough to capture the wide range of ways this film fishes for laughs. The most hilarious scene involves one of the film's many '80s montages, in which Rod goes to blow off some steam by doing all kinds of gymnastics stuff in the woods but suddenly finds himself tumbling down a mountainside. That unpredictability serves the film well, but it doesn't stick close enough to the '80s stuff throughout to warrant being called a true '80s parody.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes are formulaic, but the humor is and isn't. When it goes for physical humor and gags you can see it coming, but when it goes for witty deadpan, it catches you off guard. Calling the jokes hit or miss would not be a generalization for this movie.<br/><br/>Rod falls victim to the scattershot approach as well. At one moment he's sympathetic, in another he's so needlessly angry at his stepfather; at one moment he's shy and socially awkward, in another he's brazen and foolish. Just when you think you know the guy, you don't, and treating a main character that way guarantees complete audience apathy, which is what happens in ""Hot Rod.""<br/><br/>If someone stepped into this project with the voice of reason to say let's go for this one specific overall tone, ""Hot Rod"" could've developed into a memorable comedy considering the talent involved. Instead it's a comedic style variety show packed into a single focused story arc. As such, this is one comedic stunt that doesn't quite get pulled off.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"elshikh4","8","2","6","6 May 2011"," Finally.. A Different Comedy !
","OK, comedy is comedy. Meaning laughs. But humans are different. So comedy had to be as well. However, in the last years, the American mainstream comedies aren't. They are all about teen gross-out sex comedies, romantic - not too variant - comedies, the family, mostly horrible, comedies, the lately always-awful parodies, and the buddy comedies which is the best kind, or at least the more merciful. And there is no black comedies, unless we're talking about that status quo!<br/><br/>Thus, with the continuity of this production, nothing became different. Or maybe the different viewer, who got board of all of the above, came to a point where he finds nothing attractive, or unique. Simply, the molds have frozen, so the viewer's ambition. But this time, in Hot Rod, being different was the goods, and being hot wasn't in the title only.<br/><br/>It's a story of some underachievers, and their disordered journey to achieve. The thing is they could be teen, but their comedy isn't gross. It could be about the family love, yet in the most extraordinary ways. And it could be a parody, yet not out of movies or TV shows, just the decade of the 1980s.<br/><br/>Well, it isn't all un-formulaic, but maybe huge part of its comedy is. It handles the matters really creative, with so right sense of humor. The examples are many, and beautiful; how a reconciliation between 2 brothers turns into rap song-like, a familiar scene of gathering the team; walking challenging whatever, turns into a public riot.. etc.<br/><br/>Then ironies that can't be more ironic; The sick stepfather is like the evil guy. The big event at the climax, with the motorcycle's jump, is sponsored and transmitted by ""Radio"" station; this is wild and smart idea (it spoofs a matter that had always bewildered me; which is broadcasting footballs matches in the radio!). The rational owner of the station is anything but rational. His station, which he tries to make successful, broadcasts antique songs.<br/><br/>There is a funny and lovely nostalgia to the 1980s. Funny in terms of using the old customs, or using the Magnum's so macho mustache. And lovely in terms of using a rallied soundtrack of some of the 1980s most enthusiastic, largely rock, songs. It makes you think that the 1980s was the time of singing for hunting the dream, and fulfilling the hardest!<br/><br/>The method of acting relied on being serious while doing, and saying, entirely nonsense. That won 2 results. Firstly, it produced laughs, without turning the cast into buffoons. Secondly, it deepened the honesty of the story, giving those farcical characters a spirit of credibility, and true feel of sympathy; to be a movie about determined achievers-wanna be, not only a comedy that poke fun of them.<br/><br/>So it shows known-by-heart story by going off the known-by-heart roads, making its own special personality, to work comically, and a bit seriously too; noticing that the end isn't so happy, with the lead winning due to his try not his striking success, while not resorting to cheap and easy tricks. I know well movies that assumed themselves comic by using the F word heavily, or dealing with: farts, feces, urine, and semen.. Nothing else!<br/><br/>Save couple of lines that I didn't like, I enjoyed Hot Rod. It's where you laugh at something, then admire the novelty, and the ingenuity, of it. It managed to be another type of comedy; creative, unpredictable, hence rare. The ones who made it proved how wonderfully different they were. All of that allow one question to leap in my head: Why this didn't have a proper publicity?!"

I however loved it and the acting is fine as far as acting goes in comedy.<br/><br/>The movie made me laugh on several occasions, which I can't say about a lot of (comedy) movies.

I was horribly mistaken. Last time I made a mistake worse than that I was in line at the medical ward to get a strange rash checked(just kidding, but seriously huge mistake).<br/><br/>Honestly, Hot Rod may not have had the biggest budget, but it had the biggest heart. And what it did with it's budget turned a movie that could have been crap into gold.<br/><br/>I honestly don't believe that I had to rewind the first 3 minutes of a movie so many times in my entire life. I honestly think I was 10 seconds from having a stroke. I had tears pouring down my face from it's absolute absurdity. You totally see it coming and that's what made it so funny because you wanted to totally see him eat it really bad.<br/><br/>Andy Samberg played such a lovable, jack ass, idiot of a character as Rod Kimble that you seriously couldn't help but love to death. The confrontation between Rod and his father Frank(played hilariously by Deadwood's Ian Mcshane) was a comedic triumph in itself.<br/><br/>The random scenario's throughout the movie reminded me of a more childish and silly version of napoleon dynamite in ways. I honestly believe that Napoleon's dance was defeated by Rod's footloose spoof. The fall that ensued was quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen in a movie, ever. The sheer ridiculous of it made it that much better because you know it could never happen. Once again, GOLD!!! Anyways, the directing was nothing new to any genre, it was just a simple, light-hearted comedy. Nothing special, but in no way bad. The character commentary between each other was hilarious. Whether it was Rod telling everyone they didn't party to telling Isla Fischer that she smelled sh****, it was all just silly fun.<br/><br/>Absolute must see for any fan of Napoleon Dynamite, or anyone in search of something really funny that you can kick back with some friends, watch, and get hammered.<br/><br/>This viewer gives it 10 out of 10 for doing everything it tried to with amazing precision."

Expect good performances from the Lonely Island guys and be prepared to laugh.<br/><br/>To wrap things up, I think anyone who is a fan of offbeat comedy like Napoleon Dynamite, Freddy Got Fingered, or Superbad should give this one a viewing.

Only 1/3 of your family will prolly appreciate it unless of course your family is not uptight and appreciates laughter despites is oddities and perhaps shall I dare to say post-modernism. Its the type of film, like Conan O'Brien, that makes fun of itself and the stunt genre. If you like Andy on SNL, you'll definitely like this film.

It only was able to bring in about $5 million its first weekend, good enough for ninth place at the box office.<br/><br/>The film must not have had very good advertisements or TV spots, because it was definitely worth watching and BUYING a ticket to see. <br/><br/>Very well written comedic styling by the SNL guys, as well as acted by Samberg as Rod Kimble. Especially the scenes between Rod and his step-dad Frank, where they literally beat the crap out of each other. ""I'm gonna get you a heart, so I can kill you.""<br/><br/>A cult-following for the film and DVD sales should help bring the film out of its current flunk. Good enough for a 9 of 10."

","This movie is not perfect. I'll admit it. But back when I was a kid, I loved Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore and movies like that. This movie brings you back to that kind of feeling - the kind of completely absurd and strangely sincere wackiness that Adam Sandler used to do so well. Just like everyone used to criticize Chevy Chase and Bill Murray for going through the motions with each new film, now Sandler and some of his fellow SNL alums seem to be doing the same. It's up to the new gang, the kids who are hungrier to make it.<br/><br/>And make it they do. This movie has a few misses. A couple jokes fall so flat that you almost cringe. But when this movie is funny (and it is) it's really damn funny.<br/><br/>A lot of people will compare it to Napoleon Dynamite, and it is similar, but I felt like instead of being weird for weirdness' sake, this movie is more like a traditional ""Tommy Boy"" style comedy with that weirdness embedded in it.<br/><br/>Check out Kiv and Jorma and Andy's ""Awesometown"" pilot on Youtube and their other Lonely Island shorts. If you like those, this movie just might make you crap your pants. And if nothing else, they'll introduce you to Chester, who has a real star-making turn in this film."

","Hysterical, dumb, random, dark and slapstick comedy that I loved every minute of, but based on some of the reviews here I guess you need a certain sense of humour for. I guess that's the same for comedy movies in general though, it's probably why they normally seem to receive lower overall ratings compared to other genres.<br/><br/>Anyways, from the opening stunt I knew this movie was going to be exactly what I want from a comedy, I had sort of seen/heard a little bit of Lonely Island prior, but I was familiar with Andy Samberg, who is just a generally funny guy in my opinion, he always makes me laugh, but I get the feeling he's reminiscent of a Jim Carrey character, in that you'll either love or hate his comedy style (I love Carrey as well), and like Carrey he has an extremely expressive face that just works well comedically. The whole cast of Hot Rod is amazing, and pretty much all the characters are hilarious in their own way; Bill Hader and Danny McBride were especially funny and gave standout performances, and the infamous ""cool beans"" scene is a huge highlight for me, as well as the ""quiet place"" forest scene. The plot itself is fairly simple, but I thought it was a great concept, different from any other comedies I've seen, something a bit more out there and interesting that still offered the opportunity to explore more than just the slapstick comedy and introduce a bit of romance and drama to the storyline.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is one of the funniest movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching, but like Napoleon Dynamite, it's not for everyone, although I think if you liked Napoleon Dynamite then you probably have the right sort of sense of humour to absolutely love Hot Rod, as I definitely see similarities in some of the deadpan humour. I don't necessarily think older generations will be into this so much, but it had my mum and my sister laughing so it's not just ""guy humour"", although it probably does appeal to the younger male generation (13-35) the most."

","First of all, this movie is one of my favorite comedies and is absolutely hilarious from start to finish.<br/><br/>I just finished a book which has changed the way I view movies and read literature through the eyes of an English professor. This movie was my first victim. <br/><br/>Does Rod Kimble represent a Christ Figure? Absolutely. And here's a list of everything I noticed throughout the film. Rod is in the right age bracket (around 23). He has disciples, 3 and then 4 of them. One of these disciples eventually betrays Rod (half brother) when he makes the film. He performs miracles (sort of...stunts). He runs off into the ""wilderness"" at one point of despair. He is constantly trying to live up to his father. He really has no father (dead dad). His love interest is a red head (Mary Magdalene). In the end he prepares to make the ""ultimate sacrifice"" for his father which ultimately inspires hope in all the crowd. To top that off he actually dies during the final stunt (lying in a spread eagle cross shape) and gets resurrected!! When he beats his dad up at the end he makes him tell us ""you're a man"" in the ultimate statement of is he a god or man.<br/><br/>Did the writer intend this? I dunno. Maybe. Wh cares? But it's there.<br/><br/>Go check it out. You'll never look at the Gospel of Hot Rod the same way again."
"MartinHafer","5","1","2","18 November 2017"," Familiar but not particularly inspiring.
","""Hot Rod"" is a very familiar story, as it's both a reworking of ""Dirty Work"" and is very similar to many of the recent loser does good films. However, it's told in a rather pedestrian manner and lacks the fun of other similar films, such as ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Waterboy"". <br/><br/>The story is a goofy tale about a total loser who manages to somehow achieve a tiny level of success by the end of the film. Andy Samberg is Rod Kimble...a guy who has no job, lives in his parents house and has an obsession with doing stunts....nearly all of which he completely misses achieving. He decides to up his game and do some PAYING stunts in order to afford to give his verbally and physically abusive step- dad a new heart.<br/><br/>There are several problems with the film. The first is that it just isn't written all that well. Despite being a lot like ""Dirty Work"" and the films I mentioned above, it replicates a VERY familiar pattern but in a completely unimpressive and not particularly funny way. I think the reason I was so unimpressed as well is because I thoroughly LOVED Samberg's ""Pop Star"" and know that he's capable of much more given a well written script. Overall, it's a time-passer and nothing more...mostly due to there being little in the characters to like as well as a dearth of humor."
"mistoppi","5","1","2","17 November 2016"," Pretty funny, but hardly worth a second watch
","The only thing I knew about this movie when I rented it was that it has incredible cast. That was the main reason I chose to watch it. It wasn't until later that I realised Akiva Schaffer directed the movie (I read about that like three minutes ago when I actually googled this movie and prepared to write this review). <br/><br/>This movie has amazingly funny dialogue and writing, but also the typical physical stunts, or how the main character fails at them. Hilarious conversation and the bumbling around both work, and there are memorable scenes from both types. Good example of the humorous dialogue is this quote: ""You look pretty."" ""What?"" ""I said you look shitty!""<br/><br/>Hot Rod's structure is typical to almost every comedy or drama that was ever made. But still as Rod is about to do this big stunt, it can go horribly wrong or amazingly well. That's the thing about comedies, they are unpredictable in a way. Only certain thing is that whether it goes wrong or right, it will be hilarious. <br/><br/>I like the 80s aesthetic, but I'm still not entirely sure when the story actually takes place. There are other things I'm not sure about - like how old were the main characters? The way they acted and the stuff they said made it seem like they were teens or maybe early 20's. Of course it's even harder because of teenagers are mostly played by 20-somethings instead of actual teens. And the age thing didn't really bother me until Jonathan, who was played by Will Arnett (6' 2½''), showed up. The character is taller than everyone else and considering he had a real job and all seemed way older than everyone else. That made me think that maybe the main characters weren't as young as I thought, just a little immature.<br/><br/>Hot Rod is a pretty typical comedy. It makes you laugh, so it does its job well, but I don't think I'll be re-watching this any time soon."

It's quite interesting actually. In all actuality, this is probably the most simple, lowest budgeted Lorne Michaels produced film since ""It's Pat"", and yet, I would even go as far as ranking this movie up there with SNL- affiliated classics like ""The Blues Brothers"" & ""Wayne's World"". And there really isn't much to it. The movie is reference after reference, to movies, music, random people, that normally wouldn't be funny, but the comedic delivery here is brilliant! Samberg, truly is a riot, and the supporting cast of Danny McBride, Jorma Taccone, Bill Hader, Will Arnett, Chris Parnell, and the show-stealing Ian Macshane, all make this film worthwhile. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. If you don't like it, well, that's OK, but if you're saying you didn't laugh out loud at a scene(*Slight Spoiler*) where someone falls down a mountain for a good 3 to 5 minutes, than I'm sorry but you need to get your funny bone checked out."
"beflin","8","2","7","31 July 2009"," Extremely funny silly movie, and moving!
","I really really wanted to give this movie a full 10 out of 10. I really wanted to love it more. My main reason for doing so:<br/><br/>The script is a 10 out of 10. Pam Brady did a fantastic job of writing silly one-liners and multi-line gags. I laughed at every one of them. Even stealing a famous gag from Family Guy but using it appropriately doubled the laughs precisely because I knew it was a rip-off of a famous FG gag.<br/><br/>The acting is 10 of 10. Nothing wrong with what any of the actors did.<br/><br/>I thought most of the deleted scenes were very funny too. I applaud the editor for leaving them out, nonetheless, to keep the pace up of the film.<br/><br/>But, for some reason, I felt this movie required some kind of bigger production value. The problem is, I am not sure what. Oddly, the only thing I thought that MIGHT give the movie more bang or splash was changing the casting. This is where it gets embarrassing saying that, even though an actor does their craft perfectly, they still cannot change themselves.<br/><br/>For example, suppose Rod Kimble were played by Will Ferrell, as ""larger-than-life"" a character as Ron Burgundy is. Now, I am not saying Will Ferrell would have been a better choice for this movie for the role of Rod Kimble, but I kept feeling while watching ""Hot Rod"" that it felt like an excellent movie put on by high school students.<br/><br/>Anyway, I do encourage all of you to give this movie a 10 out of 10 if you write a comment on it.<br/><br/>I did not want to detract from the 10 out of 10 for the script, because humor requires intelligence (on the part of the viewer/listener, I mean here). Not one joke or gag in ""Hot Rod"" is racist or sexist or obscene, or makes reference to the absurdity of racism or sexist, for those bothered by other great films such as ""Borat"". Hence, comedy is MUCH harder to write than any serious drama, MOSTLY for this one reason.<br/><br/>For that, I maintain a 10 out of 10, even though I felt the female characters were not given any silly comedic gags or lines, except for the ""tai chi"" scene with Denise. The female characters were a little bit underused.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the ""continued humor during the serious moments"" style of writing: i.e. the character gets serious, but what she/he says is still outrageous and funny to the audience."
"bob the moo","Null","2","7","12 April 2009"," Silly little film that is unassuming fun as long as you don't come with high expectations
","Rod Kimble is an amateur stuntman, whose antics don't inspire the local population so much as they do amuse them. Always setting up stunts with his friends, things change when Rod learns that his step-father needs an organ transplant but has no insurance to allow it. Having never yet beaten his step-father in a fight and keen to humiliate him, Rod is determined to save his step-father's life (even if only long enough to defeat him fair and square). In order to do this he decides to jump 13 school buses in front of a paying crowd.<br/><br/>When this film recently arrived on Sky I must admit that I had never heard of it and didn't give it much attention. A while later I ended up watching it for the lack of anything better (well, that's not true – it was more a matter of looking for ""lazy"" viewing). Having this approach to the film probably helped me enjoy it because my expectations and my demands were low and what I found was a daft little ""sports underdog"" film. Those expecting frequent big belly laughs will be disappointed because the film is not that good. However it wisely sets itself firmly in the small-town loser world that makes it have quit a low-key feel that is matched by the manner of delivery as well (so much of it feels ""homemade"" rather than the big film production that it is of course). This allowed it to win me over a touch because I warm to it a little bit as one would to an indie comedy as opposed to the big star vehicle blockbuster.<br/><br/>This doesn't completely redeem it though and it is never as funny nor as creative as it would like to have though. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty amusing across the whole film but it doesn't hit the high notes very often. The cast help to some degree. Samberg in particular has a sort of gangly charm to him and he is kept grounded by some nice ""going nowhere"" characters from McBride and his other friends. Fisher is asked to be attractive, light and simple and this she does very well, making her aspect of the film work quite well. Of course she is helped by a typically good turn from Arnett – although I would have liked more time given to him. McShane is good in it and I really enjoyed the small turn from Parnell (30 Rock's Dr Spaceman).<br/><br/>Hot Rod is not a great film by any means but it does have its charm. It is slightly derivative and not as funny as it would like to be but it is still consistently amusing and with a genial air that makes it hard to dislike. Best approached with low demands but it performs well enough if you do."

","An overlooked bit of screwball comedy from the members of The Lonely Island and a few of their mid-2000 SNL cohorts. Andy Samberg grabs the lead as the titular Rod, a misguided but confident would-be stuntman whose efforts always climax in a spectacular disaster. Rod is about as one-dimensional as any recurring sketch comedy character, which is to say he's got one note to play and he milks it like a rancher with idle hands. Along for the ride, Bill Hader, Danny McBride (playing, surprise, another version of Kenny Powers), Ian McShane (grievously underused) and a white-hot Isla Fisher, are even narrower. After five minutes you'll know exactly how it's going to play out. This kind of movie isn't usually about character development, though, and as a playground for comedians to wear silly t-shirts and frequently cut away to questionably-related asides, it's suitable enough. Good for a few loud howls, but it lacks consistency, substance and identity. Its greatest sin is taking a decent gag and riding it wayyyy too long, a'la Family Guy's most indulgent moments. In short, it's precisely how the trailer makes it seem: really, really stupid. Points for an excellent butt rock / hair metal soundtrack, though."

","Will Ferrell acted as executive producer for this movie and apparently the comedian was originally set to star himself. Well, you notice that from the first few moments on. ""Hot Rod"" is full of that Ferrell-humor that has had such a huge influence on many American comedies in the past eight years or so. The problem is that much like ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Blades Of Glory"" this kind of humor ends up on the wrong side of the line between stupid fun and annoying stupidity more often that not. Silly costumes, fake mustaches, cruel stepfathers and bad 80's hair metal just don't automatically make for a lot of laughs. Quite the contrary, actually.<br/><br/>Yeah, seeing main character Rod Kimble - played by Andy Samberg, who comes across as a mixture of Ferrell, Jack Black and Ashton Kutcher - fall and hurt himself over and over again is kinda funny, but it's also incredibly cheap and doesn't save the movie from all the boredom that ensues between the stunt scenes. ""Hot Rod"" is at its most annoying when characters scream like retards and purposely act badly - another thing Ferrell has established in his movie.<br/><br/>We've just seen too many lazy and not-really funny comedies like this one. Even though ""Hot Rod"" does have a few moments that are good for a chuckle, ultimately it's mildly amusing at best and a sign that this kind of comedy has become trite and tired.

","The opening scene of Hot Rod feels like it's warming up for a Lonely Island tune to be played. That is sort of how the whole movie feels. Like one big music video. An enjoyable one that is a lot of fun, and has a different kind of humor. Lonely Island type humor. Hot Rod is about an aspiring stuntman named Rod Kimble (Samberg) who, in honor of his late father, creates ramps with his lackluster crew (Fisher, McBride, Taccone, Wilson) and jumps them with his moped.<br/><br/>His step-father (McShane) is in need of a heart transplant, so him and his crew participate in jumping fifteen full size school buses and plan to raise $50,000 so Frank can have the surgery. Along the way, they run into obstacles, and minor things test their friendship. But friendship wins every time as one would expect.<br/><br/>Hot Rod is a homage to Evel Knievel, and even knows how to poke fun at itself. In one scene, the announcer at the stadium says something like ""We must raise $50,000 for Rod's step-father's conveniently priced surgery."" The story itself knows it is nothing new, but it tackles it as if it was.<br/><br/>The Lonely Island is a comedy band on Saturday Night Live who make ""Digital Shorts"" and Music Videos that either poke fun at a certain style, or are just goofy little clips. They have released two studio albums, but they did that after the release of this movie so not everyone knew who Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer (the director of Hot Rod), and Jorma Taccone were.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun with the crew in the film. Especially with Jorma Taccone's character. The whole crew clicked every time they were on screen. They were goofy and enjoyable. Rainn Wilson, from Superbad, also has a supporting role as one of the member's from the crew and it's hard to hate him when he's playing the character he is.<br/><br/>Hot Rod's humor isn't hard to get or like. You just need to have a good sense of it. The whole movie seems like it could be made into a music video with the title The Ballad of Rod Kimble. Pretty much every piece of comedy they bring to the table works, and it makes this comedy pretty cool beans.<br/><br/>Starring: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Rainn Wilson, Isla Fisher, Danny R. McBride, and Ian McShane. Directed by: Akiva Schaffer."
"poore02","10","1","5","24 April 2011"," Best Comedy in Years
","This film stars Andy Sandberg as Rod Kimble a mislead stuntman who performs lackluster stunts which often times end up with him being injured. Rod has a rag tag group of friends who he calls his crew, the crew work on everything from team manager (Kevin, Rod's step-brother), to ramp builder (Rico, Rod's friend, then there is Dave who doesn't seem to have a job, but is hilarious just as well. After the first couple of failed jumps he decides to enlist the help of his neighbor because she has college experience plus he likes her, but he acts so childish that she does not catch on until the end. The movie is based on Rod trying to earn respect from his step-father Frank who is constantly beating him up in little fights and is constantly ridiculing Rod about his stunts, but minutes into the movie you the family finds out that Frank has a bad heart problem and only has months to live. After hearing this news Rod goes to his happy place and does the choreography from Kevin Bacon in Footloose, and comes up with an idea to save Frank by doing one big jump to earn the money for Frank's heart operation, and so he can finally beat Frank in a battle of respect. The theme of this movie is one that is unique in the fact that it seems nonsensical, but the main theme is to not give up on something if you believe in it and when you've got nothing you've got nothing to lose. This movie is just a good time for any fan of the old Adam Sandler movies that didn't really need a plot because the comedy was enough. This movie is in that same vain and is actually more respected in the film community than most Sandler movies, but I believe that is because of Sandberg's comedy style and its slight subtleness that Sandler's films lacked because of his formula. The scene in which Rod initiates Denise the female I mentioned earlier into the crew it is as funny as any moment in recent memory. At first he shines a light in Denise's eyes to get her attention and then when she comes into his garage he is hammering on an engine with a Hulkamania t-shirt and he says ""Denise what's up"" ""funky fresh"". It's these silly lines that and scenes that make this movie comedic gold. This movie is a hilarious movie and the plot while not the best is also hilarious due to the fact that Rod is trying to save his step-father just so he can beat him up and earn his respect. Even though it sounds like a foolish movie with a foolish plot it works thanks to the actors and their parts such as Rico who is played by Danny Mcbride, Denise who is played by Isla Fisher, Dave who is played by Bill Hader, and Jonathan(Denise's boyfriend) played by Will Arnett. This cast is a who's who of up and coming comedic actors that were fortunately put together to create this film."

","This movie is without a doubt the funniest movie I have ever seen. Clever dialogue mixed with a simple but hilarious premise and topped off with completely out of no where humour. This movie hits on a lot of notes and never becomes boring or stale. Now that being said this movie is not for everyone. You need to be in to very random and sometimes pointless humour. Basically if you are surfing the internet and then some person who you don't know crashes through your roof and lands on your floor and they simply look around and say ""well that didn't work"" then casually walk out. If you wouldn't laugh at that then this movie is not for you (nothing like that happens in the movie so no spoilers there). This is a fun and light hearted movie for all and I highly recommend it. I mean come on even if you hate it, it would make a perfect piece of evidence of the loss of intelligence and edicate in our society."
"ochoamanuel21","10","1","5","12 October 2010"," Perfect 80s Tribute and the funniest movie since Team America
","This movie is the greatest parody for 80s triumphant films with power ballads as its main soundtrack. The movie starts out with a bang with the main character Rod failing at the most simple stunts with over the top buildup with the camera being at regular speed when he fails such as when he attempts to jump the cans at the beginning or the pool, priceless. I'm literally still laughing after the end credits and that rarely happens with comedies since they attempt to turn it into a drama but not this one, even after Rod is dying, a taco and a grilled sandwich fight in his vision. So many funny parts, that I could list the entire movie since the whole movie is one big laugh riot! I haven't seen something so original since Team America, the plot in this movie is not that important since is so simple. The premise is that Rod has to save his step-father from dying by making one big jump so that he can kick his ass and gain his respect, even the simple plot premise is awesome. My favorite parts are the Footloose sequence which was totally unexpected, the random riot scene, the cool beans scene, the random Chinese guy throwing fliers, the final jump, and the taco vs grilled cheese fight. That's just the half of it since the entire movie is just laugh out loud funny especially if you love 80s movies. Definitely a must buy!!"

","I was forced with the difficult decision, one fine day in Blockbuster, to decide between renting Hot Rod or The Ring. I had already seen the ring, but Hot Rod looked pretty bad. I did, however, want to see how bad Hot Rod was. I have a strange love towards terrible movies. Imagine my surprise, then, when I started watching and was laughing in the first 20 seconds of the movie. I couldn't leave this movie. I watched it 3 times consecutively, and couldn't stop. I do not exaggerate when I tell you that this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Even my friends were doubtful when I told them we had to rent it. At the end, however, everybody was thanking me for introducing them to such a fantastic comedy. Of course, if you aren't a teenager, or somebody with a penchant for ridiculous humor, then this movie will not be for you WHATSOEVER. But if you are looking for some humor along the lines of Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, then look no further."
"Buddy-51","7","1","5","24 July 2009"," enjoyably wacky comedy
","For a fun, mindless and relaxing good time, check out ""Hot Rod,"" one of those goofy, lowest-common-denominator slapstick comedies which won't do much to raise your IQ or make you a better person for having seen it, but which just might put a smile on your face - provided you're not too highbrow to give yourself over to it, that is.<br/><br/>Prime credit for the movie's success goes to SNL's powerhouse-of-energy Andy Sandberg, an immensely gifted physical comedian who doesn't get nearly the recognition he deserves for his talents. Here he plays Rod Kimble, a developmentally-challenged wannabe daredevil who fancies himself the heir apparent to none other than the late great Evel Knievel himself. To that end, Rod devises elaborate stunts - usually involving jumping over large objects or a series of large objects on his secondhand moped - that invariably lead to his winding up face down in the dirt or smashed headlong into some massive immovable object. But you just can't keep a good stuntman down and, after every fall, Rod picks himself up, dusts himself off and, disregarding his bruised body and bruised ego, heads on to his next venture, eternally optimistic that this time he will be able to complete his mission. Rod's goal is to impress not only the pretty girl who lives next door (Isla Fisher) but his mucho macho step dad (Ian McShane) who thinks Rod is just a mollycoddled, cape-wearing pantywaist, undeserving of his respect.<br/><br/>Joining in the fun are fellow SNL stars, Bill Hader and Chris Parnell, along with ""Arrested Development""'s Will Arnett and acting legend Sissy Spacek to class up the joint.<br/><br/>Replete with corny '80s-style musical montage sequences and some mighty impressive stunt work, ""Hot Rod"" will win you over with its good-natured dopiness and charm. And the good feeling that it engenders may even be worth those couple of brain cells you're sure to lose in the course of watching it."
"zetes","8","1","5","22 March 2009"," Utterly hilarious
","I had flirted with the idea of seeing this film when it was in theaters, then again when it hit DVD, but somehow never got around to it. I don't even remember why I put it up at the top of my Netflix queue. Must have seen it referenced somewhere and my interest was renewed. I'm ecstatic that I finally caught up to it, though. It's hilarious! This generation of Saturday Night Live is pretty dismal, but one of the few good things about it is Andy Sandberg and his digital shorts. They aren't always great, but they're weird and frequently inspired. He stars in this movie about a man who wants to follow in his dead father's footsteps and become a stuntman. In a very common plot for SNL players, Sandberg's stepfather is going to die if he doesn't get a heart transplant. That'll cost 50 grand, and Sandberg thinks that, if he completes one awesome stunt, he'll make the money needed. Much as all of the movies like this (e.g., Dirty Work, which starred Norm MacDonald), the plot is very secondary. Jokes are first. And jokes about the lameness of the plot are hugely encouraged. In fact, Sandberg only wants to heal his stepdad (Ian McShane) because he wants to kick his butt just once in a fair fight before he dies. Isla Fisher plays Sandberg's love interest, but his desires are thwarted by ultra-windbag Will Arnet, one of the funniest men on Earth. He brings this stereotypical character to ridiculous heights of meta-comedy. Danny McBride, Bill Hader and Jorma Taccone co-star as Sandberg's wacky crew. McBride and Hader have become sure-fire signs of a great comedy. There are so many great bits in Hot Rod: the crazy dancing Asian guy, Bill Hader's calm recollection of his acid trip, a fight between a taco and a grilled cheese sandwich, Sandberg ""punch-dancing"" his rage out. Little of it comes close to being describable. It's weird and wild, and sure to be something of a cult comedy classic."

","I consider myself a film buff with comedy having a tendency to be ""last on my list"" of films that I actually enjoy. However, I have a wife that is all about the comedies thus I end up having to sit through a lot of them. I enjoy some comedies, the most recent (prior to ""Hot Rod"") being ""Superbad"". This particular film simply made me laugh a LOT! It's strange because when trying to figure it out for my review submittal to my movie club I pinned it as a mixture of ""Napolean Dynamite"" and ""Billy Madison"" and it seems that many here are of the same belief which makes me comfortable is saying that. Oddly enough, I hated ""Napolean..."" but loved ""Hot Rod"". If you've read the IMDb review, you know the gist of the film so I'll save it. I personally feel this is well worth watching and I will be adding it to my DVD collection in short time. It isn't as much slap stick humor as people seem to be saying. It's a good mixture of subtle and slap stick, just enough to where you aren't overwhelmed by the other. From someone who isn't into comedies, this particular comedy is a winner in my book."
"DJ_Benz","8","1","5","10 January 2008"," A comedy keeper for the ages
","This is one of those movies that continues to get funnier each time you watch it. Fans of the Will Ferrell, Seth Rogan, Steve Carell genre type comedies will love this. They went with a relative new comer for the main role, but there's a reason they did. He's funny as s***. True, this movie did seem to bite the style of Napolean Dynamite but has much more physical humor and more bite to it. The soundtrack will bring back memories to those in their late 20's and early 30's. They did a hilarious job poking fun at some more classic 80's movies and movie clichÃ©s. You definitely want to recommend this to your friends if you're someone who likes quotable lines. There's a ton of 'em. Enjoy."

","I posted this on the message board, too.<br/><br/>Being a slightly-larger-than-average-sized fan of The Lonely Island, I assumed this would be full of fun and laughs. Full of inside jokes and references to the web site's content. Something more than a thrusting dance and a poorly delivered ""Hoobastank."" I wanted dance numbers with raps, I wanted ""we love each other"" jokes... I wanted www.thelonelyisland.com. What I got, however, was Napoleon Dynamite mixed with some weird Family Guy-esquire moments followed by sections/the main plot of every movie Will Ferrell has done in the last 4 years.<br/><br/>Jorma's part was too small, to say the least. He had under 15 lines in the whole movie. He wasn't very involved. I loves me the Jorm, and I needed more! Samberg... tried. I think they were just going for too broad an audience. I hated Napoleon Dynamite, and it appears that the grand public loved it. ""Let's go with an awkward teenager doing punch dancing in the forest, because that looks funny!"" I think I really would have enjoyed this movie if they did it in the spirit of TLI shorts. This could have been so much.<br/><br/>The plot was kind of obvious. Maybe I was expecting too much? I don't know... I knew where each scene was going for the most part. They tried. I just want to like it.<br/><br/>Usually, I'll walk into a movie and will know within the first 5 minutes if I'll love it or hate it. I'm so rarely on the fence. I was trying so hard to like it. The first ten minutes, I laughed along with the (very small) audience. I just couldn't anymore after a few scenes. I was watching Napoleon friggin' Dynamite.<br/><br/>Maybe seeing any movie with a small audience is a bad experience? I tend to like the movies a lot more when the audience is more into it. Movie-going is a good experience when there's a good energy in the audience. Not that these people weren't loving it, they just... didn't drag me into it.<br/><br/>There were only two jokes I can think of that were unpredictable. One of them was hilariously witty. The other was just a cool editing thing that Akiva threw in. I liked both parts, but in a 2-hour-ish movie, that's just not enough.<br/><br/>They really should stick to 6-minute-shorts and rap songs, because I love them for that.<br/><br/>I honestly shouldn't want my money back from these guys. Andy, Jorma and Akiva have been great to me... I just... I don't know. I feel cheated.<br/><br/>See it if you will. I certainly expected more, Akiva! 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>-Ben"

","An overlooked bit of screwball comedy from the members of The Lonely Island and a few of their mid-2000 SNL cohorts. Andy Samberg grabs the lead as the titular Rod, a misguided but confident would-be stuntman whose efforts always climax in a spectacular disaster. Rod is about as one-dimensional as any recurring sketch comedy character, which is to say he's got one note to play and he milks it like a rancher with idle hands. Along for the ride, Bill Hader, Danny McBride (playing, surprise, another version of Kenny Powers), Ian McShane (grievously underused) and a white-hot Isla Fisher, are even narrower. After five minutes you'll know exactly how it's going to play out. This kind of movie isn't usually about character development, though, and as a playground for comedians to wear silly t-shirts and frequently cut away to questionably-related asides, it's suitable enough. Good for a few loud howls, but it lacks consistency, substance and identity. Its greatest sin is taking a decent gag and riding it wayyyy too long, a'la Family Guy's most indulgent moments. In short, it's precisely how the trailer makes it seem: really, really stupid. Points for an excellent butt rock / hair metal soundtrack, though."

","Hot Rod (2007): Dir: Akiva Schaffer / Cast: Andy Samberg, Isla Fisher, Ian McShane, Sissy Spacek, Bill Hader: Amusing if yet formula comedy about a guy with a dream with high stakes. Andy Samberg plays an amateur stunt guy set to raise money for a heart operation for his verbally abusive step-father. The stunts are hilarious mishaps but screenplay presents the wrong message in the conclusion. Director Akiva Schaffer gives an appropriate home video style appeal. The stunts are often hilarious and entertaining but the screenplay suffers. Samberg is hilarious in his focus upon being put down and his desire to raise money for no other reason other than to beat the sh*t out of his step-father. That certainly gives off the wrong message. Isla Fisher seems wasted as some girl next door whose prime function is to be a romantic prop. Ian McShane as the step-father is given great comic moments in his ability to best Samberg physically but the justice coming for him isn't the celebration as intended due to bad taste. Sissy Spacek as the mother is unfortunately flat, which is unfortunate for a past Academy Award winner. Bill Hader and Danny McBride play his best friends and cheer squad, with Jorma Taccone as his half brother. While the message is wayward the film does present a strong theme of following your dreams while taking the human body to its limits. Score: 6 / 10"

","Hot Rod is a good movie with a well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a very fun movie that you will likely enjoy from start to finish, it's a very simple story, it's obviously nothing inspirational or uplifting, but it's just a very enjoyable comedy. The main thing that makes this movie so good is the ridiculous dialogue between the characters and of course the great chemistry between cast members, many of them come from Saturday Night Live and you can tell they are close. My favourite scenes are the ones between Andy Samberg and Isla Fisher, their chemistry was pure and the relationship between the characters definitely had me in stitches the most. It's certainly nowhere near perfect, but Hot Rod is a very quick and very fun movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>A would-be daredevil motorcycle stunt rider tries to raise funds for his stepfather to receive an operation.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Andy Samberg Worst Performance: Sissy Spacek"

","I could kind of understand how some people would be kind of turned off by this movie, but I found it to be pretty amusing. It's kind of a goofy comedy, and kind of a slapstick, but doesn't fully fit the bill for either. It might also be loosely categorized under action comedy or sports comedy, but not quite. The acting and scripting is pretty good throughout. That's not to say that it's the most well done comedy ever, but the filmmakers did a pretty good job overall.<br/><br/>Our main character, Rod Kimble, is surprisingly well written for a comedy protagonist. He can be stupid, dramatic, personable, upset, overblown, and attemptedly suave, while being consistently humorous. Andy Samberg plays him well and embodies the different aspects of his personality with B+ proficiency. The other characters are pretty good too. The different members of Rod's team and his two antagonists can generate quite as many laughs as the main character, though they aren't the most stellarly written characters out there.<br/><br/>The plot, as in most comedies, is nothing special, but is kind of humorous in itself. We get a lot of great lines from Rod about how he wants to raise the money for his step dad's life saving surgery and then finally beat him in a fight. It's not at all difficult to follow like a crime comedy or anything like that.<br/><br/>The comedy is pretty good throughout in my opinion, though of course it's not going to appeal to everyone. The jokes and gags are very blatant with deliveries that make it so that, in some cases, you can't help but laugh. There is a surprisingly small amount of crude humor, just enough to give it an indisputable PG-13 rating but not much beyond that. There are a lot of gags that come from Rod getting physically harmed in some way, and he escapes from serious injury with a rather far-fetched ease, though not at a Home Alone level. There are of a couple of extended comedic conversations, but most of the verbal humor comes from one liners. Some of the jokes are just kind of random like the Ebeneezer Scrooge cameo, the taco vs. grilled cheese thing, and the peaceful march turned riot.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of absurdity in their comedies. It's kind of a cult style comedy, though not in a Ferris Bueler style. It's not bad to watch on a long trip with a group of friends, but it's fine to watch alone too. If you can watch it without buying it or spending more than three bucks, I would at least take it into consideration in any given movie search. Overall Rating: 8.3/10"

","Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg) is a man-child trying imitate his dead stuntman father who supposedly worked for Evel Knievel. He's in love with his neighbor Denise (Isla Fisher) and struggles for his stepfather Frank (Ian McShane)'s approval. To raise money for Frank's surgery, he intends to jump 15 school buses with the help of his friends Rico (Danny McBride), Dave (Bill Hader) and his half-brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone). Denise joins in the gang but it turns out that she's going out with the douchey Jonathan Ault (Will Arnett).<br/><br/>Andy Samberg has built a movie around stupidity. However the stupidity is generally not that funny with a few exceptions. One thing is certain. Samberg and cast are fully committed to put every strange weird things on the screen. When it works, it gets some big laughs. This is like a series of extended SNL digital shorts put together in a pretty thin plot."
"eric262003","7","0","1","27 January 2015"," Bad Story, But Enjoyable Fun
","Many people at the time of the making of this movie ""Hot Rod"" have asked themselves, is Andy Samberg ready to enter the film industry after only a one year stint on the iconic sketch comedy, ""Saturday Night Live""? Veteran alums like Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell took them many years to develop their acting chops in comedy before advancing through in their careers as movie stars. Now all of the sudden, this young man who's just wrapped up his second year on SNL has left the set and is now making his debut on the big screen. It felt as if Samberg was rushing his movie career too fast by not taking his time gain experience like Sandler and Ferrell did, and even I asked myself why? The only reason I could come up with was at the time SNL's roster didn't seem primed up for movie stardom yet. Samberg was the only true star at the time who seemed eligible for stardom. The movie ""Hot Rod"" was a pivotal step in the right direction, but Samberg is still eons away from the success Sandler and Ferrell has had with their movies.<br/><br/>Samberg stars as Rod Kimble, who has ambitions to become a famed stuntman because his late father was fellow stuntman who once worked for the legendary Evel Knievel. He doesn't have any kind of major goal in life, but the one thing he wants more than anything in the world is get the respect from his father Frank Powell (Ian McShane) who has verbally and taunted Rod ever since he's been in his family's life. Even though he tries his hardest and has had his share of bumps, bruises and broken bones, he still an awful stuntman and no one seems to take him seriously. However his half-brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone) and his dim-witted friends Rico and Dave (Danny McBride and Bill Hader) along with his love interest Denise (Isla Fischer) seem to support him all the way. When he comes home his mother, Maries (Sissy Spacek) informs him that Frank is now diagnosed with severe heart conditions and that he needs a substantial amount of money for much needed surgery or else he'll die. Rod decides to sacrifice his life and limb to raise the required money by attempting the impossible stunt by stunt biking over 15 school buses. If he and Frank pull through this he has fulfilled his destiny and finally get to kick Frank's behind.<br/><br/>If you think ""Hot Rod"" is a standard comedy, you may as well say Hitler was just a serial killer. You're told that because everyone else says so, but after seeing this movie you'll know better that it's all not true. You will be manipulated to laugh for the sole purpose that everyone around you is laughing. sure the opening scenes are very hilarious with the faux ""Jackass"" promo, the spoof of the 1980's film ""Footloose"" and his falling down cliff are vintage laugh out loud moments. And then by the second half, it just starts to get weird. It's not everyday you see a man costumed as a grilled cheese sandwich combating against a man dressed as a taco. I mean this racial joke goes beyond surreal by adding blood for good measure (or was just taco sauce). Samberg and his fellow cohorts manage to take simple slogans like ""Cool beans"" and turn it into a You Tube infused rap will surely make everyone laugh, while you wonder how this scene made it into the final cut.<br/><br/>Aside from the continual brain farts and the weed smoking flashbacks, the main flaw towards ""Hot Rod"" was that even though it sacrifices itself in its outrageous humor giving this film more guts than brains, the main setback was the emphasis on Rod's hobby as if nothing else really matters. The funniest thing about ""Hot Rod"" isn't how Rod keeps falling flat on his face through every stunt attempt, but it's the interaction between he and his eternally cranky step-father. And the finale at the end leads to the climactic showdown between Rod and the now fully recovered Frank. One memorable scene that had me laughing was when Frank pulled out a ninja star and threw it at Rod. It was truly one of the best scenes ever witnessed in a film for a very long time. And while ""Hot Rod"" is a very good, movie it's far from being perfect. For starters Isla Fischer who seems quite capable as a comedic actress, she has very little to work with. And while Pam Brady who wrote the script for ""South Park: Bigger Louder and Uncut"" really didn't need any assistance from Samberg and company. But by the end of the ""Hot Rod"" is a pivotal milestone for Andy Samberg, and the future looks good, still ""Hot Rod"" is far from great, but it gives the true test of time that a bad movie can still be enjoyable."
"maurice-silva96","9","0","1","30 September 2014"," Great Actor Choice
","The movie Hot Rod starring Andy Samberg is a prime example of how actor choice can influence the outcome of a movie both financially and in the overall tone of the movie. In Hot Rod, Andy Samberg is the perfect choice for the protagonist due to his past success on Saturday Night Live. The actor choice in the movie Hot Rod allows for a humorous plot and helped in the success of the movie itself.<br/><br/>The choice of Andy Samberg for the movie was a great decision due to the fact that he has past experience in comedy. Samberg starred in Saturday Night Live beginning in two thousand and five. As an up and coming actor, he was very successful through different ventures such as The Lonely Island. His comedic success made him a great choice for the role. His background in comedy was conducive to his ability to deliver a performance that evoked laughter consistently throughout the movie. For example, in the scene where Rod Kimble is punch dancing in a wooded glen we see that the character is troubled, but it is portrayed in a humorous way. This would not be possible without an actor who is able to be funny, which further proves that Andy Samberg is the best choice for this role. Another example would be the scene where they are saying cool beans. Although this scene seems very childish, it takes a good actor to pull something like that off. Saying that actor choice does not influence the outcome of a movie is completely absurd. In an interview, Samberg said, ""On a movie it definitely does shift, where you are thinking about appeasing the studio, because they have a vision for what the movie should or shouldn't represent."" This shows that it really takes a good actor in order to please the producers. Samberg really understands where the producers are coming from and attempts to be the best actor he can be. This just goes to show that the actor choice in the movie Hot Rod really led to the success of the movie due to the fact that Samberg was able to see the expectations of the producers and adapt his acting to fit those expectations.<br/><br/>Not only does the actor choice in Hot Rod lead to a very humorous plot, but it also leads to the financial success of the movie. This movie has gained a cult following due the fact that Andy Samberg is in it. Many people have been fans of his since his Saturday Night Live days. It is easy to see that the producers saw the opportunity to cast a popular actor as the lead role in their movie. In the movie he uses the same comedic genius that he used throughout his Saturday Night Live, and Lonely Island career, and this is what lead to the success of it. Andy Samberg uses this same acting style throughout the movie through his witty remarks, and ridiculous stunts. For example, the opening scene of the movie consists of Kimble attempting a jump and failing to make it across. This type of humor is consistent with that of something you would see in another piece of Andy Samberg's work. For example, The Lonely Island, a band in which Samberg is involved in performs a song titled ""I'm On a Boat"". This song is very humorous and shows how Samberg is very consistent with his acting. In an article, it states, ""Samberg continued to achieve an astonishing level of mainstream success with his absurdist and sometimes vulgar brand of humor."" This describes the humor used in all of his acting perfectly. There is no doubt that this actor choice was the right one. On the opening weekend, the movie brought in $5,310,711, and a gross income of $13,920,741. With that being said, I think it is safe to say that this movie was pretty successful.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I think that Hot Rod is a brilliant example of comedy. It is clear that the choice in actor for this movie led to the success of it, and allowed for a humorous plot throughout. If it weren't for the comedic style of Andy Samberg, I do not think that this movie would have gained nearly as much popularity as it has."

","I love this movie! It has hilarious comedy and funny actors, what's not to like? What I don't understand is all the hate this comedies been given. I've honestly not met anyone who doesn't like it. Its not very well known and it doesn't have the highest reviews, but then again, neither does Napoleon Dynamite and that movie is a classic in my book. This movie literally made me pee myself the first time I saw it, I was laughing so hard. I guess it depends on what kind of comedy you like. If you like adult comedy, then this movie probably isn't for you. The comedy in this movie has a lot to do with Rod Kimble(Andy Samburg) Getting hurt and saying and doing ridiculous things. Andy Samburg is perfect for the role of Rod Kimble. Both Rod, and Andy, act younger than their age and are just really funny. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies like, Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre, Or Gentleman Broncos."

","This movie deserves a perfect score because it did its job very well and then some. Its job was to make me laugh as much as possible and it did. That's what comedies are for after all. The people who don't say it's funny also say that its just a stupid movie, but they don't understand that being stupid is the point of the movie. Being stupid is what makes it funny. So if you watch this and don't laugh, then you don't have a sense of humor. If you have a sense of humor then this has a high chance of being your favorite comedy movie as it is mine. It made me laugh from beginning to end. I want to see another movie from this particular group of actors because they are hilarious."

Then you will watch it again and again and find yourself saying ""Ultimate Punch"" or ""Soul of a Bottle-nosed dolphin."" Every person I have watched this with loves it and it gets a place in one of they're favorite comedies. Watch this movie, and if you don't like it, watch it again.

","If your only sense of humor is what is spoon-fed to you from cable specials and therefore no appreciation for the original and experimental....GET OUT!<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie was a pre-release screening and all I remember was the cramps I had from laughing so hard. It really feels like a low budget film ($25mil...not so low) and embraces certain visual limitations which really only adds to the general goofiness and comedy. I really feel like the negative general reception was unjustified and brutal. <br/><br/>I'm guessing the only people who really even read these reviews are generally more open minded to ""off the main road"" attractions and will appreciate it. Now I generally do not encourage drug use...but many people have been known to watch this film after toking up."

","Favorite movie ever, has been since I first saw it. Have yet to laugh as hard to any other film. MAYBE step brothers or anchorman comes close, but not quite. Don't expect The Lonely Island boys (Jorma, Andy, and Akiva) and Danny Mcbride to step in front of a camera and not have epic quotable moments. I spend many daily moments quoting this movie back and forth with friends, and frankly have never met anyone who doesn't enjoy this film. Maybe not all will understand the sense of humor but going into it with an open mind will definitely have you laughing at least twenty times. Every character rocks their part and adding Isla Fisher and Will Arnetts unlikely relationship really brought some mean but hilarious moments to the film."
"gavin6942","6","0","3","17 January 2010"," A Decent SNL Spin-Off Film
","The days of the best Saturday Night Live spin-offs are probably gone. Whether you're a fan of Mike Myers, Chris Farley, Will Ferrell or other... most people would agree that the cast of SNL for the past few years (2005-2009) has been lacking. That concern aside, Andy Samberg is one of the best things to come to SNL during this period.<br/><br/>As Rod Kimble (a character obviously meant to be played by Ferrell, who has been the lead in pretty much every other comedy of this type), Samberg does some of his finest work outside of the music video world (his ""Lonely Island"" stuff will forever be the best). Then, to team him up with Bill Hader and Danny McBride (who is a great supporting actor, horrible lead) is just perfect.<br/><br/>Will Arnett and Chris Parnell play important supporting roles, and the lovely Isla Fisher steals the show. I can never get enough of her (though I'm sort of curious what a woman with an Aussie accent is doing in the States).<br/><br/>With good random humor (though not great), and some laugh-out-loud dance sequences (far more than in your average film), this one went under the radar but is worth a view if you're up for a comedy. Maybe not as great as, say ""The Hangover"", but lovable in its own right."

","In Hot Rod, Rod Kimble's dream is to become a stuntman, just like his father who died when he was a baby. He lives with his mother, stepfather, and his half-brother. Rod does stunts around town with the help of his crew. His brother, Kevin is the team manager/videographer, Dave is the mechanic, and Rico build the ramps. One day, he finds out that his stepfather is very sick and needs a heart transplant to live. So Rod plans to raise enough money to do one big jump. He plans to jump fifteen buses to raise his money. Rod sees a video that Kevin made for him and decided to show it in the movie theater. However, the movie back fires and made Rod the laughing stock of town. Rod becomes very angry and throws the movie projector out of the window. Because of that, he had to use all his money he saved up to pay for damages. On the same night, his mother tells him that his father wasn't really a stuntman, which shatters his whole universe, and he decided to give up on his stunts. Later, Dave gives him advice that made him rethink about his future. Rods talks to Kevin and finds out that the local AM radio station wants to sponsor his big jump. Rod doesn't make the jump, but he raised the money and saved Frank's life.<br/><br/>The critical intention for this film is to believe in yourself no matter what other people say or think. After Rod heard the news about his father and having everyone laughing at him, he didn't think he would be a great stuntman. In the end, everyone supported him and helped him reach his goal.<br/><br/>The movie shows how different Rod and his crew were from everyone else they grew up with in town. Rod always wore his stuntman suit and the crew wore clothes from another decade while everyone else was modern and grown up. Someone in Hot Rod even said that Rod Stayed exactly the same while everyone grew up."

","When I saw the trailer for Hot Rod last year, it threw me off a whole lot, I wasn't sure what to expect, it looked kind of lame to be honest. But I decided to go ahead and rent it, just give it a chance, so I watched it this morning and this was one of the more off beat comedies I have seen since Walk Hard earlier this year. Now off beat comedies can go either way, either it's going to be funny as heck or just plain awful and something that nobody will get. Now I'm kind of stuck in between, because Hot Rod has some genuinely funny moments that will just make you loose your breath from laughing so hard, but then there are some moments like the ""Cool Beans"" scene that you go ""ooooooook"", and have no idea what you just saw. But one thing I always like in a film is if the cast looked like they took the film for what it was and just had fun, and that's what made the story funny.<br/><br/>Rod is a young inspiring stunt man who constantly fails at jumping, his family, friends, even the whole community thinks he's a joke. But he's got something bigger going on, his step dad won't stop treating him like a punching bag, so Rod has promised that one day he'll kick his step dad's butt. But when his step dad needs a heart transplant, it'll cost fifty thousand dollars, so Rod and his friends decide to raise the money by Rod's stunts so they can give Rod's step dad the heart transplant and so Rod can finally kick his step dad's butt.<br/><br/>Hot Rod, I'm not sure I'd recommend it so fast to someone, while it has some funny moments, there are things that are just so strange and felt like they were written by a twelve year old at times. I didn't take the movie seriously, so I'm not just being uptight about it. But this movie was good for what it was, I have to admit there were some just hilarious scenes, I always loved it when Rod came up to his dying step father and told him that he was going to punch him in the face, I don't know, maybe it's the way he said it, but believe me, it's so funny.

Enough with those non-scenes, the movie consist of the soundtrack made almost entirely from Europe’s songs. Now that what I called character.<br/><br/>Now the casting, it was awesome!!! They all fit like jigsaw, except for Isla – she is too pretty for this kind of movie.

It's a fantastic movie however having said that, this is not the film to watch if you're looking for a witty and smart comedy like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Much like Anchorman, Hot Rod is basically 2 hours of one liners that just leave you both puzzled and in stitches of laughter. Unlike in Anchorman, the actors in Hot Rod are relatively unknown, or at least to me. This in no way detracts from the movie and if anything improves it.
