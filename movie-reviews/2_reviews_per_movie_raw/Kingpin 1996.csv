","This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about."
"lambiepie-2","10","42","52","19 November 2002"," This film is rude, crude and very funny
","When this film first came out, I had no use for it. Then I was home sick one day and caught it on cable. I laughed my butt off. This is a crude, rude and down right funny film. It also helped that I grew up near the Pennsylvania Dutch and plenty of bowling lanes. Two seemingly safe areas that the Farley brothers attack it without mercy. Sometimes it gets down right disgusting and many cannot stomach, but overall, its very funny.<br/><br/>Bill and Woody were funny as anything. The Disco-era beginning makes me laugh like crazy. The commercial Bill Murray does is to die for. This film will offend alot of people, and many references played for humor may make folks feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. If you are easily offended, this is NOT the film for you. But for everyone else who likes rude, crude and deviously funny -- often at the expense of others kinda humor, this is a gem to see."
"mulhollandman","10","54","70","26 August 2006"," An abrasive comedy that is not for all tastes
","Kingpin should be approached with the same kind apprehension that any sane person would approach any Farrelly Brothers film. Expect a procession of jokes at the expensive of the main characters, fused with an simple storyline and that's exactly what to expect from a Farrelly brothers film.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a washed bowler that had potential to be a professional Bowler but his dream comes to an end when he encounters Ernie McCracken, played to perfection by Bill Murray who ends up costing Roy Munson his bowling hand. Cut to mid-90's Roy is now an alcoholic, in serious debt. A chance meeting with Ishamel Boorg, played by Randy Quaid, an naive Amish man at a bowling alley leads to the pairs cross country trip to save both their respective futures. Along the way they met Claudia, played by Vanessa Angel, a tough talking con woman with her own mission. Together the three form an unbreakable bond and come face to face with their adversary Ernie McCracken.<br/><br/>I like my comedy to be intelligent, and Kingpin is one of the few movies of its kind that actually makes me laugh. It made me laugh when I first saw it in 1996 it made me laugh till I was sore and now ten years on in 2006 it still makes me laugh. The cast are brilliant and it's their talents that really keep this comedy from dating. Randy Quaid is always solid, Vanessa Angel is devilish sexy and cunning, Woody Harrelson is suitably vexed and Bill Murray reminds us all why he has remained Hollywood's main comedy actor long since all his peers disappeared.<br/><br/>Kingpin is definitely for an adult audience and it is worth watching some night that there is nothing on the television or at the cinema. Not for all tastes but damn it is good and it is one of the Farrelly brothers better films in my opinion. 10 out of 10"
"ray-280","10","42","54","16 August 2005"," Now I Know Why I Quit Bowling
","I say this in a good way: this film captures bowling's underbelly, where even the pro stars sometimes have to supplement their income the old-fashioned way: by taking it directly from obviously weaker bowlers who somehow manage to be convinced to risk their money. Just as poker games are often won with guns, bowling for money has hazards all its own, something I learned even as a junior bowler hustling games after the league on Saturday.<br/><br/>Roy E. Munson (Woody Harrelson) is such a loser that acting like a total loser is actually called ""being Munsoned."" The term is named after an incident where some victims of a bowling hustle relieve Roy of his right hand in a gruesome manner which involves bowling equipment. Somehow, even THAT manages to be funny, which speaks to the quality of this film, a film smart enough to have its three main stars on screen for most of the time. The 1979 accident was the result of Roy taking the fall for the hustle engineered by legendary bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray).<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1996, and Roy stumbles across an Amish bowler named Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), the most talented bowler he's ever come across. He offers to coach Ishmael for a $1 million tournament in Reno, Nevada that can save his family farm, but Ishmael is conflicted (the deepest emotion of the film) because he has strayed from the Amish country. Ishmael's brother is the requisite family member sent to bring the stray relative back home, and Vanessa Angel is extra-hot as the love interest for almost every guy in the film.<br/><br/>If you think this is a parody of bowling, the joke may be on you. Hang around enough lanes, in certain places, and you just might see these guys or something very close to them. Just be careful if they look drunk and want to play for money."
"jotix100","8","29","37","25 August 2005"," Bowling anyone?
","Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the directors of ""Kingpin"" show a great flair for this type of comedy. Not having seen it when it first was released, we were lucky to catch it on cable the other night, and frankly, it proved to be a happy choice. The Farrellys had a good screen play by Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan to work with, as they showed a talent for assembling a wonderful cast to make this a winning comedy the fun and exciting film it is.<br/><br/>The best thing in the film are Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray. Mr. Harrelson plays Roy Munson, the man who love bowling, but through an unfortunate incident, loses his ability to play the sport he was born to play. Woody Harrelson is wonderful in his portrayal of Munson. Bill Murray's role is much smaller, but he does wonders with it. Best of all is the way we see him at the bowling tournament in Reno with his teased hair in disarray.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good. Randy Quaid as Ishmael Boorg, gives a funny reading of his naive character. Also the attractive Vanessa Angel plays the woman who has an interest in the game."
"bat-5","7","25","34","10 July 1999"," Bill Murray at his best!
","Bill Murray pretty much steals the show every time he's on the screen. He's sleazy, he's smarmy and he's very funny.  With that comb-over going nuts at the big game, and his victory dance at the end makes Kingpin that much better.  That's not saying that the rest of the film isn't good, it is. Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Vanessa Angel make a very odd partnership. An Amish bowling whiz, a one handed ex-bowler, and a very sexy hustler scheme and dream to make it to Reno, but of course they have to beat Big Ern."

","Young Roy Munson has been raised to be a bowler.It's what he does best. In 1979,at the age of eighteen,Roy(Woody Harrelson from here on out)is at the top of his game and a bona-fide star in his Ohio hometown. After he beats Ace pro Ernie""The Big Ern""McCracken(Bill Murray,smarmy and snarkly as ever)in a match,he is raked into Ernie's con game and pays a dear price for it.<br/><br/>Seventen years later,Roy is anything but the local hero he once was. He lives in a seedy apartment in small town Pennsylvania,does odd sales jobs and has to ""satisfy"" his decrepit landlady to avoid the rent. It's at one of the bowling alleys that Roy does routes to that he witnesses one Ishmael Boorg(Randy Quaid,backing his scene stealing performance in ID4 with this bravura turn),a sweet,gentle Amish man-child who has a natural knack for bowling. Needing money and smelling a chance at scoring big time,Roy decides to take Ishmael under his wing.<br/><br/>On the way to a Million dollar tournament in Las Vegas,Roy and Ishmael pick up a comely stowaway and ally in a gangster's moll(VAnessa Angel) and bond from mishap to mishap.<br/><br/>There's nothing particularly brilliant or especially sharp about this offering,the second from the brothers Farrelly,but its uniqueness and lack of restraint on the gross-out humor make this movie a very easy watch(for those who love that kind of stuff,of course). Harrelson,Quaid,Murray and Angel move effortlessly through this flick,which may explain why it's so good. Since this film,the Farrellys have steadily moved away from the almost merciless gross-out gags of their films and has made seeing their films a little less riotous and fun,so this movie is a healthy reminder of what a little imagination(I mean,honestly...a movie about Bowling AND the Amish?)and mischief can make. A great cheap rent or cable TV movie."
"FeastMode","5","5","6","26 July 2019"," my notes
","Good for a bunch of laughs including some really funny parts, but also pretty long with extensive amounts of unfunny time. i didn't like it overall, but i had a decent time with it. wouldn't watch it again (about 2 viewings)"
"AlsExGal","8","6","8","1 September 2019"," Roy was a great bowler...and then he got Munsoned
","In 1979, to the tune of ""Disco Inferno"", Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) demonstrates that he is the greatest bowler in the world. Except nobody knows this but himself, his dad, and the rest of his small Iowa hometown. So he sets out on the open road to make his fame and fortune in the sport. And then he runs into HIM...Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray). Ernie talks Roy into running a scam with him on some other bowlers, basically a hustle, and when the scam goes bad, Ernie takes a powder and leaves Roy holding the bowling bag. And the scammed - including a preacher - do not take it well. They take revenge by putting Roy's bowling hand into the bowling ball return. You don't actually SEE the gore, but the next scene is Woody in present day (1996) stopping his morning alarm with his extremely fake looking prosthetic hand to the tune of ""It's a Beautiful Morning"".<br/><br/>Roy's fortune looks like it might take a turn for the better when he encounters an Amish bowler, Ishmael (Randy Quaid), who has an incredibly high bowling score average. He wants Ishmael to go with him to a one million dollar tournament in Reno. Ishmael won't go because the bowling hobby is a secret from his family, one that his family and the entire Amish community consider sinful.<br/><br/>So the rest of the film consists of a hilarious take on the Amish community - ever notice this is the LAST group of people that it is OK to make fun of?, a beautiful but unwanted passenger (Vanessa Angel), and another encounter with HIM - Ernie McCracken, now a successful pro bowler...who still has both of his hands.<br/><br/>With Bill Murray as, well, Bill Murray. He's always the same character. We wouldn't want it any other way, at least in a comedy. Also with Lin Shaye as the woman with patent leather skin, an oversexed landlady who is playing the same kind of gross-out role she had in ""Something About Mary"". And about Roy being ""Munsoned"", along the way he learns that his last name has become an adjective, meaning ""to have the world in the palm of your hand and blow it"".<br/><br/>Sure this film is full of juvenile jokes, but overall it is very funny, plays to the strengths of the cast, and is for everybody who feels like they blew an opportunity in life, which is just about all of us. It's a shame most of the critics at the time didn't get that."
"mapeoleaf","7","6","9","30 December 2003"," Long Live the Comb Over
","I thought this movie was great.  It has a fantastic cast made up of Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Bill Murray.  I agree with other users that this film has not been rated fairly.  You simply have to take it for what it's worth, and I personally think it's wonderful!<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson, a drunken, former pro-bowler trying with much difficulty to earn a buck.  He discovers a young Amish man who may be his ticket back to bowling prestige (if that actually exists).  The two bowling hopefuls proceed on a road trip to win the grand prize in a bowling championship in Las Vegas.   This movie is truly hilarious!  Woody Harrelson does a fantastic job in the role of the sad sack ex-bowler with a rubber hand.  He seems to have aged ten years in his portrayal of this character.  Bill Murray is his adversary, ""Big Ern"" McCracken, whose bad toupee seems to have a life of its own. Murray is wonderful in this role with his cocky and pompous attitude.  There are certain scenes of his character in a television commercial that are quite literally, marvelous.  Finally to finish off this stellar cast we have Randy Quaid as Ishmael, the NaÃ¯ve Amish man who could quite possibly be the next Bowling legend. I must also mention the gorgeous Vanessa Angel as Claudia.  Her character is under developed but she still has the charisma and sex appeal to ignite her scenes.<br/><br/>This movie must be viewed for what it is worth.  This means, it is not Oscar material but it is a very funny movie.  So watch the film with this in mind and enjoy all the hilarious scenes and great performances.<br/><br/> 7/10"

"ccthemovieman-1","8","10","19","14 July 2006"," Bowling: It Can Be A Crude Sport!
","What a strange comedy this turned out to be. Of course, that's not a shock considering you have Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Bill Murray starring. Now there's a stable, conservative trio!! <br/><br/>This actually has some very funny moments. At first I was afraid it was going to be too irreverent to the Amish - and there definitely was some of that with Quaid's character, who is made to look like a total dimwit, who has no knowledge of the Bible and is easily led - NO characteristics of an Amish person, BUT the film really isn't mean-spirited and it does show respect for the Amish in a number of scenes. However, it's still very much a sleazy film and the writers wouldn't have done this with any other non-Christian character.<br/><br/>All the characters in here, including the profane female lead played by Vanessa Angel (who?), are fun to watch. The most outrageous, in a minor role, is the female landlord who has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Bowlers will especially like this film since a good part of it centers around that. A number of PBA members put it cameo performances. One scene, with the fake hand attached to the bowling ball as it returns from the ball rack had me almost in tears laughing, for some reason. Murray's take on the flamboyant bowler (and there have been a few over the years on the Pro Bowlers Tour) is hilarious.<br/><br/>Crude, but a funny film for the most part."
"peeedeee-94281","5","3","4","9 October 2019"," Entertaining But Falls Apart Towards The End
","I finally got around to watching this Farrelly brothers movie. I've seen Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary, etc... I thought I had scene Kingpin, but as I watched it, it didn't seem familiar.
The story wasn't quite original. A star athelete who gets down on his luck and finds a protege to coach to greatness - its been done many times before. This one was set in the world of bowling.
For this movie, unfortunately, you have to set a lot of the logic aside to really find it funny. Like an Amish guy who is an expert bowler and is able to hide it from his family (strangely, they kept calling him a 'boy', Randy Quaid looked older than Woody Harrelson). Somehow they are able to travel across the country with almost no money, with the intention of arriving in Reno Nevada to enter a bowling tournament?
But where the movie really falls apart is the whole thing was a set up for Randy Quaid's Ishmael character to shine in Reno. But then he hurts his hand, and Woody Harrelson's Roy decides to bowl instead. Huh? So you think, hmm, how is he going to bowl with his left hand? Is he going to have time to practise?
No, the movie instead has him using his prosthetic hand to bowl. Now, throughout the movie, we've been shown how the hand is more like a glorified rubber glove. It's very flimsy, and can come off easily. The fingers have no support, so they're easily bent back. Yet, Roy suddenly is able to carry a 12lb bowling ball in that hand?!! That's where the movie really loses me.
Then you have Ishmael leaving without saying goodbye, so you think that Roy is mad at him, because Ishmael didn't even stay to see him win or lose. And even though Roy manages to earn some money (who pays a $500,000 advance for advertising?), he gives it all just to save Ishmael's Amish community. Seems a bit too generous, even if he did get the love of bowling back, kind of.
So while this comedy has some enjoyable moments, the way Roy is able to bowl competitively after not having bowled in 17 years, and with a soft rubber glove, doesn't really hold up. But I will say I did find the fly away comb-overs that Bill Murray and Woody Harrelson had in that final match was pretty funny.
Yes, I get it's a comedy, but come on, this isn't set in a fantasy world on a fantasy planet. Farrelly brothers should have come up with a better final 20 minutes."
"a_chinn","7","3","4","12 July 2018"," The crass breakout Farrelly Brothers comedy still holds up
","I saw this back in the day in the theater at a midnight showing and loved it. ""Kingpin"" was a box office disappointment upon it's original release, but it found it's audience on home video and became something of a cult classic. The set-up is basically ""The Natural"" except instead of a 1920s Robert Redford having his baseball career cut short, we have a 1970s Woody Harrelson's promising professional bowling career cut short. Harrelson resurfaces 20 something years later to mentor an Amish bowling prospect, Randy Quaid, in order to get payback against bowling star Bill Murray, who was responsible for Harrelson's career ending bowling injury. Suffice to say, it's not the story that made this film memorable. It's the many over-the-top hilarious gags and some surprisingly earnest characters that make this film still hold up today. Some of he best gags involve Harrelson's rubber hand, the foul mouthed Lin Shaye, Harrelson trying to pass as Amish, Quade getting some cold drinks, and an odd Indecent Proposal sequence involving a cameo by Chris Elliott, but it's really Bill Murray who steal every scene that he's in, whether he's mugging after losing a bowling match, doing a self serving infomercial, or something as small as his bad hair combover, he is absolutely hilarious in what might arguable be his best comedic performance (and that's saying something). It's really too bad Murray's part is a supporting role, but it may be his limited screen time that makes his performance so special. Writer/directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly had previously made the popular (and I believe critically underrated) ""Dumb and Dumber,"" but it was this film that helped pave the way for the slew of raunchy 90s comedies that followed, such as ""American Pie,"" the Farrellys own ""There's Something About Mary,"" all the way up to ""Superbad."" The 80s certainly had it's fair share of Porky's inspired raunch, but this new generation is a bit more story and character driven than their sleazier 80s counterparts. The main weakness of ""Kingpin"" is that the sappy maudlin elements of the story, which do certainly make the characters more empathetic, are often incongruous with the raunchy and absurd comedic elements. It's hard to go from Harrelson ""milking"" a bull or ""paying"" his rent to his hideous landlady to caring whether he finds redemption and self respect. However, ""Kingpin"" remains an enjoyably crass and rude comedy that although not be for all tastes is a hilarious treat if you can get into the spirit of the film. Vanessa Angel, Richard Tyson, Rob Moran, and Daniel Greene also appear in the film."
"andy stew","Null","3","4","27 October 2001"," Bill Murray in one of the funniest comedy scenes ever
","I enjoyed this film a great deal. There were many hilarious gags and some clever satirical sideswipes, and the main performers were excellent. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid made a superb team, and both were quite moving at times.<br/><br/>However, I must mention the extraordinary comic genius of Bill Murray here, as in this film he provided me with what must be one of the funniest scenes in the history of movies -- a very simple gag that was really bound to happen, yet I wasn't expecting it. It is the climactic scene where he and Harrelson are the finalists in the tournament, and twice involves his comb-over ...<br/><br/>I can't go any further. I'm laughing so much. My sister and I missed the rest of the film as we bust our guts in absolute hysterics as Murray performed little victory dances (one involving his shoulder-blades almost killed me) while totally oblivious to the state that his hair was in ...<br/><br/>
I don't want to spoil it for you. Just rent out the film, watch it with a friend, forget that I mentioned this scene, and when it happens it will catch you unawares and you will hopefully laugh yourself silly.<br/><br/>Ernie McCracken really was the biggest loser in the film, as he thought he was cool and suave, yet he had a terrible hairstyle (two, actually) and was a disgusting, selfish and unfeeling pervert. He plays a big role in the plot, but Murray's outstanding performance makes him so self-absorbed and bereft of any real humanity that he is almost completely separate from the movie -- there really is no point in him being there, apart from to provide us with enormous laughs and upstage everyone else and all the important things in the film. He just exists for himself and his own satisfaction, and everything about him is insincere. <br/><br/>When you watch it you will know what I mean when I say that he really seems to be one of the most unimportant important characters I've seen. Murray really is in a league of his own when it comes to cynicism and wry, dry and ironic humour; his gift is his ability to allow his casual arrogance to remove all pomposity and sentimentality, and mock everything that's important, so you can't do anything but laugh. <br/><br/>When he re-entered the film, I really couldn't care less what the outcome was going to be. I just laughed as he signed an autograph for a beautiful female fan and whispered to her what room he was staying in; and as he jokingly apologised for the appalling damage he had inflicted on Roy Munson (Harrelson), which had completely ruined his life 17 years earlier, and then selfishly began to make light of the matter, before avoiding a few punches from Ishmael (Quaid) and running off quickly while telling Claudia (Vanessa Angel) what room he was staying in.<br/><br/>And all the while, he has a hairstyle that is worse than Munson's and Ishmael's put together. <br/><br/>Man, that's some good tasting comedy."

For what this film was trying to be, it's a 10/10. Though I suppose it's doubtful you're reading a review 23+ years later trying to decide if you should watch it.

What a tour de force.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a sophisticated, light hearted comedy, then this isn't it.

If you can appreciate rapid-fire jokes and shameless attempts to get a laugh out of anything, this is a great film to see.<br/><br/>What surprised me about ""Kingpin"" is that, beneath all the raunchy humor and satire, there is a real story behind it all.  Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) once had a promising career go down the tubes due to one unlucky night and for years becomes an alcoholic loser.  By the end of the film, you can see positive changes in his life, as well as in his new friend Ishmael (Randy Quaid), a harmless Amish man who wants to gain the respect and admiration of his community."

Additionally, much of the humor, at least superficially, appeals to the lowest common denominator.  But this movie also strikes a chord on a much deeper level.  The story, while sophomoric at times, is also thoughtful and intelligent.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson continues to show his versatility, this time playing a slightly dim witted ex-bowler, who takes on a naive Amish protege played ably by Randy Quaid.

"flatulus","Null","1","1","30 August 1999"," a classic
","I can't believe the low rating for this movie.  I suppose it could be viewed as being cruel, but it's a COMEDY for god's sake.  The cruelty is part of the charm.  Some of us are intelligent enough to realize that the cruelty in this movie is not meant to be taken seriously.  If you insist on condemning the cruelty and vulgarity in this movie, then look at it this way:  life is often cruel (and vulgar) and you might as well just laugh at it rather than bemoan it.  Anyway, this movie is, for me, that funniest movie of the decade.  It's more consistently funny than Something About Mary,  which got all the acclaim and money.  Perhaps this movie was released a few years before its time, as cruel humor seems to be all the rage now (Austin Powers 2 and South Park).  Unless you're a humorless, uptight stick-in-the-mud, you should laugh hysterically at this movie."

","Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't have much of a filmography but after they produced Dumb & Dumber (1994), they were pretty much set. Since this week was the recent release of the Farrelly brothers' long awaited sequel to Dumb & Dumber (1994), Dumb & Dumber To (2014), it seemed appropriate that we visit another early Farrelly brothers' work. I was amazed to see that this is the only time Woody Harrelson collaborated with these directors. After being in and proving in other films that he still can be a comedic actor, I thought he would've made another movie with them. Guess Harrelson has had other plans since.<br/><br/>Here, Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson, a bowling prodigy who worked hard at being the best. That is, until one day after making a dangerous gamble, he loses his best bowling hand. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed, he leaves home to live a secluded life from society with poor living conditions and unkempt neighbors. Struggling to maintain any kind of order in his life, especially after losing his hand, he stumbles upon an Amish man named Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who reminds him of his youth and realizes that he has some unrecognized bowling skills and decides to take him under his wing. Along their travels, the two also stumble into a abusive rich man's wife that decides it's time for her to get out. The actress playing this vixen is Vanessa Angel. This is also probably her most memorable role in her filmography to most people who recognize her.<br/><br/>The three actors do have their moments that are funny but it's not often. Harrelson carries most of the weight because of how his character tries to be better than his current social status. Quaid's character isn't all that funny but does work occasionally too. Of course, Angel's character is one that probably won't be ignored since much of the physical humor is centered around her bosom. Thankfully, not all the physical comedy relies on Angel. Harrelson's character uses a rubber hand in replace of his metal hooks and watching him fiddle getting ready or doing other things people normally do with their hands brought up some laughs. However there are some gags that are more gross than comical. I'm sure that's apart of the Farrelly humor, but if you're a viewer who doesn't like that kind of humor, it won't be that funny.<br/><br/>Bill Murray even has a fairly major role in the story too, playing a bowler named Ernie McCracken. Man does Murray's hair get wild. In fact, his personality altogether is a bit too wild. Murray is more of an actor who can play a funny role in a deadpan fashion, not over-the-top. Most likely Murray fans will have a fun time but he does get to be too much at times. The two gentlemen behind the screenplay have more TV series writing under their belts than acclaimed comedy blockbusters, which could explain why several gags amount to very little. Also the characters for what they are, aren't the most likable. Yes, they're weird in their own way and have their moments, but they don't come off as characters that viewers would remember easily.<br/><br/>Shockingly, a number of the less important characters are extremely blind or stupid. The character of Ernie McCracken is vulgar along with his strong hubris. McCracken gropes women in public and yet no one sees this? How is it that the women being groped is OK with this? It's not like McCracken is Elvis or something. One character even called the man ""a role model for future generations"". Are you kidding? Of course it's supposed to make the McCracken character seem unstoppable but how do these people not see this on public television? It may baffle viewers. Editing and cinematography is OK but nothing special. One time composer Freedy Johnston's score was barely noticeable. Much of the time, the music was provided by music parodying or directly paralleling the situation being displayed. It was alright at points, while others not so much.<br/><br/>The comedy is frequently hit or miss, with its forgettable characters and repetitive gags. Woody Harrelson is the key to what helps makes watchable though."

","Kingpin is a movie beyond comparison. In fact, the only movies that can be compared to 'Kingpin', are the other two Farrelli masterpieces, 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'There's something about Mary'. The fact that American Pie was more successful than Kingpin, doesn't make it a better movie. Also, it is utterly insulting (to art) when anyone uses the Farrelli movies humor as a reference to 'Scary Movie'. <br/><br/>'Kingpin' is the second part of the Farrelli's comedic trilogy that changed the world of comedy and inspired EVERY other comedy that came in the new millennium. The story is about an ex-bowling player on a road trip, to find his lost dignity. Woody Harrelson is brilliant as the leading actor and Randy Quaid is great too. Bill Murray is one of best  comedians of our times and delivers as usual, but the supporting cast is great as well. You see, 'Kingpin' is really dependent on performances, because despite of what some might believe, all Farrelli movies are emotionally intense. It is this emotional intensity that makes the extreme scenes so funny; the audience cares about the characters and whatever happens to them.<br/><br/>It is the craftsmanship of the Farrelli brothers that made the transition from the humor prior to 'Dumb and Dumber' to today's movie humor so flawless. Unfortunately, it also give license to the opportunists, to offend their audience by including gross out scenes in their movies, without having the aesthetic taste to achieve it properly.<br/><br/>Still, the acceptance of movies like 'Scary Movie' ('Kingpin' scores barely one point over 'Scary movie' on imdb), created a field of competition that destroyed even the latest Farrelli creations. We will have to wait until someone comes up with something as brilliant as the Farrelli movies of the 90's, in order to get rid of this situation.<br/><br/>10/10"

","When I was a kid, Beaver Valley Bowl always seemed so intimidating. How strange then that it's the place where Roy Munson has his hand smashed and his bowling career ruined.

They didn't fake a single thing about that place. It has always looked that frightening.<br/><br/>Kingpin is filmed in and around the bowling alleys of Pittsburgh. You can see just about every major lane in the film, other than my favorite, the Hollywood Show Lanes inside Arsenal Lane with their giant photo of Telly Savalas, autographed with ""Who loves you, baby?""<br/><br/>I'm sure that everyone has seen this movie, but you'd do well to watch it again and appreciate the magic that is Bill Murray in this movie. Every single moment he's on screen is perfect. That scene where he bowls three strikes in a row? That's real. He also ad libbed just about every line in the entire movie.<br/><br/>It's worth remembering that before assassins began hunting down Randy Quaid, he was a pretty wonderful comedic actor. This is also probably one of the first times that many realized who Lin Shaye was.<br/><br/>At one point, Michael Keaton was to play Munson, with Chris Farley as Ishmael and Charles Rocket as Big Earl. Jim Carrey was another choice to play the evil bowler.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that the character Seabass from Dumb and Dumber (played by Cam Neely) is a confirmed relative of this movie's Skidmark, who is Roger Clemens.<br/><br/>Many of the lanes in this movie are gone.

","Roy Munson is a character that you think you're gonna like but don't then do again. Munson is played by the great Woody Harrelson. Kingpin is a movie that with some of the characters, you think you're not gonna like but you do anyways. Like with Claudia(Vanessa Angel). she seems nice at first, then turns into a bitch, then turns into a user, then redeems herself in the end. Kingpin is a hilarious comedy from The Farrelly Brothers(Dumb & Dumber, which I love, and There's something about Mary, Which I also love). This is the second film by The Farrelly Brothers and by their second film they proved how great they were. The Farrelly Brothers still do good movies now days. Kingpin is a movie that I never would've given a chance. But I bought it because I wanted to see what it was like. This was a couple of months ago. I laughed incredibly hard. There are many hilarious scenes in Kingpin including a fight between Vanessa Angel and Woody Harrelson. There are a lot of great performances by Bill Murray. Bill Murray isn't in it that much, but the scenes that he is in funny. If you weren't satisfied with The Big Lebowski(You have to be high if you weren't), then see Kingpin.<br/><br/>The Plot: Famous bowler Roy Munson's life is destroyed when a fellow enemy bowler rats him out after they scammed some bowlers. Years later, Munson is a loser living by himself with a hook and has a bald spot. One day he stumbles across Ishmael, an Amish man who he spots bowling and thinks that he is good. so Munson tries to convince Ishmael to bowl in a competition for money."

","Readers: Information about the film's plot/outcome may be revealed in the following review.<br/><br/>
I felt that Kingpin was a hilarious picture about a man down on his luck.  Woody Harolson portrays Roy Munson and he does a great job in doing so.  The Farely Brothers have done it again with their will to use ""stupid humor"" to add to the film's hilarity.  A perfect example of this is the constant flailing around of Roy's and Earnie's colm over.  It was a perfect way to, while nothing funny was going on, be able to laugh at the stupidity of their hair. The fact that Ishmail was a big omish guy who loved bowling and had virtually no clue as to what is going on in the world, gave the film that certain attribute that ignorance is funny.  Even the simplest things that he didn't know were amusing, for example, the scene in which Ishmail insists on getting the beer for Roy instead of Claudis.  Ishmail's nipples harden, which defeats the whole purpose of the distraction by Claudia.  He just doesn't understand, and that is what is funny.  Randy Quade gives a performance that brings out the fact that his character is innocently ignorant. The fact that Bill Murray's character is such a jerk gives the film an additional sort of humor.  You laugh so hard for the soul reason that you can't believe the kinds of things he says and does.  For example, in the scene in which Roy and Earnie are sitting down for lunch after Roy's car broke down, and Roy is eating so obnoxiously, Earnie tells him to go outside and finish it.  The only reason that the viewers are laughing is because they can't believe how big of a jerk he is.  That is exactally the kind of humor the film needed. I recommend that if you haven't already seen this film, that you consider checking it out.  I believe that it is a true comedic masterpiece. It will keep you laughing the whole way through.  The Farely Brothers have provided the film culture with another picture that will always be good to turn to if a laugh is needed.<br/><br/>J. D. Evans<br/><br/>P.S.

","Warning small spoiler....<br/><br/>This movie is about what you should expect from the Farrelly brothers. Crude and juvenile humor based on bodily functions yet at the same time a subtext of sophisticated cultural references and fleeting brushes with true drama. Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray are excellent as two feuding professional bowlers. Roy Munson(Harrelson) is a small town hero who's ticket to fame ends when he loses his bowling hand due to the Ernie McCracken(Murray). Bitter and resentful Munson lives a sad and pathetic life in exile. Harrelson plays the role of Munson to painful perfection with his pitiful comb over and reliance on booze to get him through the day. ""I only get sick when I don't drink."", Munson says to Ishmael(Randy Quaid), the Amish bowling phenomenon in whom he places his hopes of redemption. Along the way to Reno and the bowling championship Roy and Ishmael pick up Claudia(Vanessa Angel). In spite of her obvious beauty Claudia isn't any better off than the wretched Roy. These three losers reluctantly rely on each other to attain their own idea of redemption. Ultimately this is a story about the characters struggle with failure and their ability to forgive themselves and move on. The most poignant scene of the move comes when Roy returns to his home town in Iowa. When he returns he finds the town's fortunes haven't been any better than his own. Set to the haunting Freedy Johnston song This Perfect World this scene would be at home in any respectable drama. As Roy drives through the town his memory returns to the town of his childhood only to dissolve back to it's current desolate state.  In spite of all the laughs and gags this is the scene that resonates. The laughs are present in abundance but don't let that fool you; there is more to this move than that, if you want to see it."

Harrelson, a bowler with promise who was robbed of his golden moment, as well as his bowling hand, hits back years later, teaming up with the most likely of partners, an insecure Amish man, played by character actor, Randy Quaid, this unfunny mess of a comedy, not the first film, he's been wasted in. They also met a hot pro, with a nice heart, on the run from some bad guys, (yeah, shades of Dumb and Dumber) where a romance blossoms between her and Harrelson. Harrelson returns to the bowling scene, getting back at his nemesis, Murray, in fine devious form, an actor you have to witness to appreciate his method. This too long film, although Quaid, is fun to watch, is just an opposite misfire to the Farelly Brother's former hit. If a Farelly fan, and you haven't seen this, you're doing yourself a favour, snubbing this one off, believe me."
"johnnyboyz","5","3","8","14 September 2007"," Why filmmakers decide to mix sport with COMEDY is beyond me and Kingpin is a good example of why not to.
","Something I've found with sports films is that the less funny they are, the better. When I say 'less funny', I mean when they're not attempting to be comedies. Some of the best sports films from down the years have been the ones that don't show sports as a joke; films that don't send up the sports and films that don't try to be funny. Raging Bull, The Hustler and The Colour of Money are amongst these examples with The Hustler and The Colour of Money particularly relevant examples. When it comes to humour in sports films, Happy Gilmore is probably the only one that I actually liked and which was supposed to be a comedy; odd how it too features a mentor with a false hand. Because of this, that means Kingpin is, in my opinion, a failure.<br/><br/>This is quite a bump landing for Woody Harrelson who went from Natural Born Killers in 1994 to this junk with the mediocre but fun Money Train in between. Here, he doesn't play a cross country killer but a cross country bowling coach called Roy Munson as he coaches a protégé called Ishmael Boorg (Quaid). This is where the references to The Hustler and The Colour of Money come in  Kingpin is a failed and flawed version of these two films but with bowling replacing pool right down to the way the final tournament (in The Colour of Money) is started as each competitor simultaneously takes the first shot in their respective match.<br/><br/>Kingpin has several basic things wrong with it that makes it disgusting, unfunny, badly paced and frustrating. I feel the biggest problem is the casting of Randy Quaid as the shy, innocent and all round good guy Ishmael. There's something I can't quite put my finger on that's wrong with it because the guy's delivery is flat and unfunny and the character in general is just too inconsistent. He's oblivious to the world despite his age yet can give monologues about life and how bad smoking is to people and inspire them to think differently. The fact he's also a complete idiot doesn't help the consistency of the character either. Also, the humour in Kingpin is rather pathetic yet at the same time, grotesque: the 'milking' of a bull scene was disgusting, the sex with the old landlady and the subsequent shots of Roy vomiting was uncalled for, the kissing of the elderly relative with the huge beard was nasty and topping it all of was Ishmael/Quaid himself dressed as some sort of drag queen stripper. None of this was funny or even pleasant to look at so you can imagine how very surprised I was when I realised that the script was actually written by someone over the age of ten.<br/><br/>Kingpin tries to have a heart as it forces its protagonist to face former demons back at his home town about half way through. The reason these scenes are good is because the film isn't relying on dumb humour but also because the last time we were at these locations was in the opening which was very well done. The scenes of Roy as a boy bowling in is yard, the 1979 tournament and the way the camera and the disco music combines as he enters the alley is fun and very effective so how ironic that when Roy suffers his past tragedy, the film turns into a different type of beast. How very quaint that Roy also manages to give the definition of a mentor when he's trying to convince Ishmael to become his protégé without actually saying: 'I'll be your mentor'. Also, how very quaint that thanks to weak cause and effect a love interest manages to worm its way into the plot. Kingpin is perhaps fun for the first fifteen minutes but then misses the mark more times than it should with gross, unfunny humour; bad characterisation of the protégé and just a really bland feeling that it's trying too hard to be funny as well as tragic."
"Quinoa1984","8","3","8","24 March 2001"," One of the funniest comedies of the 90's
","Kingpin is a film that might not match up to the Farrelly Brothers masterpieces like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, but it comes close.  The movie stars Woody Harrelson as a once great bowling champ who's career is ended by an injury to his hand for which he must spend the rest of his life with a hook.  But then he finds a new kid, Amish, but promising bowling guy (Randy Quaid) and finds hope for a new future.  Sounds like the setup for a corny drama, but the Farrelly's take no wrong turns in delivering big belly laughs for the overall scope of the movie.  Harrelson, Quaid and even the seductress Vanessa Angel (you might remember her from TV's Weird Science) deliver good laughs, but it is two people who steal the show and make this film utterly hilarious- Bill Murray who gives a new meaning to the word comb-over, and Chris Elliot who gives one of the funniest moments in 90's comedy in a cameo.

Just...gross and sad...oh and it gets worse as the film goes on! Highly recommended to rent if you don't like someone. Woody Harrelson fits into this pathetic role almost too well (he's a great actor!) but it was a vile role to see him play. At first it seems quaint, but as soon as Bill Murrays character shows up you can see the bad times start, and it goes downhill from there. Sad sad sad waste of everything.

After a freak accident caused by Ernie Mcracken(Bill Murray)he can never bowl again. After 17 years he meets Ishmael(Randy Quaid) an Amish who secretly bowls at the local shack and of course takes him under his wing the only way the Farrely Brothers know how.

","Why would a sane person give a 10 to a movie which the plot is about a handless man and an Amish guy that want to win a bowling competition? The answer is simple. It is a hilarious movie and one of the best comedies I ever seen. <br/><br/>It has the same sense of humor of films like the Naked Gun, and the cast is great.<br/><br/>Kingpin is a cleaver movie with a different plot(where did they came up with the idea of making a movie about a former bowling player that nowadays has a rubber hand, teaching an Amish guy to play bowling so they can win a competition that pays 1 million).<br/><br/>Definitively one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.

Lately they've lost that touch (as well as almost all the other qualities they had), but this movie is still one of my favorites from their golden age.<br/><br/>Actually i would rate this as their best film along with ""Something About Mary"" which says a lot. The story in Kingpin is nothing spectacular, but the actors all seem to enjoy themselves. Randy Quaid is awesome as the unwilling bowling Amish, Woody Harrelson great as his con-man manager and finally Bill Murray is as usual brilliant as the antagonist. Just like most of the work from the Farrelly-brothers this movie constantly uses cheap tricks and nasty comedy to get laughs from the audience. Often below the belt, often mean, but always with a tongue-in-cheek that makes it work.<br/><br/>When it comes to the combination bowling and comedy, this is number one next to ""The Big Lebowski"". Silly, sure, but also very very funny. And seeing this movie today almost brings a tear to my eye when i think about the huge and disastrous failures that are ""Stuck On You"" and ""Shallow Hal"".

As it stands Kingpin is a good gross out comedy with a few good performances and one of Bill Murrays best comic appearances.

","In a rare instance of the UK getting a movie before the US, Kingpin was a surprisingly pleasant discovery on a Saturday afternoon back in the sunny July of 1996. It has since gone on to be one of my favorite comedies and showcases Bill Murray's evil, sarcastic humor at it's finest.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson is Roy Munson a young, up-and-coming bowler who falls foul of 'Big' Ern McCracken (simply by beating him). Ern executes a cunning revenge on Roy which results in the loss of his precious bowling hand. Flash-forward 17 years and Roy is living a truly grotty life and is a complete and utter loser. His hustling attempts fall flat and it looks like he's destined for a future of failure until he meets naive Amish 'boy' Ishmael, who just so happens to be a bowling prodigy. Roy and Ishmael team-up and head to Reno, Nevada for a big bowling showdown with the diabolical 'Big' Ern.<br/><br/>Part road movie, part profound life journey, Kingpin is probably the most mature Farrelly Brothers movie and certainly their best effort so far. The script is just jam-packed with brilliant dialogue and gags, and Ishmael (or 'the kid' as they keep calling him despite the fact that Randy Quaid was 45 at the time of filming) may just be the sweetest character of all time and may even rival Cousin Eddie as Quaid's funniest role. But it is Bill Murray as 'Big' Ern who steals the movie and runs away with it. Apparently he just threw the script away and decided to ad-lib, and you can tell. He keeps the rest of the cast on their toes and enjoys himself way too much. His Unified Fund TV commercial is comedy gold.<br/><br/>It may well be one of the most underrated comedies of all time, but Kingpin is a far superior film to the likes of There's Something About Mary or Me, Myself & Irene.

In my experience, males are willing to have sex with any human, object,or animal, and don't truly care about appearance as long as it feels good. Good looks are only necessary when they're out in public.

","Kingpin  1996  Rated PG-13 for crude sex-related humor and a drug scene.<br/><br/>The film fades in. We are in Ocelot, Iowa. It is 1969. Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is an aspiring bowler, who is told `You can apply everything about bowling to your daily life.'' Little does Roy know that in ten years he will be the winner of the Odor-Eaters Bowling Championship<br/><br/>It is a day come true for young Ray, who instantly has high dreams for his future. But just as quick as they come, they disappear, as Roy meets Ernie McCracken (the always hilarious Bill Murray) who is not only a con man, but a man who Ray desperately wants to be like: smooth, cocky, smart-aleck and easy-going. Perhaps that is why Ray enthusiastically (but unknowingly) carries out McCracken's con, which is hustling an alley full of bowlers. This act leads to Roy Munson's hand being shoved into a ball return by the bowling gang, which is then chopped off by the ball return device. Ouch!<br/><br/> And so ten miserable years pass in Roy's regrettable life, whence Roy is so bankrupt and down-on-his-luck that he must sleep with his fifty-something landlady just to keep his room. He has since covered his stump with a rubber hand, which he puts his bowling ring on to be reminded of the good ol days. And then, in one instance, everything changes in Roy's life.<br/><br/>Down at the bowling alley, Roy spots an Amish man named Ishmael (Randy Quaid) with a talent for bowling, and a very good talent at that. Roy approaches Ishmael and makes him an offer. Roy will represent Ishmael, be his agent, or something like that, in exchange for a certain percentage of the profit Ish makes. Unfortunately for Roy, Ishmael refuses the offer and leaves to go home. Roy finds out later that the whole thing is a secret from Roy's family, who would never let him bowl if they knew the truth. So, Roy finally convinces Ishmael to leave his roots and they start a cross-county journey to the bowling championship, where Roy will meet an old friend by the name of Ernie<br/><br/>This film was directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, who have brought us `Dumb and Dumber,' `There's Something About Mary,' and `Shallow Hal,' some politically incorrect films, two of which were funny. (`D & D' and `Mary') It is no surprise that these are the men behind `Kingpin,' which is another irreverent comedy. However, it wasn't nearly as irreverent as I hoped, not funny enough to recommend.<br/><br/>The cast works with what they can; Woody Harrelson, fondly remembered from TV's `Cheers,' is believable as Roy, whose dreams have been completely shattered after his hand is amputated. Randy Quaid might not be quite as convincing as an Amish man, but he sure as heck is funny, and that's all I need in a movie like this. Bill Murray, however, is the best of the cast. He is at the beginning of the film, which proves to be very funny, and the end, which proves to be funny. The problem is, the scenes without Murray just drag along without any great jokes so to speak. Murray makes the film, what little he is in it.<br/><br/>I remember watching `Kingpin' on television not too far back. I remember being bored, waiting for the movie to end. I watched the whole thing for two reasons: (a) because I always watch a movie I start (b) because I wanted to review it with the full film's picture in my head and (c) Bill Murray was in it. I had to see it, just for his sake.<br/><br/>So now, I am reviewing the film, and here is my verdict:<br/><br/>`Kingpin' is worth seeing, but it is not great. The jokes work occasionally but mainly fall flat. If you do see the movie, if for nothing else, see it for Bill's sake.<br/><br/>3/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

","Only the Farrelly brothers could envision a story featuring a down-and-out has been bowler, played to perfection by Woody Harrelson, and the Amish, specifically the naive bowling prodigy played by Randy Quaid. I'm not really sure what brought these two world together in the Farrelly's mind, but whatever it was, I'm glad they thought of it. A very funny movie exploring what people will do when they have nothing to lose, not even their shame. Harrelson plays the once famous bowler Roy Munson who fell off the map in the 70s when his bowling had was removed from his body, coining the phrase ""Munson-ed,"" meaning to be at the top and throw it all away. To help pay the bills, he meets Isheael (Quaid) who has great natural talent at bowling and is convinced by Munson to go to Reno to play in the national championship. Between the Amish settlement and Reno, the two go through various adventures that often pay tribute to Ishmael's Amish naiveté, such as the confusion over who actually has to pay for a lap-dance, and famous scenes from other movies, most notably ones from The Hustler. Kingpin also features Bill Murray in one of his fantastic roles, this time as the swarmmy bowling champion Ernie McCracken. We get the sense that all of the characters in the movie are desperate, either for money for his people, Ishmael goes along on the trip to win money for his Amish settlement, or to reclaim fame and fortune, Munson, or to just be known as the best, McCracken, and it's the desperation that leads to the comedy and the human touch. The film also features Vanessa Angel as a bimbo who helps Munson and Ishmael out of tough spot, and ""Jefferson's on Ice!"" perhaps one of the funniest TV parodies in a movie.

","This is a comedy that at the start threatens to become overburdened by - of all things - a plot.  Too much time is spent on developing the characters and manouvering them into the situation that will become the driving force of the movie.  About halfway through, when all of this has been done, the movie's tone finally settles down into a steady stream of gags.  The rewards that follow make it well worth the effort of sticking with it during the opening.  There are at least three jokes over the running time that deserve to be recognised as all time classics, if not more.<br/><br/>   As has so often happened, the Farrelly brothers have managed to extract creditable performances from all four leads.  Bill Murray steals the show, but then, I don't think I've ever seen a movie where he hasn't.  The guy is a comedy legend, 'nuff said.  Quaid manages to imbue a real sensitive sweetness into what would otherwise be just a stupid character.  Ishmael IS stupid, but he's stupid with a heart of gold, and the Farrelly brothers again manage to handle the material with enough sensitivity that most moviegoers will be shocked, but not necessarily offended.<br/><br/>   This, ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" are the Farrelly brothers' GOOD movies.  ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is not in the same class."

","KINGPIN is the second movie that Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly have directed. There first movie was DUMB AND DUMBER, which was one of the funniest movies of all time. Now in KINGPIN, the Farrelly brothers have made another one of the funniest movies of all time! It's about a bowler named Roy Munson [Woody Harrelson] who loses a hand and can no longer bowl. Years later, he meets a man named Ishmael [Randy Quad]. Roy thinks that Ishmael has what it takes to win the championship so he decides to train Ishmael for the championship. They both are determined to win since they both need the championship money. Just like DUMB AND DUMBER, KINGPIN is full of crude humor, gross sight gags, sex jokes, loads of slapstick, and millions of laughs so if you liked DUMB AND DUMBER, you will love KINGPIN. There are two versions of the movie. One of them is rated PG-13 and one of them is rated R. I saw the R-rated version so I don't if the PG-13 version is as funny or not. I'd suggest seeing the R-rated version though."

"MadReviewer","7","1","2","20 April 2001"," And You Call Yourselves A Bowling Alley?
","Just on principle, any movie about Amish bowlers should be funny. ""Kingpin"", which is a Farrelly Brothers film about an Amish bowler, is not only howlingly funny, it's also sick, twisted, and one of the most underrated comedies of recent years.  While not quite up to the lowbrow genius of the Farrelly Brothers' other films (""Dumb and Dumber"", ""There's Something About Mary""), there's enough crude humor blended with a genuinely engaging story to create a film that's remarkably good.<br/><br/>Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is a promising young bowling champion who has the audacity to defeat the king of the local lanes, Ernie McCracken  (Bill Murray, in a delightfully sleazy, love-to-hate role). Ernie decides that Roy needs to learn a lesson in manners, one thing leads to another Three Stooges style, and Roy's bowling career is suddenly ended by a freakish injury, one which costs him his bowling hand.  (The sheer fact that the manner in which this is done is hysterically funny is a tribute to the Farrelly Brothers' gift for comedy.)  Fast forward ten years to a fat, bitter, and balding Roy, who suddenly spots Ishmael Boorg , a kid with a real gift for bowling . . . a sweet, innocent, Amish kid.  Roy takes the kid under his wing, and in a crude, darkly funny series of events that oddly seems to parody ""The Color of Money"", Roy begins to teach the kid about bowling . . . and about life.<br/><br/>""Kingpin"" isn't exactly the most intelligent comedy ever made -- one of the best jokes in the film involves X's efforts to milk a bull -- but it is darn funny.  Like other Farrelly Brothers films. there's also a certain level of sweetness mixed in with all the bawdy humor, which gives the film some depth and makes it more than just a 90 minute R-rated Three Stooges routine.  As stupid as some of these characters are -- and there's plenty of stupid to pass around in ""Kingpin"" -- you actually care about what happens to them. They aren't just walking punchlines.<br/><br/>Of special mention is Bill Murray, who brings new dimensions to the word slime.  With his sequined shirts, plastered comb-over, and condescending sneer, Murray looks and acts like a cross between a used car salesman and Hitler.  As Ernie McCracken , Murray relishes being loathed and hated, and man, he gives you plenty of hilarious reasons to hate him.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, if you appreciate fun, dumb, politically incorrect jokes.  B+"
"JBoze313","Null","1","2","14 November 2000"," One of the funniest movies I have ever seen
","This movie is brilliant.  It's about a run down drunk of an ex bowler (Woody Harrelson) who won a state championship almost twenty years ago, but now he's barely making his rent money.  He no longer bowls because he's missing his hand...so he's left with nothing but a hook.  Thru a series of events, he meets up with Randy Quaid who plays a really stupid Amish guy who happens to be a very good bowler.  Eventually they get together for an adventure thru the country, making their way to Reno, Nevada for a bowling championship.   The movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen, and Harrelson is hilarious.  If you buy the DVD version, it's rated R as opposed to the regular PG13 version, and I must say the R version is better.  I think they have 17 mins of added footage on the DVD.  A lot of people will see this movie is somewhat gross in spots, but I don't mind it at all, and I think it only goes to make it funnier.  Vanessa Angel, who I know from Weird Science the USA series some years ago, is pretty funny in this movie as well.   I think it's a gem, and I'd definitely give it a 10/10."

It's more subtle than ""Dumb and Dumber"" and less commercial than ""There's Something About Mary"". This is the Farrelly Brothers best film. The film pulls no punches and paints some pretty real characters. Our heroes are total losers. Woody Harrelson plays the bitter, balding bowler Roy Munsen and Bill Murray has a riot as the smarmy and salacious conman Ernie McCracken. The script goes from one nasty joke to the next, breaking as many taboos as it can. Kingpin is a combination of all our nasty character traits rolled into one film and that's what I love about it. It's honest and blunt. It deals with bitterness, paranoia and betrayal. Kingpin shows you what happens when people live truly for themselves.

Don't get me wrong though, I liked Mary, I just loved Kingpin. It's a shame that Mary turned out to be the money maker and almost no one's ever heard of this one.

","A movie about ten-pin bowling may not sound very interesting to most people. But Kingpin was pleasantly surprising.  The more obvious comedy of Woody Harrelson as Munson, and Bill Murray as McCracken, combined with the subtle comical lines of Ishmael played by Randy Quaid, results in non-stop laughs. The addition of the very beautiful and sexy Vanessa Angel enabled a romantic sub-plot to develop with Munson.  Kingpin has a bit of everything for everyone.

The Farrelly brothers have given us countless laughs, but this is their best. It brings together some of the most unexpected actors, many out of their element in a comedy, to flawlessly turn a script into a comedic work of art. The laughs are typical Farrelly gross out while remaining truly, deeply funny.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson turns in one of his best performances as the down-but-not-out Munson, wearing a ridiculous wig, outdated clothing, and always his fake rubber hand. Each scene he's in is a lesson in how to lead a comedy, and reminds one of his early days on ""Cheers"" as the bartender Woody Boyd. His co-star in Quaid is the same; whether it be the murderous, greedy Sheriff is ""Hard Rain"", or here as the hilariously simple sure relative of the ""Vacation"" movies Cousin Eddie, Randy Quaid proves his ever surprising versatility as an actor.<br/><br/>Bill Murray also fires on all cylinders as the over the top McCracken, Harrelson's arch-nemesis. Murray's last scene is one of the best in the movie; with his hair tossed every which way and his eyes flooding with tears he makes you shocked that he's only been nominated for one Oscar. Vanessa Angel is mostly eye candy but she doesn't have to make up for any acting downfalls.<br/><br/>""Kingpin"" is well-casted, well-written, consistently engaging and always funny.

","This film is absolutely hilarious, deadpan stupid at times, and more reserved and subtle at others - its the perfect hangover cure. Harrelson is fantastic as a hard-done-by bowler who got done over ('Munsoned' is the phrase later used, which is his actual name in the film to his annoyance) and is out for another shot at the big time. His sidekick is an innocent religious countryman whose style contrasts well with all the others - Murray is just great, but could have been in it more. One scene, for me, really stands out. Certainly in terms of Gramsci esque masculine humour - Murray is in a eaterie with Harrelson and tells him to 'go outside and eat that', then he tells a waitress to come back after washing off her perfume, finally he says 'hi' to a fit bird sat across the way. Her mum says 'hi' and Murray says 'not you - hi'. The younger fit bird smiles and says 'hi'. This film is just great."

Nearly twenty years later, he is an alcoholic who sells bowling supplies to local alleys. <br/><br/>One day, he meets an Amish man named Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who impresses Roy with his bowling skills. Later on, Roy reads about an upcoming bowling tournament that is to be held at the National Bowling Stadium in Reno, Nevada, with the grand prize being one million dollars. Believing Ishmael could have a legitimate chance in the contest, Roy heads to the Amish community where Ishmael resides, finding him and telling him about the opportunity. At first, Ishmael passes on the idea because he does not want his family to find out he bowls. However, once he learns that the community is in financial trouble, he agrees to go to Reno with Roy.<br/><br/>Roy becomes Ishmael's trainer, teaching him what is necessary to claim victory in the tournament. Along the way, they meet up with a woman named Claudia (Vanessa Angel) at the home of her boyfriend Stanley, with whom Ishmael has a bowling match with in an effort to win some money to get to Reno. Things go awry at Stanley's, and Claudia leaves there with the duo and they make their way across the U.S. to Reno, where Roy discovers that Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray), is bowling in the event. McCracken was involved in the situation that ultimately cost Roy his career, and this is the first time they have met face to face since that night. <br/><br/>Ishmael has an accident and breaks his wrist, which of course eliminates any chance of him competing in the contest. This leads Roy back to the lanes, bowling for the first time in years. How will he do?<br/><br/>""Kingpin"" makes one laugh in different ways. To start with, there are plenty of laughs generated by Roy's hook and prosthetic hand. The film itself is a spoof of ""The Natural"" (if you've watched that, you'll see what I mean). Randy Quaid is good as Ishmael, and Ishmael's lack of knowledge about life outside his home leads to some pretty funny moments. Bill Murray is talented at playing obnoxious characters, and he is perfect as Ernie McCracken. Vanessa Angel of ""Weird Science"" fame is also well cast as Claudia.

","It's not hard to imagine the kind of comedy you're going to get from a film that combines amateur bowling washouts, rubber prosthetics and the Amish. That's what ""Kingpin"" delivers: Lots of gags and quirky, dumb characters. Impressively enough, however, the Farrelly brothers make slapstick feel fresh in this film with tons of obscene, crude and even plain old disgusting humor. This not a film for those who find no humor in stupid, for those who do, ""Kingpin"" is a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson stars as Roy Munson, the 1979 Iowa amateur bowling champion whose life goes south when he gets cheated by Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and it costs him his bowling hand. 17 years later he meets Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) in a bowling alley and sees an opportunity to turn his life around. After convincing Ishmael to leave his Amish community, the two set forth for Reno's $1 million bowling tournament, teaming up with Claudia (Vanessa Angel) along the way.<br/><br/>This is a cross-country (Pennsylvania to Reno) comedy adventure where each scene has a bunch of obvious gags, but they're clever (not overused) and usually short and sweet instead of drawn out. That, and the Farrelly brothers also supply some ""unspoken"" humor like Roy and Ernies' hair flying in several directions throughout the film. So there ends up being a lot to laugh about in this film, which helps a lot with the sort of aimless plot.<br/><br/>Harrelson and Quaid are great in the film, though Billy Murray is the actor who really takes this film to the next level. The film's climax is all about utilizing his talents as a comedian and he helps make an okay scene (the climax to an aimless plot) way more tolerable to get through. The rest of the cast is pretty bad with the exception of Lin Shaye as Harrelson's landlady, a scene which deserves no spoilers. Angel is pretty terrible (other than her looks). She lets her British accent slip out a lot and I didn't know she was from the UK before I watched this film.<br/><br/>This is a great movie in you're in the mood for some really creative silliness.

","I knew about the leading actor, I knew the premise of the film (about bowling, although it sounds like a gangster film), but I didn't it was directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Basically Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was raised by his father at a young age to be the best bowler in the world, and in 1979, all grown up, he was growing as a champion. Unfortunately his talent was cut off (literally) when fellow bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and him got into a misunderstanding, and Roy lost his bowling hand. Years later, Roy is now living with a metal hook, and a connectible rubber hand, and works as a travelling salesman, but he is going downhill, until he sees the opportunity to get back into the bowling world. One night he sees a skilled bowler, Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), an Amish who secretly went away from his farm to bowl (and he would get disowned if the other Quakers knew). Roy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer to make the world's best bowler, and Ishmael is actually finding life outside the farm quite fun. Roy does soon encounter now top ranking bowling champion Ernie, now obviously his nemesis, and Roy gets his chance to prove he still has his skill (even with the rubber hand) when Ishmael breaks his hand, and he takes over at the ultimate bowling championship. In the end, you don't expect Roy to lose (by one point), but at least he gets the girl, Claudia (Vanessa Angel).

","This great comedy made me laugh a lot; it is really one of the best comedies that i have seen sort far; Bobby and Peter Farrelly definitely are masters in this genre, that maybe is one of the more hard to achieve. I think that pulling tears from the public is hard, but pulling laughs from the audience is as hard or harder than that!, this movie did it masterfully. I really was amazed of how Bill Murray as Ernie McCracken could perform such a hateful character, he does, and the impression that i felt was totally of hate for McCracke, great for Murray's performance!; the music is simply spectacular, the song played by Blues Traveler is great!, this movie also have a soundtrack worth to buy; some Urge Overkill song is heard in the movie too. But the thing that finally i liked most was that this movie, being a comedy, give a good lesson for life, for honesty and care for the others; you have to see the movie to the end to understand this!. Some scenes that i loved where the bully milking, the strip dancing of Ishmael, the hand on breast, etc, I laughed in this movie, and when i think about it some smiles come again.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MOVIE: Woody Harrelson is Roy Munson a great bowler trained by his dad since he was a child and who was the Nevada state champion of 1979 beating the hateful Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray), after this in some incidents with bets with some bad guys Munson lose his right hand, and his career was spoiled, he isolates and start to drink, wasting his life. 17 years after that, he mets an Amish man, Ishmael Borg (Randy Quaid) who show a special talent for bowling, he tries to convince him to compete, but for his traditions he prefer to stay at home. Munson see in Ishmael a chance to go back to success and try by all means to convince him to compete. They start to live trough some great and funny situations while trying to earn some money, in their way the met the beautiful Claudia (Vanessa Angel), whose love for money make her join to the party and share with Roy and Ishmael some funny moments while they want to get to the Bowling 1 million dollar Championship.<br/><br/>Great, totally great funny movie! 8/10!"

","I have heard quite a bit about Kingpin, about how funny it is and how great the actors were together, this film was on the top 100 funniest films of all time and not to mention that I heard a lot about it from my friends. I thought that it was a pretty decent comedy that I had fun with, especially the finally bowling scene with Bill Murray, he was the one who truly stole this film. But the entire cast was so great and special, I think anyone could laugh a few times from this film.<br/><br/>Roy has been brutally disfigured in a bowling game when his partner, Ernie, leaves him to a horrible disfiguration of getting his bowling hand cut off. Years and years later, he finds Ishmael Boorg, an Amish farmer who bowls extremely well, but he doesn't want his family to know that he can bowl, but after begging and begging, Ishmael decides to be with Roy in a huge tournament for a huge cash prize. Through the trip they make, they become the most unlikely of friends picking up a hot woman, Claudia.<br/><br/>Kingpin is one of those films you don't forget and I will guarantee the minimum of one laugh, especially when you see these grown men have comb overs and are acting like little boys in the the competition together.

","It could be not only the worst comedy in 1996, but one of the worst in the history of cinema. ""Horrible"" is a little word to describe everything and everyone in here. For Bobby and Peter Farrelly, putting message in a movie would be something they would do later, because at the days of (Dumb & Dumber - 1994) and (There's Something About Mary - 1998), they were in the dumb zone, playing the adolescent game of who can come up with dirtier stuff than the other?! They were determined not to make nice time, only an ocean of sperms & spews which stands for nice time for them! If being a comedy means making me laugh, then this one didn't make me laugh or smile. Instead, it made me feel how sickening that was, how easy making nauseating comedies is, and how scary culture might degenerate. Without an atom of exaggeration, movies like this prove the collapse of civilizations, and the withdrawal of man to savagery. Funny for you or not, just give it some thinking, and maybe, just maybe, you'll be as scared as me."

","""Kingpin"" is either the grossest funny movie or the funniest gross movie I have ever seen. Few comedies, even good ones, can make me laugh so hard that I cry, but this one did. Half the time I was laughing; the other half, I was shaking my head at the raunchiness of it all. If you can watch this movie without laughing uncontrollably, you should consider replacement surgery for your funny bone.<br/><br/>As others have said, the cast is perfect. Vanessa Angel is so hot I was afraid my VHS tape would melt. Randy Quaid (looking a lot like a much larger version of the Little Dutch Boy) is dopey and lovable. Woody Harrelson is smooth and cocksure when he should be, and pitiable when the situation requires it. And the always amazing Bill Murray might be the most detestable (but hilarious) egomaniac on celluloid - it is no small feat to be both detestable and hilarious.<br/><br/>I have no idea how ""Kingpin"" qualified for a PG-13 rating. Even an R is a stretch, although there is no nudity or graphic violence.<br/><br/>The movie has a kick-ass soundtrack, but perhaps a few too many songs. Music should enhance a film, not overwhelm it, as it sometimes does in this case.<br/><br/>In the midst of all the vulgarity and chicanery, there is even a moral. After spending seventeen years drunk and in denial, Roy (Harrelson) comes to realize that, in the end, we have no one to blame for our problems but ourselves."

","Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid are tragically funny in this vehicle wherein a washed up, one-handed participant of the national bowling circuit recruits an Amish farm-boy nobody to help him pull various scams to get to a bowling tournament in Reno with a million dollar payoff, all unbeknownst to the Amish nobody.<br/><br/>Harrelson is the star, with Bill Murray taking the part of his competitional nemesis. Harrelson actually surprised me with his performance herein. I do not know what I expected really, but his performance surpassed those unknown expectations. Randy Quaid is so not Amish that it was amusing watching him as a man who is not Amish, trying to pretend to be Amish, convincingly, and not. But he did not mean to be convincing. It's merely the tenor of his performance which makes you half buy into his Amishness (if you can dig it).<br/><br/>The weakest element here was Bill Murray. I hate to say that, as I have been a fan for thirty years, or so, but he is not nearly as great as his ego makes him believe, and his arrogance in this vehicle lost its humor when the character's megalomania too closely approached his own, thereby rendering the character a non-character in my book, and negating his performance as a performance.<br/><br/>All in all, this is amusing, but not highly so, and is seriously overrated by the users here at IMDb. ""The greatest comedy of the 90's"" it isn't! It rates a 4.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","My favorite actor once wrote in one of his best movies "" All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" ... That's how I felt about this movie. I love a decent and serious drama or epic but sometimes I just feel like laughing silly and lower my brain activity. And Kinpin is one of the best films to do this. Sprung from the mind of the Farrelly brothers, this comedy about the bowling world is hilarious. Well acted by respectable actors and filled with great jokes and quote-material. Just the right doses of sentimental elements and (almost) never over the top. Back in 1979, Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was a very gifted bowler. Due to the bad influence of Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray in a great role) his bowling hand was mutilated by villains. Now 17 years later, Roy is a schmuck and a drunk. He meets the very naive Amish guy Ishmaël ( Randy Quaid ) who is a great bowling talent. Roy wants to take him to Reno where a bowling contest is held. At first Ishmaël doesn't want to cause it doesn't fit in his Amish way of life but when his fathers tells him the community needs money he finally agrees. The way to Reno and the search for money causes a lot of hilarious situations. They meet a gorgeous woman, Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and she joins them to their trip to Reno. All the actors give a terrific performance. All that Vanessa Angel has to do is being sexy, of course, but she does that like no other woman could. Randy Quaid is cast perfect in the role of the Amish son of a farmer. His naive way of life give us the funniest scenes in the movie. I'm a big fan of Woody Harrelson and I think he can handle comedy as good as the serious roles he played in Natural Born Killers and The People vs Larry Flint. OK, he was in the funny sitcom Cheers but the this is a whole other kind of comedy. The supporting roles are very good as well, and the landlady is the first that comes to mind. Great, I tell you !! This is my personal favorite of the Farrelly bros. Although I laughed very hard with Dumb & Dumber and Something about Mary too, this film has something special. I can't really explain what that is. Anyway, this film is highly recommended to everyone who can appreciate a good comedy and isn't easily offended. People may claim that it's vulgar, but I think that's rather relative. I think it's a lot less vulgar than those typical high school comedies like American Pie. It's more accessible for people too in my opinion."

Maybe I just don't get the Farrelly brothers type of humor if that's what you call it. There's a bunch of sight gags that go nowhere and look really lame. There are jokes that you see coming a mile off and just repeat themselves. There are some usual disgusting scenes that make you cringe. What this movie doesn't seem to have is any originality. OK so there's an Amish bowler but he comes off as stupid just so we can laugh at the predictable stupid things he does. Like the other characters he's two-dimensional and not that likable.

","If there is a category for college alternative movies, like music, I nominate the Farrelly Brothers. They're just ""off"" enough that their humor while often silly is whip-smart wicked funny. That means these guys are deftly talented. They can take liberties that in lesser hands would likely fall flat even being offensive. Instead they masterfully manipulate stupid and offensive into hilarious comedy as their debut with Dumb and Dumber hit big proving. So here we have a similar formula of two uncool guys on a wacky adventure Smartly, however, they are not even close in disposition and are serendipitously brought together by the most uncool sport on planet earth: professional bowling. These little differences make King Pin a superior film to the mega-successful Dumb & Dumber.<br/><br/>In King Pin amidst all of the possibly sharply barbed satire there is a real heart of humanity. It hovers at different times and makes an excellent sum in the unexpected ending. I always love the Farrelly Brothers pop music sound tracks and it's excellent here. They often weave in overlooked gems that are so cool and well placed. When a soundtrack elevates the proceedings it actually affects the storyline masterfully. Speaking of masterfully. Woody Harrelson plays his role of Munson so well it appears we're seeing an actual person as the actor melts into the part. It is exceptional to do this with the portrayal of a downer character playing comedy wrapped in equal parts spiraling down and barely hanging on all the while retaining a sliver of hope. Munson as a character does all this for which you can't help love the loser. What's a loser without an evil foil? That is provided in superlative fashion by none other than the slimy comedic excellence of Bill Murray as profession bowling's reining kingpin ""Big Ern"". I simply cannot imagine this working so well without Bill Murray's role. He's an absolutely perfect slime ball. Then there's the glue which binds these character's together and it's Randy Quaid. Quaid playing the Amish ""kid"" turns in one of his finest portrayals of a character, ever. Whatever happened to him in later life he had acting chops to play an utterly ridiculous role and do so in such a natural way it seems, again, that the actor faded into a very real misfit. Vanessa Angel as the femme fatale is so right her unlikely pairing with Munson and ""The Kid"" never feels wrong in spite of it being wholly unthinkable. What's happening here? It's a mini-masterpiece of left-field comedy is what."

Then you put Randy Quaid and Woody Harrelson, the Farrelly brothers on the directors' chair and you got yourself a great recipe for comedy. The comedic flow of the film is rather consistent, moving from funny situation to the next; with Ishmael's naivety and Roy Munson's street smarts the duo grows exponentially funny as approaching the climax of the film, it's rather obvious but it still evokes a warming comical sense of familiarity, which all comedy films should provoke.<br/><br/>I should not forget that Bill Murray plays Roy's sleazy rival, a part for which he absolutely marvels anyone who watches him.

","Strapped for cash, an injured former bowling champion hatches a cunning plan to coach a talented young man to lucrative tournament success in this lively comedy from the Farrelly Brothers. As per Farrelly norm, the film is littered with crude humour and childish gross-out gags. Also, as per the Farrellys' earlier 'Dumb & Dumber', there are one too many gags at the expense of a main character's naivety. 'Kingpin' is frequently funny throughout though with even some of the cruder puns (""we have a bull"") working well. Much of the film's success is due to how likable and empathetic Woody Harrelson is as the bowling champ whose life has gone downhill ever since his arm was severed. It is a character that could have easily been written as pathetic, but on the contrary, he is passionate and imaginative, going to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying the rent and to convince the talented young man (an Amish farmer) to take him on as coach. The film also benefits from Bill Murray at his funniest, some fun movie references ('The Graduate'; 'Indecent Proposal') and the way the story defies generic expectations and ends with loose ends as the fates of certain characters are not actually germane to the plot. And it is quite a warm tale that the film spins beneath its obscenities: a story of not giving up and the belief that all people can change."

Believing that Ishmael is the perfect ticket to win the money, Munson befriends Ishmael and the two men set off on a journey that neither man is likely to forget.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers show in this film (and with the original Dumb and Dumber film) that they could still make films that were funny and fairly good natured. Yes like Dumb and Dumber some of the humour is a bit crude (it's a Farrelly brothers after all), but for me most of the funny moments revolve around Ishmael's naivety when Munson pulls him into the 'real' world outside of his Amish community. It perhaps also helps that Randy Quaid gives an absolute stellar performance and does an excellent job at captivating this vulnerability. It does feel a bit mean-spirited at the start, but the bond and respect that develops between the two men is quite touching and the film has a lot more heart than I thought it would.<br/><br/>The only minor issue I had with this film is that the narrative is a bit aimless and meandering. I got the impression that a lot of the scenes in the middle could have been edited and that the whole film could have been cut to around the 90 minute mark (which probably would have made it a bit more enjoyable). However, this is a minor quibble and Kingpin more than makes up for it with the big laughs that are on offer here. Randy Quaid was the star of the show here, but Harrelson and Murray were both excellent as well. The supporting cast were also good and Vanessa Angel looks great here.<br/><br/>Kingpin plods and drags its heels at times, but it's a fine film with great performances, lots of heart and many very funny moments."

Angel plays off toughness with vulnerability as she remains one step ahead of Munson. Bill Murray steals scenes as a competing bowler who betrayed Munson and displays no signs of remorse that isn't met with sarcasm.

","This often-amusing piece of trash begins with a scene out of Paul Newman's ""The Hustler."" Bill Murray sees the latent bowling talent in Woody Harrelson, cultivates it, and they set out hustling small-town rubes. Harrelson pretends to be drunk and is faced with an impossible frame. Everyone bets against him and when he makes the spare, he and Murray split the money. That is, until finally some clot of rubes wakes up to the scam and grinds Harrelson's bowling hand off, while Murray cheerfully speeds off alone.<br/><br/>A tragic tale. Harrelson is a real down-and-outer in Baltimore, forced to service his landlady in lieu of the rent. She has a face like Euryale the gorgon and he vomits voluminously after the bout.<br/><br/>Then he gets a lucky break. He spots a young man, Randy Quaid, from a neighboring Amish town who has the same talented touch with a bowling ball, and persuades him to take to the road. They hustle their way to the million-dollar championship bowl off in Reno, Nevada, picking up some enemies along the way, not to mention Vanessa Angel. The two final contestants are Harrelson, bowling with his hook instead of his hand, and the egomaniacal Murray.<br/><br/>I didn't think it was as inventive as ""There's Something About Mary"". There is no equivalent of Ben Stiller's arrest at the roadside tea room. Yet it is funny and it gets funnier as it meanders along. Some of the gags are silly and pointless -- the burly Quaid dressed in tights and doing a pole dance. But there's wit in some of the visual gags -- Harrelson bending over a cute baby, making goo goo sounds, and chucking it under the chin with his hook while the mother's eyes bulge with anxiety.<br/><br/>And the dialog has its moments too. ""You know, you're not the most intelligent person on earth."" ""Oh, yeah, and who are you, Alfred Einstein?"" Then there are the performances, uniformly professional. We'll begin with Vanessa Angel. Yes, let's begin with her. The English-born actress has a mellifluous voice, a little throaty, and is strikingly attractive, a paragon of pulchritude. Oh, yum.<br/><br/>Quaid is a large, clumsy actor but his role rather suits him -- the stolid, God-fearing, son of the soil, who takes his first automobile ride and shortly afterwards is taking hits from a long blue bong.<br/><br/>Harrelson doesn't exactly have an actor's elocution. He has a weak voice and usually sounds as if he's reading his lines from some off-screen cue card. But he excels at light comedy, especially when the comedy has a slightly deranged quality, as it does here.<br/><br/>Murray plays it straight at first but the final confrontation in Reno gives him a chance to unwind. He is absolutely hilarious, seen on television in a parody of one of those ad miseracordiam commercials for ""Unified Way"". ""Little Charlotte here has never eaten a hot dog in her life. She lives in poverty and depends on your donations to keep her alive."" Meanwhile, Murray is copping feels from the local mothers and daughters. I laughed out loud when Murray wept with joy at the prospect of beating Harrelson at the championship bowl off.<br/><br/>I'm glad we see a little bit of what looks like Reno too. Reno is a pleasant, laid back little city. I've spent many cozy nights there at the elegant Mapes Hotel, sleeping in the lobby."

","Kingpin's way up there among my favorite comedies, now, let's see, well, um, there's Dumb & Dumber (which was made by the Farrelly brothers & is my undisputed favorite comedy), there's Me, Myself & Irene (that was made by the Farrelly brothers), There's Something About Mary (made by the Farrelly brothers), and Shallow Hal (the Farrelly bros), Stuck On You, too (the Farrelly brothers made it!), aaaaaaaaand, oh yeah, Kingpin (made by, who else, the Farrelly brothers!). Wow, the Farrelly brothers make truly great comedies, don't they? These two brothers are incredibly funny as well as incredibly talented too. There's Something About Mary and Dumb & Dumber, I mean, those two alone. Those two alone are two of the best comedies ever made! And Kingpin is not too far behind them. Kingpin is just about the funniest movie. I love it. It's so good and funny all the way through.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson is simply golden as Roy Munson, former state champion bowler. Roy Munson is a tragically lovable soul. Woody is a real good and funny guy himself. Randy Quaid is hilarious as Ishmael. Randy Quaid was meant to do comedy; he really shines on screen. Vanessa Angel is gorgeous as Claudia. Vanessa is really so smoking hot in Kingpin. Her outfits that she wears, oh my God, they're too much. I tell ya, if I was given the power to create a beautiful woman all from scratch, you know, out of thin air, like with my computer or something, while I'm wearing a bra on my head, I am pretty sure that I'd create Vanessa Angel. She's unbelievable. (Note to self, go buy Weird Science DVD boxset immediately, is that available?) Listen, I don't want to make this entire review all about how hot Vanessa Angel is (oh wait, no, yes I do), but let me just say, I crush hard on Vanessa. She's something special. Somehow, I don't think that I'm alone.<br/><br/>Kingpin is one classic comedy. If you can't believe me, just go watch it yourself, I mean, there's so much to laugh at! I gotta rate Kingpin a 7 but a strong 7, I mean, it's like honestly a 7.998, just barely under an 8, and mostly due to its story not being meaningfully heartfelt enough, that's the point I'm trying to make, Kingpin isn't meaningfully heartfelt enough to be a great 8, but it's oh so close. I love Kingpin, like I say, it's one of my favorite comedies. So all in closing, let me again say, I love Kingpin, Woody Harrelson is great, Roy Munson is a genuine hero, the Farrelly brothers are incredible, Randy Quaid's hilarious, Vanessa Angel is deeply hot, and Kingpin is way, way freaking laugh-out-loud funny! Go see for yourself! Thank you!<br/><br/>(Oh and also, I about forgot, there's this one other man who is in Kingpin, he goes by the name, Bill Murray, and Bill's about the funniest, sweetest guy on the planet, and in Kingpin, Bill plays Ernie McCracken, who's like, the funniest, meanest guy on the planet)"

","I take my comedy seriously (no pun intended). I grew up watching the original cast of SNL, three stooges and actors like Gene Wilder. They all had something special, and I think remain extremely special 30 years later. Kingpin has that rare ""something special"". I had to watch this movie a few times before I fully appreciated the ""once in a lifetime"" performances by Harrelson and Murray, and outstanding writing by the Farrelly brothers.<br/><br/>This movie, unlike most other comedies I've seen, continually provides genuinely funny moments throughout the entire movie. There are very few comedies I have ever watched that I can say the same about. It's like all the stars in the sky aligned for one perfect moment and in that moment they filmed ""Kingpin"".<br/><br/>Now, this film may not be for every one. It's crude, rude and in your face comedy. It's typical Farrelly brother fare. If you like that, or even if you don't and just like the silly comedy of Bill Murray (before he went all serious) - then this movie is well worth a watch. Definitely a 10 out of 10 in my book."

","Following their success with ""Dumb and Dumber"", the Farrelly brothers directed ""Kingpin"", about a mangled bowler (Woody Harrelson) who trains an Amish man (Randy Quaid) to bowl. Since this is the guys behind ""There's Something About Mary"", there are naturally a few scenes with no purpose except to have a gross-out gag. But it is pretty funny throughout most of the movie, with a lot of mild gags. I suspect that the Amish didn't like it.

","Kingpin (1996) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Bowler Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) has everything in front of him until another bowler (Bill Murray) sells him out to a group of men they've just hustled and they end up cutting off Munson bowling hand, which puts an end to his career. Seventeen years later Munson is a worthless drunk who sees his chance back in the hopes of a Amish man (Randy Quaid) who he plans on getting to Reno for a big tournament. This was the Farrelly brothers follow-up to DUMB AND DUMBER and unlike that film, this one here wasn't a huge hit out of the gate and instead it took sometime to build up its cult following. I'm really not sure why this movie didn't hit it big when first released but time has been quite friendly to the raunchy comedy as it's certainly one of the better comedies of its period thanks in large part to a terrific cast, a nice story and plenty of big laughs. I think the story itself really isn't anything too special as it's pretty much your typical road movie with the biggest difference being the bowling subplot. I think what really makes this film so special are the three leads who are so perfect in their roles that you really can't imagine anyone else in the world playing them. Harrelson has always been an underrated comic actor and he does a very good job here and manages to get laughs out of the smallest stuff. Just the way he laughs or looks at someone can get a laugh but even better is the way he sells some of the jokes including a hilarious bit on the Amish farm where he pretends to know what he's doing, which leads him to ""milking"" a bull. Quaid can play an idiot like no other and make it look very easy. The way he brings this Amish guy to life is a lot of fun to watch because you really do feel as if you're watching someone real and someone experiencing the real world for the first time. Murray does what only he can as that type of comedy isn't easy and I can't think of anyone else who can pull it off. Apparently Murray ad-libbed just about every word in the film and the way he pulls this character off really helps bring in the laughs. Vanessa Angel fits in with the boys very well and manages a few nice laughs of her own as does Chris Elliott in his brief scenes. I think the film would have benefited had it lost about ten-minutes worth of footage because at just under two-hours the film is a little too long. The stuff with Angel's boyfriend isn't the funniest bits here and everything that happens with him in the second half should have been left out. The great thing about KINGPIN is that it never really delivers the type of laugh that you might expect and that's why the film works so well. The movie will have a scene set up and you might think you know where it's going but the funny part is seeing how different it plays out. The movie has some fairly low-taste laughs but the brothers were clearly just warming up as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY was just two years away."

","This was the Farrelly brothers' (Peter and Bobby) follow-up to their 1994 theatrical debut, ""Dumb & Dumber"". I first saw ""Kingpin"" in 2000, four years after its release, and again in 2003. I didn't like it at all either time, and it might have been even worse for me the second time than the first, really leaving a bad taste in my mouth. After that, I obviously hoped never to see the movie again, but that eventually changed. Seeing ""Dumb & Dumber"" twice in 2007 and liking it both times was probably major reason for that. Over six and a half years since my second viewing of this follow-up, I've finally watched it for the third time, and the first time without anyone in the room with me. This was after watching Peter and Bobby's 1998 smash hit, ""There's Something About Mary"", which really left me puzzled about that film's appeal. I can't deny that watching ""Kingpin"" again was definitely better than the first two times I saw it, above average this time, but it still wasn't always funny.<br/><br/>Roy Munson grows up bowling, learning how to play the sport from his father at an early age. In 1979, he becomes a professional, but doesn't get very far, as fellow pro bowler Ernie McCracken gets him to participate in a bowling hustle, which leads to the amputation of Roy's right hand, the one he bowls with, by a group of thugs! Seventeen years later, he has not bowled since then, and has been drinking a lot. He has prosthetic hook and a rubber hand to wear over it. For a living, he sells bowling alley equipment, but is not very successful and struggles to try and pay his rent to his scary landlady. However, one day, after failing to make a sale, Roy sees a man bowling at the alley who seems to have a lot of potential. This man's name is Ishmael Boorg, and he lives in a nearby Amish community. He has secretly come to this alley to bowl, even though it goes against Amish beliefs. Roy comes to the Boorg home disguised as an Amish man to try and convince Ishmael to enter a tournament in which the winner will get $1,000,000. After Ishmael learns that his community's land will soon be taken unless they come up with $500,000, he agrees to take part in this tournament for a good cause, with Roy as his manager. On their trip, they are soon joined by Claudia, the abused girlfriend of a ruffian named Stanley, and also meet up with Ernie McCracken, Roy's sleazy rival from 1970's who is still a popular professional bowler, unlike him! <br/><br/>The first time I saw this second Farrelly brothers movie, I think it looked promising around the beginning, but in the end, I was not impressed. I'm not sure what I thought around the beginning the second time, but the third time, it seemed nothing more than mediocre at first. However, I found that it eventually improved slightly, and there were some very funny gags through the film's run, as well as some mildly amusing ones I guess. One highlight I can think of is the staged mugging, and Roy's landlady catching him with the man who posed as the mugger. A memorable gross-out gag (something the brothers are renowned for) is the lead character throwing up after having sex with his landlady to pay her, and the landlady saying things that make him throw up more. I know it's juvenile, but I thought most of this scene was amusing the third time. I laughed a number of times during the rest of the film, sometimes with the awkward relationship between Roy and Ishmael, and some of the things Ishmael does on the trip, such as acting as a female stripper and waking up with tattoos! Unfortunately, despite all the funny parts, the film isn't quite consistent enough with the gags, plus I found some parts perhaps a little too mean-spirited, and I don't think the film features the greatest comedy characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Lots of modern-day comedians/comedy filmmakers are known for their crude humour, with lots of jokes involving sex and bodily functions, and the Farrelly brothers are among these. It's a type of comedy some people can't stand, but I think it can be really funny, and that may sometimes be the case in ""Kingpin"", though not as much as it is in ""Dumb & Dumber"". This 1996 bowling comedy doesn't have as much appeal as its predecessor, nor can it match the appeal of ""There's Something About Mary"", another 90's Farrelly brothers comedy. I know most people would probably disagree with this, but I personally think this film comes somewhere in between the other two in terms of quality. At least this one doesn't have any gag as disturbing as the genital/zipper one in the 1998 box office smash! Then again, I've never seen ANY other gag that disturbing! To me, ""Kingpin"" could have been much more consistent with the laughs, but if you're old enough to watch it and like crude humour, I won't say skip it. It would probably help if you're a fan of the sport the film focuses on as well."

But a ray of hope comes for Roy when he meets Ishmael who is a talented bowler himself and tries to recruit him for the $1,000,000 winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada. The thing is Ishmael is a Amish boy. This film was a bit darker than I expected and flows with some crude and rude humor, but it's actually quite funny at times, despite it being a bit dark. And the humor in this might offend some people even if it's not the most repulsive comedy out there or even comes close but since it sort of seem like a kid friendly comedy some may get offended. This is a funny road movie, that will keep you laughing or at least grinning in some scenes. It wasn't the most hilarious movie I ever seen but I got some good laughs out of it. The direction the creators went with this is ambiguous and isn't the stereotypical and predictable comedy, and the ending did not sit right with me and sort of made me angry. But it just shows the reality of life even if a lot of this film is down right outrageous. Soon Claudia(Vanessa Angel) is in the group as well, but I found her character more annoying than funny, she is a whore and that is the bottom line no matter what she does at the end. It just wasn't believable and it seemed like she had some other ulterior motives or just forced. I don't know about anyone else but I don't particularly think that a girl that constantly act like a hooker throughout the whole movie to be attractive. Plus in my opinion she has a butter face but maybe I am shallow. And to top it off she wasn't sexy even if some do disagree, she was only on the ride for the money and that is basically the main thing she saw at the end as well, cause her character change was just not believable. Especially since the characters are more serious compared to other comedies where the characters seem to be from another planet or just way too bizarre, stupid and retarded which sometimes adds to the comedic value, but that ain't the case for this film. I found how they turn any serious situation that are suppose to be dull into something funny which is a nice touch. Just about the entire cast was special and put on a great and funny performance. So it's a funny comedy with some crude and rude humor, just nothing downright hilarious and the comedy in this seemed a bit tacky sometimes.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

I'm not getting into the story, since so many others have done that before me already. Let's get to the characters. I'll immediately say that I liked Bill Murray the most. He was awesome, close to being g@y but gallantly maintaining manliness through the entire movie. With his character, the movie kind of insults the viewer though. For instance, how can we expect the audience to actually like him? Don't get me wrong, he's a great character, but he's supposed to be the bad guy and he doesn't have what it takes to come over as the lovable kind. That's all good, but during the bowling matches it's just not right that the audience seems to like him. His arrogance and cockiness are spread throughout and should be a reason for the crowd to despise him, not like him. I understand that for the sake of the underdog argument, he's supposed to be liked by the masses, but it would have made the movie so much better in my eyes had he been just been despised by the crowd. Harrelson is under-doggy enough already, we don't need to have that emphasized any more. That said, Bill Murray's still a great watch.<br/><br/>Randy Quaid, as the ""naive"" Amish, is great but slips up miserably at some points. The idea of having a naive Amish is lovely, it's just that at some moments, he's portrayed as plain stupid - in sharp contrast to just ""naive"". For instance, there's a point where Harrelson says something like ""Holy sh!t"" and Quaid goes something like ""Where do you see sh!t?"" I don't recall the exact situation anymore, but such things happen in this movie while they shouldn't. <br/><br/>The love triangle was kind of excessive to me. Please explain to me this: evil lover is abandoned by chick -> lover meets chick again and although it is flat out OBVIOUS that the chick didn't like him, the evil guy still falls for her again after a few cheesy lines of 'let's get back together and make things good for the both of us, I never really wanted to leave you'. <br/><br/>The 'evil lover' was underwhelming also, the 'good guys' were afraid of him but they never really had a reason to. It would have been so much, so much cooler had the evil lover type had a bunch of mean looking gangster types with guns around him. Over the top, of course, but so much more awesome. <br/><br/>There is a problem with the lady also. The first few times we get to meet her, she seems like a hard-a$$ chick who can handle herself. Then at some point, when she says something to insult the evil lover guy, the tone of the scene shifts incomprehensibly to a situation where she gets abused by her evil friend. It just made no sense to me. She shows no depth in her acting either. In the scene where she and Harrelson visit Harrelson's hometown, Harrelson holds up very well but she just lacks what it takes to make the scene really work. To be honest, the lady just slowed the movie down, while not putting anything meaningful to the table. <br/><br/>Harrelson was great, I liked his character and he put down his role pretty well. Some jokes with his fake hand were well done, sometimes fooling the viewer in a good way but also failing the gimmick once (I only saw it go wrong once, might have been more often).<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is pretty fun but with a few adjustments, it could have been so much better."

The pitch alone is worth a laugh: a one-handed bowler (crippled by thugs after a fixed bowling game!) takes on an Amish protege and heads to Reno for the national tournament.  And the cast elevates this ridiculous premise to comedy-heaven. Woody Harrelson gives a hilarious performance in the lead, and his character is surprisingly well-rounded.

","""Kingpin"" is a harmless but overall unsatisfying comedy from the Farrelly Brothers.  The premise is great, and it's nice how the Farrellys didn't let the gag involving Woody's rubber hand run its course, but it could've been handled much better.  I still have no clue why Roger Ebert voted it as one of the funniest comedies ever.  There are gags that work, and there are also gags that don't.  And there are lapses of dullness between each gag.  The cast is good.  You can probably recognize certain Farrelly regulars like Lin Shaye and Chris Elliott.  Woody Harrelson is terrific in the lead role. Then again, Woody never ceases to please.  Randy Quaid is a perfect choice as the dim-witted Amish bowler.  Vanessa Angel is great to look at, though her accent noticeably drifts at times.  One thing I do have to criticize Peter and Bobby Farrelly for--and this even pertains to their good movies--is they always choose dorky music for their soundtracks.  I liked the hip opening, set to ""Disco Inferno,"" but from then on it's nothing but depressing easy listening tunes that only your grandparents enjoy listening to.  Did they forget they were making a comedy???  We need something a tad more upbeat.  The only cast member I can say was wasted was Bill Murray.  He tries to get a few chuckles, playing an ultimately mean-spirited character, and he has very little screen time.  I'm not placing the blame on Murray, I'm placing the blame on the screenwriters.  If he had some good material, his appearance would've been more memorable. <br/><br/>There are only 3 scenes that made me laugh out loud, one being the hilarious barn-raising scene where Woody lets go of the ropes and the barn comes toppling down.

","What makes a great comedy?  Funny scenes.  Funny characters.  Funny dialogue.  ""Kingpin"" has all of these qualities and in large doses.  It's one of the top ten comedies of the past ten years, and in my opinion, the crowning achievement of the Farelly brothers thus far.<br/><br/>""Dumb and Dumber"" was hilarious.  ""There's Something About Mary"" took the romantic comedy to a new level.  But ""Kingpin"" stands out as the most bizarre and likeable film of the Farelly trilogy.  Much like the ""Billy Madison"" of Adam Sandler films, ""Kingpin"" is not so much funnier than the rest of the Farelly Brother's movies, as it is more weird and awesome.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that drag, and I don't think Randy Quaid's character is as funny as it should have been, but everything else here is gold. Woody gives a great comedic performance.  Vanessa Angel has a great chest (""and those babies are real!"")  Uncle Willie, Chris Elliot, and the landlady are superb.<br/><br/>I could write an epic poem on the greatness of Bill Murray in this movie, but I won't.  Suffice it to say that his performance in ""Kingpin"" is best thing he has ever done.  Its the best part of the movie.  He's not in it nearly enough, but that only makes you cherish his scenes all the more.<br/><br/>However, the most underrated character in this movie, and in cinematic history for that matter, is unquestionably the ""Great Stan"" (Vanessa Angel's boyfriend).  He represents everything that is enigmatic of the human condition.  He's simultaneously slick and weird.  He wears black turtlenecks and has a gray streak in his hair.  He beats women, and makes fun of the beating of women, while respecting the beauty of the natural woman.  He is violent and depraved, yet he frowns upon cheating.  He drinks Coca-cola. He has some weird friends.  And last, but not least, he has a bowling alley in his basement.  Modern psychology has yet to fully comprehend such a character.  Perhaps it never will.  But one thing is certain:  the ""Great Stan"" is the best thing to ever come out of either art or reality.<br/><br/>Kingpin is a great movie."
"Patrick G. Smith","10","0","1","28 October 1999"," Harrelson and Murray are fantastic in this truly great film. Best Farrelly brothers movie.
","This is the best Farrelly brothers film. It is extremely funny but also has a great plot, unlike There's Something About Mary, which was not very funny anyway. Woody Harrelson is perfect as the down and out bowler Roy Munson. His nemesis is Ernie McCracken, or Big Ern, played by Bill Murray in one of his funniest performances to date. A tremendous film with tremendous laughs."

","I wasn't that impressed by the movie.  There were certainly funny moments, but sometimes they went for obvious laughs (i.e., Munson's hand coming off during his opening frame in Reno), where you can see it's coming and it's _still_ not funny.  Bill Murray and Randy Quaid seem to be having fun overacting, but Vanessa Angel is pretty much a non-entity, demonstrating here why Weird Science - The TV Show is probably going to be the pinnacle of her career.  Harrelson basically plays an unlikeable bastard.<br/><br/>It also strikes me that the ending is somewhat flawed.  Even in most slob-type comedy movies, isn't there a requirement that the bad guy get his comeuppance?  The only ""triumph"" of the climax we're so divorced from that through most of the movie that there's no impact when we find out about it.<br/><br/>When the gags click, they're very funny.  The whole Amish community sequence in the beginning is hilarious.  However, there's an awful lot of blank space or duds between the gags that do work.<br/><br/>Overall, Kingpin is relatively funny, but it's not as insightful as Ferris Bueller, nor does it spit out the gags the way that Airplane! does."
"Tomrad","5","0","1","20 June 1999"," Not so good...
","This really wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I don't know why - there were a few bits that really made me laugh, but it didn't seem quite up to standard against, say, dumb & dumber. I don't think this was one of Bill Murray's better roles, they just went over the top with all the ""hero"" thing, it just got sickening. Anyway, quite amusing and worth seeing if you've got nothing better to do - 5 out of 10"

","There's two great things about this movie. One, is that it is extremely funny, hilarious even. Two, it is the best movie about bowling ever. I happen to love bowling, so this is right up my alley. (Pun not intended) This movie has so many funny things beginning with the fact that it displays some of the worst haircuts in cinema history with gleeful pride. It also has the only breast boxing scene I've ever seen. Vanessa Angel is super hot and super nippely in the freezer part of this movie. And who can possibly forget Woody Harrelson's land lady. Bit part by Chris Elliot hits the mark and Randy Quaid's Amish bong-pulling sequence is monumentally famous among stoner's. This is probably the best comedy since Top Secret!"

","I'm a huge Bill Murray fan, but even he can't lift this one up.  I read someone saying the same type of ""snobs"" who hated this hated FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and AIRPLANE!.  Well I loved those movies, but I really don't see anything funny about this one.  Especially Randy Quaid, who, as he did in INDEPENDENCE DAY, seems more concerned with condescension and goofiness than creating a character and being funny.  I just don't get the Farrelly brothers, I guess."
"Robman9000","8","0","1","6 March 1999"," In bad taste, yet very funny.
","I'm not the kind of person who likes most of the comedies that come out today, but Kinpin is one of the very few that is actually funny.  It's by the Farrelly Brothers who also made the moderately funny Dumb and Dumber and the hilarious There's Something About Mary.  Of those three, Kinpin is definitely the best.  The laughs keep on coming, even when watching at home on video.  Naturally there are a few gags that didn't work for me, but they can easily be overlooked.  All the gags that work, work very well and receive long, loud laughs.  Another surprise, Chris Elliot is actually funny. He's only in it for one joke, about five minutes, but it works very well. See this movie if you aren't easily offended, and like big laughs."
"party","9","0","1","16 February 1999"," Bill Murray having a ball!
","Contrary to many critiques of the film, I think Kingpin hits the spot.  This outrageous comedy from the Farrelly brothers (their best effort in my view) is a road movie with a difference! Brilliantly cast Woody Harrelson guides the delightful Vanessa Angel and dutiful Randy Quaid across the U.S, dodging sex starved fogies and robbing sheep-loving yokels to reach the mecca that is Reno.  Having sampled Ms Angel's pins, we get caught up in the 10 pin duel between Harrelson and the undoubtable star of the movie..Bill Murray. The genius of Murray is on show for all to see, and he simply cannot be beaten for sheer comic timing.  The final bowling scenes are terrific, with Murray - clearly enjoying himself - playing the crowd for all its worth."
"juan-3","9","0","1","23 September 1998"," One of the most cruel but funniest movies I've seen
","A movie that begins with a bowling player whose hand gets torn off is a strange way of introducing a humoristic story. But it is humoristic. All the actors are outstanding, but Bill Murray is in a league of his own. Some of the scenes are gruesome but the farce involved in it is truly witty and amusing. Pay special attention to the tribute to 'The Graduate' between Woody Harrelson and the hideous landlady."
