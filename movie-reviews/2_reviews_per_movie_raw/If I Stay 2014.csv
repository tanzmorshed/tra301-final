","If I stay is a beautiful, moving film about a teenage girl and the life or death decision she must make. Mia is a teenage girl that has a wonderful, quirky family, a boyfriend who loves her to pieces, and a bright, ambitious future. But, all of that changes when she and her family are in a fatal car accident. While Mia's body is in a coma, her mind journeys back to all of her memories, triumphs, heart breaks and future. She has to make the decision on whether or not to fight and stay alive, or let go and leave this world. Will Mia stay? <br/><br/>I love this movie. It made me laugh, cry and it helped me to see all of the good in my own life that I should cherish, because you never know when it could all change. The cinematography is beautiful. Most of the film is filled with memories that Mia has and the way they are portrayed is very neat. The music is also beautiful. Mia is a cellist and a lot of the film focuses on her dreams of becoming a successful musician, so the film is filled with beautiful classical music. <br/><br/>My Favorite character is Mia played by Chloe Moretz. This film shows so many aspects of Mia's life, so it's easy to find something to relate to. She has a great passion for playing the cello and dedicates most of her life to it. She has difficulties relating to her parents and even her boyfriend since their musicals tastes are far more edgy than hers. She has to face her insane loss and she has to choose between many different things in life. There's something about her life that I think anyone can relate to, so she's a wonderful character. Chloe does a wonderful job portraying everything she's going through and she moved me to tears many times.<br/><br/>This film makes me think about my own family and everything I would do for them. It makes me think of my life and all the joys and sorrows I've faced. There was not a dry eye in the audience because this film provokes unique memories for every individual. I felt especially connected to Mia's family because I too have a younger brother and am very close with my parents, so I was very touched by Mia's situation. <br/><br/>I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 because of the intense emotions and mature content. Make sure you check out If I Stay in theaters August 22nd.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

","What sleight of hand! A moving love story between a high school cellist prodigy & a rising rock star (slightly older). If I stay implies a choice is to be made. Perhaps there is. Who am I to say? If there is no one knows for sure, & if they proclaim otherwise, they are a clear & obvious fraud. This story revolves around this existential question & successfully gives deep & equal background for both. Many will flat out cry, & I remember two instances of prolonged hard blinks, fighting off tears.<br/><br/>The maturation of Chloe Grace, as I call her, has been sublime to watch. I rarely watch Carson Daly, but remember the genuineness & wit from his interview with her before an early hit movie. This was ingrained into my memory as someone to keep track of. She displays masterful acting, as the female lead. If I could buy stock in an actress, she would be my blue chip 1st choice.<br/><br/>It gives me great pleasure to recommend this movie. It was enjoyable to see the clear chemistry between boy & girl. They were successful in portraying the emotions of true love, the give and take, and sacrifices that make it endure. Chloe Grace Moretz outshines everyone else in the story. The supporting cast was good, but never had the chance the moment she was cast. The ending seems predictable but it was far from it. The director makes two equally compelling cases for her choice. Enjoy this movie about young adult love, and don't be surprised if you compare it to your own love stories. I rate this a very solid 7/10 stars on the back of Chloe Grace's performance. Others, who enjoy this genre more than I, may well rate it 1-2 stars higher. Chloe Grace continues to rise in her mastery of the art.<br/><br/>Knox D. Alford, III"

","Anyone interested in this film already knows the premise by now if they have read this far, so I won't rehash it.<br/><br/>All I will say is that this film could have easily been contrived and cheesy and hokey and clich√©d but rather, the end is result is truly one of the finest, most real representations of youth and love I have seen in a long time. And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I have not cried in a film so much since....""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly is.<br/><br/>Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited, the fact the a bunch of tween girls went ""Huh? What? That's the end?"" when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to overstay the welcome.<br/><br/>Make sure you have some Kleenex."
"deprofundisss","Null","22","28","11 January 2015"," Didn't appreciate it as much until an accidental 2nd viewing
","I thought it was pretty good the first time. To be honest, I was half asleep when I first saw it, to the extent that I didn't realize I had seen it just based on the name of it, so I accidentally started streaming it today without realizing I had seen it before several months ago. I know, this doesn't sound supportive of this movie. For the record, I almost never watch movies more than once...I get too bored. After it started this second time, I did realize immediately that I'd seen it before, but I figured I'd stop it the moment I became bored, which I knew was inevitable given that I'd seen it before. Well, somehow I watched it all again, in its entirety. This time, I saw more depth than I'd seen before. Bottom line, this is worth watching. Of course, it's not perfect, and the main character looks like she's 12 rather than 17 or 18, which is a little bit creepy. But it has heart, and it's beautiful. Granted, I don't totally agree with the ending, but up until then it brought up questions that were very meaningful for anyone who has experienced loss. Kudos to this movie for being unexpectedly watchable for a 2nd run, and for actually being better another time around."
"phd_travel","10","78","117","4 September 2014"," Real and genuine - a cut above the rest
","This is a well balanced romantic drama. The movie has a good balance between family tragedy of a horrific car accident and teen romance of young love. Also the theme of music is well shared between classical cello and Pacific Northwest rock band. The romance is a convincing tale - not too passionate for their age but with the real problems of differing paths and East Coast (Juillard) vs West Coast (rock band). This is a problem that face many couples and it's good to see proper issues as the problem instead of trumped up melodrama. The story felt more real than ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and less sentimental too. In fact although the tale is a sad one, it's the best of the recent teen based romance movies far better than ""The Giver"".<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz proves she can do anything from horror (Carrie) to action (Kick Ass) to moving romantic drama. Her face is sensitive and expressive. Even though she is very pretty she is such a good actress she can still pull off the shy musical prodigy without being fake. Her love interest is played by Jamie Blackley who does a good job without overacting. He isn't too good looking so it's a believable romance. The ex rocker type parents seem like they couldn't have had such a beautiful daughter but never mind. Stacy Keach is surprisingly effective as her grandfather.<br/><br/>Well done - moving, involving, rings true."
"guchrisc","Null","58","88","2 September 2014"," A lot of music and tears in this teenage romance tearjerker love story.
","A Warner Brothers/MGM film. 'If I Stay' is a tearjerker film about a teenage-girl who experiences an out-of-body experience whilst in a coma.<br/><br/>The teenage-girl is played well by Chloe Grace Moretz. As film opens we discover that she is part of a sickly-sweet family that seems just too perfect. Off out together, they are involved in an accident. Miss Moretz's character, Mia Hall, comes to, but does not understand why she is being ignored by the emergency services, as she stumbles about in a dream-like state. Seeing herself, she starts to understand, as she goes to the hospital. These scenes all occur at the start of the film, the rest of the film is based at the hospital, with the majority of the film being flash-backs.<br/><br/>Director RJ Cutler has done a good job here. The scenes at the accident are, as said, rather dream-like, thus capturing the confused state of Miss Hall. Miss Moretz captures well the disorientation of her character. Both Director Mr Cutler and actress Miss Moretz capture well the out-of-body experience. As a disembodied spirit, Mia Hall has no physical abilities thus travel can only be achieved via open doors etc.<br/><br/>Thus, 'If I Stay' is completely different from 'Ghost' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply', both of 1990. Those films were about the interaction of living breathing humans and the spirits of dead humans. Not so in this film. 'If I Stay' does however share one thing with both of those other films, a love story.<br/><br/>Flashbacks tell us that the teenage schoolgirl Mia Hall, has fallen in love with older boy Adam, played by Jamie Buckley. The two were attracted to each other, and did fall in love, but were troubled with what might be described as musical differences. Thus this film has a major musical plot-line that reminds of the recently screened 'Begin Again'. The films are similar in many ways, the major one being that we viewers get to hear a fair bit of music. Mia and boyfriend Adam are both musicians, though very different ones. However the music does provide one further link to 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'.<br/><br/>The two young lovers are ably supported by a great cast, all of whom are good, but special mention should go to those playing family members. Joshua Leonard plays Mia's father. He and the Director got the flashback scenes just right, they are also funny, as we see the younger wild rocker turn into the more sedate parent. Hair-styles in those scenes was particularly good. Mireille Enos, playing the mother, has some poignant scenes with her daughter. However the most emotional scenes were with veteran actor Stacy Keach. He gives a stand-out performance, particularly in one very emotional and very important scene.<br/><br/>Preparing for her role in Kick Ass (2010), Miss Moretz trained with a stunt-crew for three months and also did most of her own stunts. For her musical role in 'If I Stay', Miss Moretz is also reported to have engaged in much musical study. Last year she gave a tremendous performance in the 2013 remake of 'Carrie'. Here, in 'If I Stay', we once again see Miss Moretz play a somewhat shy girl, that sometimes seems dreamily unaware, but that at other times capture perfectly the utmost depths of the rawest of emotions.<br/><br/>Shauna Cross wrote the screenplay of the Gayle Forman novel. Director RJ Cutler has done a great job. Outside shots, particularly those featuring different seasons, were done well, ably capturing the sense of passing time.<br/><br/>This teenage love-story shares a supernatural spiritual love story like 'Ghost' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'. Like 'TMD' it also has some hauntingly beautiful music. The film is also about music and could be described as a teenage version of 'Begin Again'. If you liked any of those films, then 'If I Stay' will appeal to you.<br/><br/>This tearjerker deserves 10/10 but needs a hanky."
"cschultz-2","8","12","15","4 June 2015"," Affecting, Without Being Manipulative
","'If I Stay' is without shame a picture aimed straight at the tear ducts, presumably in the belief that a good crying spell is both therapeutic and cathartic for the spirit. And the picture mostly works hard to earn its tears honestly: The characters are attractive and appealing and likable, and the actors playing the characters also are attractive and appealing and likable. This is the rare picture which features no bad guys. Everybody's a good guy.<br/><br/>Based on Gayle Forman's 2009 young adult novel of the same name, 'If I Stay' chronicles the emotional experience of a buttoned-up 17-year-old cello prodigy Mia Hall, played here by actress Chloe Grace Moretz, and her worlds-colliding romance with an up-and-coming young rock-and-roll guitarist named Adam. That both Mia and Adam are on the cusp of professional breakthroughs in their musical pursuits accounts for most the of the ups and downs in their relationship.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, their romance is in the middle of one of its downs when Mia and her family are involved in a catastrophic auto accident, casting Mia into an out-of-body experience in which she can observe the people she loves, but not communicate with them or interfere with their actions.<br/><br/>'If I Stay' is a picture that gives you the kind of satisfaction you get from being on time for an appointment, following your doctor's orders, eating the right cereal, taking your medicine as prescribed, or getting a flu shot: You might rather be watching 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' a 'Fast and Furious' movie or 'The Expendibles,' but you just know that a movie with this much cello music in it has got to be good for you.<br/><br/>And it is fairly good. Young Mia has wonderful support from her parents, a set of amiable former rockers played appealingly by Mirielle Enos and Joshua Leonard. Leonard especially, late of 'The Blair Witch Project' hysteria of 1999, has matured into a solid character actor and possesses a sort of good-natured, loopy appeal which in 'If I Stay' contrasts nicely with the buttoned-up performance of Moretz as his daughter.<br/><br/>In the film, it's shown in flashbacks that Mia's folks grew up and embraced responsibility when it became apparent to them that the late nights and party lights did not blend well with parenthood¬Öan epiphany which makes even more perplexing their almost pushing young Mia out the door to be with her rocker boyfriend.<br/><br/>As Mia's rock guitarist boyfriend, Jamie Blackley is somehow manages to be sullen without actually pouting, and is simultaneously withdrawn and inarticulate about romance yet strong-willed and verbose about music. You can see why Mia's attracted to Adam, but if you're like me you might be more than a little conflicted about their falling into bed quite so quickly, especially if, like me, you view the picture with your girlfriend's adolescent daughter present.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, at some point‚ÄîI'm not exactly not sure when, but I think it's about an hour into the picture‚Äîthe narrative becomes sticky and manipulative, and the picture begins to rely on broad characterizations, familiar stereotypes, and the familiarity of plot devices from movies past, to sort of swindle the tears from the audience.<br/><br/>And that's too bad, because by that point I'd already decided I enjoyed the picture, and was unprepared to modify my opinion. That the scene which I believe began the manipulation featured the showcase moment for veteran actor Stacy Keach, as the crusty but lovable old Grandpa, made the cheat seem even more unexpected and surprising. Keach, much like Robert Loggia, seems like such an honest, sturdy, and dependable actor.<br/><br/>But having said that, about 80% of the success of 'If I Stay' belongs to young Chloe Grace Moretz in the central role as Mia. Moretz is earnest enough in her craft to make us care about young Mia even through her most puzzling and selfish interludes.<br/><br/>Moretz followed 'If I Stay' with a supporting role the high-profile action film 'The Equalizer,' with Denzel Washington. And combined with 'If I Stay' and Moretz' affecting characterization in the title role of the most recent remake of 'Carrie'‚Äînot to mention Hammer's under-appreciated 'Let Me In' and the 'Kick-Ass' pictures‚Äîit's plain that this is one young actress who's going places. Fast.<br/><br/>I liked 'If I Stay.' But I think I already told you that."
"rocketrider231","4","80","127","4 September 2014"," Watchable, but very Disappointing and Forgettable
","When I first saw the trailer for If I Stay back in April, I got chills and it quickly became one of my top five most anticipated movies of the summer. From then on, I stayed away from all other trailers and clips so that I could see the movie knowing as little as possible, to the point where I'd put the TV spots on mute and run out of the theater when a trailer came on. Based on the trailer I saw, I honestly expected something similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or a dramatic Inception. However, after having finally seen it this weekend, I am sad to report that If I Stay is nothing like that at all, and is instead probably my most disappointing movie of the summer.<br/><br/>If I Stay follows Mia, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, an 18 year old girl who likes classical music and cello, and who's still not quite over her ex, Adam (Jamie Blackley). Then on a snowy day, her life is completely turned upside down when her family and she get into a deadly car crash, sending her into a coma. In this coma, she has an out of body experience in which she needs to decides either to die and go up to heaven or live with the physical and emotional repercussions, all while flashing back to the relationship she and Adam had.<br/><br/>The movie is primarily made up of flashbacks to the relationship that Mia and Adam had, and the chemistry that the two of them share isn't very strong and can be described as okay at best. Chloe Grace Moretz is a talented young actress who really gives it her best in this film, whereas her costar Jamie Blackley ranges from decent to mediocre. The relationship between their two characters is cute and sort of fun for the first half of the movie. However, in the second half when their relationship slowly starts to go downhill, Adam becomes a jerk and is unlikeable and unreasonable, which made me have a tough time feeling bad for him when he was an emotional wreck. Also, with Adam and Mia's relationship, something felt missing. Rather than true love, it felt like a typical high school relationship where the two people think they're love, then someday breakup and later realize that they never actually were in love.<br/><br/>Then all the other characters are either annoying or underdeveloped. Mia's parents are somewhat likable, however, most of their jokes and dialogue come off as either flat or cringe-worthy. Then there's this couple who is close friends to Mia's parents, and they are present in the hospital for most of the movie and in many of the flashbacks. In one scene they talk about never wanting to have children, but then they are later seen in another scene with a baby (referred to as their son) who is then never referenced or seen again afterwards. The one exception to all this would be Mia's grandfather, played by Stacy Keach, and he had one scene in particular that I did really like (those who have seen the movie can probably guess what scene it was). Perhaps I am just being biased since I do enjoy Keach and his acting, but I do think he gave a good performance.<br/><br/>Now I have some things to say regarding the ending. I'm not going to outright say any spoilers, but I'm kind of going to imply what happens in the end. Therefore, if you do not want anything spoiled about If I Stay, skip this next paragraph.<br/><br/>Mia makes her decision to stay or leave based off of a five minute speech that one character makes to her, and then the movie ties itself up really nice in a bow and leaves everything real hopeful and bright for the characters. While I do like happy endings, I felt in this case a less hopeful ending would have been better suited to really make her decision difficult. Not Requiem For a Dream level hopeless, but rather cutting the whipped cream and cherry on top. However, I do have to say that with the route they chose, the last ten seconds of the film were perfect. The place where the last shot cut could not have been better.<br/><br/>In the end, If I Stay is just another average teen romance movie, and it's not even all that interesting. The trailer makes the movie seem like a tear-jerking drama that takes place all in her mind about her decision to live or die, when in reality, it's a high school love story consisting of 70% flashbacks that only spends a small portion with her out of body experience. I REALLY don't want to give this movie anything below a 6/10 because of how much I had been looking forward to it for so long, but I have to give it a 5/10. It's even possible that in the future my score will go even lower. While it is somewhat entertaining, If I Stay is a rather weak romance movie for teens and is overall very forgettable."

","hey I loved this movie. If a movie stirs my emotions to a point where my body can't control itself, cry, laughter, anger etc, then in my mind it's done it's job. Movies are escapism. If you don't feel like you've been transported into the movie, then you're just not into it.<br/><br/>As a father I relate to this movie, the sacrifice the father makes for his talented daughter.. It well and truly stirred my emotions. It's a 10 in my book. The concept might appear cheesy to some, but it was up my ally. <br/><br/>If you're a romantic at heart, you will enjoy this flick. If you don't want to embrace being taken on a journey of what it might be like in he next world, then go check out something else."
"ansgarlarson","1","13","19","10 August 2015"," No substance to grab you with
","While this movie's characters and plot have potential to hold the viewer's suspense throughout, this movie BORES the audience with the drawn-out, very predictable layout. As stated in any description of the movie you'll see that the main character slips into a coma and sees her situation from an out-of-body experience. She is torn between the decision to return to her life or transition to the afterlife but, she's only reviewing portions of her life already lived. These scenes have already been depicted and/or forecasted during the movie's introduction to the character in the first thirty minutes of the movie and are painfully redundant. Like I stated above, the movie has potential to hold the viewer's attention but it displays a typical low-budget ""indie"" feel with a lack of originality. The movie's only saving grace would be a ""twist"" ending but, if you find yourself still watching after an hour and five minutes, despite your own better judgment, you will be begging for the time you've wasted back. Trust me, you will be fast-forwarding through much of the movie and you will have not missed any essential details at all. You will find that the ending will only disappoint you. Save yourself, don't wast your time."
"matthewssilverhammer","1","26","43","30 August 2014"," As Bad As a Weepy Pop Song
","Music is a recurring literal and allegorical motif in If I Stay. In keeping with this tired trend, if If I Stay was a song, it would be a weapy Avril Lavigne ballad: fake, melodramatic, and boring. It's blandness to the nth degree, with little to no style OR substance to pull it out of its own self-absorbed pretension. Who will this movie appeal to? It's too slow for tweens, too tepid for adults. Unless you're looking for something stupid, vapid, depressing, clich√©d, annoying, and laughless, don't bother. The movie's essentially a fantasy for shy teenage girls: the dreamy, popular older band-boy inexplicably notices you, pursues you, and falls in love with you. She's a shy but stuck-up classical cellist jerk. Her love interest is a selfishly immature hipster jerk. They are a match made in conceited jerk heaven! But when a tragic accident puts you on the brink of death, your conscience must decide: do I keep living, or do I avoid pain by dying? This pretense could make for some interesting storytelling, with a ghost having to watch her life play out without affecting it¬Öbut nope. Moretz, who I normally like, is given nothing to work with and turns in her worst performance to date. A bevy of Portlandia-style caricatures parade around screen shooting for authenticity and consistently missing. I couldn't contain my eye-rolling at the onslaught of cynical clich√©s and bad quips about the ""power"" of music. Some decent scenes of actual musicianship, a couple of good performances (Grandpa), and a modicum of sweetness are completely overwhelmed by the inauthentic and never-ending dullness."
"3xHCCH","7","23","38","4 September 2014"," A Cello Runs Through It
","The cello is my favorite musical instrument. One of my favorite movies of all time is the Japanese Oscar Best Foreign Language film winner ""Departures"" and a cello played a prominent part in that one. ""If I Stay"" is another film in which a cello takes center stage, and I would not miss it even for that reason alone.<br/><br/>""If I Stay"" is a dramatic film about a shy cello-playing teenager named Mia Hall. She has cool supportive parents, who were once in the punk scene. Her boyfriend Adam is the front man of an up-and-coming rock band. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly with her. She is awaiting for her acceptance letter from the Julliard School. Then one beautiful winter day, a tragic car accident happens.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to good cello music, and it did not disappoint. Those music in those scenes showing Mia auditioning for Julliard were breathtaking. As it turns out though, the cello music is not the only thing good about this film.<br/><br/>This film is a tearjerker of the highest order. The script was written in very emotional language by Shauna Cross based on a best-selling novel by Gayle Forman. Thankfully, the cast, though mostly unknown except for the lead actress, does very well in bringing this script to life.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz is really a phenomenal young actress. She gained attention as the ultra-violent It Girl, the best part of the ""Kick Ass"" films. Now a little more grown-up as Mia, Moretz provides this role the grace and elegance. A lesser actress may have made those death scenes mawkish and those romance scenes cheesy. Those cello-playing scenes were killer scenes.<br/><br/>Jamie Blackley was fine as Mia's boyfriend Adam. He seemed uncomfortable at times, and his chemistry with Moretz was not entirely convincing. I like the actors who played Mia's parents Denny and Kat better, Joshua Leonard and Mireille Enos. That New Year's Day scene where Kat was drying the dishes while Mia washed was especially well-written and well- acted out. <br/><br/>I had seen Liana Liberato in her devastating film debut as a victim of child rape in ""Truth."" She also did well her as Mia's loyal friend Kim. I think this is the first time I have seen perennial bad guy Stacy Keach in a role that made him so emotionally raw as Mia's grandfather.<br/><br/>The storytelling, with its weaving in and out of past and present events, was very well-edited. However, the pace taken by Director RJ Custer can feel very slow and repetitive at certain times in the middle, which made me look at my watch a few times. Overall though, it was effective in its intention as a tear-jerking romance. Your handkerchief or tissue paper will definitely get wet with this film with its many touching scenes."
"bcgandrewej8","8","37","66","24 August 2014"," Chloe Grace Moretz's Best Performance Yet
","Normally I completely agree with meta critic but this is the one time that I do not agree. I went in with low expectations but I was completely wrong.I do not normally give out ratings without thinking about it first. If I stay is one movie that I believe is 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz performance in this movie was amazing. She is always referred to as a future great actress of the industry but I felt that she has not completely proved herself yet until I saw this film. Moretz plays Mia Hall so well and so believable. I think she portrays the love and the actions of a teenage girl in love with great accuracy. Her on scree chemistry with Jaime Blackley was on point. He also performed great. I did not expect much from him but he along with everyone else in the film performed great.<br/><br/>This movie has a little bit of everything. It makes you smile, it has music, a strong story, great acting and a lot of emotion. The film does not center around her out of body experience but centers around Mia's love for Adam. The film skips back and forth from her out of body experience to her memories with Adam and her family. This was done well and allows us to understand the love and bond that they have because it skips back to different points in their history. The story is not about god or the afterlife but simply about a choice that she has. Does she leave with her family or does she stay and continue fighting through life with Adam by her side?<br/><br/>I honestly really enjoyed this movie and thought multiple times during it that this movie is really good. I never think about movies much afterward but with this one has been on mind. The ending was perfect especially with the gasps and reactions of the audience. Best movie of the summer by far."
"nicolechan916","7","12","18","11 November 2014"," Average story but good acting.
","I was really excited to watch this after seeing the trailer, and not to say that I was disappointed but I was kind of expecting a bit more. The whole story basically revolves around her first love and whether she should stay. Though I appreciate that it wasn't as lovey-dovey as most young romances (or high-school relationships) tend to be, I would've liked if there was more to the story other than that.<br/><br/>The music element was pretty cool, and I wonder if she really plays the cello herself, because it looked really authentic. Same with the other actors in the band.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, it wasn't spectacular but it was good enough for the film. Moretz surprises me by the range of her characters, as I first knew her from Kick-Ass which is profoundly different. Blackley does a good job too, though I guess I didn't really feel the connection between the two,and maybe that's why I felt that there was something missing from the film. I didn't sympathize with them and so thought that the film was just all right. Though the parents had real character to them and they played the part of a family really well.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was that when Hall was a 'spirit' people still tended to move out of her way and it was really obvious. There was this one scene where her friend opens a door and she pushes it a bit further as if for the person behind...which was Hall as a spirit. That was not good. Do people actually see or hear her? If not, it should be consistent throughout. And it also seemed as if she could touch things, though people didn't notice.<br/><br/>Read more of my movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"kmol226170","1","45","84","7 September 2014"," I DID NOT want to stay for this movie
","Okay, let's get this over with. This was a terrible movie. Do not go waste time and money to see this. If I stay, was nothing but a big snooze party. The characters were annoying, with little or no character development. The entire time my cousin and I were looking at each other with eye rolls, laughs at things that weren't supposed to be funny, and lots of times I checked my watch to see when the movie would be over. Alright, I have to admit that it was a clever idea, but the overall production of it wasn't good at all. The music (which I was looking forward to enjoying) was mediocre, the characters all were annoying, the story line was messed up and confusing. Also, I had read the book, and it wasn't the best adaption. The whole time I was just waiting to see what happened. It was so boring, and oh, I didn't even mention the music! The cello was okay, but the music the character Adam sung was terrible. When he started playing in a hospital (bad idea you might wake people) I literally whispered to my cousin, ""if I were her I'd unplug my IV and die so I wouldn't have to listen to that awful music anymore.""<br/><br/>So, story line is a girl falls in love with a guy named Adam and is in a coma and has to decide if she wants to live or die or pass on. Pretty neat idea right? And you'd think with a story line like this the characters would be pretty cool right? Wrong!!! Mia was annoying... always complaining and for some reason I really hoped she'd just moves on and get out of this ridiculous story. Adam... he was a mess. Okay, first, he was incredibly selfish and awful. He: sneaks into her house, gets mad at her for wanting to go to a certain college far away since he won't see her (really?!!? CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM? HE HIMSELF IS ALWAYS LEAVING HER, AND NOW HE WONT LET HER LEAVE?!?) He gets mad at her for stupid things and he's really annoying, a really bad person, and a bad character. If we were supposed to be charmed by his bad boy looks and the fact the he was in a band, we weren't. <br/><br/>Also... the ending!!!! I won't spoil too much, but the entire time my cousin and I were like WHAT?!? The whole reason we wanted to come to the movie was to see if she stayed or left (I was hoping she would leave) I just disliked it entirely. I'm also a teenager, and if they were trying to impress young teenage girls, they failed. I was disappointed, bored, and was about ready to walk out of the theater. <br/><br/>Please, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this movie."

","I am actually the target audience for this movie- a teenage girl. If I Stay is about Mia Hall- the one sided protagonist- who gets into a car accident and must decide during an out of body experience if she wants to live or die. Mia is supposed to be ""quirky"" and ""loveable"" but I hated her. There are only three things she likes. 1. Cello. 2. Classical music. 3. Adam. As if there weren't enough ""I love him so much I'd waste away without him"" movies already. <br/><br/>Speaking of Adam, he was a manipulative douche bag and I feel sorry for any teenage girl who takes him as an example of a good boyfriend. Apparently, if you kiss your girl and break into her house enough, that makes it OK for you to get mad at her for making her own decisions about her own future without consulting you, which is actually a huge red flag. <br/><br/>One major plot point that didn't make any sense was that Mia liked classical music while Adam and her family liked rock. According to If I Stay, people can't like more than one genre of music, and if they like one different than someone else, it's gonna be real hard for them to get along.<br/><br/>If I Stay is set in Portland, close to where I actually live. I can say with complete certainty that Portland is a very diverse city, yet the only POC I saw in this awful movie was the spiritual black woman whispering advice to Mia's comatose body. The main characters could have been a lot more varied, but apparently only white people are good enough to make a movie about. Seriously... even the other members of both Adam and Mr. Hall's band were white and they were barely even seen. <br/><br/>Speaking of diversity, when we find out the piano player in Willamette Stone is a lesbian, it's only because Mia is jealous of her relationship with Adam. Huge red flag. Her lesbianism is only used to further the assumption that boys and girls can't be Just Friends. <br/><br/>In the same sense, Mia's family is only killed off just so Adam can be the one to motivate Mia to stay, because it's """"""true love"""""". Give me a break. <br/><br/>Don't give your money to this movie. You'd be better watching The Fault in Our Stars and pretending the cancer is a car accident and imagining the Anne Frank House as a boathouse."

","Off the top, I cannot think of a film that brought with it higher expectations. In my review of KickAss2, I pointed out that Chlo√´ Grace Moretz was not merely good in the film, she was the ONLY good thing in it, showing a knack for saucy dialog and delivery, and generally (given her age) being willing to go further with her character than other members of the cast twice or three times her age.<br/><br/>And I have always had a weak spot for these tales of life between life, Enter the Void, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Stairway to Heaven, these are some of the films that spring to mind.<br/><br/>So, how can you not have a great film here? Easy? Terrible script (so bad it should never have made it to production) along with some really bad casting choices and top it off with some of the worst editing in the history of the medium.<br/><br/>That last item is especially important since a film about someone wandering in limbo (real time) while having flashbacks (past time) requires editing at the Oscar level. Here it seems the budget can't even afford an editor NAMED Oscar.<br/><br/>Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, who verily stole KickAss2, and had the best lines in KickAss1, seems here lost and completely unconnected with her character or the hapless audience.<br/><br/>In fact, it is veteran Stacy Keech who actually steals the few scenes that he has, and for mere moments in an otherwise forgettable exercise makes the viewer CARE about what happens next.<br/><br/>Fans of Ms. Moretz (and there are many, including, don't forget, this scribe) need not feel compelled to shoot the messenger (reviewer) here, a quick glance at her bio shows her to be a very hot property now, with multiple projects underway, and many chances in her long career ahead to make up for this travesty."

","When it first came out I read the book, cried then went to see the movie where I cried yet again. The chemistry between the characters in the film is one of those which I don't think you see very often in a film. Normally films which are based on books aren't actually that similar but I thought it was fairly similar. I loved the story line and the drama in the film. It's most definitely one that I would watch again. I would recommend it to friends and family being the socialite that I am. Typical college girl me. Sigh.

All that changes after a car wreck leaves her alone and fighting for her life. Watching her family and friends at the hospital and looking back over her life she must decide to stay living and chase her dreams or let go and be with her family. First thing I have to say is that while this is a sad movie it wasn't as depressing as I was expecting. The movie did a really good job of making it emotional without feeling forced. The movie was able to stay away from becoming overly melodramatic or too cheesy. On the other hand though the movie was a little generic in some parts and you were able to see certain things coming. The whole movie you are trying to guess whether she will stay or go and I had a feeling that the choice would make or break the movie. I could see points for both sides and I have to say that I thought the ending was perfect. Overall, a movie that wasn't cheesy but it was a little generic in some parts.

"aharmas","9","24","46","24 August 2014"," Move Over... Chloe has arrived and she is very good
","""If I Stay"" is a meditative story of what we do when we have to make the ultimate choice. A teen finds herself revisiting important moments of her life at a crucial time, and by the conclusion of the movie has to decide whether she should which one of her beloved she will follow. Chloe is nothing short of sensational here, giving a very sweet, strong, and sensitive performance as the girl who has lived a very good life but finds herself at odds when she meets the young man who could be her soul mate. There's a lot of love and affection in this movie, and it is very painful to see that there are times in life when pain rears its ugly head, and there's not much we can do about it.<br/><br/>Mia (Chloe) is born to a loving pair of free spirits. These two Denny and Kat (Mirelle Enos and Joshua Leonard) are remarkable in their portrayals of two very sweet and loving parents. They show hints of a wild and fun past, but they are able to transition into a mature and nurturing set of individuals who are willing to do everything they can to support their children. It's heartbreaking to see their fate, and we immediately miss them because the characters are probably two of the most wonderful creations of the last decade. It's not that we believe them incredible because we recognize their flaws. It's just that in this film we see their good side, though we recognize they have fears and broken dreams, too, but here the children are the important part of their lives.<br/><br/>The film is about choices and growing up. Mia finds herself a bit insecure and can't see herself getting into Julliard. It's obvious to everyone she has the talent and the passion, the fire and the craft is hers, but she's slow to recognize much of what's obvious, and this includes the arrival of the man who might be her perfect partner, Adam, in a great turn by Jamie Blackley. He loves music, he loves life, and most importantly, he loves her.<br/><br/>Most of the film is spent in the hospital, as Mia watches everyone's reaction to her family accident. She wavers between staying or going. She hears people express their vote of confidence that she'll be able to pull through, and that it's up to her to decide. She's loved by all the people who come in await the turn of events, and things become more intense as the hours pass by, and while she looks back at her life, we understand that this is not an easy choice. The family she knows is now for the most part gone, but there are others who also have plenty of love and affection for her. It's just that if one knows those parents are not going to be around anymore, faith in surviving dims pretty quickly, and it would take a very special individual to give you hope again. So we keep on hoping, waiting, and trusting that the ultimate decision will be the right one, and that no one will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Waiting is painful for all of the parties involved, including us, but we are fortunate to see a great director and some very good actors working on this story. Most impressive is Chloe who can say so much with those expressive eyes of hers. She has already proved herself a physical performer who is not afraid to show the dark side of humans. I can recall her amazing part in ""Kick Ass"", and she's the one element in ""Hugo"" that kept me from running out of the theater. Indeed, she's grown up in front of her eyes, but this girl has taken on a very difficult role, and she's given us a full performance, an innocent at first who grows in front of our eyes as she experiences life, and she is lucky to have her immediate family provide her with strength, love, and support, only to have her suddenly, face a cruel turning point in her life all by herself. We know she can handle because there's inner strength and intelligence in this young lady. The question is whether she'll play it safe or she'll continue to meet the challenges of her special life.<br/><br/>This is an interesting film and demands a second viewing in order to fully appreciate it. I want to go back and see more of the quiet moments. To listen to the dialog and the messages in the superb line up of songs, to see the choreography of those family and neighbors reunions long gone from the movies and very welcome in here. Enos' performance is like watching flowers bloom and the rainbows in full display. She's life herself and her eyes are great conveyors of emotion. We believe Mia and her are fully related. She's the muse that inspires love, confidence, and strength. It's a wonderful piece of acting.<br/><br/>We now know that ""Carrie"", ""Kick Ass"", and her other turns were not flukes, that she's the real thing. I'm glad she's not involved in any of those silly trilogies, that she's moving on to serious film making and will be able to see more of this young actress. Here's someone who can project real emotions without the need of contrived action backgrounds and silly story lines."

"rgkarim","7","23","46","22 August 2014"," An Emotional, Moral Filled Tale
","Surprise, surprise another weekend, another movie based off of a book. I start my review off this evening with the latest popular drama entitled If I Stay¬Ö Why we have yet another somber, emotion engorged screenplay when we just had one, I will never know, but Hollywood is eating up the profits from movies like this. So with the hot little topic these movies are at the moment, I go once more into the dimly lit theater to determine if this movie is worth your hard earned money. What is my verdict? Like always, please read on to find out. <br/><br/>The key factor that these movies go for is the ability to bring about some type of emotion. If I stay is no different, though in this flick¬Ö you can pretty much guess what emotion is filling the screen. From the trailers, one should be prepared to go in for a tear jerker movie, filled with sad and morbid factors for the whole nine yards. In my theater, there were plenty of emotional fans crying, gasping, sobbing, and any other description you can think of as Mia (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz) faces her trial of choosing to live. Before you turn away though, If I Stay surprisingly has some happy emotions to it as well, spread amongst the misery to help lighten the mood. Perhaps this is what kept me interested in the movie, as the delivery did a nice job balancing both happiness and sadness. Integrating the disaster amidst memories of Mia's life is a great approach, helping to establish and develop a backstory without giving it all away at the beginning. While I'm sure fans of the book already expected this, but I appreciated the development of the relationships with her family and friends, gradually building up to where the movie starts. The timing of these memories was spot on, each memory slightly deeper as Mia fights to hang on to life, using a different aspect of her life to carry on. Of course, the movie is full of morals about the various components of life, each done in an artistic fashion that is filled with glorified movie magic. One can certainly appreciate what the story has to teach, enough to oversee a little of the cheesiness in some of the scenes and dialog.<br/><br/>Of course the balanced emotions are only one part of the strengths of this movie. The acting is not half bad, with Moretz doing a good job at playing the awkward girl role. Moretz is dynamic and I enjoy her broad spectrum of characters she can play and the way she brings her lines to life. In this role she gets to act like a real person, reacting to the situations life deals her as she tries to break out of her comfort zone. Yet, for me there was a little too much crying and weakness in this character, her drawn out rants of crying and screaming a bit taxing for my patience. Of course this fits with the theme of the movie though and helps one relate to the turmoil she is feeling. Playing her opposite is Jamie Blackley who is perhaps the central point in Mia's world. Blackley's character is an attempt to represent the wild, unruly side, but his character is more relaxed than wild. The audience will get more than their fill of his songs that fit well with the scene he brings to life. However, some of the songs are simply shoved down our throats in an attempt to promote the actor's talent at singing songs that sound all the same, (like a Taylor Swift album). Regardless, I like how real his character is, and not some extreme, high on life, rogue whose bad boy attitude has all the girls swooning. The rest of the cast was fine, and well fitted into the story, but they were all rotating around the giant love relationship in this movie. <br/><br/>This brings me to the next part of the review, some of the weaker aspects of the movie. Despite the relationship being a little more realistic than others, it still has its moments of sheer fantasy and movie magic that sob lovers will enjoy. The predictable nature of the movie is also a bit old as well. While I did enjoy the balance of memories in the story, it was obvious where the tale was going with the underlying themes in it. Such predictability is overshadowed by the slow pace of this movie, as the lack of any exciting events leads to movie to be slightly boring. I'm still weaning myself away from the action, but this movie seemed to go around in circles instead of covering any forward ground. One minor thing is while I normally love songs that help bring out the emotions in the scene, this was a little too somber for my taste. Soft and classic rock fans will rejoice in the soundtrack, but it just didn't do much for me in this movie, and once or twice made me very sleepy. <br/><br/>Overall If I stay is an emotional tale that drama lovers I feel will love. It's got great life lessons, an intertwined tale of both joy and sorrow, and some decent acting that fit well to bring the novel on the screen. Yet, don't let the trailers and commercials overhype the movie, nor should you go in comparing it to the book. While I have not read the novel, my track record leads to usually disappointment, so try and block that mindset if you can. Is it worth a trip to theater? My opinion is not really, as there is very little quality that would look better on a bigger screen. Truth be told it's a great girls night out movie, or a movie you can treat your significant other too in hopes of getting reciprocation. The scores for the film are:<br/><br/>Drama: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5"

","So basically I am wondering why it took me so long to actually watch this film. I'll try to write this with no spoilers. <br/><br/>If I Stay is a film based on the book by Gayle Forman. It is about a girl called Mia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) and how her life changes after her whole family is in a car accident, leaving her in a coma. She is having an out-of-body experience and must decide whether to wake up and live a different life or to end it by not waking up. The choice is all down to her. <br/><br/>During her out-of-body experience, she see's her other relatives turn up, her friends and her love, Adam (Jamie Blackley). The film focus' a lot on their love and their journey, with the help of some flashbacks you kind of get how and why they fall in love. They are both into music but at different ends of the spectrum. He is a rock star in a band and she loves classical music and plays the cello (which whoever is playing her music double is AMAZING). It shows the trouble they go through when he goes away and starts to make it big, while she's at school applying for colleges, but there is one in particular college that she wants to go to and that is Juilliard, but that means leaving Adam behind. The flashbacks also show the relationship between her and her parents and her little brother, with her best friend Kate and into some of her memory's, like Halloween and New Year, where she is surrounded with people she loves. It's a true love story on so many levels.<br/><br/>I like this film because it has stayed true to the book and oh my it just made me feel all emotions all at once. I couldn't give this any more credit. So tissues at the ready because you will cry.<br/><br/>https://gracedoody.wordpress.com/"

","'IF I STAY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Teen melodrama flick, based on the popular YA novel (of the same name) by Gayle Forman. It tells the story of a teenager who has a major 'out-of-body experience', after being in a severe car accident, in which she must decide whether to go on living, or die; as her family did. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teen, and costars Jamie Blackley, Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard, Liana Liberato and Stacey Keach. It was directed by R.J. Cutler and written by Shauna Cross (who also wrote the outstanding 2009 teen drama flick 'WHIP IT', and the novel it was based on). I found this movie to be pretty boring, and excessively cheesy as well.<br/><br/>Moretz plays Mia Hall; a teenager that's in love with classical music, and playing cello, despite the fact that her parents, Kat (Enos) and Denny (Leonard), are really into rock music; and her dad was in a mildly successful alternative rock band (when he was younger). She falls in love with a rocker from school, as fate would have it, named Adam Wilde (Blackley). Just when she's deep into making really tough and dramatic teenage decisions, about her new love life, her family is involved in a horrific car accident; and Mia falls into a coma. She then experiences life 'out-of-body' and must decide whether to keep living, or pass on; as her parents did. Mia's past life is told through flashbacks.<br/><br/>I like the premise of the movie, and I do like well made films adapted from young-adult novels, but this movie is just poorly made. It's way too melodramatic and badly paced; it's even excruciatingly dull at times. Both the director and the writer have made better movies than this, but they really dropped the ball here! I also like Moretz, in other films as well, but she gives a pretty unimpressive performance here too. Stacey Keach is the only person that does anything impressive, in this movie, but his part is too brief.

","I'm just going to say this straight out, I'm not a fan of these kinds of movies. I find movies like this a snooze fest. This movie was surprisingly good. If I stay is about a teenage girl named Mia Hall who gets in a car accident with her family. Losing them all and having to decide if she's going to live for love or die and go with her family in peace. In the beginning, her and her family are eating breakfast when it's announced that Mia and her brother, Teddy, and her father (he's a teacher) are going to be having a snow day. Her mom calls in to work sick, so she can spend the day with the rest of her family. The make a plan to see Gran and Gramps, Henery, Willow, and their baby. Those plans of course go sour. Throughout the movie you get to see what Mia's life was like before the accident in flashbacks, which in my opinion really adds to the story. It adds to the heartbreak and the heart wrenching choice Mia has to make. The casting in this movie was perfect. Every casting choice made was brilliant. Anyone being a HUGE, fan of Chloe Grace Moretz or her roll in the Kick-Ass movie series, might have thought that she couldn't pull off this roll. I thought that too, and boy was I wrong. Jamie Blackley who plays Mia'a hunky boyfriend, Adam Wilde, was fantastic. I've never seen a movie with him in it, and when I was looking at the cast list, and I saw his name I thought ""Who is Jamie Blackley?"" I was a little nervous again because of that casting choice. After watching the movie, I can tell one day he'll be a big star. Maybe not Brad Pitt big but big enough so when he's the leading man or the lead people won't be confused on who that is. When I went in to the theaters, I was expecting this movie to be a train wreak. I was very wrong. To me, this movie had it all. A great plot. Great dialogue. And a great cast. You need to watch this movie, it's heartbreaking. It's brilliant. And it will bring you to tears."
"makstracy","6","3","4","7 September 2015"," I got what they were trying to do but...
","LET me start this by saying that I thought that Chloe Grace did a very good job on this film, and I quite liked the performance of the man who played her gramps as well, but the movie itself just didn't SELL it for me.<br/><br/>I understand that Mia Hall is in high school and it's an age when sometimes the wrong things matter the most, but I just didn't like how most of her flashbacks; how most of the things she remembered as something important and a reason to go on with her existence, centered around a BOY. I honestly just don't like that kinda message - how most of the things she thought about when she was unconscious and having an inner debate with whether or not she wanted to live was mostly about this Adam character.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more about her bonding with her little brother - who's death touched me a lot - or her going shopping for old records with her mother, or her and her father doing a lot more stuff together. I would have liked to see her conversations with her best friend, them talking about things that actually matter to them (the one time I recall seeing them actually talk was about *drumroll* Adam). I would have liked to see her grandparents spoiling her rotten with cookies and old stories.<br/><br/>Still, romance sells. I guess.<br/><br/>I get what they were trying to do, but I don't think they did it how it should have been done. I haven't read the book - which I regret - but if it was as boy-centered as the movie was, I would like to know. It could have been a beautiful tale if Mia Hall was more developed of a character. If she was more...independent. I liked her little moments with the cello, but I felt like there weren't nearly enough.<br/><br/>It was a movie that was tolerable, and at moments very touching, but it didn't quite get THERE. -"

I love the fact that two different worlds get to be put together, trying to find a common path when there seems to be none, how you see both worlds struggling on their own but also as one. I love the fact that everyone can relate to the story on a certain way because: - if you come from a happy family, you relate to the happy moments. - if you come from a broken family, you can relate to it (both through Adam and Mia) - we all struggle to achieve our dream - we all loved and all been broken-hearted. <br/><br/>(Can you tell I loved this movie?)"

Chlo√´ Grace Moretz has nothing to do in this flick, it's definitely far from her best. <br/><br/>Overall, for 14 years old girls this will do just fine, for all older i can say, you can safely skip this. It's not a bad movie by any means, just unfortunately it's very predictable, it has nothing new or exciting to offer and at running time 100 min. it drags and repeats itself - it has well intentions, but unfortunately it just doesn't click."

Chloe did an amazing job of portraying Mia, and Adam was exactly how I envisioned him. The casting was perfect and the acting was on point.

The movie is great all in all, the plot is great, the actors are great, the characters are great, however I feel that If I Stay is a bit slow paced.

","*Possible idea of spoilers* *Not sure*<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. As well as being something to watch, the movie teaches you things about life too. It teaches you that no matter how hard life gets, you should never give up. It also teaches you that even if you think you're alone and you can't go on, there are always people who are there for you and who care about you. It is very emotional, as I found out myself, but this is one of the reasons why I would highly recommend that you watch it. Everyone needs to cry. Crying during sad films is how you know that you're human. I've wanted to watch this film ever since it came out and the only thing I regret, is not watching it sooner. A film of this quality is not something you want to wait to see or miss out on seeing. I have seen a lot of amazing films but this one is one of the greatest, most inspirational, tear jerking films I have ever seen."
"thedukeofmovietown","7","5","9","14 September 2014"," Plays well to it's audience
","I saw IF I STAY last night! This movie, directed by R.J. Cutler, is based on a novel by Gayle Foreman about a teenage girl named Mia, played by Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, who has an out of body experience after a massive car wreck that leaves her comatose. As Mia's life flashes before her eyes, she must decide whether she will live with her life forever altered or embrace the serenity of death. I really have to give this movie it's props for two reasons. First of all, for those of you who were wondering if Chlo√´ Grace Moretz can really act or is she just the flavor of the month, the jury is in and it's unanimous, the girl has got some skills. Her performance is wonderful and she really effectively showcases the full range of emotions that a teenage girl can have. Moretz is not the only actor here that's good, the whole cast does a great job especially Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard who play Mia's ex-rocker parents and Stacy Keach who plays Mia's grandfather. The second reason to like this movie comes from the script. It is so carefully written that it manages to keep you attached to living in the moment despite watching a series of segments that take place in the past. If I have any complaints it is that it runs a little long and things get trope-ish from time to time in a really CW kind of way and they get REALLY iffy near the third act when Mia's boyfriend, played by Jamie Backley, shows up with a sack full of melodrama. Overall I'd say that If I Stay is a good movie. It knows it's audience and plays to it really well and despite a few hiccups and possibly overstaying it's welcome a little, the people it's made for will enjoy it. If I Stay gets a 3.5...out of 5"

","I went into this blind. I knew nothing about the book it was based upon. It didn't take long before I realized this might not be my thing. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience. Judging by this I will assume the book is also one of those Young Adult type things. That isn't necessarily bad; I've enjoyed several of those movies over the years. This one, though, missed the mark. The narration and music obsession totally got on my nerves. We get it: you like music. 786 references is overkill. It doesn't even feel sincere. Chloe Moretz does a less than impressive job. She's one of the younger actors today whose career I can see either lasting a long time or fizzling out within a few years. We'll see. Her parents here are terrible. The dad is played by the guy from Blair Witch Project. I didn't even know he was still around. Stacy Keach gives the most memorable performance in the movie as the grandfather. The guy she falls madly in love with is a poorly written clich√© of a Cameron Crowe character. He has no chemistry with Chloe and their love story is inane. Really, the whole script is just pretentious drivel that tugs on the heart strings with no subtlety at all. It's also overlong and often dull. It makes A Walk to Remember look like a classic."
"bopdog","8","9","20","23 August 2014"," Surprisingly evocative of my own early love development years. Sweet but slooooow
","This was certainly a ""lovely"" film. It is obvious that the writer/director cared about presenting something genuine and touching - rather than some plot driven smash-a-thon. I could relate to the themes. They were telegraphed so clearly, however, there were no real surprises. We could see each line and exchange and development coming from a mile away - and the movie took forever to get to each tiny step (it's 2 hours and 15 minutes).<br/><br/>It pains me a bit to say it, but the movie's glacial pace and repetitive nature slowed it down a bit too much. And how it would linger over each small movement in the two kids' relationship, and then go back over it and over it and over it - made it feel repetitive. I suspect women might find this more of a match to their style of fantasizing? If the movie wasn't so earnest, and ""real"" in some very authentic ways, I would have found it annoyingly tedious. Didn't quite happen, though. I was surprised to find myself flashing back to some very sweet moments from my own teen-aged love affairs. It was sweetly evocative in that way, which I appreciated. I can't remember seeing a movie depicting the development of love with ""youths"" turning into adults so authentically and with so much meaning for me. Usually romances are either rom-coms, or formula set-ups, or twinky vampire book treatments. Or set pieces from current hip culture. This was none of those. This was nice. Sloooow, but nice.<br/><br/>Although the very predictable (and extremely limited and overly simple) plot points failed to ""move"" me particularly - it was interesting but no big drama - I was generally liking all the characters. I was glad for the characters finding romance, and I enjoyed reliving a bit of my romantic development in a fresh way no other movie had managed to do. But getting all weeping with the deaths and near-deaths and reuniting and all - nope. It was just life, and no cause for any tear-jerking hullabaloo."

","Life changes in an instant for young Mia Hall after a car accident puts her in a coma. During an out-of-body experience, she must decide whether to wake up and live a life far different than she had imagined or let go.<br/><br/>If I Stay is directed by R.J Cutler and starring Chlo√´ C. Moretz. This film is based on the best- selling novel written by Gayle Forman, novel that I did not read. The trailer depicted the movie as I thought it would be but the movie is actually really not like that at all. The film does have this ""out-of-body"" experience happening throughout it but ultimately it's a container to tell the story of how she met her boyfriend in the first place and how they love each other and everything. They are cute, it's working as it's a teen drama story. It's a romance and it's what it is. Then they break up because they want different things out of life. What disappointed me the most is that the ""out-of-body"" experience is very brief, it's not like mainly she's in the hospital and shows her back story. The movie shows her in the hospital way less that I thought. If I Stay tries to surf on the wave of a way better movie i-e The Fault in Our Stars . It's trying to cash in on the success of teen romance movie. The movie itself establishes that heaven is real, it's not questioning it or whether or not you believe in it; *SPOILER ALERT* at the end she refuses an eternity of happiness with her family in order to regain the love of this young eighteen years old musician that she loves. She's the main character, played by Chlo√´ C. Moretz who was good in her role though, and we are supposed to want her to live happily ever after and fulfil her dreams. However at this point of the movie we DON'T, we want her to walk towards the light that's all. It's a big fail.<br/><br/>Overall if you're a young teenage girl: THEY GOT YOU! They achieve to waste the potential of having a ghost in the movie by telling us a boring and easy love story."

","Independent films have been able to find a market lately as a source of bold original cinema. If I Stay is neither bold and only mildly original as a story of a teenage girl, her relationship with her indie-rock boyfriend, and an out-of-body experience. The camera work is amateurish and cheap at times, even by indie standards, and the movie mostly relies on Chloe Moretz narcissistic acting and Portland's hipster culture to the point where it comes off as contrived and haughty. There are a few redeeming plot elements and it will definitely tug at the heartstrings, but movies like this are better suited to the Hallmark Channel.<br/><br/>In the end, it's nothing more than a tear-jerking Chloe Moretz vehicle trying to be the Fault in our Stars (which is a much better film)."

","7/10 I was actually really excited for this movie, me being a fan of both the book and Chloe. I thought I was in for a real tearjerker. But some parts, I felt myself get bored and think of other things, or I'd long for the particular scene to be over. And to be honest, Mia was looking like a little girl compared to Adam. My friend and I had also agreed that there were too many kissing scenes that seemed that have just made the movie unnecessarily longer than it needed it to be. <br/><br/>There were also a lot of good things about the movie too, though (hence the rating). Chloe and Jamie had perfect chemistry with each other and their relationship developing was one of my favourite things about the movie. I also loved how it stayed true to the book, the message and the little details that were weaved into the movie. Some of the pain Mia was feeling had pierced through my heart as well, but not all of it.

","I really, really loved this book version. I remember, when I read it, i couldn't even breathe, because was crying so hard. Was really looking for the adaptation. So the movie? Well, yeah, it was something. Not so sure which something, but not the 'oh-gosh-this-shook-my-world' kinda feeling. I mean, I really loved Mia, she was this cute girl you can relate to easily, but she also got this freaking talent with her love, the cello. Basically she was the girl I loved in the book. Chloe was amazingly good in playing her, it was good to see that something can be made exactly the way you imagine while reading. But Adam? Hey, Hollywood you sure can do better! It was like watching the twilight series again, (not like it didn't hurt enough for the first time). And it wasn't because of the two love-struck teenagers who fall madly in love in a very young age. Nope. This feeling come to me, because Jamie Blackley resembled Kristen Stewart so sadly much. OMG! NO FACIAL EXPRESSION! NO ACTING! Remember, when you went out on a cold winter day for too long to play in the snow and then for hours you couldn't move the muscles on your face, because they froze? This was Adam. He already was someone. Probably at the beginning of the shooting he was someone already, and couldn't change his face during the movie, because he was cool like that. Uhm, big, fat no. His character is a shallow, love seeking, insecure, possessive asshole, who cannot get over himself. And it sure as hell didn't come from the book. Where did you put the kind, loving, caring boy he was, dear film-makers? This point was the biggest disappointment of this film. On the bright side Adam Wild fans, Jamie has a strong, catching voice, you can believe him having a career in music. As for the soundtracks, pretty much all the song were great. Even if this wasn't Shooting Stars, just some weird Willamette Stone. Loved the classical music blend into all this modern drama. At some points I felt right it wasn't really worked out everywhere. Some places are not clear how they can explain, if they do a second movie from Where she went. And maybe there were too much memories and not enough time in the hospital to give time to the viewer to let this tragedy sink in. Or maybe it's just me knowing the inner fight this girl had going on while deciding if she stays or not. That's for sure, that there where great lines with excellent timing in If I stay. Somewhere I was just so shocked about how artfully the power of these sentences were emphasized. OH, and loved the parents, their characters were amazing wish-i-had-them- here as well."

Although not really a fan of the indi rock scene a lot of the movie focused on It did not halt my enjoyment overall. <br/><br/>Huge fan of Chlo√´ Grace Moretz who plays Mia. Mostly because of her role as Hit girl in the Kick Ass movies, but it was cool to see her do other things. She has a real connection with the kid who played Adam, which made their own screen relationship entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Romance is not really my thing, and it gets a little to sappy when it revolves around teen love stories, but I thought it was worked well.<br/><br/>Like the ghost story element as well.

It was mostly about Mia's love story. Maybe I'm just so curious about coma state, so I kinda disappointed with the adaptation <br/><br/>While the book narrates the accident with a very horrifying words, here I guess the director is too scared to make the brutal and horrible accident scene.

","Kat: You're going to go to Julliard and play the hell out of your cello. Or, you're not. You're gonna stay with Adam and have lots of amazing adventures. Or you're not. Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's gonna smash into a meteor, or it's not. Life is this big fat gigantic stinking mess. But that's the beauty of it too. Whatever you do, I support you. Either way, you win. And also either way there's something that you lose. What can I say, baby? True love's a bitch.<br/><br/>This is my favorite quote in If I Stay and it epitomizes the reasons I really enjoyed this film. The story follows Mia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) bred from a rock and roll family who ends up with a love for playing the cello. Her parents Kat and Denny Hall (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) are very supportive and cool who allow their daughter to be who she really is. They understand her undeniable passion for the cello and never once put her down despite the fact that it sometimes annoys them. Mia on the other hand, does not quite seem to see what her parents do. I observed her to be insecure, unsure, and overly critical of herself. Then she meets Adam (Jamie Blackley) a cute rocker who is the complete opposite. For me personally, there was something lacking in their chemistry with each other. I'm wondering if that is because Mia's character feels out of place amongst Adam's clan...perhaps a feeling she felt her entire life with her family? Either way...I didn't 100 percent connect to their love for each other. Early on in the film, we witness Mia and her family in an accident that leaves her outside her body watching on as doctors strive to revive her from the coma she is left in. The film then transitions back and forth between the past and her current state after the accident. I feel the film hit the nail on the head with happy moments shared in a loving family. The film is a tearjerker for sure but I found these family scenes absolutely beautiful as it reminds us that life can change at the drop of a hat. That is why we need to make the most of our time while we are here. Overall, the performances were great with a special nod to Chloe Grace Moretz. She was consistent in her portrayal of Mia and powerful at the times she needed to be. The only other thing I disliked was that I felt this was story that had been told before. It wasn't as original as I would have liked it to be but that didn't take away from me enjoying the film."

","I was struck and very attached to the beautiful face of Chloe. That is really what got me through the movie, as well as the family dynamics. I don't view it as a possibility to mix a truly classical mind with that of a teenage rock wannabe idol. The two just don't combine well, except, of course, when background is added to some soft rock pieces. So, that is what the movie was about to me: the attempt to mix the two genres. <br/><br/>Personally, I see it as impossible at the level one has to understand and memorize centuries old cello solos compared to three or four chord rock songs that really don't tend toward peace. Instead, they're about a mixture of feelings and breakups in a chaotic world, whereas cello solos come from a more profound depth in the soul of the player and listener where God speaks. In order for the real winner to be, the cheapest music had to be dropped, and it was. Let the cello live on."

","Based on the novel by Gayle Forman, If I Stay follows 17-year old Mia Hall (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), a violin prodigy who falls for a handsome guy named Adam (played by Jamie Blackely). Their relationship seemingly goes smooth while facing some occasional ups and downs. This is until one afternoon, Mia and her family are critically injured in a car accident while going on a small road trip with her family. While the family manages to survive, Mia becomes stuck in a coma and experiences an out-of-body experience as a ghost. With her family and friends sitting next to her death bed, Mia must decide whether she should wake up back in her body, or leave and go to heaven. This film flashes back and forth from her in her out-of-body experience watching her family and friends while they are in the hospital, to the events leading up the accident.<br/><br/>Upon reading the plot, the film sounded interesting enough. The whole premise of the film is intriguing and captures good attention. This film has some very emotional and touching moments throughout, enough to make viewers reach for the tissues. However, it really tries so hard to take advantage of the emotional tone, to the point where it becomes a bit manipulative. Throughout the picture as the main character's family is trying to cope with the tragedy they are about to face, you can strongly feel their emotions; which is a good thing. But then, when you add the slow tone and the constant sappy music score to it, it tries to be emotionally manipulative, especially when you have the romantic plot between the main character and her boyfriend. While you learn to care for the characters, you get so bored out by the constant sappy tone. Chloe Grace Moretz's performance is what I personally found to be the most appealing aspect of the movie. She does a great job at keeping her character alive, even though her character is critically ill. I also enjoyed the performances by Jamie Blackely and Liana Liberato (Kim, Mia's best friend). Lastly, I thought the film is a little predictable. Some scenes are very easy to guess, and if you watch this, you might know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>If I Stay is not terrible movie, but it isn't too great of a movie either. If you watch this, you may enjoy it. But it is not very likely you'll find a reason to watch it again. While this goes on an hour and 47 minutes, it feels so much longer."

It will also be touching and I'm sure you will be moved by how the story is portrayed.<br/><br/>Still while we all can relate to many of the given themes here, the movie goes more on the romantic route than the dramatic one. Which is a shame because there are quite a few things that could've been played out better (imho). It's easy to keep up with the time frame, even if it might confuse a few people at first. What's important, is that you're always with the main character (no matter what your stance on religion, after Life and more things are, this is a story, nothing more nothing less).

","If I Stay features movie star on the rise,Chloe Grace Moretz and gives her all in this young adult romantic film that tells the story of Mia,who is faced with the decision whether to live or to join her family,who all died in a car accident.In addition to that,there is a storyline involving her with regards to making a decision as to whether to pursue a musical career at Julliard or be with her love of her life,Adam portrayed by Jamie Blackley. This film directed by R.J. Cutler that has a supporting cast the includes Mireille Enos,Joshua Leonard,Aisha Hinds and veteran actor Stacy Keach is based on Gayle Foreman's novel of the same title is dominated by music and melodrama together with some elements of the supernatural wherein we see Mia in a spiritual existence as she sees the people who visits her while in coma fighting for her existence at the ICU.<br/><br/>It was evident that the movie is directed at a particular audience namely young adults.Too bad that people not within that age group would find the movie lacking authenticity,emotionally manipulative and a tearjerker that modern movies at present move away from.Somehow even mature young adults belonging in that particular group would somehow find it clich√©d and predictable as well and would lack appreciation for it.Aside from that,the love story involving Mia and Adam is far from believable as well considering that both barely have similar traits and characteristics.Even the type of music that they play are different from each other with one being classical music and the other being rock music.It just manages to put the familiar young adult romantic relationship that people of different characteristics can pull through a successful relationship.But overall,it just provides the viewer some confusion on their attraction to one another despite their lack of similarities character-wise.<br/><br/>The performances in the film is satisfactory overall.But Chloe Grace Moretz was definitely far from satisfactory.It was outstanding as she was able to make the viewer empathize with her character as Mia with the many events of her life from falling in love with Adam;the pressure she felt during her audition at Julliard;the life-changing decisions she was about to make from either joining her parents and young brother who all failed to survive the car accident or joining her boyfriend by continuing her existence; and her maturity from being a young girl into a young adult the moment she entered into a relationship with Adam.Despite the emotional manipulation and melodramatic elements of the storyline involving her character, Moretz somehow minimized them through her performance as Mia including her indecision in either staying in existence or dying at deathbed to join her family who just passed away that somehow slowed the story down somehow and provided it some seemingly boring moments. In the end, one could see the potential she has and a great future that she possess as an actress in the years to come.In summary, Moretz's portrayal of Annie alone was able to lift this young adult romance film higher than just an average rating."

Chloe is a 17 year old cellist that hopes to study at Julliard-she loves classical music and no, I don't mean classical rock, she plays a cello for goodness sakes.

Chloe becomes a ghost-like out of body version of herself-she can see everything but no one can see or hear her. Flashbacks show the happy and the not so happy times in Chloe's life and the tough decisions she has to make. First and foremost, should she go back into her body and rejoin the living? Then, should she go across the country to Julliard and possibly loose the love of her life? What do you think? Most of the story is clich√©' filled drama that you can see plot developments coming from a mile off. It's rated ""PG"" for sexual situations-no nudity-and drug/alcohol use and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. It's not one that I would buy or even rent.

","First I'll have to say that I'm a big Chlo√´ Grace Moretz fan. And shes the only reason I considered watching this movie. Her acting has always been top notch. And you can really see that this is a girl that works hard to stay that way. But,<br/><br/>The step from a child to adult is a hard one for every actor and actress. The things that was really good a couple of years ago, is not impressing anymore. You have to evolve, or you'll end your career as an A-star.<br/><br/>In this movie she showed the first bit of weakness when it comes to facial expressions. In a life changing moment, she often turns to wrinkle her nose or open her mouth slightly. Its not good enough, and frankly, its a little bit disappointing. <br/><br/>I'll say this. I think it could be cos of inadequate directing. Cause we all know what ms. Moretz can do when she's led in the right direction. Like her few scenes in The Equalizer, so we know shes still got it. <br/><br/>I don't have much to say about the movie. Other than its a generic teen drama with an existential theme that The Fault In Our Stars made so much better use of. But then again, this movie was not made for me, so I understand the people that find this enjoyable. <br/><br/>Hoping for a Chloe that still brings the crisp acting to a screen that is worn down by mediocrity. I'm sure she'll find the right way eventually."
"TheFilmGuy1","5","4","9","31 August 2014"," Boring And Poorly Made
","The trailer to this film made it look decent, so I was hoping to enjoy it... But I really didn't. This film just isn't good. It has almost all flaws and very few positives to it.<br/><br/>To start off with, the story is an interesting concept, but it's executed in a way that is extremely clich√©. The story has your typical plot points that a lot of cheesy romance films have. The fight, the make up, etc. We really don't see a lot of the in between dead and alive kind of stuff, and even that isn't executed. It got so clich√© that it started making me incredibly bored. I wanted to yell ""STAY OR DON'T, JUST MAKE A DECISION!"". It really just doesn't work.<br/><br/>What make this story worse is the acting. It can be pretty bad. Chloe Moretz just isn't very good. I haven't seen much of her work, but I just don't see why she would be cast in a lead role. She is cute, but her acting just can't hold a film together, especially a film with such an emotion driven plot. I didn't feel for her in the least bit, which completely ruins the film. It was very tough to get through.<br/><br/>Another little detail that I couldn't get over was the CGI head. I'm sure you're asking, what does that mean? Let me explain. Chloe plays a character who plays the chello extremely well. I am assuming Chloe doesn't know how to play it, because in scenes where we see her playing it, they obviously CGI her head onto the body of someone who knows how to play, and the issue is, it's extremely obvious. Her head floats and bobs and looks so odd. What's worse is that in shots where it's from the side, you can tell it's not even Chloe at all! They don't attempt to CGI her head from the side, but just leave the different actress who you can tell from the side isn't Chloe. It was so distracting and I couldn't help but laugh at how bad that was.<br/><br/>Overall, if you wanna see this film, just watch the trailer and then find out whether she stays or not. The trailer gives you a better emotional journey than the film as a whole does."

","Teenage Mia is a cello prodigy. She lives with her lovable younger brother and her impossibly awesome parents. She is a bit socially awkward which is why, at first, she doesn't respond easily to the interest shown in her by up and coming singer/guitarist Adam. But he is genuine, and their blooming relationship is marred only by conflict over their possible separation if her application to go to Juilliard is successful. Which is why she did't tell him she'd applied. Which is why he is upset with her. Who'd be a teenager in love, right? Things get a lot simpler when her family has a horrific car crash and she is lying in hospital at death's door faced with the choice of living or dying.<br/><br/>This teen weepie involves Chloe Moretz doing an awful lot of running around hospital corridors barefoot, shouting things at people who can't hear her because she is in limbo, hovering between life and death. It could usefully have done with some special effects rather than people conveniently holding doors open just as she wants to run through. Yes I know, money.<br/><br/>Moretz is as good as always in a film which, to me, was no better than OK. It concentrated rather too much on peevish teenagerness, and not enough on the fairly big issues which were implicit in its basic premise.<br/><br/>The performances were good, though, especially Stacy Keach, better than I've ever seen him."
"akalilazn","7","3","6","24 August 2014"," More than I was expecting
","Having read the book, I went into the movie prepared to be disappointed, as many (if not most) book-to-movies tend to leave me. I left the theater pleasantly surprised and shockingly satisfied. Not every book can be a good movie and as such, parts were added or embellished. The acting/directing is cheesy and poorly done in some scenes, namely the death scenes and some of the romance, but overall, the acting was phenomenal. Blackley, Leonard, and Enos each played their roles perfectly, even better than Forman had created them in my opinion. Moretz, though a fantastic Mia, didn't seem to fit right in a few scenes which I'd tack up to poor directing.<br/><br/>As a movie: 6.5-7/10 It's a good tear-jerker but, again, the directing leaves much to be desired. The 'sad' scenes are a little dry, the romance scenes were cheesy or embellished, and, for a movie about musicians, some of the soundtrack was either hard to listen to or extremely out of place. The bright spot was the acting which was fantastic on all fronts except for a couple extras (the nurse Ramirez character and most of the hospital staff). Each of the band tracks were pretty good even though I'm not much a fan of pop/punk. I wouldn't necessarily buy the DVD but I'd recommend the trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>Compared to the book: 10/10 As I said before, a good book isn't necessarily a good movie so if you're a purist, hopefully you're an open minded purist. Each character, even Mia, was perfectly played. Kat, Denny, Adam, Kim and Gramps were much better characters in the movie than their slightly drab book counterparts. The character development was better even through the added/deleted scenes. The bonfire scene had the audience humming and quietly tapping. The death scenes were poorly done but still emotionally striking. Each memory was included though some were changed (drastically) and some were added. Overall, the movie was actually just as good, if not better than the book in just about every way."
"shannensama","4","5","13","22 August 2014"," The Book Was Better
","I went to an advance screening of this movie after I was hopefully misled by reviews that stated it was ""close to the book"" and seeing the author so obviously involved in all their social media publicity. <br/><br/>It does stay close to the spirit of the book in a sense, but they twist and distort a number of the scenes (not enough to change the story dramatically, but enough to annoy someone who loved the novel). I expected that to a certain extent; like the way they sort of wiped out the peripheral members of her family to focus on her love for Adam. I did not expect them to almost obscure Teddy's role from the story entirely. Even her scenes with Kim are limited to her discussing Adam. I should've expected them to up the drama by breaking her and Adam up and bumping her Julliard letter.<br/><br/>Tiny tweaks aside, one of the most disturbing things about the film was the lack of passion for the music. It's clear Mia has a stand in who can actually play cello (especially in her more animated scenes), and you can see Chloe actually striving for that sense of being lost in the music, but she clearly isn't there. Adam was a million times worse. As a frequent concert goer I expected a lot more energy and investment from his performances, but it's like he's gliding over them. These people are supposed to breathe music, it is the foundation of their relationship and what ultimately pulls them in different directions, but you just don't see it in the film. It's like watching puppets on a stage. It was awful. All I could think about was the sequel and how these people couldn't possibly perform at that level - they can't even manage to portray musically talented teenagers, let alone amazing adult musicians. <br/><br/>Even their love for each other seems a little bit put on. I expected Hollywood to force the story to fit their idea of a teenage romance, but they stripped the story of its soul in the process. The book is amazing and moving and you're not sure where it's going but the movie is just another cookie cutter romantic drama."
"Eddie_weinbauer","1","4","10","15 November 2014"," I would leave
","I didn't know anything about this movie except that Chloe was in it. So I figured I'd give it a shot, since I really liked her performance in Let me in, and Equalizer.<br/><br/>It started out really okay, not too cheesy,in a not too over the top teen romance kind of way. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how close the movie follows the book. Sadly instead of trying to be original,it borrows from Flashdance and a few others<br/><br/>By that I mean, cute talented girl who have doubts about pursuing her dream, and questions if she is talented enough. Flashdance had way better music score in it though. But they share some of the same clich√©s,which I think its a bit sad<br/><br/>Mia the quiet nerdy girl, falls in love with Adam the cool rocker guy. whom has the typical leather jacket(Hollywood's way of saying he's a rocker/rebel)With the broken home background. I found it a bit cool though, that Mia's parents was OK with her dating a older boy.Thats is a rare quality in movies<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the relationship, was that you can clearly see he's way older. Like too old, to go in the same school older. The chemistry between them, isn't all that either.. But they didn't really have the whole, deeply-in-love-for-the-first- time-chemistry.Got the impression they were just going through the motions And the characters are kind of shallow<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was,actually the whole stereotype clich√©s recipe they have used.Just to make it teen bait.= The boyfriends are always the one who starts an argument, the girls is always the victim. The boy always have to do something insanely romantic to apologize.<br/><br/>I'm probably too old to be the target audience, but I would like for once to see the girl be the rocker instead of always the boy. You know Hollywood, girls can actually play guitar too"
"mingsphinx","4","3","7","19 February 2015"," Sappy, teenage love story
","Chlo√´ Grace Moretz gave a decent performance and that is why I did not rate this movie lower. The underlying theme is a straight forward teenage romance with two very encouraging parents who seem more than thrilled that their daughter has bagged a punk rock lead singer of a local Portland band. Much of the film is basically run of the mill teenage fantasy fluff that was intended to appeal to the youth demographic. This is the kind of movie that money minded studio executives dream up and from their success at the box office, they got what they wanted.<br/><br/>The thematically heavier material like death, out of body experience and the bereavement of losing all of one's family is strangely only incidental and treated as an appendage to the teenage love story. Sixteen year olds looking to get laid on a date my have use for this material, but I would give this film a pass if are looking to be entertained or thoughtfully provoked."
"Rickting","3","3","7","14 February 2015"," If this had stayed any longer I don't know how I would have coped
","In the latest Young Adult weepie adaptation to hit the screens, Chloe Grace Moretz plays a 17 year old musician who is left in a coma after a car crash that kills her family and she must choose between life and death. As this is a teen drama, of course there's also a love story. If I Stay is meant to be a tear jerker, but if certain scenes have you howling with laughter, there's definitely a problem. To be honest, this movie is one big problem. While fans of sappy love stories will be entertained and the film offers a couple of heart string tugging moments and some really cool parent characters, IIS is simply a terrible movie. Watch The Fault in Our Stars instead. I'm not the target audience, but I can enjoy this kind of film if it's done properly. This one is a soppy, underdone, manipulative mess which barely raises a sob. RJ Cutler, who makes his feature film directional debut, shows no personality or imagination behind the camera, and the film hops between flashbacks and Chloe wandering around the hospital in ghost form with the delicacy of a hyperactive frog.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz gives a weak performance as Mia. Having learnt nothing from Carrie, she tries again to play an outsider but it just doesn't work and sadly her role just feels wet. A terrible shame considering how good she normally is. Her love interest is played by a wooden newcomer who doesn't do anything particularly interesting with his character. The quality of a film hinges entirely on the script. Without a good script, any positives in a film are often for naught. IIS has a soppy screenplay where every scene exists for exposition or making people cry. It fails. The film is very boring, it sacrifices true depth for manipulation and the ending is frustrating and lazy to the point where comparisons with The Devil Inside would be justified. Phony and manipulative, IIS may not be as bad as Endless Love, but while that was just a tedious romance, this throws in loads of drama which could have been interesting but doesn't develop it. The romance itself is silly and unrealistic, the main character is ungrateful and only thinks of her ex boyfriend even though her family could be dead and it just makes you want to sleep. Hit Girl would be mortified.<br/><br/>3/10"
"noonoonomore","2","2","4","5 June 2017"," Just Avoid It!!
","I can't believe I wasted my evening on this. An immature story good enough only for girls below twelve years of age. I wonder why Hollywood likes to glorify self-centered annoying little girls who only complain about everything and the only purpose of other people's existence is to comfort them. I guess the industry needs us, girls, as needy as possible and this is its way of brainwashing us. T'was boring, stupid and pointless. I gave it a two because the first 10 minutes, the whole punk rock family with the cello lover daughter looked pretty interesting; could've been an interesting movie as well, but it was a big torturesome bore, hungry for money."

","Saw the decent average on IMDb and checked it out at Redbox blindly. Fairly shortly into the runtime I realized I was watching a musicky sitcom with dialog written by a 7th grader. Yes, the dialog in ""If I Stay"" is cringe-worthy if you're looking for anything adult-like or with depth. Director RJ Cutler is targeting 14 yr old girls with this movie that seems almost like one of those preachy Christian movies thankfully without the Christianity. A sampling of teen dialog has characters stating, ""I know, I suck"", or several utterances of ""skype."" I was hoping for something with more explanation into the supernatural or afterlife, but this movie is a straight, squeaky-clean Disneyish, ""School of Rock"" without Jack Black and the classroom. Not recommended - 5/10."

I've played for 30 years, so I know the time needed exhibit such bow control. (We did see the orignal baroque bowing of the Prelude) <br/><br/>A teenage romance that ends too soon for their teenage hearts. The boy is destructive and the girl is a loner, but music brings them together. Reminded me of August Rush, just with teens. We can experience the awkwardness of teen romance that appears to be true love. Regardless, this is more than a film about teens in love, far more. We learn of the sacrifice a family makes for their children, for music. <br/><br/>The film is emotional, yes, verily, with a simple storyline, so be ready to enjoy this film once, and leave it there. It is simply too dramatic, too close to the heart, to heavy to watch on repeat. With that said, it is a beautiful film, perfectly packaged for an ""Insta-gratification Generation"" while appealing to Xennials and Milenials alike. <br/><br/>And it is all tied together with good music: Saint-Sa√´ns Concerto N¬∞1, Beethoven Cello Sonata N¬∞3 in A Major, and the Kod√°ly Solo Sonata. We enjoy the Kod√°ly twice and quite prominently actually. We witness the only ever cello audition, ever in a film. We are with Mia and her family as they record her audition, and we witness the importance of a little brother's encouragement. <br/><br/>I know what that is like because I lived Mia's life, sans the romance. My family believed in me, encouraged me, stood backstage and gave in-car pep talks. They let me wander off and listen to the 3rd Beethoven, for months as I dreamed of a music school in California. I experienced that same ""out-of-body"" feeling Mia felt during her in-person audition. I know what it is like to play your guts out and leave it all on the stage. And I know the joy of winning that audition too. :-)<br/><br/>I am a cellist, who song writes on guitar, who lost a father to brain cancer, who auditioned for uni and WON with the same Beethoven A Major Sonata Mia loves so much.

Unfortunately, from my point of view, I simply cannot find the problem in this situation. I cannot think of a person who would actually choose to die instead of continuing his life, no matter how hard it seemed to be ahead. With life, you're not given a second chance. You live or it's game over. And with this said, there comes this movie's predictability which kind of spoils the finale. Besides this, it is exactly what you would expect from this type of movie. Dramatic and sad but also romantic and emotional. You feel sorry for her numerous times, and that is a good thing, especially as she is faced with more and more difficulties.

","The movie If I Stay, directed by R.J. Cutler comes across as just another teen romance movie at the first glance, but if you dive deeper into the meaning, you see it centers around family values and questions the choice people have in living or dying. Mia, the story's main protagonist, is faced with the ultimate question after being in a horrific car accident with her family and falling into a coma. She has the choice to fight through the pain and emotional loss that will await her when she wakes up, or to simply give up and let go. The movie focuses on Mia's passion, playing the cello, and just how influential it has been in her life. It brought her family closer together, introduced her to her boyfriend, Adam, and gives her a sense of calm and peacefulness when everything else feels like too much. We watch Mia struggle as her spirit is free to see what is happening in the hospital, as her body is stuck in the coma. Her best friend, grandparents, and Adam all let her know that they understand if she wants to just let go. The conflict in the story keeps the viewer on edge, never sure whether she will chose to fight through it, or join her family."

","The movie is definitely gets you from the beginning.It makes you wanna see what happens next.We don't have the typical high school romance with the top athlete and the cheerleader,saying love you after a couple of weeks and then breaking up over who ate the last piece of chocolate or something idiotic like that.<br/><br/>We do have a cool kid though.He is a guitar player and part of a band.He is a small star in his school.He notices a quite girl,modest and serious(not slut) who also has a fancy in music,though a different kind than his.He's stuck with her from the beginning and it is obvious that it matters cause that did not happen only due to her looks.The female character is a bit more shallow though and you can pick that up almost from the beginning.I mean she's left speechless because the school's star is talking to her.Made me wonder how would she react to him,if he wasn't someone.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie you can enjoy various music tracks,either rock-like or classical music.I liked this film because the characters are so vivid,even Mia's parents.And they happen to be pretty cool.The feeling are genuine.But after the first half of the movie and the accident,which actually shows how things can change dramatically in a blink of an eye,things begin to be a bit more shallow.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty much solid...I had some issue's with Mia.I am not sure she's mature enough as an actor yet to convince that she really feels love and pain.There were some scenes while she is in her ""spirit form"" that felt quite awkward.Also the whole genuine feeling thing,is reduced to almost a typical high school one sided romance.Mia's makes plans with Adam,he seems mature and sure of his decisions and in no case does he take or try to take advantage of her,and that was sweet and heartwarming.The thing that bothered me is that Mia is portrayed to be a bit wavy in her mind at times,reasonable since she is a teenager,but then not only lies to Adam and takes-without him-a different path than the one they chose together,but also blames things on him.The writing here was bad since we have another unreasonable character with unreasonable demands and at the end,the one who should be angry at this situation ends up apologizing and calling himself an a**h*le,like he did something wrong.Then we have the typical bul*sh*t ""You shouldn't be worried about me getting to Juliard,they won't pick me for an audition""....""Oh they picked me for an audition,but you should not worry cause I won't pass anyway"" and so on so on....<br/><br/>Last thing that put me off,was the ending.OK,she lost her parents and brother,and that is really awful,but she still has a family,friends and a boy who loves her more than anything.Everyone is there trying to support her in any way they can but she is just too hurt to want to survive this life anymore??Are you kidding me?? You stay alive for you!!For YOUR life!!Bad things will happen but you must continue,not stay down and kill over every time things aren't great.Despite everyone appearing and talking to her and showing to her how many reason she still has for living,she cares not about grandparents,friends and boyfriend,but sure when he reads her the letter from the music school Juliard and she passed,she gets moved and decides to live???.....Right there felt like a silly twilight romance to me....<br/><br/>So while there is solid acting,vivid characters,nice story telling and music,the second half of the movie lacks depth and the writing could be better.I liked it but I am skeptical cause it felt a bit shallow at the end.Nothing like ""The perks of being a wallflower""...So it's a 6/10 from me."

","I like the characters and the story. Being a musician myself, it was pretty relatable and fun to watch. I really like Mia & Adam's relationship too - the fact that they're both musicians but still different in many ways is interesting and makes their relationship more complex. I think this film was pretty realistic too (other than the fact that Mia gets in Juliard and Adam becomes a popstar which is a little...far fetched might I say). Mia basically had a normal life, until the day of the car crash. Shows how unexplainable accidents like this happen in real life, and there's nothing we can do to control it. What matters is how we handle those situations - that's what the film is trying to say, I think. The problem I had with this movie is that it felt slow paced, and when it was over I didn't feel particularly amazed. I was just like okay, that's it? Kind of predictable."

","If I Stay is a wonderful movie about a 17-year-old girl that gets into a car wreck with her family. The main character is then in a ghost type phase trying to decide if she wants to stay or not.<br/><br/>If I Stay is an American family film. It was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and New Line Cinema. It was released August 22, 2014. R. J. cutler directed this film. This film was based on the novel If I Stay by Gayle Forman. This film's main character is the young cellist, Mia Hall. When her family decides to go for a car ride on a snowy day they get into a nasty car wreck. Mia Hall is then trapped in this weird ghost-like phase although she isn't dead. She is stuck in her phase trying to decide if she wants to continue living or not. <br/><br/>Some things that made this film really more interesting was the flashbacks the main character had. They showed her life before the accident, which included: her family, friends, her cello, and her boyfriend, Adam. Mia's memories showed everything she still had to live for, even if her family really wasn't part of it anymore. The music also had a really beautiful effect on the whole movie. It matched every scene perfectly and really set the mood. Even when Mia played her cello, her music really made me feel the way she did whenever she played. I also really love the way the plot flowed. Especially with Mia's flashbacks foreshadowing what's going to happen next and her final decision.<br/><br/>The main theme of this movie is: even when all hope is lost you should hold on to what you have left of life. When Mia wasn't really sure if she should stay or go, her happy flashbacks (even the sad flashbacks) and her family/friends guided her towards her final choice. Even though she lost plenty from the wreck, she still had a lot to hold on to and continue living for. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and loved the message it sent. It was well directed and edited. This movie really made me feel grateful for everything I have and life. It taught me to grasp on to the good things in life and live through the bad. This movie is one of my new favorites because of the good messages it sent out.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie. It deserves a 10/10"

","If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be the word ""Breathtaking"". The movie itself was nothing spectacular compared to any Nicolas Sparks-like movie. There were no fancy effects, no extraordinary performances, and no unbelievable moments of suspense (like mission impossible; tom cruise hanging off a building). <br/><br/>However, the storyline is what made this movie. We meet a young lady who is going through something life changing over the course of the movie. We flip back and forth between the present and the flashbacks of her life leading up to where she is today. Throughout both, you will cry your eyes out (man or woman). I must have cried at least 3 times as this movie pulled on my heartstrings time and again. <br/><br/>You will find yourself in a whole mess of emotions and will require a sort of sugary comfort food or a snuggle buddy with whom you can watch the film. It is difficult to watch in some places, but as you reach the ending you feel this amazing sense of satisfaction that many movies these days just don't give you. I could only applaud for the ending of this film. <br/><br/>The only reason this film doesn't hit a 10 out of 10 for me is because its a full-blown chick flick with a ton of drama."
"mistoppi","4","0","0","1 March 2016"," I am so disappointed
","I learnt about this movie in school in English class that was all about movies. Two girls made their analysis on this film. I only saw the trailer, but it was enough to convince me to see this film if I ever had the chance.<br/><br/>But boy am I disappointed! I expected something way more from this film. Of course it's deep, it has important meaning. Mia is an amazing characters many people will see themselves in. But the thing is, no one can truly, truly feel like they are Mia, if they haven't been in a life or death situation before. So it feels like a waste of character. There could've been another story about Mia, amazing Mia with her talents, who doesn't even know how amazing she is. There are other stories you could put her in so people could truly feel her. But having her in weird ghost fantasy was kind of a waste, especially when this kind of story seems so typical. Has this been done before because I feel like I've seen a similar movie but with less interesting main character?<br/><br/>One of the things I hate about this film is the dialogue. Almost immediately when Adam talked with Mia I had to sigh and roll my eyes. No teenage boy talks like that! That pretentious dialogue is so annoying to listen to. It suits with some romantic sappy novels you read in rainy day, hoping you'll meet your significant other, not in a movie. I don't know if I can excuse it if the dialogue was that bad in the novel. It's like some unrealistic fantasy, and it bothers me. Does someone actually watch a movie like that and then hope they'll meet a guy who talks in poetic pretentiousness? Ugh!<br/><br/>And I really expected this to be the kind of movie you could watch and cry so long you're kind of cleansed, but no. That's the thing I'm most disappointed about. This movie didn't move me at all! I'm mostly blaming the writing for that. <br/><br/>I can't really judge right now, but usually I'm very impressed by Chloe Grace Moretz. She's a talented young actress. She was very convincing as Mia, she was astonishing. She displays emotions well, no matter how ""bad"" they might look in front of a camera. That's what I love about her acting.<br/><br/>I loved the music in this film, but if it's a movie about music then... Then it's kind of obvious you have to have good music there. There was both classical music and punk rock. It's the same kind of contrast that was between Mia and Adam. <br/><br/>As I said before, this movie is very deep and it has an important meaning. It struggles with several themes that may not be important in general, it's not like this movie has a political message. No, the message is mostly for individuals. And even if the horrid dialogue makes you shiver, If I Stay really makes you think about several things the movie mentions. You don't have to agree with the message, but at least you think about it.<br/><br/>If I Stay was definitely not for me. If you love movies about teenagers that are actually deep, this is for you. If you don't care about writing too much, this movie might be for you. Obviously If I Stay has an audience that loves it, and it's definitely meant for someone. If I stay is deep, the message is amazing and it's probably even emotional movie when it hits the right person. If you are sure you won't like it, don't bother. But if you think there might be a chance you'll love this movie, take that chance."

","Before i talk about the movie, i just want to say that the acting was fantastic!So I Just watched this movie for the second time and I like it even more now. The first time I saw it, I was annoyed with the ending. I didn't like the fact that they took us through a roller coaster of emotions and just leave it with Mia opening her eyes at the end. I was hoping to see her wake up and show a big love scene of Adam telling Mia how much he loves her and then show them a few years later together living in New York. Now seeing it again I thought the ending was perfect. I think the first time around, you're distracted because the whole time you're thinking ""is she going to live or die""? So you're waiting and waiting for this big climax but you don't really get one. The second time around, you already know the ending so I feel like you appreciate the movie more. It's not your typical cheesy romance movie. I highly recommend watching this."

","If I Stay is one of the most beautiful, emotional, and amazing films you could watch. It is about a girl called Mia (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) who suffers from a major car accident that her and her family are in. She goes into a coma, and she has an out-of-body experience. The movie also flashbacks to incidents about her life leading up to the accident and around that about either passions or difficulties (the cello, getting into Juilliard or not, and her boyfriend Adam). It is shown that her mom, dad and brother died from complications from the collision, but Mia was still in a coma, and the doctors, Adam and her best friend Kim, were hoping she would wake up (with one of the doctors assuring her that it was her choice whether she lived or died) towards the end, after the rest of her family sadly passing, her grandfather who had a close bond with and devotion to her, was beside her hospital bed in tears, saying that she needs to fight to stay alive because she's come so far with her life. Soon after, at different times, both Kim and Adam were devastated beside her bed, talking to her, hoping she'd wake up (Kim takes out a photo on her phone that she said she'll always remember her by that photo, and Adam puts headphones on her head to play a specific type of song/music). Soon after the moment with her and Adam, she wakes up from the coma, and the movie ends on Adam's word ""Mia?""<br/><br/>Both plots with the flashbacks of Mia's cello talent, her relationship with Adam and hope for a place in Julliard, and then the out-of-body experience she has in the hospital, are done brilliantly and are both extremely emotional in many ways. This movie certainly made me shed a tear. A great movie altogether."

If our decision makes everyone and us happy so why not choosing it? Mia wants to give up (die) but just because of Adam, who is her boyfriend, makes her fight for life again. Life is not about ending up so easily because we have our choice and we should have solutions for the problems. Everything not just ends up by the death.

","Mia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a promising young cellist whose biggest wish is to be accepted into Julliard which is an esteemed music school. She's also set to go on a date with rocker Adam on Friday night. However, she decides to go out for a drive to see relatives with her family and unfortunately their car collides with an oncoming vehicle. Mia ends up in a coma, but ends up experiencing some sort of afterlife and is in a position to see the aftermath of the accident which ultimately makes her re-examine her whole life where she realises that she has some tough choices to make.<br/><br/>Although If I Stay initially feels like it's ripping Ghost off I have to admit that this is a relatively interesting and involving film. The film essentially has two strands to its story; you have Mia's out of body or afterlife story arc where she is able to see how the accident affects both her and her friends and family. The second strand of the story is a little more interesting where we get to see what would have happened if Mia would have stayed and gone on her date with Adam rather than go out in the car with her family. Although it's interesting to start with I got the feeling that we have a film with 10-15 minutes worth of plot which was agonising drawn out to a 95 minute feature film. Many of the scenes in this film were repetitive (particularly the scenes in the hospital). As mentioned, the other arc to the story was slightly better, but this again felt like it was going round in circles. I also never really felt that there was much chemistry between Adam and Mia which again was something else that drew me slightly away from the film.<br/><br/>Shauna Cross' screenplay is a mixed bag and although there are some heartfelt and touching scenes for me the film also became a little irritating - things like Mia's afterlife moments where she keeps talking to people even though it's established very early on that they can't hear her. For me this became quite annoying and together with the tedious repetitive nature of the narrative it also made it a very long 95 minutes. The ending of the film is also a little cheesy.<br/><br/>I can't really fault the performances and I can see that If I Stay is a film that's full of good intentions as well as offering some interesting insights into the afterlife and life verses death, but the story is unbearably slow, repetitive and a little tedious at times. It's a shame because there was a lot of potential here, but sadly most of it is wasted."

It is not the first time such theme as an out of body experience is exploited. But this love story between Mia, a talented but shy Cello player and Adam, a future rock star to be, is really touching and a tearjerker. 2 worlds collide but they do a wonderful union.<br/><br/>The two main actors, Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley have a really good chemistry between them. There are a lot of scene which makes me cry especially the last one when Adam starts singing a song he wrote for her telling how much he loves her and how he wants her to wake up to fully live their passion. Stacy Keach is also very touching in his role of a grandfather so proud of his granddaughter and who is completely torn to have lost his son, daughter in law and grandson, whose only hope left is to see Mia waking up.<br/><br/>But Chloe's performance is so touched by grace. Seeing her realizing how much she has lost in that car crash, seeing the people she cherishes the most passing away, completely powerless. Her performance makes me cry all alone. She really proved how talented she is and I truly hope a lot of directors have seen her golden talent as well.

The family (or the author of the book this is based on) didn't see the value of a loved one at the bedside of a coma victim until way into the end of the movie. Maybe the family knew about the break-up and didn't want Adam there. Maybe. Still I would think that everything should be done to help a patient out of a coma. <br/><br/>Miss Moretz is truly an exceptional actress and we'll see much more of her in the future. The entire cast was very good and we were not bored any time they were on screen. It was the length of the too long script that put this into the ""average"" category as the pacing was too drawn out. <br/><br/>Notables: Liana Liberato as Kim, Mia's best friend; and Stacy Keech, Mia's ""gramps"", who came up with a very good bedside pleading. It's okay to have a box of Kleenex nearby at this time. <br/><br/>This started out really good and became average. <br/><br/>The last scenes involve Adam and Mia whereby Adam had finally written a song about Mia and sings it to her at her bedside.

It is not just a teenage love story, its about music, family, death. And the director works the flashback (that are many) smoothly and that keeps the interest high throughout the movie.

","To start: I have not read the book, but I would be willing to after watching this movie.<br/><br/>I overall liked it. It's a great romantic drama between two musicians as they find how to work out their relationship with different opportunities for each being presented.<br/><br/>What I did not like about the film was the constant flashbacks. They we're very necessary to unfold the story line, but I feel having them run at the same time as we are dealing with the ""crash"" scene was distracting. I felt like I was having to balance two different stories at one time, and honestly they took away from the climatic and dramatic crash. It didn't have time to build up. (someone may comment that it is how it is done in the book, i have no doubt if it we're, but whereas that might work in a book, it's not very effective in film.)"

","I was expecting something with the ""romance"" of Twilight and the tragical fate of The fault in our stars. But what I've seen was a piece of art. I usually don't fall for these teen romances but this movie was different. You think you'll see 2 hours of clich√©s and a boring love story but it wasn't those things at all. Mia's love was believable and the romance was intense, while still being presented seriously. I really liked the picture they gave us about Mia and Adam. Even though the fact that ""she's never been on a kind of date"" and then after 3 dates, sleeping with each other seems a bit unrealistic to me, I think they showed us teen love in a beautiful way. The movie also managed to maintain the balance between this side, the family tragedy Mia was going through and the choice whether to leave for New York. For me, Mia's story felt relatable and she was a character I could easily identify with, therefore the movie experience of her happiness and tragedy really touched me. The ending was on point, not much but enough and still touching. All things considered the word I could use to describe the movie is beautiful and that it was a piece of art. The cello parts made it sophisticated but still modern.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've seen such a movie so I can recommend it to those who are even a bit interested."

","I really like this movie. I am a life-long musician and the theme of this movie captured me totally. Plus the young actress carries this movie and shows why she is one of the best teenagers acting currently.<br/><br/>Chlo√´ Grace Moretz (of ""hugo"" fame) is Mia Hall, part of a wonderful family and with a younger brother she loves. At a very young age she took and interest in the cello and at 16 had developed into a prodigy of sorts. She didn't even realize fully her capabilities.<br/><br/>But tragedy strikes and everything changes. She has choices but the movie is about how she will make her choice and what that will lead to.<br/><br/>The rest of my comments contain story SPOILERS and should not be read by anyone who doesn't know the story here. <br/><br/>It snows and the family takes advantage of school being canceled for a snow day, perhaps unwisely take a road trip. In the icy conditions a truck skids into their car, everyone is badly injured, and Mia finds herself in the snow, apparently unharmed. But as she walks towards the wreckage sees herself, badly injured and unconscious. Her spirit is observing this, she gets into the ambulance with her injured self, and much of the remaining movie is in the hospital as she and others are treated.<br/><br/>But it isn't that simple, as she is required to ""decide"" whether she will let herself actually die, or be brought out of the coma, we see her life the past year and a half leading up to that, how she meets a boy at school who is a rocker, how she finds love through that relationship, her audition for Julliard, and a number of other things.<br/><br/>She finds out her mom and dad both die, then her brother does too, she doesn't want to awaken to live as an orphan. But the pivotal scene is when she (her spirit), unseen and unheard by others, hears her cello music over the hospital's paging system. But as she rushes to the room where her unconscious self is, finds that her boyfriend is playing the music into her ears using headphones. She has him, she has Julliard, she has a life ahead and wakes up. <br/><br/>The boyfriend is played by Brit Jamie Blackley as Adam who does all his own singing with his fictitious rock band. Moretz took cello lessons to appear realistic, but face replacement technology in post-production was used to make it appear she was really playing."

"billygoat1071","4","3","8","4 September 2014"," Wandered Drama
","If I Stay has a strong premise, it might as well be compared to Ghost, but this one gives the main character an opportunity either to live even without her family or to die leaving the rest of her loved ones. It gives a vast emotional tone whenever she explores her past and trying to choose between her fate, but it doesn't let the conflict be as stirring as it meant to be. The plot is so burdened with the flashbacks that feels more like one big exposition leading to the tragedy they are facing right now, as for the plot itself it doesn't bring enough intrigue to its actual situation. I know that the film wishes to build more of the drama than the high concept, but it also feels like a huge hindrance from something that is actually interesting to the story. Those big chunks of memory didn't help the story to bloom enough either, and that is how it sadly fail.<br/><br/>One of its conspicuous problems is its lack of exploring through its supernatural side. The situation of the character does sound risky, but the film doesn't make the cope feel like it's right there. Definitely, the story has to rely on the backstory of Mia. Those flashbacks do not have much of a big conflict, they're basically just simple problems that are already too familiar in many romantic films you've ever seen. Adding it with their affections to music is its only, but small distinction. What the movie tends to bring isn't really hard to figure out. It obviously tries to make the audience connect with the characters so when the story hits to where the movie started, it would make the life and death decision look a lot challenging. But there isn't really much happening to Mia's ghostly journey. It only consists few actions, which is either finding out what happened to her family or just watching her mourning loved ones. And the nurse who somehow knows about this weird spirit zone seems to only exist for exposition to a world that doesn't even try to make sense.<br/><br/>It does have a fine job of building how their lifestyle works. All of these scenes are quite pleasant to watch, and the characters are pretty charming adding a shade of life, but we mostly cannot reckon what else is big or interesting going to happen next, other than the accident. Much of their personal issues are just stale to keep the attention on, and yet it gets more of the focus than its most crucial moments, which leads the entire film momentum free as possible. The acting however helps to make it tolerable. Chloe Grace Moretz has outweighed her own character, she gives more of the soul than what it is written for Mia. Jamie Blackley is fine, even though he didn't leave any mark to the character other than being a cool boyfriend. And the adult cast, although with only few scenes, perfectly delivers the needed gravitas the movie is cut out for.<br/><br/>If I Stay may set its tone right and have a better ambition to flesh out its love story, but in the end it's just a rather dull surface. The main plot rarely goes anywhere, until the final act at least when the genuine drama is starting to show, but it is going to take a lot of time to get there. And even with that normal runtime, the film almost feels unending, precisely because it doesn't earn enough growth with its own storyline. But my real complain here is its lack of consideration to its much interesting themes: the grounded romance isn't really that fresh (even if they're musicians, it doesn't change a whole lot) and the fantasy elements are terribly underutilized, which doesn't give the full compelling effect it wanted to show."

"burlesonjesse5","6","2","5","7 September 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of If I Stay
","Hey, everybody cries at the movies. Heck, to this day I even sob when I view the ending of Hoosiers (and I'm 40 years old, crazy right?). So at a screening for what was supposed to be a three handkerchief flick, I checked around the room to see if any audience member had their tear ducts flowing. Not one, nothing but dry eyes. Should I tell everyone to revisit Ghost again (a film that the one I'm about to review sort of resembles)? I guess so. But most people have probably already seen it. Well, to those who haven't viewed that spooky gem from 1990 yet, you'll probably get word of mouth from other moviegoers and figure it out. You don't need my help.<br/><br/>Anyway, here are the words that I would use to describe the teen tearjerker If I Stay (which takes place in Oregon): manipulative, overlong, and a tad sappy. While there are a few heartfelt moments, this vehicle only comes to life towards the last half hour. Within this half hour, it concentrates solely on hospital scenes showing our protagonist (Chloe Grace Moretz is miscast but she stills radiates a little screen presence as Mia Hall) laying comatose in a trauma ward bed. Prior to that, If I Stay consists of an uneven dispersal involving present day scenes that possess virtually no dramatic tension and tireless, young love flashbacks that resemble an episode of The O.C. as opposed to an actual feature length film.<br/><br/>Like the aforementioned Ghost, If I Stay follows the story arc of the 2004 firefighter drama Ladder 49. ""49"" is a flick in which the hero or main character, is shown dying at the beginning and the remainder of the proceedings involve flashbacks of their life leading up to that point. If I Stay also feels a lot like the 2005 dramedy Just Like Heaven in which the lead role (Reese Witherspoon as Dr. Elizabeth Masterson) is on the verge of dying, leaves her body, and is able to watch her unconscious self being slowly brought back to life. I have to say that Ladder 49 and Just Like Heaven are unfortunately, really lousy movies. Is If I Stay a better film than the utterly disposable ones just mentioned? Yes, but only slightly better and I'm being generous, trust me.<br/><br/>Based on a novel (of the same name) written by Gayle Forman, If I Stay begins with images of an Oregon forest and treetops of heavy snow. The movie chronicles the character of Mia Hall (Moretz). She grew up the child of hippy rock band parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard as Denny and Kat Hall). Instead of following in their rock n' roller footsteps, Mia decides instead to concentrate on playing beautiful classical music via her cello. As the proceedings move along, Mia falls in love with a fellow boy musician at her high school (Adam Wilde played by Jamie Blackley who kind of looks like a young Tom Hanks), tries to get into The Juilliard School harnessing her music, and eventually succumbs to a car accident where her, her brother, and her parents become severely injured.<br/><br/>In the first paragraph of the review, I talked about the fact that If I Stay contains flashbacks (and there are a bunch of them). In fact, the whole film is concentrated almost solely on flashbacks. We see Mia's early childhood, her relationship with her family, her love for the cello at a young age, and yes, the soggy melodrama between her and her rocker boyfriend. Every once in a while, If I Stay when it feels like it, decides to intercut these flashbacks with present day scenes in the hospital where Mia is on the verge of death (from her car accident). Here in lies the problem: these scenes are short, underwritten, underplayed, and lack serious dramatic heft. In fact, the car crash sequence that should be designed to illicit a heavy response from your typical moviegoer, has almost no buildup and it happens in the blink of an eye. Honestly, it was so quick it's as if it never happened. Finally, there's Moretz in the title role. She narrates most of the running time and it kills any dramatic momentum that ""Stay"" could have contained. Ultimately, it's too perky. And I guess she's seventeen in real life but honestly, she looks about 13 or 14 here. She doesn't appear fully developed enough to resemble a high school student and she actually has a PG-13 style love scene. Pretty darn creepy if you ask me.<br/><br/>In conclusion, If I Stay is a mixed bag for sure. And although I believe that Chloe Grace Moretz can indeed act, she looks and comes off as a little too young to carry a romantic drama. Along with a tiring, recycled screenplay (which includes lots of make-up break-up stuff that is better suited for the teenage crowd than a serious adult audience member) and a story that although decently told, seems to drag on and on, If I Stay ends on a down note if you think about it (I won't reveal whether the Mia character lives or dies but (spoiler alert) her family doesn't make it in the car crash and if she had survived, would her life by any less scarred?). Bottom line: if you are not patient with this movie, you as the audience member, might say to yourself, ""should I go?""<br/><br/>Of note: if you choose to take in a viewing of If I Stay, look for the stars of the film hovering around a bonfire and singing an acoustic guitar/cello version of ""Today"" by Smashing Pumpkins. Gosh, I almost forgot how much I missed that song."

The plot was good, the cast was nicely acted except Chloe Moretz, she was at first acting good but sometimes she overacted her character even she was forcing trying to drop a simple tears when she was sad. His boyfriend was acting after he bang her like a complete jerk and selfish. She was somehow submissive to her boyfriend because she was so insecure woman even that she have the best down to earth parents that anyone wish to have. I was so desperate to get inside of the movie to unplug the life support machine in order to finish this annoying movie. All the time, she was like this: i'm going, i'm not going, i'm going, and i'm not, and on, and on and on. COME ON, make up your mind! I believe this movie is worth to be seen in DVD not in theater. Some scenes where good, some others not that IMPRESSED! I recommend better the movie: The fault in our stars. More realistic and touching that shows what is real love even after death.

","The acting was truly awful. I hated the way Chloe played Mia Hall. It's not that she didn't stay true to the book, she just didn't act very well at all. Forget what his name was, but the actor who played Adam was terrible as well. The best part of this movie is that they know the smashing pumpkins. The acting was just pathetically terrible. It's fine if you change some of the details from the movie, but to change almost the entire relationship story of the two lovers is just formidable. I hated the movie, but I loved the book. It's clear that the producers weren't able to correctly read the book before making it into a movie. Mind you, these were the producers of twilight, and I'm not sure what I expected."

","""Isn't it amazing how life is one thing and then, in an instant it becomes something else.""<br/><br/>If I stay is the latest film adapted from a YA novel, and even though this movie is in no way aimed towards an adult audience, it does have some moments that aren't as superficial as one would expect coming from this genre. Despite of all the clich√©s and the melodramatic scenes the story works thanks to Chloe Grace Moretz who is able to hold the film together and get us through all the corny moments. Her chemistry with Jamie Blackley on screen works, although in my opinion their moments together weren't actually the best scenes. When the film focused on the relationship with her parents was when I actually was drawn more to the story, and the few scenes she had with her grandfather, played by Stacy Keach, where the highlight of the film. There is actually a very emotional scene near the end where Keach gives a powerful speech which if were in a better film, critics would be talking about award consideration for his small performance here. Of course that won't be the case because we are talking about a YA novel adaptation filled with flaws. Chloe Grace Moretz gives an inspired performance as well and she is actually what holds this film together. She has four more films coming out this year so hopefully we will get plenty of more opportunities to see her shine in better films. She is an actress who has been in my radar since her role in Kick-Ass and I absolutely love her. The romantic part of the film which is the main attraction for young teenage girls is probably the weakest thing about If I stay considering it's full of clich√©s. The fact that both these characters are in to music helps out the film because the soundtrack stands out, but at times the romance feels like it's part of a music video clip with beautiful scenery and good looking people. If I Stay fails to break out from the genre conventions and the premise might be a bit far stretched to make much logical sense. It is also very manipulative and at times the scenes are basically introduced to force the audience to let out a couple tears. Having been released only a few months after The Fault in Our Stars also hurts this film because it doesn't handle the emotional scenes as well as that film did. Moretz and Keach are basically the only reason why I'm giving this film 3 stars. <br/><br/>If I Stay was adapted from Gayle Forman's novel of the same name by Shauna Cross (known for Whip It and What to Expect When You're Expecting). Moretz is Mia, a talented cello player who catches the attention of Adam (Jamie Blackley), the rock star of her High School who is actually getting an important break with his band. Adam falls in love with Mia, the shy and quiet girl from school and they quickly begin a relationship. The love story is told through flashbacks as Mia is going through an out of body experience after she suffered a fatal car accident with her family. Her parents and younger brother are all killed in the accident and she is left in a coma. She must decide whether she continues to fight and stay or if she should let go now that her family is gone. How she is given the power to decide is never really mentioned in the film and doesn't make much sense, but we just have to accept it. The parents are perfect which makes the audience feel Mia's pain and loss. There isn't one scene where her parents look like real people because they are constantly portrayed as these cool and perfect parents. It is perhaps a flaw in this film, but I actually enjoyed the scenes they shared with Moretz. It is all pretty much a fantasy aiming to make the audience cry and feel sorry for Mia, but Moretz's grounded and natural performance elevates this otherwise poor film."
"zkonedog","4","1","2","26 February 2017"," Seems A Bit Gimmicky
","After loving the roles that Chloe Grace Moretz played in ""Carrie"" & ""The Equalizer"", I decided to give this one a shot after recently having watched (and enjoyed more than I thought) a similar teen drama in ""The Fault In Our Stars"". Unfortunately, I felt that this one was kind of based on a gimmick.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""If I Stay"" tells the story of Mia (Moretz), a high school girl who plays a beautiful cello. This musical talent gets her noticed by cute guy Adam (Jamie Blackley) and she is awaiting a letter from Juilliard's music program. On a seemingly normal family drive, however, Mia is involved in a car crash putting the entire family in the hospital. As ""physical Mia"" fights for her life in the hospital, ""spirit Mia"" watches the action unfold as a kind of ghost entity, trying to discover what is happening to her and her family members. Many moments of the previous year are flashed-back to as Mia discovers what is really important in her life.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it seems to be based on what I consider to be a very gimmicky concept, that being ""spirit Mia"" watching herself (and her family) in the hospital interspersed with flashbacks. What purpose did that serve in the film besides to give Moretz more time to act? It all could have been done with Mia just laying in her hospital bed. All that would have been missed was a few reaction shots.<br/><br/>Couple that with the fact that the story here didn't strike me as particularly strong to begin with. Maybe if one appreciates cello music more than I do, or is a sucker for sad movies, they will find more significance here, but I never felt that what I was watching made the jump from ""contrived"" to ""real"".<br/><br/>The highlights? Moretz is still great in her role (as convoluted as it may be sometimes), while a grandfather character (played by Stacy Keach) practically steals the show with ever scene he is in. In a movie that should be filled with such emotion, it is telling that a guy on the screen in a very limited role has such an impact.<br/><br/>Thus, while I know I shouldn't directly compare this to ""Fault In Our Stars"", it just so happens that I saw both within about a two-week span. ""Fault"" made me actually care about what was going on and drew me in. ""Stay""...not so much. At times I even got a little bored waiting for something to happen. Like I said, Chloe Grace Moretz is still solid, but it isn't enough to inject life into this vehicle."

Chloe's character slowly became less annoying and the movie lost a bit of its pretentiousness. HOWEVER, the end of the movie was absolute garbage. The entire movie makes you invested in the relationship between Adam and Mia, then it puts a gun in your face and pulls the trigger. Spoiler: at the end of the movie, Mia decides to wake up, despite losing her whole family. And for what? For her first love, who acted like a stubborn idiot until she was on her deathbed. Yes, he was only happy about her fulfilling her dreams when she was literally dying. This movie is PATHETIC."

","This was a good adaptation of the book by Gayle Forman. I think the movie captures it well, as does the cast. I like the way the movie flashes back and forth in between the hospital scenes and the story behind the love interests' story. Chloe Grace Moretz is a good choice to play the lead as a gifted cello player who gets an audition for Julliard, and it causes friction between her and her boyfriend, who's the lead singer in a band. Her father was in a band too. Chloe is involved in a horrific car accident and has an out-of-body experience and learns how much everyone cares for her, the fate of everyone else involved, and the hardest decision she had to make. This is a movie about love, sacrifice, and decisions. I loved it. <br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","If you are looking for a romantic movie to watch in a lonely night, this is it! The best approach of the movie was decision making so I say it's self raising. It's realistic and touchy because it's the kind of a life that teenagers would like to live so what happens when 'this life' breaks apart? Decisions are made regarding our fate and life goes on. The chemistry between the boy and Mia was everything. If you're looking for a different love story, go for this film. It has nothing with teenagers being very sexually involved or making big dreams come true. It says falling in love with the wrong person is not always wrong, so why not love it? I's a smart creation because everything was matching and nothing awful."

","1) Too much kiss scene which is really not necessary. I don't get the feeling they are really in love just because of all those kiss scenes.<br/><br/>2) The girl in the movie is so naive and always jealous about anything: For example, she could be angry about Adam out of town to Seattle for shows, but she do not show any happiness if Adam drive back for a day of drive just to see her when the night got no show in Seattle. And she shows not happy when Adam phone her immediately already when big news happened to his band. She just feel angry when the phone ended up being Adam's phone was wet in champagne. She is so inconsiderate. etc.<br/><br/>3) The actress for the girl do not know how to act. The scene where she and Adam argued about she getting an audition out of town and he's leaving for a show, Adam acted great but she acted so bad, with not much face expression or voice change at all. These kind of lack of facial expression and emotion in voices happened all the time in the movie. This make me feel that she is just acting for this movie due to her beautiful face. (A vase for the movie). I really could not like her at all.<br/><br/>4) There are part of the movie, actually all parts, that the writer want to show the audience that the boy and the girl's relationship is mature. Like the part where they sleep on bed after sex, and talk about life, talk about when's their first time knowing they are good at music etc, they just do not show the feels! At least the girl did a bad job. They are too young to talk about life or talk about success. Just because of the car accident, why need to make them look like they are finding the love of their life. And they are actually at the beginning of it after all. They got trust issues, and many other issues. This is just the same with any other relationship, or even puppy love. There are no need to make a big deal out of it. I feel so disappointed with the movie."

Over all, its a good movie, but If you don't want to waste your time wanting to know what is going to happen next, don't watch it.

","Whilst beautifully acted and a tender love story, I was disappointed by the unrelenting sadness and trauma that was central to the story. I'm not sure why a well written script and wonderful actors had to be so terribly undermined by a psychologically upsetting and even traumatic narrative that literally grabbed hold of you and didn't let go. I feel upset and haunted, and all the beauty is now lost on me. Not a way to spend a Saturday evening, unless you need a good cry and enjoy imagining tragedy. I mean, good films can have tragedy, but with some redeeming features, some lightness and warmth to provide balance and scope -- this was just terribly upsetting."
"Robert_duder","6","1","3","4 September 2014"," Surprisingly dreary and slow, saved only by a very good cast
","Really my header says it all. I expected this to be a lovely, heart wrenching drama/romance filled with teen angst and a ridiculously syrupy sweet story and honestly? It hardly was any of that. The story seemed to drag excruciatingly so and it jumps back and forth in a way that never really works. I actually thought 3/4 of the way through the movie that they were doing something clever, playing a trick on you where the flash backs were actually flash forwards and I was getting excited that something unique and clever would come out of this...and then...nothing. Dreary. Almost boring. How unfortunate! I haven't yet seen The Fault In My Stars but I'm hoping it is far better than this. I am glad to say that the cast for the most part saves this from being a complete awful mess. The cast is actually very good and I would even say that much of the dialogue and script is pretty good too. Its the plot and the pacing where the film truly stumbles. The chemistry with our lead ""Romeo and Juliette"" if you will is okay at best and with a romance full of passion and angst you want incredible chemistry. Any of the romantic classics the chemistry is phenomenal.<br/><br/>I adore Chloe Grace Moretz. I think she is one of the best young talents in Hollywood period. Since the moment I saw her in Let Me In I knew she was a talent to be reckoned with. Her charisma on screen shines through here and her role is very good (though a little predictable) but she does well in it. This is definitely a starring vehicle for her and the slow pace doesn't take away from her performance which is very good. Jamie Blackley is her Romeo. He's decent. He plays the role well. The role is also painstakingly predictable. He's a young rocker with a hint of goth to him and he's created with the sole purpose to make teen girls swoon and I suppose he does that well. The chemistry between them is decent which helps. Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard are fantastic as the free spirited parents of Moretz's Mia. Enos and Leonard have a lot of great lines in the film, very memorable life moments and they are fun together and as individual characters. Stacy Keach might give the best performance in the whole film. He is one to watch because he is quite honestly stunning. His scene beside Mia and his desperate speech to her is heart wrenching. Liana Liberato as Moretz's best friend is okay but very underused and just sort of there.<br/><br/>So the cast ranges from good to great...so why does the movie fail? Simple. It is painfully predictable, horribly mis-paced, and very scattered in its story telling. I think this lays solely on the shoulders of our director and perhaps writers too. RJ Cutler has absolutely no experience in this genre and it has such a direct demographic that it is aimed at. Cutler is a pro at documentaries and at some Television but how would he get this job? Even screenwriter Shauna Cross who has done some good work is not right for this film. I often wonder what studios are thinking when they give scripts like this to people who don't have the right area of expertise. Its an average film aimed at young teen girls with too much sex to really appeal to that age group and not enough direction to make it worthwhile. Skip this one and wait for another romance with more oomph behind it. 6/10 (most of this rating if not all is for the cast.)"
"shawneofthedead","5","1","3","3 September 2014"," A guaranteed weepie that, in trying to tell its love story, loses sight of its profound family tragedy.
","There's a genre of movie for every mood - comedies to make you laugh, horror flicks to give you the heebie-jeebies, and weepies to make you cry until your eyes hurt. If I Stay, of course, belongs to the last category, alongside films like The Notebook and The Bridges Of Madison County. At their best, such movies strike right at the heart, finding something devastatingly truthful to say about the tragedy of the human condition. At their worst, they wallow in undercooked melodrama, wringing tears by brute force rather than gentle persuasion. If I Stay hovers uncomfortably in the middle, a first-rate tearjerker with some third-rate narrative twists.<br/><br/>Mia Hall (Chloe Moretz) is the oddball in her family: obsessed with her cello and classical music, she can't imagine how her super-chill, hard-rockin' parents - dad Denny (Joshua Leonard) and mom Kat (Mireille Enos) - could ever have produced someone like her. One perfectly ordinary snow day, her entire family, including little brother Teddy (Jakob Davies), gets in the car for a fateful drive that will change her life forever. Suddenly, Mia finds herself wandering through the broken remnants and memories of her life, as her body lies torn and tattered in a hospital. Teetering quite literally between life and death, she revisits her romance with budding rock-star Adam (Jamie Blackley), and watches as her grandparents (Stacy Keach and Gabrielle Rose) and best friend Kim (Liana Liberato) wait in breathless, heartbreaking anticipation for her to wake up from her coma.<br/><br/>There's a tantalising question in the film's title - what is there left for Mia if she chooses to stay, to live? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is tangled up rather uncomfortably in Mia's relationship with Adam, which is flushed with the heat of first love. The romance makes sense, more or less, but for every genuinely sweet moment (Adam coming up with an interesting idea to decorate Mia's room), there's another that's either cloying or clunkily written. The weight of their love frequently relies on silly, cheesy proclamations, and it's hard to tie it into the kind of soul-defining connection that we're supposed to believe might keep Mia tied to the world of the living. <br/><br/>Far more effective is the lively, heartwarming dynamic within Mia's family: the film feels stronger, and the tears it elicits more real, when we delve into Hall history. We find out how Denny came to have the strength to give up being in a rock band; and we watch, hearts in our mouths, as Kat gives her daughter some invaluable life advice as they wash dishes at the kitchen sink. Keach's Gramps, by the way, will shatter your heart and tear ducts when he sits by his granddaughter's bedside, wanting her to live but not wanting her to suffer. It's a shame that this part of Mia's life winds up taking a back-seat to her love story - all-encompassing as it understandably is. <br/><br/>The cast is better than the film strictly deserves. Blackley has enough charisma to hold it together when his character swerves swiftly from mature to childish. Enos and Leonard are wonderful as Mia's parents, skulking after her to demand that she have fun instead of keeping to her invented curfew. But this is really Moretz's film, and she carries it with a great deal of grace. Even when she's called upon to rend her garments and clutch her face in despair, the camera swirling (melo)dramatically around her, she emerges with dignity intact. She lends If I Stay the credibility to power through its more poorly-crafted moments. <br/><br/>If it's a full-blown weepie you're looking for, quality be damned, If I Stay will hit the proverbial spot. Even though its plotting and execution never quite works in the way it's meant to, this film is pretty much constructed to drag the tears out of you - and that it will do, come hell or high water. But if you're looking for a finely-crafted drama with deep insights into the tragedy of life and the joy of death (and vice versa), you're more likely than not to be frustrated by If I Stay, which spends too much time in the realm of teen romance and too little exploring the rich, far more affecting family drama at its heart."
"Iamdiva28","2","2","12","14 February 2015"," Teenage Sex
","Not a family movie. Would have been great had it not been for the teenage sex scenes (multiple). Was excited about seeing it, but bummed now, not a keeper. The acting was fairly good, but as a mother and as a teacher who sees too many students suffering the consequences of teenage sex (pregnancy, STD, date rape, etc.), I did not appreciate the fact that it made it out to be ""ok"" and it was just another part of a relationship. Again, it would have been good except for that, as well as a kissing scene between two girls, although brief, again not appropriate for children and definitely not a family movie. Other non-family friendly elements include teenage drinking and a few party scenes. These elements could have been implied, but instead there was just way too much of it and it kept coming. I think this movie would have received much greater reviews had these elements not been present. NOT a good movie."

","Review:¬† I'm in two minds about this movie because I liked the¬†intriguing out of body¬†experience¬† footage, although she should have known that no one could hear her but I didn't like the corny love story which took over a majority of the storyline. Chloe's acting was also a bit annoying because she kept on wondering around the hospital in a daze. The movie is about an inspiring cello player who falls in love with a popular lead singer in a up and coming rock group. There's then this big accident which destroyed the whole family and leaves them with life threatening injuries. Whilst in hospital the main character, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, has an out of body experience and runs round the hospital, scared that she's going to loose her whole family. The movie then travels back in time to show how she met her boyfriend and her relationship with her family. The problem with this movie is that the love story really took over the whole plot, even though the family is fighting for there lives. I was waiting for ages for something to happen, and when it finally does, it's nothing that amazing. The teenagers got on my nerves after a while, especially the guy who was playing her boyfriend and the ending was proper corny. Anyway, I personally lost interest after a while and I don't think that the concept was executed that well. Not that great!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Chloe Grace Moretz has been getting some major roles lately and she always seems to be playing the lead but I¬†personally don't think that her performances have been that amazing.¬†I think she was the wrong choice for Carrie and Kiss Ass 2 was really disappointing but she was great in the first Kick Ass and her small part in the Equalizer wasn't that bad. I don't think that she has had a role that has pushed her to the limit yet but at the ripe age of 18, she's got plenty of time to shine. She has achieved so much at such an early age so I hope that it all doesn't go to her head. The rest of the cast were¬†mediocre along with the whole back and forth thing that got on my nerves. Anyway, the film made a healthy profit at the box office, due to the adverts showing all the best bits but I personally wasn't that impressed with the film.¬†<br/><br/>Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $78.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/dramas about a girl whose an inspiring cello player and falls in love with a rock star but she is close to death after a fatal car crash. 4/10"

"jadinkelsey","3","0","1","1 October 2015"," If I Stay
","""If I Stay"", a movie that almost has five stars on Netflix, is not worth the watch. It started out as a book and should have stayed a book. The movie is like every other drama movie. It makes you cry like you never thought you would and keeps you in suspense. The movie is watchable because of the tear-jerking plot, and the way you can relate to the characters, but if you're looking for a movie with good acting, I suggest looking elsewhere. <br/><br/>The movie starts out with Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) eating breakfast with her family. After finding out it was a snow day, Mia's parents, played by Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard, decide to take her and her little brother to their grandparents' house to get Mia's mind off her crazy, teenage life. Little did Mia know that that was the last time she would be eating breakfast with her family. On the way there a tragic accident occurs and leaves Mia in a coma. Mia has an out-of-body experience and can see everything that goes on but no one can see or hear her. She now has to decide whether or not it is worth waking up to a life she never expected. As the movie progresses it flashes back to events that happened in the past and introduces her hunk-of-a-boyfriend, Adam (Jamie Blackley) and her best friend, Kim (Liana Liberato). <br/><br/>The acting in the movie makes a huge difference in how the movie is portrayed. Mia, the main character, has a lot of weird moments. The movie sometimes made me feel uncomfortable because of how awkward of an actor Chloe is. An example would be the part when Mia gets stung by a bee at one of her parents' potluck dinners and Adam sucks the stinger out of her hand. It is a hard scene to watch because you feel uncomfortable for them because of all Mia's ""family"" sitting around the table. There is a part later in the movie that shows Adam and Mia getting intimate and as she is taking clothes off Adam she rehearses notes or strings like she is playing her cello. Extremely weird!<br/><br/>The script is also something that contributes to the terrible acting because there are some awful attempts to be funny. The part where Mia tells Kim she wants to lick the side of Adam's face is a dreadful way to fit in humor. Alongside the part where Mia dresses up as a rock star for Halloween to impress Adam at one of his shows and then does this weird ""grr"" to Adam when asking if he likes her better dressed in this costume or her normal, boring self. Adam replies with something sweet, like he always does. <br/><br/>The reason that this movie is highly rated is because of the storyline. It is a heartbreaking movie. Unlike some drama movies, the director, R.J. Cutler, really keeps you guessing on whether or not Mia will decide to wake up. Another reason this movie has good reviews is because you can connect with the characters. It is a very relatable movie because the director puts you in their shoes. When tragic events happen to Mia and her family you get chills thinking about how that could be your family. It is amazing how a movie can make you feel so real. <br/><br/>Despite the terrible acting and the awkwardness of the characters it was an acceptable movie. I am sure the book is more pleasurable to read than the movie is to watch, but if you like typical drama movies with actors that make you feel uncomfortable then ""If I Stay"" is the movie for you."

He encourages her to be her even though her parents try to push her to be like her boyfriends friends. Tue best parts are the ones where it shows reality (hospital and accident parts). The band playing on stage is in a teenage setting which happens a lot during the movie. Like i said its pretty good.

","Chloe Grace Moretz has been my favorite actress since she first appeared on ""Kick-ass"" and that was the reason i chose to see this movie. I watched the trailer and, to say the truth, was not really interested in the plot. There were some movies and novels about after life and love and I thought this movie would be on the same way as them. But after seeing, I realized that the movie is about choices and harmony. <br/><br/>When being a kid, Mia chose to play cello, not to become a rocker like her parents. Then Mia date a rocker and they two had some troubles caused by the differences of kinds of music they follow. They chose to overcome that difficulty and become harmonic to each other. <br/><br/>There is a mix between rock and classical music and I find that pretty interesting. I've never thought that these two kinds of music could be such harmonic. I love classical music and now I love rock music too.<br/><br/>The final choice Mia has to make is whether to wake up or not. She lost her family and if she chooses to stay alive, she would have to face the loneliness. She used to be very happy with her family and now that happiness is not available any longer. That was a difficult choice. And I am happy that she chose to wake up.<br/><br/>The scene that impressed me the most was on the last part of the movie when Mia looked back to the party she had with her family, her parents' friends and Adam's friends. The moment when they gathered around Mia and Adam playing in a special show with cello and guitar is really a moment of true happiness."

Caught between life and death for one revealing day, Mia has only one decision left, which will not only decide her future but her ultimate fate.""<br/><br/>The set up is straight forward, she is a classical cello player, he is a rockstar with abandonment issues and yet there is an attraction there that is powerful enough to concur death in someway. There is a sweetness about this film that creates sense of nostalgia in the viewer revisiting in our memory the people we've lost to a sickness or other type trauma. This type of empathy is absolutely necessary to fully be able to enjoy this film. Those of you who do not like to go inwards and examine those feeling might leave the cinema with bitter grim on the face. They say how can you know true joy if you've never experience true sorrow. As the main character is stuck in coma she revisits all the important moments in her life that shaped who she is. Should she come back to life knowing that possibly she will be an orphan or should she go into the gentle night. I don't think that by the end of this film there was a dry eye in the screening room. Big credit goes to the actors delivering very believable performances. Chlo√´ Grace Moretz seems to be on a roll. After ""Kick-Ass"" and remake of ""Carrie"" she really is raising fast on the Hollywood star leader. She delivers very sympathetic and full of depth performance that might get stuck in you head for a while after watching. Mireille Enos in a supporting role as her mother brings messiness and punk rocker demeanor in to otherwise soulful performance. Jamie Blackley playing Adam showcases his voice a young rockstar charisma with ease. Other members of the supporting cast like Stacy Keach (Gramps) and Liana Liberato (Kim) as well as Joshua Leonard who plays the father who sacrifices his dream of being rockstar so that his little girl can get the cello she uses to become a skilled musician. All the credit should not go only to the cast but should be shared with the director R.J. Cutler who in fact before this film had mostly documentary experience. He was able to create a safe environment for the actors to truly share themselves with the audience. ""If I Stay"" is recommended to the audience who is not afraid to confront their sense of loss and to some extent pain because this is what this movie all about.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"
"sloqp149","5","0","1","21 September 2014"," A teen movie
","The trailer let me think it will be foolish. But in my seat, I feel a serious tone, very relevant sometimes. I like the film, of course, the movie introduces some nice classical musics, and rock as well ; yet I'll try to express some reserves. Despite really relevant performances of all actors (and more notably, the grandfather's monologue), I feel some disturbances between the actors. Mia and Adam are expected to be in love with each others, but their lines of dialogs seem to me that they are put end to end; and not shared. Concerning the dialogs, they are good, but they could have been deeper, more intense (I think of ""Blue is the warmest color""). The scenario is interesting however. One can reproach the blurred circumstances of the accident, but it was a necessity for the plot. Though the dialectic of ""does she have to stay or not?"" is weak, the development of characters are successfully managed, the love story is believable. I think the best achievement is the montage. If the story was told chronologically, it would have been quite boring. But the way the story is told in the movie adduces elements regularly, we can rebuilt the whole plot and I was never bored, and for instance, the flashbacks are logically brought. I really appreciate Chlo√´ Grace Moretz since ""Kick ass"", and I expect a lot of her, like some mind-blowing performances. But I find her just good, not perfect. And I can only complain on the fact that she plays in a lot of movie, maybe to many to prepare her role at the best. I like the movie for what it is. And without the objections I underlined in this review, it would have been a masterpiece, and not just a teen love movie."

"zoe_xox","9","0","2","17 September 2014"," Beautiful, emotional and obsessive film!
","The hard hitting, tear jerking film directed by R.J cutler, based on a novel by Gayle foreman is about a young, musician Mia (played by Moretz) whose life unexpectedly changes. Based on an out of body experience Mia has to make the most challenging and hardest choices, whether to stay with Adam (Jamie Blackley) or leave facing death? These events all happen very suddenly for Mia after her and her family was in an icy and horrifying car wreck. The majority of the film was based on Mia's loving memories and flash backs of her family, friends and Adam. <br/><br/>The story itself was very hard hitting and a brilliant performance was made by Chloe Grace Moretz (Mia), their couldn't of been a better person to play young Mia. There is a lot of mature content and brings out the greatness and the worst of emotions. Her on- screen chemistry with Adam was on point and of course Jamie Blackley performance was also on key point. You can also tell that the director also had a place in his heart for the film as it was near perfection and each scene was heart touching and beautiful. I also liked the fact it wasn't just about a 'Girl and boy' the film involved her family, friends and even 'stragglers' that came round for dinner. <br/><br/>The only major fault with the film was the confusion of the real life scenes and Mia's flash backs scenes. If you didn't take much notice at the beginning then you defiantly wouldn't have got the rest of the film (As my boyfriend discovered), however if you do understand the film you will fall completely in love with it as I did. <br/><br/>Lastly be prepared for an annoying ending. If you like a romantic ending then this isn't the ending for you! As the director and writers stuck mostly to the book the ending is the same as the book but I also think by leaving it how they did at the ending was a good choice because the viewers will become more hooked and want to see more of Mia and what life choices she makes and how her life may go on without her family. <br/><br/>Overall I would rate this film a 9/10 and I really do hope that they turn the book 'where she went' into a production, even though it would be harder to achieve considering the success of 'if I stay'."

","This film was so good, such a amazing film to watch and definitely a must see. I was crying throughout most of this film as it makes your heart race, but also you cant help but fall in love with Adam and Mia's relationship, its just such a strong story line and keeps you entertained throughout. One minute its all romantic and the next your back crying with tears and sadness. Each character was a strong character and I loved the way the story went from Present day back to what had happened in the past. It also makes you consider life as we know it and what we would do in a situation like Mia's. How would we react, what emotions would we portray. It has made me want to live life to the full and enjoy every moment as much as I can."

","Mia(Chloe Grace Moretz) a bright seventeen old, who is in hopes to go to Julliard, cause she is talented cello player. But one day could change all, when she gets into a serious car accident with her folks, starts having an out of body experience, she gets caught between life and death, and during that, we start to see things unfold in her life.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz really gives the performance of her career, she just won't be thought of has Hit Girl, I would nominate her for a Oscar. And everybody else here really gives good performances. Because they feel real, not just acting. Bring plenty of handkerchiefs, I also liked the love story, and at times when you think the story is gonna go one way, it takes you by surprise."

","I always warn if my mind is open I like the movie. ""If I Stay"" was a well written and acted drama about a teenage girl who is in a car accident with her family of four. Dad, Mom, and little brother don't make it. <br/><br/>I live in outside of Boston if you have a snow day, stay home, it's friggin' dangerous out there!!!! sorry my attempt at a little comic relief. <br/><br/>She looks over her comatose body while her remaining loved ones visit and decides to go into the white light??? or stay??? <br/><br/>Lots of flashbacks of her recent memories which tie the story together quite well. I recommend this one enjoy...."
"scatter_brained4","10","0","1","10 September 2014"," A movie about life and death
","This movie had me sucked in from beginning to end. I like the documentary feel to it that made the movie seem even more realistic. And the relationship between the two characters was also fun to watch. This movie has a great message too. There are funny, dramatic, and very serious parts that show people's humanity. I liked that the main character wasn't perfect and had her flaws along with everyone else. I do wish thought that they showed more of the family so the audience could have a connection with them too. When I decide if a movie is good is if the ending was good along with all the rest of the movie, and this one didn't disappoint. I just really loved it and hope to see the sequel soon."
"Seraphion","7","0","2","9 September 2014"," Stronger drama aspect for the teen/young adults
","The movie tells about a young girl Mia Hall. The movie goes alternating back and forth between the stories of her past and the present story of her family's car accident. The past stories elaborate on her relationship with Adam; how they first met, going through differences between them, break ups and reconciliations, and the conflict between them when Mia chose to go to Julliard while Adam decides to continue on with his band. The present story is a day when Mia is waiting for a response letter after her admittance audition on a snowy day. Her parents notice her anxiety and ask her to go on a ride. The innocent joy ride turns out to be a disaster when a car from the opposite direction swerves and ran straight head on to the family's car. Mia wakes up on the side of the road as the paramedics tend to her family and¬Öher. <br/><br/>Being out of her body and having no one responding to her, she stayed with her body to the hospital. There she soon learns that her parents are killed instantly and that her brother survives the crash but is sustaining heavy injuries. She also learns that being conscious outside of her body and hanging on a thread between life and death, she has to make the decision whether to keep on fighting to go back to her body and continue on with her changed life, or to just let go. Through some flash backs of her own as she sees many people close to her come and visit her at the hospital, and ultimately seeing Adam relenting and deciding to go with her to New York after he tells her that she got into Julliard, Mia finally sees the white light and returns to her body and wakes up.<br/><br/>Being based on a teen/young adult novel, the movie is bold enough to introduce a newer kind of story flow style, the alternating back and forth style, to the teen and young adult audience. I said so because movies aimed especially at this market, particularly in recent years' releases, have never used such a style. This is good because it kind of demands the viewers to be more intellectual in enjoying how the story is being told. This movie opens kind of slowly before the main conflict settles in. But it already started with the back and forth style even before the main conflict takes place. <br/><br/>Like all recent teen/young adult movie, the ingredient mix of a teen couple romance and some degree of fantasy works well for the story. Unlike the others of its kind, the drama side is very strong in this movie. The fantasy side seems like it's only there to give this story some depth to it. For me that's quite good so that the current teen generation that's been growing up with all the Harry Potters and Twilights and even Hunger Games can learn to appreciate the drama side of a story.<br/><br/>Chloe-Grace Moretz' acting quality sure does increases since the last I saw her in Kick-Ass 2. She can really handle the close up scenes nicely, depicting the right facial expressions. Jamie Blackley provided the nice balance for the story, although he doesn't quite really balance Moretz' performance. It's quite funny to see Mireille Enos as a good mother here after the last time I saw her in Sabotage.<br/><br/>A 7 out of 10 score is from me without hesitation for If I Stay (2014). It's a good drama entertainment and a teen movie altogether. A recommendation is a sure nod from me."
"ablackburn45","5","0","1","9 September 2014"," I honestly thought they could have done better...
","I read the book just days before watching this movie. I thought, after seeing trailers and reading the book, that this movie would make me at least tear up here and there; the book definitely did. But I was much too distracted with the things they changed. I understand that it's difficult to follow the book,but seriously... they could have done better. I think that they should have kept the part where she finds her parent dead at the beginning. It would have been more effective emotion wise. And they left out what seemed to me to be important flashbacks; they even changed some. And the ending extremely disappointed me. Adam did not write her a song and the fact that they put that in made me mad! He was supposed to say, ""Don't make me write a song about you."" And he puts on her song after begging her to stay and then she wakes up. That was, in my understanding, what brings her back in the book. It was an excellent movie, don't get me wrong they just could have done better..."
"hootonsrus","7","0","1","7 September 2014"," Not a chic flick movie type but liked the movie
","I don't usually go to chic flick style movies (prefer horror) but this one was pretty good (didn't cry but came close :) so even if you're not into this type movie usually - it's worth checking out. I originally just went to just to see how they depicted the outer body experience but actually turned out liking the whole movie. (Must be getting soft in my old age :) but I would recommend this one, but most people will need tissues. Good story line great outer body depiction decent acting. My only critique would be parents reactions to things going on were a bit unrealistic even for liberal parenting. Overall still a good movie even for a chic flick, coming from someone who doesn't usually like chic flicks AT ALL."
"Amari-Sali","7","0","1","6 September 2014"," While the film contains most of the narrative issues the book had, some fans of the book, and those who only saw the trailer, may like the film.
","With reading the book this is based off of, as well as the book's sequel, my expectations were heightened since I knew everything that was supposed to happen. Though, as I learned from past book to movie adaptations, getting your hopes high for a movie adaptation is a foolish thing to do. For even if you like the cast, there is always the issue of what was kept, or changed, for the book's transition to the big screen. Leading to us talking about If I Stay.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>Two people living in different parts of the music world, one rock and one classical, one day happen come together. It begins with Adam (Jamie Blackley) hearing Mia (Chloe Moretz) play her cello, and watching her passionately go at it. From there he asks her out and their relationship begins. We watch the socially awkward Mia fall in love with this guy who is on the way to becoming a rock god, while her retired Rock & Roll parents, Kat (Mireille Enos) and Denny (Joshua Leonard), watch in delight.<br/><br/>However, no story dealing with romance can be without conflict. Which, for If I Stay, mostly deals with the fact Mia is younger than Adam and at a different place in her music career. But that is just her issues within their relationship, seen in flashbacks. As for the real conflict which may drive them apart, it is a car accident in which Mia's family seemingly are dead, and she is wondering if, without them, should she stay?<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>As Moretz grows as an actress, and a bit more consistently brings depth to her roles, you can see from movie to movie that she is really honing her craft. For, as seen in Kick Ass 2 and Carrie, as much as she can play a smart mouthed young lady, she can also draw you in with her character being vulnerable, having a sense of uncertainty, and Moretz seeming just as much ready to fight and seem bad ass, as she could breakdown into tears.<br/><br/>As for Blackley as Adam, while I admit I don't see him as a good fit for the roll, since he seems more geared to swoon the audience than be my perception of Adam, it is hard to deny Blackley and Moretz play don't well off each other. They help create the visuals for a love story in which while he helps Mia bloom, she doesn't fully lose herself and while she may fall in love, her insecurities don't just abate because of how powerful the love Adam presents is.<br/><br/>Leaving one last thing to note: In the film there are great classical pieces used, and Adam's band is given songs to perform of which more than half were actually good.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Unfortunately, between the transition from book to screen, a lot of the issues I had with the book's narrative of going back and forth on a fairly constant basis were not changed. Which sucked to me since those jumps in time make it hard to not only stay connected with the story, but also emotionally connected to the characters.<br/><br/>Though the real problems with the film deal with changes made due to artistic license, omission, or necessity. Such as Adam's band not being called ""Shooting Star""; a lot of Adam trying to get into the ICU to see Mia being cut; the film trying to instill a bit more hope in Mia's family surviving the car crash than there is in the book, as well as more drama in Adam and Mia's relationship; and then there are general cuts you recognize had to be done. Things like us seeing how Mia and Kim became friends; seeing Kim's mom; the lead up to Mia's grandpa taking her to her Julliard audition; and a lot of the back stories including Willow's and her grandparents.<br/><br/>All of which sort of take away the impact of dramatic moments to me. For with grandpa and Willow's roles rewritten to the point they are, their appearance feels like it means less. Like with grandpa, all the build to him taking Mia to the audition is wiped, and all that was saved is him talking about him not supporting Denny and Denny's decision to leave the band for Mia. Then, when it comes to Willow, honestly it felt like they should have wiped her character. For with her not being a force to reckon with when it comes to Adam seeing Mia, nor Teddy being at another hospital, making it where her appearance could truly be devastating, the film loses most of its drama to bad screenplay decisions.<br/><br/>Leading back to my issue with Blackley. He, to me, doesn't look like Adam, and also has the same issue Gus, in The Fault in Our Stars, had where it seemed he was more so there to make girls squeal than woo Mia. Leaving us to talk about Moretz: in the film, I felt she over acted. For, whether I just saw Mia acting differently in the book, or her performance just not being to my taste, I felt she was a bit too over dramatic, even considering the circumstances.<br/><br/>Overall: TV Viewing<br/><br/>As someone who read the book, I honestly want to say to skip this. A lot was changed, or omitted, which doesn't make this something worth seeing. However, seeing this from the point of view of someone who didn't read the book, I think there are enough laughs and cute moments throughout the film to justify seeing this. Leading to me labeling this as ""TV Viewing"" since it will likely disappoint the book readers, but seems like it may be OK for those who never touched the source material."
"patsworld","6","0","4","4 September 2014"," Not As Good As It Could Have Been
","Here's the thing, in the movie Field of Dreams, with Kevin Costner, everyone was perfect. Each role done to perfection ‚Äì all except the wife. Bottom line is she simply tried too hard. Her supposed enthusiasm was irritating to the point of absurdity. The one bad note in an otherwise perfect symphony. In this picture, If I Stay, that honor went to the mother. As the wife who supposedly was part of the wild live band scene in previous years, she overplayed her part to equal imperfection as that mention above. She bopped around, acting like an aging hippy more than anything and it, again, struck the one false note in the melody. Other than that, my only concern was this movie rather dragged on. I mean, it was a tad short of plot ‚Äì the girl dies, does she stay? Does she go? So it sort of lagged here and there. I guess I was expecting more somehow and I was a bit disappointed with this one. I had so looked forward to it, and it isn't a bad movie, just not what it could have been, I think. Light on action, heavy on emotion, it's okay. But that's all I can say. It's okay."
