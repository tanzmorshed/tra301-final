","With more confident direction, a more ambitious story, and impressively realized action set pieces, X2 is the rare sequel that improves on every aspect of the original - while also working as a great stand alone movie in it's own right."
"Big Movie Fan","Null","106","122","5 May 2003"," After Watching This, Roll On X-Men 3
","Absolutely happy! That is the only word I can use to describe my feelings after spending my hard-earned money to see X-Men 2. It was worth every penny.<br/><br/>Firstly, the makers of superhero films such as this have an unenviable task. They have to please hardcore comic fans and casual movie fans which is no easy task. And The X-Men-with their forty years of history and continuity-are perhaps the hardest heroes to put on the big screen. Well, I've spoken to many hardcore X-fans and casual movie fans and they all enjoyed it too.<br/><br/>I won't go into great detail about the plot. Let's just say that The X-Men and their enemy Magneto have to join forces to combat an even bigger threat. I enjoyed this movie so much because for the first time in years, I didn't read ANYTHING about the plot or any reviews prior to viewing it. That is why I'm not going to go into great detail about the plot. Just enjoy it.<br/><br/>All the favourites are back including my personal favourite Hugh Jackman as Wolverine (I hope Wolverine gets his own movie franchise one day). The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. We'd all love our favourites to get more screentime but with so many X-Men (and women), the producers have to do the best they can; and they do indeed.<br/><br/>There are a few really great special effects in this movie but unlike some special effects laden movies, the plot is more important in this movie. Furthermore, the movie is much deeper and really makes you think. Marvel comics (and movies) have always been deep and many of the issues have reflected real life. This movie is about persecution and intolerance of mutants and reflects many issues from the past and the present such as Hitler's treatment of the Jews and the different ideologies of Martin Luthor King and Malcom X. In fact, many longtime X-fans have compared the X-Men's Professor X to Martin Luthor King and the evil Magneto to Malcom X. Seeing a movie like this cannot only provide a couple of hours of entertainment but make you view society in a totally different way.<br/><br/>This is the best superhero film since the 70's (when we saw gems such as Superman The Movie) and the 80's (when we saw Tim Burton's Batman). It was a fantastic film but it begs one question-how are they ever going to top this?"
"suicidea","Null","168","210","8 January 2004"," why all the underrating?
","A lot has been said about this movie, as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. While I truly respect everyone's opinion, I really don't see the point in some criticisms brought up against this movie.<br/><br/>(Definitely NO spoilers ahead.)<br/><br/>First of all, we must realize that X-men comics have been around for decades. They existed before many of you were born. Still, the producers had to assume that the average audience had little or no idea about the mutant phenomenon, but Bryan singer did a very good job (as always) in the first film, and introduced the audience. Besides, adapting such a story with so many characters to the screen is no easy job, and is also risky, considering it's Hollywood and it must return all those millions. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained, the characters and their abilities introduced, and the plot (which actually had a story, unlike many action flicks) was carried out smoothly. All in the running time of one film. good job.<br/><br/>The second film, however, had to concentrate (naturally) on more characters and a more thorough story. This is why I object (in the title) to people criticising this film for ""lack of character development"" etc. Many of the characters WERE developed in the first film. If you never read x-men comics, and did not even see the first movie, and see this one right away and still expect the director/writer to spell things out for you, well, you'll be disappointed. ""Where did Colossus take the kids during the attack?"" someone asked. To hide them somewhere, THAT'S where he took them. I don't think people would like to see the director spell out everything, such as Colossus' inner voice saying, ""Well, let me take these kids somewhere beneath this multimillion dollar facility, to hide them from the bad guys.""<br/><br/>And the newly-introduced characters were introduced well enough. You see their abilities, you see whose side they're on, you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. What else do you need to learn? Which team he supports?<br/><br/>The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes, very well done.<br/><br/>The movie had many shortcomings, of course, the pace slowed down more than once, some main characters, especially Cyclops, were almost lost, but the plusses were way more than minuses. Especially Nightcrawler, who almost stole the lead from Wolverine. I must also add that Wolverine is much more violent in this film than the first, much more like the original comic character.<br/><br/>As for the people who complain about the abundance of characters. Well, bad news for you. X-men is not a story of a couple of guys and their girlfriends. There are much more characters, hopefully to be seen in the next sequel(s). Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus were all hinted in this one. Though I'm eager to see Gambit also, I can't wait to see how they will do the Beast. Of course, I can see the ""no character development"" people asking each other, ""Who is Beast?""<br/><br/>In short, this movie does what it's supposed to do: Gives us entertainment, and shows us our favorite characters on screen."
"MinorityReporter","8","52","62","12 December 2005"," Another X-ellent movie!
","Some people would tell you that X2 is more conventional and mainstream than the first movie and to that I can only say: What a load of rubbish! Not only does X2 continue in the style set by the first film but it also improves on it greatly. This is achieved by adding more characters, making a deeper story and making the ever expanding universe even more chaotic so as better to capture the essence of the comic book. Two thumbs way up! The story picks up after the events of the first film in a way that pleases the viewers of the first film and is satisfactory to new viewers. The story is still well written and the pacing has improved a lot from the first film. There are no real slow points during the movie and the director takes special care to cram many of the scenes with breath taking visual effects so the audience will never lose interest. The dialog is once again both very sharp and witty and intelligent and allows for adequate character development. The character development is something some people have seen fit to criticize as they claim there isn't enough of it and except for only two characters I whole heartedly disagree. The character development of the main characters happened pretty much in the first film and therefore it is only necessary to add a bit more depth to the characters instead of repeating the character development from the first film. I did feel, however, that the film seemed somewhat rushed at times and that is a shame as it definitely had potential to be a 2½ hour film.<br/><br/>The acting is still sublime and I, of course, have to emphasize Hugh Jackman who is still absolutely brilliant as Wolverine. Both in bringing out the animal sides during the fight sequences but also in keeping the character human like in the comics. Ian McKellen returns as well and further fleshes out his character of Magneto and makes the character every bit as devious and charismatic as in the previous film. Patrick Stewart returns as well and does what he did in the first film and he is still the only one who could play Xavier. Among the new actors are Brian Cox and Alan Cumming. Cox does what he does best and plays the new villain with the exaggerated style he usually does. Cumming on the other hand shows remarkable depth as Nightcrawler and is in spite of his appearance one of the most human characters in the film. I will miss him in the third film. Lets hope Beast is any bit as good as in the comics. Some have had their characters lessened in the sequel. Most notably James Marsden while Famke Jansen's character is developed further. Halle Berry's character Storm is still kept in the background but I'm sure she will get more screen time in the third film. Aside from the ones I have now mentioned the acting is quite good all round.<br/><br/>Action wise the film took a major step up from the first film and many of the action scenes are quite simply awesome. We get to see more of Wolverine's feral rage which is always worth a look. All fights scenes with Wolverine are awesome and some of the most entertaining I've seen. Also we get a brief glimpse of Collosus kicking some ass and he does look cool I must say. In fact many of the individual mutants' powers are fleshed out in X2 and like in the original X-Men film they look absolutely beautiful. My only concern regarding the effects and action scenes is how on earth they are going to top them in the coming third X-Men film.<br/><br/>In regards to music and sound the film improved upon the first film with a much more catchy soundtrack and more audible effects. For example the sounds of Wolverine's claws shooting out and retracting have been amplified making him even more menacing than he was in the first film. Very well done.<br/><br/>All in all X2 is an excellent continuation of the original film and we are nearing something that is more like a saga than a series of films. I'm really beginning to see Bryan Singer as a master director after these two brilliant films and I am a little sad he opted to do Superman Returns rather than finish what he started with the X-Men films.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Logansneo","10","64","84","7 May 2003"," The Best Comic Book Film EVER!!
","With all the hype surrounding this summers blockbuster sequels, not the least of which is The Matrix Reloaded, as well as having to fight the ghost of Comic-book-movie-bombs-from-summers-past, it goes without saying that a lot of hopes and dreams were riding high on the shoulders of everyone involved in Fox's second big screen outing for everyone's favorite team o superheroes.  Brian Singer himself must've been sweating adamantium bullets, not only being held under the gun by the studio to lead their next big moneymaker, but most importantly and fortunately for us because of his deep and honest desire to make the most accurate and cohesive comic book-to-film adaptation in the history of cinema.  Well Brian I am thrilled to say that that is precisely what has been achieved with your amazing film X2: X-Men United!<br/><br/>It has become rarer and rarer to find a film that has the ability to grab your senses and lock your attention so firmly, not ever letting up until the credits role, such as this film does.  One might only be able to count a handful of films where a sequel takes all of the good elements form it's predecessor, completely eliminates the things that didn't work or fit in the original, then goes on to not only exceed the expectations and hype surrounding it, but completely redefines and elevates it's genre.  From this day forward let it be known that all other Comic Book films will hereby be judged and held up the new level of excellence set by Brian Singer's brilliant X-Men 2. And if ya' can't already tell, I kinda' like this flick! ; )<br/><br/>I am sure many of you would love to know exactly what makes this film worth spending your money on?  Well, to try and sum it up the characters, their struggles, their dreams, their relationships, they all MATTER because infused throughout this entire production and at isn't core lies HEART! And at the same time the film can be both touching as well as possess a gritty and visceral quality, giving each in attendance license to participate in the action as an outlet for their frustrations and monotony of their everyday lives.  Just as I felt as if I was part of the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings, so here again I feel like I am part of the X-Men team.<br/><br/>But what really drives my excitement is Brian Singer's seemingly boundless ability to correctly interpret the true spirit of the X-Men comics.  Individually, as a team, hero and villain alike, he has somehow tapped into the heart of these books and like the title says, united them in a film that defied my highest expectations and ignites my imagination. This is however not to say that he hasn't altered things from the comics.  But unlike other directors from the past who have butchered comic book adaptations, Singer's interpretation of the characters lets you understand that any changes that were made were for the best.  Prime examples of this can be found in how deftly he handles Jean Grey and the silent discovery of her Phoenix powers.  Understanding that it would be totally impossible for him to try and take the Phoenix Saga and directly translate that to film, Singer has rightly decided to do what lesser directors would have cowered at; to re-interpret this change, still showing Jean Grey inherit this power, but to use it to build on her character, and realize HER potential more than most writers of the comics have done in recent memory.  At the same time treating the character with respect as well as both we the audience and the dedicated fans of the comics with that same respect and maturity. Another example of his skills in character interpretation is the way in which he has taken the religious zealot that was William Stryker in the comics and turned him into a much more menacing zealot shill clinging to the original characters' self righteous justifications.  But by giving him the military background and simultaneously making Mastermind his son, as well as merging the scientists who created Wolverine and Deathstryke, Singer serves up an extremely multilayered and more well rounded Stryker with a very clear agenda.  Brian singer accomplishes all of this at the same time he is sewing up crucial sub-plots and characters that are ingeniously and potently utilized.<br/><br/>To illustrate the difference between how Brian Singer and the writers/producers for X2 utilize the material and do so intelligently making us pay more attention to the details, and alternately how so many of us have gotten used to dumbed down films that lead us deliberately, treating most of us like children, to their obvious conclusions, I bring up a subject of much debate.  Now some have pointed out that in the ending of X-Men 2 where Jean Grey goes out of the plane to sacrifice herself was unnecessary obviously did not follow what was occurring to Jean throughout the film.  What I saw was her character going through the anguish and realization that something inside of her was reaching far beyond her capabilities to control and after seeing what she was capable of in her battle with Cyclops that at the mom ent she saw that everyone in the team was in danger on the plane, she used this as self justification to sacrifice her life for everyone and at the same time stop the force inside of her which she feared was a growing danger not only out of her control but could eventually threaten or hurt all those who she loved.<br/><br/>What other director can you name has so responsibly adapted something like this to film?  I can think of only one off hand, Peter Jackson and his diligence to The Lord of the Ring books.  I dare say the Brian Singer has accomplished more than even Mr. Jackson, because Singer has taken a Comic Book, something the majority of people and press disregard as children's books or even geek literature, and has transformed it into a very HUMAN, very poignant, very real experience, and can only hope that he will continue on what he has accomplished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* * * * * (5 stars)"
"nived84","7","47","62","18 April 2006"," ""Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.""
","2000's smash hit X-Men certainly deserved a sequel (or two, or three), especially with all the cash it made and how the first one ended. Now the X-Men are back together once again, and this time they've got some new friends, including Nightcrawler and Pyro, and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike (his personal mutant ""assistant""/slave). This time the X-Men find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique (their nemeses from the first film) against an evil military scientist named William Stryker, whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.<br/><br/>X2: X-Men United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological, it's longer, there's more action, more mutants, more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags, right from the get-go X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact, X2 is almost the perfect comic book film almost. The one little, weak link in X2, for me at least, was Nightcrawler. Now, I like the character of Nightcrawler, but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming, he came off as a bit weak, and kind of ""dorky"". The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot; like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the X-Jet, which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler, besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House, was his religious side, which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine, which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart, Marsden, Janssen, Berry, Paquin, Cox, Romijn), and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000, and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing, and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first X-Men there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much, or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor, and plenty of action, maybe even more so than the original. And like the original, X2 sets itself up for a third film; let's just hope it turns out (at the very least) as good as the first two films, if not better."
"Chandler81","7","95","136","16 December 2004"," A few problems in an otherwise excellent film
","They've done a hell of a lot right. That's my response to Singer's X-Men films; they're slick, funny, emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations, X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Admirably, the film allows the majority of its characters a genuinely engaging storyline amongst the bigger picture, and although the story is not without its fault (using Cerebro as a major plot point two films in a row is like building the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi; been there, seen it before) it is certainly worthy of high praise. It's amazing that in just two films we already have a real appreciation for the relationships between such a considerable group of characters, and it is for the continued development of these relationships - and not the cool story line and action sequences - that makes me look forward to another X-film.<br/><br/>I would love to say that it's the casting that makes the films so brilliant - and it's true, the casting is great - but a couple of these characters have been woefully miscast. Iceman stood out for me, bringing an uncomfortable Backstreet Boy vibe to the role, and although his role in X2 is small, James Marsden just doesn't seem to have it in him to hold a commanding and authoritative position among the X-sters as Cyclops. In the first X-film he managed to at least stand beside the Wolverine with some great gags, but he's been left in the gutter for X2, and in the single scene toward the end of the film where Marsden is allowed to genuinely act, his emotional response feels awkward and forced. I am sure he is capable of more than this, and hopefully when X-Men 3 comes around he'll have more to work with. I've never been happy with Halle Berry as Storm, and she looks bored out of her skull in this film. I hope not to see her return.<br/><br/>Thankfully, most of Singer's new cast are admirable. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. In fact, Alan is the only actor in the film who comes close to matching the quality of Jackman's Wolverine and McKellen's Magneto. These wonderful actors all appear to genuinely revel in portraying their characters. Janssen steps her performance up a notch too and it helps the film no end. I really hope to see her in the next film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there are just a few slip-ups here in an otherwise classy and supremely entertaining film. With such an established canon of characters everyone is going to have their own opinion on how particular character should be portrayed, and for the most part X-2 does the job. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out and we'll see a sequel of equal or greater quality in a few years. I'm certainly excited at the prospect."
"Devotchka","9","15","18","18 September 2003"," Better than the first.
","This movie was great--much better than the original film, which was pretty standard as far as summer blockbusters go.  X-2 skipped all the awkward and unnecessary attempts at a backstory (and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the XMen when I saw the film) and went straight for an intelligent route.  The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful.  Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ian McKellen, Alan Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin more than made up for the mediocre attempts of Halle Berry and Famke Janssen."
"MovieAddict2016","10","65","94","4 May 2003"," The budget is bigger, the cast is larger, the story is deeper, the film is better...
","The film begins. We are shown a tour guide leading students and adults through the White House in Washington, DC. It seems normal enough. A security guard notices someone straying off the path and asks if he is lost. The man raises his head, and a tail flicks out from behind him. Before the security guard can do anything he is down on the ground, alerting all security in the area of a mutant attack. <br/><br/>The blue creature, known later as Nightcrawler, teleports past dozens of guards and kicks and whips them with his tail and fists. Finally the action dies down with the creature being shot (not killed), and we are left to catch our breaths. Reader, I'll tell you, it took me a few moments to catch mine.<br/><br/>It sure looks as if ""X2"" is on the right track for a sequel, and if anything, it seems better. The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film, and though the action never quite again reaches its high-point as in the beginning, it sets the film up for other non-stop action sequences, just like the James Bond movies are known for doing.<br/><br/>But that's not all ""X-Men 2,"" or ""X2"" as the posters abbreviate, is all about. It has an important human element that adds to the pure, non-stop, full-blooded action-spectaculars throughout the film. The cast is bigger, the budget is bigger, the story is bigger, and the action is plentiful. Teenagers will enjoy the action side, and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story. It seamlessly combines both these two elements/techniques even more than the original film did. I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first, but I must say I did.<br/><br/>It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world.<br/><br/>The film begins with an assassination attempt on the president's life, carried out by a teleporting mutant. This act upsets the entire world, and the president is about to begin the mutant-human war predicted by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) in the first film. In an effort to get to the bottom of the attack on the president's life, and prevent world-wide war, Xavier sends out Storm (Halle Berry) and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) to search for the teleporting mutant and discover the truth behind the assassination attempt.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Logan ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman) has returned to Xavier's mansion after searching for any signs of his past. He has found none. He is greeted by Rogue (Anna Paquin) and her new boyfriend Bobby ""Iceman,"" who was briefly seen in the first film and is given a deeper character backdrop in this film. <br/><br/>But soon things start to turn for the worst as an attack on Xavier's mansion is led by Stryker (Brian Cox), the man behind the assassination attempt, who wants all mutants to be killed off. He kidnaps Charles Xavier, and reveals that he wishes for Charles to kill all mutants.<br/><br/>How? By focusing Xavier's psychic powers/telepathy on a particular group of people, Xavier can actually kill them. So Stryker plans to use his disowned mutant son (who also has psychic powers) to control Xavier's mind (sort of) and focus on all the mutants in the world, automatically killing them.<br/><br/>With this plot in motion, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) has little time to free Eric ""Magneto,"" which results in a truly amazing escape sequence which I will not spoil for you.<br/><br/>Now, in an ironic moment, old enemies must fight together to bring down Stryker before his plan follows through. But the band of X-Men are far from solving their problems, as a new mutant, Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) may stand in their way of defeating Stryker. And Wolverine may also find the key to his past in this mess.<br/><br/>""X-Men 2,"" unlike other sequels, improves upon itself. Tragic sequels go to the dogs when the filmmakers are either too proud to try and surpass the original, or are too arrogant to even attempt it. ""X-Men"" was an excellent comic-book adaptation, in more ways than one, and ""X-Men 2"" is only better. It contains more action than ""Spider-Man"" and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original, which is ironic, since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes.<br/><br/>The cast is first-class, but the real scene-stealer, just like in the original, is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one, just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"".  If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan, they need look no farther, because though he may not look the part in this film, Jackman can look very suave and proper (see ""Kate and Leopold""), and is my top choice for the next Bond.<br/><br/>Comic book films are usually hit-or-miss. They're never in between. ""X-Men"" was an unexpected hit, but more than that, a good unexpected hit. It wasn't all hype. It was smart, action-packed and hat a great character side to it. Like I said before, ""X-Men 2"" improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor.<br/><br/>I expect ""X-Men 2"" to break some box office records, and unlike other films, I can honestly say that it deserves it.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

Far-out special effects, new characters (particularly winning is Cumming as the blue-skinned Night Crawler) and non-stop action packaged with kinetic infectious giddiness. Jackman continues to amaze as the tormented Wolverine, Berry is given more to do as the tempestuous Storm, Janssen's Jane Grey is perhaps the most nuanced in her suddenly advance telekinetic skills and McKellen is wellmagnetic as Magneto. Fun tongue-in-cheek screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (w/ David Hayter, Zak Penn and director Bryan Singer getting story credits) keeps up with the multi-layered storyline encompassing class welfare, social strata and in general to accept one for who they are and not what they are. Well done!"
"LebowskiT1000","10","36","52","3 May 2003"," One of the best sequels to date!
","The X-Men has always been my favorite comic book, without a doubt. Spider-man is probably in second place, but The X-Men take the cake.  Ever since I heard a sequel was going into the works and Bryan Singer was still on board as director, I had faith that he would do the sequel justice...of course I couldn't help but have that looming fear that something would go wrong.  In the end, the film was released and of course, I wasted no time in getting to the theater to see it on opening day.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I can definitely say it's been a long time since I've come out of a movie theater as happy as I did for this film.  The story was absolutely brilliant and was told in the perfect manner to keep you interested.  ...And of course, there are plenty of new characters and action to keep the audience in awe as well.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler was a truly brilliant character to bring into the sequel of the film.  Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) has always been one of favorite X-Men characters, perhaps even more than Wolverine...but that's up for debate. Teleportation has GOT to be one of the coolest and most interesting ideas for a mutant ability!  I was incredibly stoked to see him brought to life on the big screen, Bryan Singer and Alan Cumming did a FANTASTIC job!  Next to Wolverine, Colossus has also got to be one of my favorite characters.  I can't even begin to express how happy I was to see him in the film...although not NEARLY enough was done with him when there was so much potential for his abilities in the film.  Oh well, there's always X-Men 3 right?  The other two new characters, Pyro (John Allerdyce) and Lady Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama) were very well done as well, although not much of their character histories were explained...which is ok, there is only so much time in a film.  The rest of the characters already had a firm basis from the previous film and were all executed extremely well in this sequel, my hat is off to Mr. Bryan Singer, ""Keep up the good work!""<br/><br/>The entire cast was absolutely perfect for the film.  Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, and Daniel Cudmore all did incredible jobs with their roles and should be proud of their work, truly fantastic.<br/><br/>The story in this sequel is great.  I love the idea of the good and the bad having an equal threat and being forced to work together in order to save them all.  The chemistry and the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Professor Charles Xavier is so bizarre and interesting...and very thought provoking.  There are so many interesting and well done relationships between characters in the film: Logan (Wolverine) - Scott Summers (Cyclops), Rogue - Bobby Drake (Iceman), Jean Grey - Scott Summers (Cyclops) and Jean Grey - Logan (Wolverine) to name a few.  I love just watching them all interact with each other.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is this, if you liked the first film, then you should definitely like this film.  I'm not sure I could say I liked X2 better than the original, but I'd definitely feel comfortable saying it was just as good...and better in certain aspects (but not as a whole).<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend seeing this film in the theater or at least rent it when it's released, it's well worth your time.  This film isn't all about super-heroes, action and fantasy, there is a lot more to it than just that and I hope you can see and appreciate that.  I do hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do and thank you for reading my review, be sure to read my review for the first ""X-Men"".<br/><br/>-Chris<br/><br/>P.S.  They better start crackin' on a X3 right away!<br/><br/>Also..here's some interesting trivia for ya.  In the scene where Mystique is finding out where Magneto is being held she is scrolling through a bunch of names, the name above Lensherr, Erik (Magneto) is LeBeau, Remy...aka ""Gambit""...nice little touch there, I didn't get a look at the other names there, but there might be more allusions there.  Another cool thing is in the scene where the security guard is in the bar, there is a TV on in the background with a guy named Hank McCoy talking...Hank McCoy later becomes known as ""Beast"".  Pretty cool huh..."

","With nine films thus far and at least two more on the horizon, all released over a near-twenty year window, 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise is something of a wonder in today's world of near- constant reboots and remakes. While it has by no means been a smooth ride, the fact remains that the long-running series has been a widely beloved and infinitely important one, especially when placed into historical perspective. Director Bryan Singer's original entry was one of the first major comic-to-film adaptations that convinced studios and audiences alike that comic-book movies could not only be mature and enthralling, but could be certified hits once again after the genre seemed to die-out in the 90's. And thus, a franchise was born and has stuck around ever since, through thick and thin.<br/><br/>It's almost a surprise, however, that one of the best entries in the entire saga came so early- 2003's follow-up ""X2."" With Singer once again at the helm, the film is in every conceivable way an improvement over his excellent first film- it's more thoughtful, more daring, more exciting... I think one could even reasonably say that not only is it arguably the greatest film in the franchise- it just might be one of the best comic-to-film adaptations of all time. Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>Some time after the original film, a brainwashed mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) is sent on a mission to try and assassinate the President of the United States under the guise of being a martyr for Mutant Freedom. Despite the mutant being stopped, the troubling event gives Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) the political edge and backing needed to get approval for an ""investigation"" on Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters- but his investigation is actually an invasion, as he storms the school, taking many students hostage and forcing the remaining X-Men to flee. At the same time, Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) are sent on a mission to collect Nightcrawler and learn his motivation for the attack, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) are captured by Stryker's mysterious bodyguard (Kelly Hu) and the shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) helps her former leader Magneto (Ian McKellan) escape from his high-tech prison. Soon, the remaining mutants (including Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Anna Paquin as Rogue and Shawn Ashmore as Iceman) are forced to team up with their former adversary to try and stop Stryker's scheme to use Charles and his powers to wipe out all of the mutants on Earth.<br/><br/>Given the film's nature as an ensemble piece, it's near-impossible to discuss the performances of each actor individually. But to keep it brief, everyone returning from the original is great in their respective roles. Special commendation goes to Hugh Jackman and his continued excellence in the role that helped to define him as a superstar and to Famke Jannsen, who gets a lot more attention this time around. They are by far the stand-outs of the returning cast. I also highly enjoyed Stewart and McKellen, who bring a sense of class and elegance to their roles and are incredible as always. The newest additions are also outstanding. Brian Cox is one of the greatest actors of our time, and his turn as Stryker is quite remarkable. He gives the character both an easily- ""despiseable"" sense of threat and dread, yet also a nice and subtle sense of pain and pathos. He's a cruel man, yet he has a past that might explain why he is the way he is. Alan Cumming is just magical as the frightened yet also amusing Nightcrawler, and there's a lot of great moments in his performance. And Kelly Hu makes for a fun and furious adversary as Styker's second-in-command ""Lady Deathstrike.""<br/><br/>Singer returns to direct from a script by ""X-Men"" scribe David Hayter and the writing duo of Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Singer got his start with hard-hitting thrillers like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Apt Pupil"", and I think that's part of what gives him an edge with the storytelling. He plays the stories straight and gives them a sense of real and honest threat, while also maintaining an emotional core that feels realistic despite the outlandish nature of the story and heavy Science-Fiction leanings of the material. He's also a very gifted visual artist with a slick and savage sense of composition and flow that lends itself well to the needs of high- concept action. His work on the series has always been nothing less than stunning. The script is very tightly written and juggles the plethora of characters well- everyone has their moment to shine, every major player has a clearly defined role and arc and the pacing is superb. Some wonderful work is done with the writing, and it's an honest shame that neither Hayter nor the writing partners of Dougherty and Harris were involved in the third entry.<br/><br/>The rest of the production is just marvelous. (Pardon the bad joke) Composer/co-editor John Ottman shapes some wonderful and memorable musical themes that compliment the tone and style perfectly, and he weaves together shots and sequences with a masterful touch. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel's visual palette is cool and visually arresting, and his work is just stunningly gorgeous. Some wonderful visual flair is given thanks to his talent. And production and costume design courtesy Guy Hendrix Dyas and Louise Mingenbach respectively is just fantastic. The film is made with nothing but top-notch work from top-notch artists.<br/><br/>As it stands, ""X2"" is easily one of the best if not the single best entry in the long-running series. Its phenomenal direction, sharp and thoughtful writing, beautiful production and outstanding cast weave an enthralling and thrilling cinematic experience that still stands tall well over a decade later. It's up there with the best of the best in terms of comic-book movies.<br/><br/>There's no other way to look at it- ""X2"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."
"MaxBorg89","10","15","20","21 December 2005"," X2: Mutation Moves On
","After the success of the first movie, Bryan Singer brings the X-Men back to the screen. He has stated X2 is the X-version of The Empire Strikes Back. He's not totally wrong: like Empire, X2 is darker than its predecessor, characters are developed and dealt with in a more mature way, and the foreboding climax is quite shocking indeed (there's even a ""I am your father""-style revelation concerning Wolverine's past, which is given more space here than in the first chapter). In fact, the movie could have been named X2: Humanity Strikes Back. <br/><br/>That's right, this time it's the ""ordinary"" people who are raising hell, in particular William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military scientist who takes advantage of the increasing paranoia surrounding mutants and has the POTUS himself approve his plan to take down the ""monsters"" once and for all. The war is about to begin, and with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Cyclops (James Marsden) gone, the only X-Men left to face Stryker are Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), with some help from Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). They are eventually joined by a former employee of Stryker's, the blue-skinned teleporter Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), as well as the most unlikely ally around: Magneto (Ian McKellen), who has managed to escape from the plastic prison he was locked up in (the break-out plays like the Marvel version of Hannibal Lecter's escape in The Silence of the Lambs, and yes, that is a compliment).<br/><br/>The plot is loosely based on the famous graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills by X-guru Chris Calremont (the villain and the alliance with Magneto are explicitly taken from that story), but Singer makes it all much more apocalyptic (Stryker was simply a preacher in the comic-book), while also having the time to take a look at some of the first film's subplots: the Wolverine-Jean-Cyclops love triangle is taken to a new, unexpected level and the Canadian mutant's forgotten ""origin"" starts getting slowly unveiled (Wolverine: ""Who are you?""; Stryker: ""Don't you remember?""). Jackman is the standout in this movie, as we finally get to see everybody's favorite X-fella lose it and make the bad guys regret they showed up in the first place. Those sequences are a treat for those who have grown up loving Wolverine and his dual, conflicted nature. Another actor who leaves a memorable impression is Cumming with his portrayal of Nightcrawler, one of the mutants people fear the most (he looks like a demon), but also the one who's most willing to forgive mankind for its mistakes.<br/><br/>So, with all the great acting, good writing and clever direction, no wonder X2 was voted the greatest comic-book movie ever before Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins were released. This is one superhero opus you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>9,5/10"

","X2 takes what the first film did and improves upon it. The story is very interesting and it's cool to see the heroes and the villain from the last film working together. This film is also darker then that first which I liked. There is more action, with the Wolverine in the school scene being a standout. The cast is really good again and there are some great new additions. Night crawler was probably my most favourite new addition. The villain was quite good as well.

"kyle-medina","9","6","8","30 March 2012"," Excellent 2nd Film!
","This is one of the better films in the Xmen series.<br/><br/>The first film was a bit muddled with so many new characters, to the non-fanboy populace, and in plot details. Although the film was a massive success, it was difficult for many moviegoers uninitiated in the X-Men saga. But in ""X2: X-Men United,"" there's a greater degree of cohesiveness. We have a clear and present evil, a solid storyline, and loads of characters to gawk at. There's also a better pace to this film. It's more organized and the action sequences are evenly placed in the movie. I kept waiting and waiting for Deathstrike to unsheathe her claws, and when she finally did, it was thoroughly satisfying. Her and Wolverine's fight scene was incredible! Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is more complicated, feral, and downright vicious in this film and I like it. When he begins his berserker rage in the school, I couldn't help say, ""Wow."" Without his performance, the movie goes nowhere. He is such a hinge for the film. Alan Cumming was awesome as my favorite X-Man growing up, Nightcrawler. He has always been so complicated and enigmatic, and this movie gave us just enough to understand him, but not enough to discard him with boredom. The attack on the president scene was better than I could have ever imagined. Much like Spider-Man, I always had an idea about how Kurt would move, teleporting from here to there, the acrobatics, the ""bamf"" and the cloud of brimstone: one word- amazing!"
"LondonOnMyMind","9","6","8","28 January 2006"," A meaningful film and brilliant sequel **SPOILERS AHEAD**
","**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>X2: X-Men United is one of those sequels that not only continue the narrative of the original film, but also further develop the ties between the characters, making the audience empathize with them. Like the first film, it is a metaphor for society's prejudice. Simply put, this is a film that would be enjoyed by fans of excellent cinema and X-Men comic book fans alike.<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography, choreography of action sequences and the overall style of the film are exquisite. The Nightcrawler's (Alan Cumming) teleportation stunts and Pyro's (Aaron Stanford) fire domination left me breathless. The fight sequences and special effects are a sight to behold, without the overdose of CGI that many new films drown in, showing yet again that a good director and creative vision are essential to the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. The cinematography is rich and colorful, painting a warm picture of safety with interior and exterior shots of Xavier's School for the Gifted and, at the same time, hinting at an ominous mystery with the cold shots of Alkani Lake.<br/><br/>The emotional depth of the piece is exceptional, particularly today, when frequent gratuitous violence in action and sci-fi movies often detracts from any involvement that the audience might have with the characters. The X-Men films draw on universal themes of individualism and isolation, themes that the second film emphasizes even more than the first one. This time around, the Brotherhood and the X-Men must join forces against General Stryker (Brian Cox), who gives nepotism a whole new meaning and is surely one of the most vile characters in recent sci-fi. As with Rogue (Anna Paquin) in the first film, we again have an outsider, Nightcrawler, who finds kindred spirits in Xavier's group of mutants. From internal conflicts to romantic relationships, the world of mutants is parallel to our own world, making the film relatable on many levels.<br/><br/>The acting is again solid. Standouts among the cast are Cumming, whose Nightcrawler is kindness and compassion come to life; Stanford, whose Pyro is a tough, vulnerable and pained human being; and Famke Janssen, whose Jean Grey makes the unimaginable, but inevitable, choice.<br/><br/>I would recommend X2: X-Men United to all film fans. However, it is our world today that needs the lesson this film can teach. No one is all that different from the person next to them. Always look beyond the surface.<br/><br/>9/10"

Nightcrawler's introduction was great and very helpful for later sequences. Also, Magneto had more meaningful action, same with Mystique. Stryker was a decent villain.<br/><br/>I'll leave a list of some things I liked about the movie and some thing it fixed from X1.<br/><br/>What X2 did well:
<ul><li>Charles being used and manipulated, exposing his weaknesses</li><li>Gave depth to characters stories, specially Wolverine</li><li>Nightcrawler's addition and action sequence at the start</li><li>Stryker controlling mutants plot</li><li>Storm's power being used more</li><li>Pyro</li></ul><br/><br/>What X2 fixed from X1:

","X2 is the second part of X men's trilogy. Thanks God it basically has the same cast of the first movie, with new characters like Nightcrawler, Yuriko (Lady deathstrike) and Colossus . (A sad thing that they didn't show in the movie that Nightcrawler is Mystique's son) <br/><br/>I noticed that the mansion used for the school also appears as Lex Luthor's home in ""Smallville"" and that both Senator Kelly and William Stryker were born only few days/years apart, what makes strange the statement of Stryker saying that Kelly is his junior.<br/><br/>In the movie,Stryker is a high-ranking army colonel who leads an assault into Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer Cerebro in order to destroy every mutant on Earth. He hates mutants, and his son, is a very powerful mutant with the capability of convincing others with his mind to do what he wants (mastermind, anyone?)to be done. It's sad to see Jean Grey die, but it is nice to see the Phoenix symbol in the water surface.<br/><br/>One of the things I love in X men, are the metaphors to reflect current social issues that are always happening in our world, like problems with racism,prejudice,homophobia among others, that doesn't let people live in peace."

","Since the first movie, ""X-Men,"" was famous for its great special effects, this sequel knew enough to deliver the same kind of eye-popping effects to please its fans....and it did! There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects, both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I do think the film needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action, it needed more breaks. It's just too much. Either that, or shorten the story.<br/><br/>Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, in her skin-tight outfit, is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad, either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here, such as Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>It's a pretty interesting story and although they state evolution ""as a fact"" early on once again, they do have something unusual in today's films: a Christian character who was a good guy.<br/><br/>All in all, if you liked the first film, you'll like this."
"tributarystu","8","5","8","10 May 2003"," Exceptional at first, simplistic in the end
","This movie was, in a way, an adventure for me. I did prepare for it, I really did! I re-watched X-Men, twice even, I asked around about the movie, etc. Had real pleasure working. As a sequel, one might expect less from this than from the original. I had high hopes that it would exceed the original, as that one was more or less a mediocre movie. Maybe it wasn't mediocre, but it left me a feeling of unhappiness. Sadly, this one has too but still, it's quite a difference between these ""tastes"".<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>So we've all seen the movie, it's good and all that stuff, but for the beginning I've got a question which bothers me day and night(actually it bothered me only for 5 minutes after the movie): why did Dr. Gray have to ""die"" ?(if she did die...fact which I doubt, despite having no info on the comic books) It makes little sense for me. ""She made a choice""...come on! Which was this choice? Did it regard the two ""contenders""? Well, it'll remain a mystery for the time. This is one of the less logic things in the film. For me, as a non-comic book reader, at least. The movie makes a great impression on the whole, but if you really look in detail at it you notice something which might bother you: it's simple and, though well masked, predictable. It doesn't shock you, yet it thrills you, it doesn't amaze you, yet it makes you feel good. This might be the thing which made me feel a huge gap between what I wanted and what I saw in X-Men.<br/><br/>The characters are only interesting because they are funny. Not really complex, I'd say. Wolverine is made a fool of and I remain unsure whether he is or he isn't intellectually ""equipped"". Dr. Gray is my mystery. You could see from a million miles away what kind of a person Pyro was and what he was going to do. The romantic couple lacks true romance. In a way it's quite interesting: the ""flaming"" kiss can only exist with ice. Strange way to look at it. Yet, they have no sense of measure.<br/><br/>On the big, big whole it is, as I've said, a good movie. It's good action, tense and something's always ""cooking"". I personally liked circus man, Kurt Wagner, the most as he did have not only a great skill, but also an interesting character. I only wonder: why does he believe? There's not backing up to his beliefs. Yet, I'm on his side. 8/10"
"Theo Robertson","4","16","35","14 December 2003"," "" Something`s Wrong "" - Yeah The Script
","***** SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>I wasn`t all that taken with the original X-MEN movie but since it was the introduction of a franchise I forgave the flaws like the underdeveloped themes of antagonism between the humans and mutants . X-2 has no such excuses however since the plot revolves around Magneto and a rogue human general trying to start a war between the humans and mutants . Well I used the word "" Plot "" but just like in a Roger Moore Bond film or a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster the plot gets drowned out by explosions , stunts and special effects <br/><br/>It`s here I wish to absolve the screenwriters for most of the blame of a muddled underdeveloped story because I can imagine the screenplay being repeatedly returned to the writers with a note saying "" Okay Jean and Wolverine are in love but there`s not enough teen romance so introduce a couple of teen characters "" and "" The boys at special effects have come up with a new morphing effect so write a few scenes where we can show it off "" Note to Hollywood studios - If you think writing a screenplay is so easy try writing one . Then after you`ve done that write another one and another<br/><br/>
Regardless of the pressure they were under there is a couple of things the writers are guilty of and that`s the mutants using their special powers to escape from a tight spot . F-16s on the tail of the escaping X-Men , I bet Storm can conjure up a few twisters . Yup thought so and this type of cheating takes place far too often but the fundamental error lies in a way a character is killed . If Jean dies at the end of the film it`s logical that Jean should be the focus of the story but for some reason it`s Wolverine who`s the focus for much of the story which is a blunder on the part of the screenwriters <br/><br/>So I wasn`t too keen on this sequel at all and as recent blockbusters like LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL show a good memorable fantasy adventure is down to a script that allows good actors to act and have special effects that arise naturally from the story . Cramming a film with special effects just isn`t enough any more"

","""X-Men"" is responsible for reviving the once dead Super-hero genre of movies. Since then, we've seen Spider-Man and Daredevil protecting the streets of New York while accomplishing box-office success. But 'X-Men', to me, is still the best Super-hero movie since Batman. So it will be rather difficult to achieve the same kind of success with a sequel, right? This is the first 'part 2' sequel from the super-hero genre since Batman Returns. So it's sort of testing the waters, on Hero staying power. 'X2' continues right where the first left off. Wolverine arrives back from his trek in Canada,at Xavier's school for mutants. Magneto is still in a plastic prison for his attack on Liberty Island. And all is right for the mutant world. But not for long. A mutant named 'Nightcrawler', attacks the president by infiltrating the white house with his teleportation powers. Which causes civil unrest in the country. Gen. William Stryker finds out about Professer X's mutant academy, and uses the attack on the president as a means to invade it. Here groups of mutants are seperated, but they find out about Styker's plan to destroy every mutant on the planet using Professer X, and a secret weapon. This situation calls for the X-Men and Magneto's (you may have guessed, he escaped) Brotherhood to unite to save the mutant population. While not exactly better than the first, it is better than most original movies. It starts off wonderfully, like the first movie never ended. The production design was consistant with the first movie, unlike the Batman franchise. And the action was superb and top-notch. My only problems are some characters dont get as much screen time as they should, Cyclops for example is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. But he does make the best of it. And the character 'Lady Deathstryke' should have been more developed. She hardly spoke at all. But the biggest problem (while still small) is the movie is a bit anti-climactic. It does have a climax, but a bit toned down for the X-men. Just a bit. Other than that, its an exciting story with a very brave ending. Everyone gave a good preformance. Most notably, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro). The movie progressed the X-Men storyline very well (unlike the Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers.

"rosscinema","6","9","18","11 May 2003"," Entertaining but a little chaotic
","I did enjoy this sequel I admit, but I think I'm the minority when I say that its not quite as good as the first film. The first X-men introduced us to a handful (Or two) of mutant characters and we learned about each one of them. The focus of the story was aimed at one thing but here in the sequel they have added so many more mutant characters that the main story is almost forgotten in a windstorm of action scenes. Anna Paquin as Rogue has hardly anything to do here except be frustrated at not being able to be intimate with her boyfriend. This film is definitely geared at a young audience with a lot of the characters being of the teen variety. Halle Berry as Storm is another casualty where her big mission in this film is to get children out of a tunnel. She is absolutely wasted and didn't director Bryan Singer have a better written character for this Oscar winner? The things that I think help the film for me is the mutant Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who is so sexy and strong that even when she's just standing there doing nothing you can't take your eyes off her. If they ever do a film with just her, I'm sold! Their is two performances that stood out for me and the first one is by Famke Janssen who plays Dr. Jean Grey. Its the best written role in the film and she shows real human complexities, she's not just a comic book figure. She's having problems with her telekinetic abilities because of the dreams she's been having and she's also torn between her relationship to two others. The other performance is by Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier who runs the school. He doesn't just posture and allow special effects to run his character, Stewart is too well trained an actor to allow that. In a scene at the end of the film his character is staring out a window reflecting on what has happened and what the future may hold. Even with all the impressive special effects in this film, that scene of Stewart leaves the most indelible image for me. I hope if or when they make another sequel that they try and keep just the main characters as the focus so the overall point of the film doesn't get lost like it seemed to in this film. Of all the new characters introduced here the one I liked the most was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming. Entertaining film but has way to much going on in such a short amount of time. Lets hope they tone everything down the next time."
"Buddy-51","Null","14","32","20 December 2003"," less cerebral, more conventional than the original
","`X2: X-Men United' is the widely admired sequel to `X-Men,' one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as `different' from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part `irrational fear of the unknown' plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner. Perhaps when it came to `X2,' director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, `X2' starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy `comes out' to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their `ordinary, average' child (whom they had just considered `highly gifted') has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance (`We still love you no matter what you are') on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life. `X2' could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.   And it was scenes like this one that made the original `X-Men' soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  `X2' doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.<br/><br/>Every so often, `X2' feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a `terrorist' organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clichés.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?   Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.<br/><br/>People seem to be enamored of `X2,' even more, perhaps, than they were of the original `X-Men.'  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view `X2,' for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.  I have my fingers crossed for `X-Men 3.'"

Even compared to other superhero offerings it is disappointing.<br/><br/>If lately you've had the experience of choosing a Hollywood blockbuster based on hype but no first-hand info from friends, and then left the theatre disappointed and sorry to have wasted your money, then... you'll have a pretty good idea of what you're in for.<br/><br/>In X2 you'll be fleetingly presented with around ten superheroes, see them perform a trick or two each and then recede into well-deserved oblivion. You will also see a super-car and a super-plane. None of these entities will manage to awake any emotion whatsoever, since there simply isn't enough time to get acquainted with any of the multiple protagonists. Then again, that might not be so bad.<br/><br/>The boring and unimaginitive script contains not a single instance of wit or humour. All is dead-serious and self-conscious, which is rather amazing given the sheer ridiculousness of the superheroes and their abilities. There are fleeting attempts at discussing the place of mutants (""illegal aliens""?) vs. humans in society, but these are halted and overshadowed by computer-generated tricks. The times when movies would only need a few of those to entertain audiences are over, but the makers of X2 didn't realise.<br/><br/>
The film even manages to make Halle Berry look bad (white 1960's hair). Enough said."

Then again, ol' Supes or Batman never gave me shivers either, and still I loved the first Superman and Batman movies, so that don't mean a thing.<br/><br/> So : what's so wrong with this movie? Well, basically, I think it's just... DUMB. Yeah, that's the word : dumb! The scenario, and everybody in it is just so dumb it makes you cry. Hell, with prof. X's supapowers and Cerebro, I'd have fixed the Magneto problem in no time! Being Magneto and having co-designed the thing, I would have killed all those pesky norms in a sec too (which it is clearly able to do according to the film)! And then the army guy... with an asset like Mastermind, couldn't he really think of a more, well, intelligent way of fighting the mutants? Well of course, he *is* an army dude so maybe that's asking too much. And then the regular guys, like in the scene where Pyro blows up a load of cop cars, ""You heard about those big bad mutants guys?""-style : being one of the soldiers, I would go like, ""**BANG** - Yeah, I heard. I also heard most of you guys aren't BULLET PROOF!!!"".<br/><br/> That's one more thing : haven't they invented the gun yet in the X-Men universe? Most of the mutants are not power-protected in  any way from bullets (except when Magneto's around of course), still none of them ever seems to think of wearing some Kevlar, let alone a *gun*. So, okay, I know it might have been a problem in the comic because of CCA regulations, but still, couldn't they have changed that for the movie just to make it less dumb? It would change the whole dynamic of the thing.<br/><br/> So, are there qualities redeeming the lack of basic intelligence throughout the movie? Not many... most of Wolverine's dry humor is gone, and Wolverine as a character seems less interesting than in the first X (though this does not seem to be a problem with the acting - see below). The fight scenes are just boring, sometimes even offensively so (Deathstryke could have killed Wolverine a thousand times in that fight, and still she lost it in the lamest manner imaginable - what a bummer). The other action scenes don't get a lot better (that plane chase for instance - there were a thousand ways they could have made that one tons more exciting than by just using YASP, Yet Another SuperPower).<br/><br/> The acting is very good for some, awful for others. Ian McKellen shines, as always : I bet he could even make a Coca Cola ad look exciting.  Patrick Stewart also does a very good job at it - he really CAN do something more than Trek, and I really look forward to seeing him in better fares than this. And Hugh Jackman is still a good Wolverine, though he didn't get half the chances to show it that he got in the first movie. Even Romijn-Stamos did a pretty good job, a lot better than in the previous film. The rest of the acting though ranged from the simply lame to the excruciatingly bad. Nightcrawler made me crawl up the walls, but not in the funny way it was clearly intended.<br/><br/> And finally, there is  the whole soap-factor : who isn't having an affair with whom in this movie? I remember this being one of the things that hit my crap-o-meter in the comics too - but just because it's crap that's in the comic, that don't mean you have to keep that crap for the movie!<br/><br/> All in all, I feel like this movie could have been a lot better, which is a pity. I had a negative feeling about the first X movie as well, but the more I thought about it and the more I saw it, the better it became. In the end, it finished about side-by-side with the original Matrix movie. X2 started out as just boring in my book, however : it only got worse each time I thought back about it, and the second sitting of it was just torture.<br/><br/> This movie will be a must for lovers of the X-Men comic as it quite faithfully reproduces its feel, all of the crap in the original books included. For those who do not fall into that category however, go see Reloaded, or if you have already, go see it a second time : you will be the better for it."
"bob the moo","Null","7","14","3 May 2003"," Flawed but better than the usual no-brain summer blockbusters
","Following an assassination attempt on the President of the USA by a mutant, General William Stryker is ordered to take action against the mutants. Using information gleamed from Magneto, he attacks the X-mansion, taking some prisoners and scattering the rest.  Wolverine, just returned from the hunt for his past, escapes with Pryo, Iceman and Rogue and sets out to meet up with Storm and Jean.  As the full extent of Styker's plan becomes clear, the X-Men have no choice but to join forces with Magneto to defeat him.<br/><br/>I have to be honest I say that every year I get sucked in by the hype machine that surrounds the summer blockbusters.  Most of the time I am let down (Jurrasic Park 3, Planet of the Apes  the list is long).  This summer looks different with this and the Matrix films to look forward to and X2 was the first one I came to.  I enjoyed the first film and immediately noticed that it's strength had been lost in this sequel.  Here the running time is over two hours and the central plot includes a lot more side issues than the first.  In one regard this is good because there is much to hold the interest.  However it also means that the film doesn't all work  most of it does but a lot of it feels abandoned or incomplete.  Wolverine no longer is the focus as he was in the first, and this is a loss.  His story is the most interesting to many people but he isn't allowed as much as he deserves. However he fares better than Rogue and Cyclops who barely have anything to do.<br/><br/>The central plot is good and has enough twisting to keep you entertained  only the odd subplot appears to be on a hiding to nowhere.  The action scenes are good on the whole.  The opening assassination attempt is very exciting and the storming of the mansion is solid.  The climax of the film with Wolverine is a little disappointing thanks to MTV style editing making the fight unclear.  Although some people have complained about it being action light, I think that is missing the point.  The film is more about the plot and the characters than just the action.  So we do have lots of dramatic scenes without action but they still work as they are building a wider story.<br/><br/>The film is a lot less funnier than the first and hence a little less enjoyable on a surface level.  Mostly this is due to the shift of focus off Wolverine and his lines.  There is still some humour but too much of it is ill-judged (in the middle of Iceman `coming out' to his family  an emotional point  his mother says `have you tried NOT being a mutant'  didn't work for me).  Happily the darker side of the film is stronger and makes this change of tone feel deliberate rather than a loss of humour. Singer directs well overall and uses his budget well  only the fight between Wolverine and Oyama was one part where I felt he had over stretched his reach a little.  He has nice touches as well  like including stuff for the harder core comic fans (eg Colossus at one point).  Also there are modern day parallels to be had in the script that are a little bit less than flag waving.<br/><br/>The cast really help this film though.  Jackman may not be the central focus for this film but he is the centre of every scene he is in.  Stewart and McKellen both do very good work here and really contribute to the feeling that this is more than a dumb blockbuster.  Berry is OK but on at least one occasion her breasts seemed to be used to greater effect than her character. Janssen comes on a lot and her struggle with her changing powers is well portrayed.  Romijn-Stamos has a much bigger role and her character is used well.  Paquin and Marsden are AWOL even when onscreen but Cumming is a good addition.  Cox is the film's greatest addition and he doesn't allow Stryker to become a carton bad guy at any point. I really like Kelly Hu and was sad t see her have little to do.  In fairness she manages to make a good impression without more than a line in the whole film but her final fight is a little disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall this is a superior summer blockbuster.  The way it tries to carry so many subplots and side characters causes it to become very weak and times and not all of it works very well but it is still good for what it is.  The change in tone from the first film will put some off but I enjoyed it and found the story to be well supported  however for X3 I hope that this ensemble feel is cut back a little and a smaller core of characters allowed to develop well rather than a lot of them developed a little."
"filmbuff1970","7","6","12","8 July 2003"," DULL
","After a good opening sequence,the movie follows the route of a big budget remake of the first. Only i found this less than exciting infact i found it boring. A film should never cost this much and be dull. But i have to say the movie is tedious. The dam scenes look poor compared to ones in Force Ten From Naverone. The action is lukewarm at best. Patrick Stewart might as well be playing Picard,spot the difference. Only Hugh Jackman and Alan Cummings deserve any credit. All talk and no action. One Boring Movie."
"Wuchakk","8","4","7","10 April 2012"," Has the most depth of the trilogy
","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.<br/><br/>The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br/><br/>You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.<br/><br/>Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).<br/><br/>""X2"" is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement, as laid out in ""X-Men."" More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker.<br/><br/>""X2"" has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and others are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. In other words, the US Government becomes the proverbial ""bad guys."" Take note how Wolverine shows no mercy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining. I like the emphasis on character and the way the film eschews moronic ""blockbuster"" conventions.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"
"Maniac-9","10","4","7","31 January 2012"," The best of the X-Men movies
","Not counting X-Men: First Class since that's a different lineage if you just count X-Men, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand and the Wolverine movie this is the best of that bunch. The first movie a big part of the story was just establishing all of the characters so this movie has the advantage over that in everything is already in a groove without having to spend a good chunk of the movie just explaining everyones character background. Last Stand had so many flaws there's not enough time to explain them.<br/><br/>The movie having good additions to the cast with Brian Cox as William Stryker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike and Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler were both positive additions."
"freemantle_uk","10","4","7","16 March 2008"," My favourite comic-book conversion
","X-Men is my favourite Comic Book Series and I loved it when it made it to the silver screen. X-Men was a good film in it own right, but it was really an introduction, especially to people who didn't know the comics. I love X-Men because of its themes of alienation and how to use power. I also love the fact that most of characters, heroes and villains have an ideology, compared to most other comics where the villains are either looking to make a lot of money or conquer the world.<br/><br/>X-Men 2 continues a few months after the first film. Nightcrawler (Alec Cumming), tries to assassinate the US President which was one amazing scene and starts the film on a high note. An military scientist Stryker, played by Brain Cox, uses the attack as justification for attacking Xavier's school. Events spiral out of control, Xavier is kidnapped by Stryker and Magneto escapes from prison. X-Men and Magneto are forced to ally with each other to save mutant kind. The film introduces new characters, Nightcrawler and Stryker as already mentioned. Colossus had a brief scene in the film, and other additions were Pyro and Lady Deathstrike. Brain Cox and Alec Cumming's performance were particularly good in my opinion, Cox is normally gives a good performance. Pyro was also fun, especially when he takes on the police outside Bobby Drake's/Iceman's house. Iceman also has a bigger part in this film, especially because of his relationship with Rogue. The film does build on the characters and that was why Bryan Singer's version worked because he focuses on them and the film was the X-Men with action, and not action with the X-Men which what happened in the third film. Singer also took on the film as an outsider because he was never a film of the comics. He was able to cut off some of the stuff that wasn't needed, made the series realistic and did his research on the characters and the story. The film also had some brilliant action scenes, and at times was surprising violence. As already mentioned the opening scene and Pyro attack on the police were great, and so was Magneto's escape from prison, the army raid on the school, the Wolverine vs. Nightcrawler fight and when the Blackbird had to escape for the US air force. In my opinion the action in this film is the best in the series.<br/><br/>The film ended with setting up a Phoenix/Dark Phoenix storyline, but the filmmakers didn't capitalise on the opportunity. Loosing Bryan Singer and his writing team was really felt in X-Men 3 and made that film it a disappointment. Just focus on the first two films and ignore the third one."
"DavidSim240183","10","4","7","14 May 2006"," What was X-cellent is now Xtraordinary
","With X-Men 3 just around the corner, and having just written a review for the original film, here comes Part 2. And like Spider-Man 2, the action is grander, the characters seem fuller, and the special effects are better than ever. Add to that a much more multilayered storyline and we have ourselves a very impressive 2 hour film.<br/><br/>Picking up not long after the first, Wolverine (the ever impressive Hugh Jackman) has gone to the Canadian Rockies to look up his past, and has found an abandoned laboratory complex and not much else. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has been having nightmares ever since Liberty Island, and predicts something dangerous on the horizon. And she's quite right.<br/><br/>X2 has a cracking opening scene that is not only a showcase of special effects work but a terrific action sequence. A blue-skinned mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) infiltrates the White House with his power of teleportation, dispatches Secret Service guards left, right and center in an attempt to assassinate the President, and is forced to retreat when he fails.<br/><br/>Jean and Storm (Halle Berry) are sent after Nightcrawler while Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) continues to look in on Magneto (Ian McKellen) who is still imprisoned in a plastic cell. Magneto also gets another visitor in the form of William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military colonel who hates mutants. Stryker interrogates Magneto about the X-Men mansion, and most importantly, Cerebro, Xavier's device that can locate mutants all over the world.<br/><br/>What our heroes don't realise is they're all the victims of an elaborate trap. Stryker ordered the hit on the President to substantiate his claims that mutants are a threat to society. Nightcrawler is really an innocent who was controlled by Stryker through a special serum. Stryker captures Xavier and Cyclops (James Marsden), then storms the mansion, stealing technical specifications for Cerebro. Stryker intends to use Xavier's exceptional powers of telepathy, amplified by Cerebro, to eliminate every mutant off the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>Wolverine manages to get Rogue (Anna Paquin), the cold-inducing Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and the fire manipulating Pyro to safety. While they head off to reunite with Jean and Storm, the shapeshifting Mystique breaks Magneto out in a truly ingenious way that has to be seen to be believed. They form an uneasy alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker's insane genocide plan.<br/><br/>Well, that was quite a bit of exposition to wade through! And although X2 requires a great deal of concentration, it's worth it. Bryan Singer has upped the ante, and took everything that was excellent about the original and turned it into something extraordinary for Part 2.<br/><br/>Wolverine gets to have most of the fun again, learning that his and Stryker's pasts are linked, acting as babysitter to the young ones, being seduced by Mystique, and getting into a serious fighting match with Lady Deathstrike, a steely eyed vixen with a few steel claws of her own.<br/><br/>Rogue and Iceman get to have a bit of a romance, not to mention how interesting it is to watch how they can be together without any physical contact. Some of the gay politics surface again in a 'coming out' scene, when Iceman has to confess to his parents he's a mutant. And Pyro is a mutant who likes his power a little too much. X2 has so many good ideas I could go on all day.<br/><br/>The special effects are flawless and perfectly integrated with the characters. There are some marvellous sequences like Storm conjuring up tornadoes, seeing the inside of Xavier's mind, and the gripping finale at Stryker's laboratory.<br/><br/>Jean's role is expanded upon, and her feisty nature is played up thankfully. She gets to be the big hero in the end, when she makes a noble sacrifice for the rest. Even Storm seems more improved. Halle Berry is enjoying herself more this time, and her performance is all the better for it. Magneto still continues to impress, throwing out dry insults at every turn, and proves in the end that he still believes in his cause. No wimpified turns of character here!<br/><br/>But where some of the characters are given great exposure, others are not. Cyclops is again relegated to the sidelines, and half the film he is absent. Still, James Marsden has yet to impress me as an actor, and he just can't bring Cyclops to life the way the character deserves. And I would have liked to see more of Deathstrike, because she makes a huge impression whenever she's around in a Lucy Liu kind of way.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart is sadly sidelined as well. In terms of plot, it seems necessary, but he made such a huge impression last time it's unfortunate he's not given enough to do. But he does what he can, and it's safe to say Stewart has finally carved out a character all his own, just as he did with Captain Picard.<br/><br/>Alan Cumming is a bit of an odd choice as Nightcrawler, but somehow he's quite effective in the role. He's an amusing character, especially the way he's always reminding people of his days in the circus. His teleporting is a definite highlight, and the make-up work is superb.<br/><br/>X2 is a marvellous adventure. Everything seems to lock into place in it's own way, firing on all cylinders and hitting the bullseye every time. With a shocking twist at the end creating a grand finale, X2 is up there with the best superhero films. And I'm left with no doubt X3 will be this series crowning achievement."
"poolandrews","4","5","10","25 January 2008"," Didn't do much for me at all.
","X2 starts as an attempt is made on the US President's (Cotter Smith) life in the Oval office by a teleporting mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the President sees this as an act of aggression on the part of all mutants & orders Willaim Stryker (Bran Cox) a military General to tighten up on mutant security. However it is in fact Stryker who was responsible for the attack & with the President's authority as well as some forged documents he sets out on his own personal crusade to rid the entire world of mutants, Stryker learns from Magneto (Ian McKellen) that Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) runs a school for mutants & the existence of the Cerebro machine in which Xavier can telepathically communicate with any living creature on the planet. Stryker intends to force Xavier to make contact with every mutant on Earth & telepathically kill them all...<br/><br/>Directed by Bryan Singer who also has a small cameo in the film as one of the security men in Magneto's plastic prison this was the sequel to the original X-Men (2000) film the huge financial success of which pretty much got the whole Marvel superhero comic book adaptation thing going with such large box-office returns, the likes of Spider-Man (2002), Daredevil (2003), Hulk (2003), Elektra (2005), Fantastic Four (2005), Ghosr Rider (2007), the Blade trilogy & Iron Man (2008) duly followed to cash in on the cinema going publics craze for these superhero flicks. To be brutally honest I've never really been that impressed with the genre with the notable exceptions being the excellent Blade films & the fun Spider-Man flicks & the silly titled X2 (why not X-Men 2?) does nothing to change my overall opinion. I think one factor is these larger than life superhero character's with all manner of odd abilities were designed for a 2-D comic book rather than a 3-D film & with a few expectations they look better as a comic strip than a live action character, the basic mechanics & demands of a full length feature film are just very different than a simple comic strip. The script by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris & David Hayter is really weak, the character's are poor & lets not forget that not everyone will have read the comics or seen the original film, the story is also very poor. It feels very slow & pedestrian, most of it takes place between mutants in imaginary settings & therefore I found it very hard to think of the film taking place in reality. I know it's pure sci-fi but for it to work it needs to be grounded in some sort of recognisable reality otherwise where's the threat coming from? Also the X-Men themselves are too powerful, between them they can do just about anything including Wolverine who can get shot on the head yet heal himself. You just always felt they would be able to overcome any situation they find themselves in & it just kills any excitement or tension. At well over two hours X2 feels like it goes on forever, there aren't that many memorable set-pieces & as a whole I think X2 is one of the poorer Marvel superhero comic book films.<br/><br/>Director Singer does alright but there's not much here that really stands out, there are a few forgettable fights, some exploding cop cars, a bust dam spewing water & a few flashy CGI computer effects. In fact I was quite surprised at how bland & routine feeling the action scenes were considering the budget. I also didn't like the way this was filmed, the scene at the end when Xavier & the rest of the X-Men turn up in the President's office with lightening flashing outside is truly embarrassing. I suspect that it was meant to be sinister & atmospheric but I just thought it looked awful & over dramatic. The special effects are generally very good but like most CGI computer effects you just 'know' what your watching is an effect.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 one has to say X2 is well made with high production values & that big budget Hollywood look & feel to it. I personally thought the acting was awful, the scenes at the end as they mourn Jean Grey are embarrassing, the shots around the camp fire as Magneto fills the rest of the X-Men in on Stryker's plans & they all try to look worried & concerned is another cringe worthy moment as is Rouge's 'scared' reaction when she lands the jet plane at the end. Hugh Jackman can't act, Halle Berry can't act (how did she ever win an Oscar?) although she does look good in tight leather & even great actors like Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart seem off colour.<br/><br/>X2 was a big disappointment to me, I was expecting lots of action & great effects but what I ended up with was a passable superhero comic book adaptation & nothing more. The story is very weak, the character's are weak & the action is forgettable. Followed by X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)."
"Movie Nuttball","10","8","19","21 March 2004"," X2 - X-Men United - In-depth Comment!
","The sequel to X-Men is here and is arguably better than the first! Though I like both films and I can't decide which is better but both are great and that's awesome! The first was a dark and mysterious film and X2 is a thrilling action sequel! There are more characters in this one though Toad and Sabertooth are not in it but there are plenty of others that are just as cool! The music is by John Ottman this time around and not by Michael Kamen. People may think Ottman's score is more fitting for the sequel than what Kamen composed for the prequel but I think Ottman's score sounds similar like the original score by Kamen which in My opinion is good for the movie! The acting in the film is top notch and so is action and also the special effects! Below is an In-depth look at the characters of the film X2: X-Men United!<br/><br/>The characters!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - Still searching to find out who he is, Logan as he is called finds an empty base up in the great north but it appears empty as it hasn't been used for some time. Since the base is empty and his questions remain will this great fighter return to Professor Xavier back in the states and seek his help or will Wolverine search else where on his own?<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - The powerful minded leader of the X-Men goes with Scott Summers to check on how Xavier's old friend Magneto is doing. How is he doing? Has anything gone wrong in Magneto's prison? If so will these two X-Men be able to handle it without the others?<br/><br/>
Ian McKellen as Magneto - Still imprisoned in his plastic jail, Erik Magnus Lehnsherr and the lovely Mystique are still partners from what is left of the Brotherhood of Mutants but will she be able to free Magneto?<br/><br/>Brian Cox as William Stryker - This military leader has done some strange things and word has it that he has experimented on mutants? If this is true what kind of experiments were they? Is it possible that he responsible for Wolverine's uniqueness? Is he still active in his duties as of now? Is he a threat to mutant kind and if so will the X-Men be able to stop him?<br/><br/>
James Marsden as Cyclops - Still protective over his girl Jean Grey, Scott Summers prefers not to interact with Logan simply because Summers thinks that Wolverine wants Grey to but is this the case?<br/><br/>Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - Jean Grey is more powerful minded now and her mind is almost as great as Professor X! If there is a time that the X-Men are in danger will she save the X-Men from an unspeakable situation?<br/><br/>Halle Berry as Storm - The Egyptian beauty goes on a mission with Jean Grey on the X-Jet. When enemy jet fighters attack she produces incredible storms but will this be enough to stop the enemy?<br/><br/>Anna Paquin as Rogue - Rogue has a more developed relationship with Iceman since time has gone on. Still wearing gloves since she cannot touch anyone and this makes her relationship with Bobby Drake difficult.<br/><br/>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - The beautiful shape shifting Mystique is back and returns as Senator Kelly. The master metamorph changes into many others to her advantage. Does she and Magneto join their enemies? Since she fought and was defeated by Wolverine will she fight him again and have revenge or will she do something else? Does she have a relationship with Nightcrawler? Does she and Rogue have a relationship of some kind and if so what kind would Rogue have with the blue skinned beauty known as Mystique?<br/><br/>
Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oyama - The bodyguard like fighter for William Stryker is quiet but an incredible looking woman. Lady Deathstrike finally faces off with Wolverine and reveals that she is not afraid of him. She battles with each of her long extracted fingers of steel! She also has similar healing like her foe so how can he defeat a woman that has the same techniques as he, is more agile, and a more skilled fighter who knows martial arts?<br/><br/>Shawn Ashmore as Iceman - An amazing mutant is Bobby Drake or Iceman as he wants to be called can freeze anything he wants with his hands. Though his relationship with Rogue is difficult but he loves her and will not let her mutant skills get in the way.<br/><br/>Kea Wong as Jubilee - She can produce electricity from her hands but what else can Jubilation Lee do?<br/><br/>Aaron Stanford as Pyro - John Allerdyce can control fire as a powerful weapon! When Magneto and Mystique arrive on the scene will Pyro join them or will he become a member of the X-Men but what has come to have him make such optional decisions?<br/><br/>Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler - Born in Germany and raised by a Gyspy woman, Kurt Wagner went into the circus but when it changed to new ownership he then later was going to be put in a freakshow and he decided that is not his destiny. Even though this mutant known as Nightcrawler resembles a demon of ancient times he is quite peaceful and in fact studies to be a man of God. Wagner is very agile and is capable of teleporting from area to area. With his German accent and kind personality he joins Storm and Jean Grey onto their mission!<br/><br/>Daniel Cudmore as Colossus - Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin who is also known as Colossus is a huge strong man and he has the ability to change his body into steel like covering. This steel also makes him have incredible strength!<br/><br/>I love the X-Men films and I would really like this franchise to be a trilogy or even a saga! There is so much more that Bryan Singer can do with his projects especially since he has a great cast and knows how to make great movies!  I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at X2: X-Men United!"
"jerekra","6","3","5","25 February 2009"," A Little Better Than The First One.
","FOr the most part I thought the first X Men film was OK. I thought there could have been more action and a little more character development. I think that ""X 2"" did a little better at character development and had a little more action.<br/><br/>Wolverine is in this film about as much as the first film. I guess he is the most popular X Men member so he gets the most screen time. Wolverine does get in some more solid action in this film but I wonder with how much he is in these X Men films how much more they can show in the upcoming Wolverine film.<br/><br/>Mystique is in this film a lot. She really is pretty important to the film. It is kind of cool how she is completely naked other than having some sharp patches on her and being blue. Magneto is kind of on both sides in this film as far as being both a good guy and a bad guy.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see a lot of my two favorite X Men, Colossus and Ice Man. Colossus was awesome as he gets a brief scene where he attacks some guys who break into the X Mansion but that is it. He does not show up really at all after that scene. Ice Man is in this film a marginal amount and he got to show some dramatic scenes where he expresses his love for Rogue as well as how he tells his family that he is a mutant. But I was disappointed with how little he used his abilities. Could have been ""cooler"" but at least he was a developed character.<br/><br/>Jean Gray is pretty cool in this film also. Storm was OK, but I do not know something seems to be missing with her character. I also liked Nightcrawler and he is very important to the film and is developed correctly. Cyclops once again did not seem as cool as he was in the comics and does not get to do that much.<br/><br/>I think the film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off. It has pretty good flow and there is a lot happening. But there is a lot of good action about a half hour into the film in the X Mansion scene but that is the best action part of the film. THere are other action scenes but nothing as good as that part so after the X Mansion scene there is nothing as good as that. I expected a better final showdown at the end of this film against Magneto, better than the one in the first film but there was NO SHOWDOWN with Magneto in this film. The ending I thought was kind of boring.<br/><br/>THere could have been more action but what they had was pretty good, not great. THey do a good job with certain characters portrayal though and that is a big improvement from the first film. A little better than the first one but still has some flaws. I recommend it over the first one."

","I'll keep this short and to-the-point. I am a life long reader of comic books. I love them and passionately anticipate and enjoy most of the recent motion pictures based on them. DC and Dark Horse comics have always been my favorites, and aside from The Punisher and Ghost Rider, I do not care too much for Marvel. However, despite that, I enjoyed the original X-Men very much. I think Bryan Singer is one of the most talented directors of his generation (see The Usual Suspects.) Yet, I was really disappointed by this sequel. Don't get me wrong, X2 is a very well done comic book adaption when compared to shameful misfires such as Hulk and Elektra, yet I do not believe it to be nearly as wonderful as everyone says. The whole film just feels so muddled and pointless to me. The ending drags on forever, and doesn't really have much of anything new to offer. Perhaps I missed something, but other than the addition of the awesome Nightcrawler character, this felt very routine and meaningless. I can't say I have very high hopes for X3 either. I do highly recommend the original X-Men, but I don't feel either of these films come close to the real masterpieces in the genre, such as Batman Begins, Hellboy, V For Vendetta, or Sin City."

","Like the first movie, the point of view seems to focus on Logan. I love that the story revolves around my favorite X-Men Character. I must admit that the first time I saw this film I wasn't very impressed. I did enjoy the special effects, but had hoped to see the Sentinels in this film. After watching the film a second time I rather enjoyed the flow of the story. This movie finds Wolverine starting to become more and more a part of the team. It does do a little background into the Weapon X program, but it really stands out by humanizing the characters that we all know as ""super-heroes."" I was also happy to see some of the characters get to shine by using their powers a little more than the first movie. I was very happy with this film. The X-Men series is proving to be one of the best of the comic book adaptations so far."
"Bergmaniac","9","3","5","16 July 2004"," The best comic book movie I've seen
","X-2 is alongside the first batman movie in a class of its own compared to all the others comic book movies out there. It has smart script that doesn't make you groan because of the stupidity of the screenwriters half the time as most of the other superhero movies do. It's really entertaining, lots of humor, magnificent fighting scenes(the opening sequence will forever remain a classic in that department IMO - astonishing combination of creative special effects, fight choreography and totally fitting great classical music), actors who  are really good and concentrated on their job(especially Ian McKellen, who is once again awesome as Magnetto) and even some actual message behind all the fights and superpowers, that really works. It also has what is always most important for a good movie and that's a smart director who knows his job. Bryan Singer is showing his talent here, getting good performances from all of his actors despite the CGI scenes being aplenty(but they are  really well done, much better than Spiderman 2 for example) and also creating a visual feast and an unique feel to the movie. And I've never even read the comics before, but I really felt close to the characters and easily got engaged in the X-Men universe.<br/><br/> Lastly, but definitely not least important, is the fact that this movie has one of the greatest looking female cast ever assembled in a mainstream movie. Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and the ultra-gorgeous Rebecca Romijn Stamos(who even has a short, but memorable appearance without the blue paint that goes with her Mystique part) - it doesn't get better than that. And all those lovely ladies can act pretty well too. Not that their parts were difficult, of course, but in comparison with the pathetic failures we so often see by the pretty actresses in the blockbuster movies it's really refreshing to watch a bunch of pretty women who can act decently enough.<br/><br/> I highly recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It's even better than the excellent first part."

A word for all the idiots who are comparing it to the previous movie are idiots.You dont compare a comic with its previous issue do you? Same is the case with the movie..The first established the characters and this went Forward with it.<br/><br/>Not many ""Fight scenes"",but it was good the way it was. NightCrawler was Awsome,i hope he gets some more time in the next one, Kelly Hu's character was totally useless and unimpressive, her fight with Wolvi dint make sense.(i think they just included her to show that Wolv was a Lab Experiment gone wrong).<br/><br/>Rouge,IceMan & Pyro were under used(They Were probably just being introduced in this one and Pyro was pretty impressive in his V.S Cops scene).....Magneto reminded us ""once a BaddY...Always a BaddY"" although Mystique was always Really CooL.And y dint they add the baddies from the first (i.e. Sabretooth,Toad & Storm???)? Toad was really kool and id love to see him go against NightCrawler.I nearly forgot...Jean's death was BAD and i never saw that coming, but   i dint see her character growing so i guess it was ok(maybe they bring a Kick @$$ character in the next)<br/><br/>End: X2 was a great movie and for me it was a better movie than the first.it was more realistic and Quiet believable.Hope X3 does justice to this one and maybe even does one better like this one. its a 9/10 for me.. ....By the way ""Dint the Senator die in the first movie..."

","Bryan Singer really proves himself here, bringing us possibly the GREATEST superhero film ever. If you loved the first film, this one will exceed your expectations and beyond!! I'll begin with the incredible story, which will involve audiences throughout, done by Zak Penn thankfully. This time around much more screen time is devoted to personalization these characters and Singer makes sure each one gets their adequate amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic I must say. We have all the actors from the previous film, plus several new and thrilling characters. Night Crawler, played by Alan Cumming, is no doubt my favorite of them. Aaron Stanford is Pyro, another character well done. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine perfectly, creating a sense of mystery with the mutant. The action is mind blowing, no less than awe-inspiring. From the White House assassination attempt to Pyro's firery attack against the police, all the scenes are unique and have an intensity only Singer could deliver. Which reminds me, Kelly Hu is sexy as Lady Death Strike and the fight between her and Wolverine is by far one of the best action sequences ever filmed.<br/><br/>Singer sets up a dark atmosphere of conflict, not too unlike our own discrimination and hate-filled world. It is this major component that shows that only through unity can intolerance be defeated, the movie's definite theme. To add to this film's greatness, John Ottoman's score is incredible, if not one of his very best. It definitely keeps the mood of the film, whether heroic, tormented, or tragic. Single handedly one of the best hero flicks ever filmed."

","... which the sequel then junked for the usual silly superhero theatrics and vapid set-pieces. Some people criticised X-Men because they thought it didn't have enough action - I liked that it focused more on 'dialogue' and 'mood'... X2 went too far in the opposite direction, for my liking. To put it into perspective, I also liked ""The Hulk"" for the same reasons most people hated it... ! The first installment was duty-bound to do sterling work establishing the players and examining their various back-stories. For the most part that isn't necessary here, and so I felt that it just wasn't dealt with satisfactorily AT ALL - even for party newcomers like Nightcrawler. Any trace of subtlety is pretty much swamped by the traditional gung-ho heroism now that the majority of the group know each other better.<br/><br/>The many interesting relationships of the first (such as that between Wolverine and Rogue) are not given anywhere near the attention they deserve in order to cram in more physically astonishing feats. Your average teenage moviegoer will love this (as proved by the high rating here) but I've seen it all before; and to see the series regress to aping countless other summer blockbusters when it began by celebrating differences, (literally) was more than a little dispiriting to experience..."
"sscsgh","2","4","8","25 November 2003"," Really??????
","I saw this film in the summer and was really underwhelmed. I quite liked the first film, for style and tone if not the afterthought plot, so I was expecting good things from this film as the introductions had been done in the first film and we could crack on with a really good story.<br/><br/>Maybe I need to see this film again but I don't see where on earth all these great reviews came from. I could see how people might think it was okay, or diverting and entertaining but no more. I left the cinema pretty cold. More characters were introduced, more background needed filling in and Bryan Singer seemed to not know how to handle it. Maybe it was the story/script at fault, maybe the editing went astray but I thought this was a lesson in how not to handle an ensemble film that an X-Men film is always going to be. He lost control of all the stories, especially near the end, it seemed like we were jumping between plotlines in a quite unplanned way.<br/><br/>
As in the first film I didn't rate the main storyline much either. I hope that when X-Men 3 (or X3, or XXX or whatever it's going to be called) comes that the less is more approach is taken and we get a more structured narrative round the interesting characters, new characters are limited, and we get a good central storyline that is is more than a subplot for the ongoing humans versus mutants story. I think this franchise has potential from what we've seen but has been let down so far by weak story and weak characters."

If you put enough characters on the screen, do you have a franchise?<br/><br/>Plenty of people liked X2, so I guess #1 is true, and I'm certain the studio is banking on the second holding true as well.  Though I liked X2 better than the first X-Men, I was more overwhelmed by the lack of character development and story progression than the effects.  It's unfortunate, because the X-Men backstory offers a unique take on the superhero milieu, but how can you develop characters that will keep the viewers coming back when you're contractually obligated to give over a dozen people screen time? I have a feeling the answer will be to throw more money at the screen, and I think that will get old after a while (see: The Matrix)."

","this is a bad movie.  there is no drama, there is no character development. all of the dialogue is completely expository.  the direction is flaccid and amateurish(three instances that come to mind are wolverine touching stryker's hand through the ice wall, cyclops crying after jean gray saves the airplane and nightcrawler reciting the lord's prayer).  it not drama. it's contrived.  the plot isn't interesting at all, though a good portion of it is confusing for a x-men virgin like myself(though i saw the first film). case in point--the love triangle with wolverine, jean gray and cyclops. that little bit had no bearing on the story whatsoever.  zero.  the special effects add nothing to the film, with the exception of the opening sequence with nightcrawler(by far the best sequence in the movie).  X-2 was extremely boring; the last half hour stretched on forever.  on top of all this, the film came off as preachy.  i got the whole 'mutants are oppressed' thing in the first movie.  no need to beat me over the head with it.<br/><br/>

"djcallender","4","5","11","13 May 2003"," One x-men fan who doesn't love either of the films
","I can appreciate comic books as much as the next guy (although I'm not a reader), and the X-Men, I have to admit, are probably the best team out there, if not the best superheroes, period. That said, the movie versions do not live up to mutant standards. Its okay, we can be honest, no one will hurt us here.<br/><br/>I think the only thing making these flicks so popular is the fact that comic book fans get to actually see live action interpretations of what they had only previously been able to catch in 2-D rendering--and not the quality of the films themselves. Why the special treatment?<br/><br/>I think all comic-to-screen attempts are hindered in one way--the filmmakers concentrate too much on the visuals and lose sight of the characters and the story. Those latter two qualities suffer as a result. There have been many movies that have done a good job of alleviating this obstracle (Superman and Spiderman, even Batman and Daredevil), but X-Men and X2 fail miserably. With as much criticism that the Star Wars prequels receive regarding their scripts and dialogue, you'd think more people would let the X-movies have it.<br/><br/>Furthermore,  do they really do anything visually innovative? I like alot of what I saw in X2, but overall it was nothing on par with, say, The Matrix. I'm not asking for a Matrix ripoff by any means. What I am saying is that I would have liked to see the same level of quailty and commitment. Maybe it was just that the F/X were not effective because of the weak plot and character development; they were sort of wasted. Either way, they don't save the  film.<br/><br/>Its not just me, the casual fan, that dislikes these films. I recently had an eye-opening discussion with my friend, the die-hard comic book geek. He confessed that he felt compelled to be a big X-Men movies fan because of its comic book roots. In actuality, however, he hated much of what they did to his beloved mutants, and was quite dissapointed in general.<br/><br/>
So let all of us X-Men fans stand up, and speak our true feelings--the movies are not that good! There--no longer should we hide in disgrace. We are free, free at last!"
"dr_foreman","3","5","11","7 May 2003"," United we falter
","Everyone seems to think that X2 is superior to its predecessor, merely on the account of its larger budget.<br/><br/>How unimaginative and superficial we've all become.  X2 is a bloated, noisy, action-oriented sequel to a more thoughtful, far superior film.  Special effects aside, everything about X2 is weaker.  The massive cast prevents sufficient character development, the film is edited like an MTV video, and the plot meanders terribly.<br/><br/>The most interesting characters from the first film - Rogue and Magneto - are sidelined here.  Ian McKellan is wasted in a minor role, and suddenly his morally ambiguous character - who was so fascinating in the first X-Men - is just evil, to the point where he taunts Rogue after having tortured her, and advocates the total destruction of humanity.  Rogue, meanwhile, gets to have a poorly developed romance with Iceman - every bit as thin and unconvincing as Wolverine's romance with Jean Grey.  Why bother hiring such talented actors as McKellan and Paquin if they must take a back seat to digital trickery and junior high school-caliber ""romance""?<br/><br/>Alan Cumming makes a terrible Nightcrawler (I can do a better German accent - ""my name eez Kurt Vagner,"" indeed!), and Halle Berry is once again a totally flat Storm.  Brian Cox makes a cheesy villain (his name is Striker, for goodness' sake!), and his human troops are so outmatched by the mutants that he never provides a credible threat.  In fact, the conflict is so imbalanced that I have to root for humanity - we're going to get our backsides kicked!<br/><br/>On the plus side...well, I liked Jean Grey, and Magneto's escape, but they weren't worth the ten bucks.  Here's hoping that X3 gets its budget lowered, so it might turn out smarter than this soulless, cash-powered clunker."
"cmb1033","3","5","11","3 May 2003"," It's bad.
","It's bad.<br/><br/>Certainly the characters are entertaining, the special effects are outstanding, and the plot hangs together, but the movie is poorly done.  I liken it to watching a film produced for children with ADHD:  everything's repeated and explained, constantly, just in case you missed it or forgot what was said earlier.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>For example, how many times do we need to be told that Xavier is deadly when connected to Cerebro?  This film seems to think we need to be told no fewer than three times.  How many times do we need to be reminded that Nightcrawler is from a German circus?  I realize it's done for comic effect, but in a movie plagued with repetition, it grates against one's nerves.<br/><br/>In many instances, characters explain away plot elements that need no explanation.  Consider Jean and Storm tracking down Nightcrawler.  Already it has been established that Xavier has issues tracking him.  They remind us of this (since we can't possibly have remembered that Xavier's just explained this himself), then when they find him Jean suddenly has to tell us, `He's a teleporter.  That must be why the Professor had trouble tracking him.'  Well.duh.<br/><br/>The movie simply seems to have a big problem with its audience awareness. Yes, some people who see this movie may need a few hints in a few places. But come on, do we really need Magneto to tell us about his helmet (via a conversation with Pyro), illustrate its defenses against mental powers through his resistance to Xavier's Cerebro attack, THEN point to his helmet while in the reconstructed Cerebro room as if to say to us, `Look at me, I'm wearing my helmet; you might recall it protects me.'   I think we don't.<br/><br/>The movie also lacks any kind of emotional impact.  Even at the one point in the film I almost had an emotional connection (Jean's sacrifice), the movie had undercut any possible feeling by neglecting to develop Jean's relationships with any of the characters (beyond her cold shoulder with Wolverine).  By then also giving the final monologue to her voice (with the accompanying BLATANTLY OBVIOUS FORESHADOWING - they could have just flashed up a sign and been done with it, it was so poorly done), they cut out any kind of emotional effect her death could have had.  A much better choice would have been the voice of Cyclops for that last scene.  I might have cared then.<br/><br/>That said, I loved the special effects.  See it on the big screen b/c it will be totally pointless on a small screen, or save yourself some money and wait on the upcoming Phoenix movie."
"gcsman","10","2","3","8 April 2018"," One of the half-dozen best superhero films, hands down
","In the X-Men comics, the Jean Grey/Phoenix/Dark Phoenix sequence originally from the 1970's and 80's was one of the all-time great storylines in all of comics history. In fact, it's still going, because Marvel realized (somewhat too late) just how powerful that theme was with the fans. The echos and spinoffs from the Phoenix saga have kept resonating through all the X-Men titles with follow-on characters like the post-Phoenix real Jean Grey (in the long-running X-Factor series), her apparent clone Madelyne Pryor (whom Scott Summers married when Jean was MIA and presumed dead, had a son with, then separated), Rachel Grey/Summers (the daughter of Jean and Scott from an alternate timeline), and ongoing conflicts between Scott and Wolverine, Jean's two lovers. And the Phoenix entity itself keeps showing up, once in a while. Jean herself has been put through a confusing near-endless cycle of death/resurrection/Phoenix re-animation, though it seems unlikely any of these would make it into the movies, since the X-films have now defined a path of their own.<br/><br/>According to screenwriter Zak Penn, the original concept for the movie X2 (X-Men United) was to go all the way into the Phoenix story, but he persuaded director Bryan Singer to hold back on it till the X-Men movie world was more well established. On its own merit I'd say that was a wise move; it's just that in X3 (2006) under different director Brett Ratner, they actually did go into Phoenix and messed it up. However, hope springs eternal. We'll see what the new Dark Phoenix (2019) has to show us next year with the rebooted younger X-Men cast. Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>Anyway, in X2 we just get three short moments when the Phoenix entity makes its appearance within Jean as a sort of prelude, but they're exciting moments in themselves and a key to the big climactic scene that is the payoff to the whole movie. From the moment of its theater release (2003) X2 has been one of my favorite movies, let alone superhero movies. And I'll say that a rating of 10/10 doesn't mean 'perfect', which as far as I'm concerned can't be defined for films; it just reflects how I feel about it. I watched this again on DVD just this week and it still holds up very well against all the other movies in this now-big genre. <br/><br/>My ""top 5"" list of all-time best superhero flicks right now is (no particular order) X2, Thor, Iron Man, Avengers, and Wonder Woman. What do they have in common? The answer isn't great special effects, although they all have that. It's (a) storyline and (b) characters that we care about, just like in any good movie of any genre. X2 from 15 years back is the oldest of these. Its special effects are just fine for what it needs, but the point is that it does NOT rely on its big action sequences as its whole reason for being. It's what happens BETWEEN those action set pieces that matters: the story, the characters, the dialog. If those are good, then you've got something that lasts. <br/><br/>After the success of the first X-Men (2000) we eagerly looked forward to the second instalment with anticipation and a bit of anxiety: would it be as good? maybe even better? It delivered, and that was important: the whole idea of the superhero genre was very new then and its eventual success was not at all guaranteed. The familiar X-people were back, the key actors were more comfortable with their roles, and the new people (Nightcrawler, Pyro, and brief bits by Colossus and Shadowcat) fitted in well -- the opening scene of the movie where Nightcrawler blitzes the White House guards to get to the president is one of the great introductions to a character who's going to play a substantial role in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The X-Men franchise has had some distinctive things going for it compared with the MCU. Right from the start, it's had something closer to gender parity with Storm, Jean, Mystique, Rogue all having strong roles. (And X2 easily passes the Bechdel test: as an example, see the scenes between Jean and Storm when they go off to track down Nightcrawler.) This is ground that the MCU still hasn't covered 15 years later. Another strong point is that the dialog and direction of the X-films doesn't rely on Joss Whedon-like self-referential humor, irony, or snark. Those have their place -- at Whedon's best, it's brilliant -- but at times it's just nice to watch something that takes itself seriously and where the issues feel real. Wonder Woman (2017) fits that category, too.<br/><br/>On repeated viewings of X2, though, you really start to admire the structure of the plot -- its complex web of interlocking storylines and characters, and the patient way in which it all unfolds until everything finally comes together in the last half-hour. Just about every piece of the web that appears in the first half of the film, large or small, gets used in the second half. If your movie is just a framework for running from one action scene to another for the sake of eye candy, you can't do that. <br/><br/>Who is actually the central character, among this big cast and complex story? Logan (Hugh Jackman) is the center of a sub-plot about uncovering his own origin, but he's not at the epicenter of the entire film. Magneto (Ian McKellen) is in a lot of scenes and is the leader of a sort of parallel attack on Stryker, but again no. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is MIA in the middle of the film (again!) and surprisingly we hardly notice. As I hinted above, this movie belongs to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). On a second or third viewing, you can see the ending coming in what happens with Jean throughout the film (including, especially, the first appearances of the immensely powerful Phoenix force within her). And it's the last 15 minutes that lift this movie from good to great. Jean's heartrending, fully self-aware sacrifice allows all the rest of the team to survive, along with the mutant kids rescued from the evil Stryker's clutches. Greater love hath no man. The emotional kick of this scene is doubled by the grief pouring out from Scott and Logan, who both desperately loved her in different ways. <br/><br/>Not that there aren't other good action sequences at well calibrated intervals. There's the visit of Bobby, Rogue, Pyro, and Wolverine to Bobby's parents' house (where we get the best line of the film from Bobby's mother, ""Have you tried ... not being a mutant?), which goes sideways when the police arrive. There's the Blackbird chase by two fighter planes, with the moment when the Phoenix force first pops up; the all-out violence of the fight between Wolverine and Deathstryke; and the extended battle within the giant hydropower dam-turned-lab. But again, it's what happens between these that is important. The characters develop, interact, grow, and end up different people than they started.<br/><br/>It was a letdown that X3 (2006) couldn't continue the string. The franchise wouldn't rise to these heights again until Days of Future Past (2014). We'll see what next year's Dark Phoenix has to bring. The storyline is still begging for a good treatment.<br/><br/>(A footnote: Jean Grey is a puzzingly colorless name (no pun intended) given that it's from Stan Lee himself, that lovable promoter and genius behind the Marvel superhero universe. Stan came up with loads of strong and/or alliterative names for his comics characters like Susan Storm; Peter Parker; Jessica Jones; Luke Cage; Ororo Munroe; Scott Summers; Rogue; Reed Richards; Ben Grimm; Stephen Strange; Nick Fury; and dozens more. Why something so ordinary?)"

","Having already seen the first X-men movie and loved it, I couldn't wait to watch the follow-up, X-Men 2 and it didn't let me down. From it's themes and action scenes to the acting and direction, X-men 2 is a superior sequel to the first one in almost every possible way.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a indoctrinated mutant named Nightcrawler breaking into the White House and tries to kill the president but is unable to and flees. In the meantime, Wolverine journeys to an old army base in Canada to find evidence about his past but discovers nothing. Professor X locates Nightcrawler and sends Jean Gray and Strom to find him, while William Stryker gets permission from the president to examine the X Mansion for it's mutant ties. Stryker's forces than attack the mansion and abduct several students while Wolverine and a few other mutants are able to escape while Professor X and Cyclops are also captured. Now, the remaining X-men and Magneto must unite to save the professor and stop Stryker from executing his plans of destroying all of mutant kind.<br/><br/>With sequels, remakes and reboots being the main summer blockbusters these days, it's becoming harder and harder to find an action movie that has the capability to grasp your mind and engage your concentration so rigidly and doesn't let go until the film ends, X-Men 2 is one such movie. Usually, there are only a handful of movies where the follow-up is able to take all the previous elements from the first movie, effectively toss out anything that doesn't work and goes on to not only smash people's doubts or any kind of excitement for the movie but also utterly revalues and enhances the genre's credibility like The Dark Knight or Terminator 2. Given how the X-men feel more political and emotional than most other superheroes, the main aspects of the story lie with the characters and their battles for acceptance, their thoughts on how the world sees them, their relationships with each other, and how they all play a part in the story at hand while at the films core lies something a lot of modern action movies lack: heart.<br/><br/>But it's also thanks to director Brian Singer's obviously endless capabilities to accurately portray the authentic essence of the comics in a way that only a few directors have been able to do. Singly, wither they be hero, villain or as a team, Brian has managed to touch upon the emotional center of the comics and bring all these heroes and villains together in a movie that has no need for epic battles or witty dialog, but instead focuses on the lost arts of character development and interaction. Now, that's not saying that Singer follows the comics note for note as he does change things, but doesn't destroy it like what Josh Trank did to Fant4stic and while Brian's version of the X-men allows the viewer to appreciate that any changes made to the team are for the better like how skillfully Singer handles the character of Jean Gray and her hidden abilities as he reinterprets this variation by still bestowing her this power but using it to develop Jean as a character and allows the viewer to see the abilities she has and at the same time, Singer treats her along with the viewing audience and the fans with the utmost admiration while another fine case in Singer's abilities of character analysis is taking a villain like William Stryker who was a religious fanatic in the comics and turning him into a more dangerous bigot who still retrains some of his original holier-than-thou attitude but making Stryker a military man makes him even more ruthless and evil allowing Singer to give us a more complex and developed villain with a clear-cut plan and by adding in important sub-plots and characters that are used effectively make the movie what it is.<br/><br/>The movie's screenplay is able to juggle it's vast amount of characters without feeling too rushed as it gives each hero and villain a decent amount of development as well as has a change to have their moment without the movie feeling too cumbersome while there are plenty of Easter eggs for fans of the comics that don't endanger the course of the story. The movie also has a lot more smooth action scenes than the first one including Nightcrawler's spectacular attack on the White House and Wolverine slicing and dicing Stryker's men during the attack on the X mansion while John Ottman gives us some incredible and catchy themes that complement the movie while the editing and cinematography are to a high level.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie would be nothing without it's cast and it delivers that on a silver platter. Ian McKellan continues to show his acting credibility as Magneto and he doesn't hold back when it comes to the malice and warmongering, yet brings a level of class to the character as does Patrick Stewart as Professor X by conveying a relaxed grace as well as all the characteristics of a father figure and leader while Halle Berry brings the usual believability and truthfulness to the role of Strom. Anna Paquin is back as Rouge and gives a fantastic performance as does James Marsden as Cyclops, even if he's given little to do, Rebecca Romjin once again brings a dangerous edge to Mystique. Shawn Ashmore is believable as Iceman, showing great emotional range while being very likable. Aaron Stanford is great as Pyro, Famkie Jensen is again fantastic as Jean Grey and is given quite a lot of development which makes her all the more relatable. Allan Cummings is fantastic as Nightcrawler while Brian Cox plays a wonderfully menacing William Stryker. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine and has completely made the role his own from the action scenes to the emotional moments.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie, it's truly awesome."

","X2 picks up after the first, with Wolverine rejoining the X-Men after a search on Alkali Lake for his past. When William Stryker infiltrates the X-Mansion in search for Cerebro, he also abducts a few child mutants in the process. Professor X is almost tricked into killing all mutants in the world until the X-Men, teamed up with Magneto, Mystique, and newcomer Nightcrawler, they save the worlds mutants and defeat Stryker and his feminine henchman, Lady Deathstrike. Jean Grey gives her life to save the team when the lake's dam burst, but there is hope that she isn't truly dead. This movie is better paced than X1 and we're given better character development. Bryan Singer has succeed once again, making one of the best superhero films of all time. That's why I give it a 10/10."
"Axel-9","9","2","3","12 May 2003"," The evolution of the event movie has begun...
","Finally I've seen it. And now I want to see it again. I wouldn't judge it against past efforts just yet, but, and only time will tell properly, this is probably the best comic book adaptation to date. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer has done a fantastic job, giving the characters space to feel but also remembers to let them kick some ass, and what a way to kick off proceedings with Nightcrawler bamfing through the Whitehouse. What makes that scene so fine isn't just the action packed thrill of it. Well that helps but the scene is also integral to the plot, making it more than just eye candy. It's a great way to introduce a new character, and means that when we find out about his tragic past, our attention has already been won.<br/><br/>
The rest of the film runs in a similar vein, building upon what we already know and adding to the characters personas. Inevitably with such a large cast some don't come of as well, mainly Storm and Cyclops. This is a minor gripe though as the characterisation elsewhere is spot on.<br/><br/>
Iceman and Rogue's almost tragic relationship, with Iceman unable to kiss her is well played by both Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin. Iceman's coming out to his parents demonstrates more ability on Ashmore's part and he seems to be a young actor with some emotional range. The exchange with his mother where he is asked 'Have you ever tried not being a mutant' captured the adolscent-esque awkwardness of his situation. <br/><br/>Aaron Stanford conveys the burgeoning hatred of humans, that his Jon Allerdyce/Pyro feels. The glee with which he attacks police officers sent to arrest the mutants is well played. As the viewer we know there is something distinctly dark about this boy. His exchange with Magneto where he is asked 'what's your real name?' by the magnetic master is the moment he knows being human is no longer an issue.<br/><br/>Then of course there is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Jackman has real presence, and dominates whenever he's on screen even when faced with the similarly adamantium pumped Yuriko Oyama, or trading words with Brian Cox's sinister Stryker. He certainly had the acting chops to carry the first film and is excellent whenever given the opportunity here. His improvised answer of 'Art' when asked what subject he teaches brought a cackle and his ability to deliver such one liners is often in evidence. He can do the emotional stuff too though, with scenes involving him chasing after the unattainable love and looking almost apologetic after he dispatches Oyama after their climactic fight. That actually made the fight better for me, as after all the hype it never quite had the required impact on me, but Jackman's understanding of Wolverine's reaction to killing one like himself shows.<br/><br/>Both Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart as the mutant elders give solid performances. Famke Janssen is good value as Jean Grey and Rebecca Romjin Stamos cuts loose a number of times as Mystique, ironically turning up as 'herself' to entrap a prison guard in a bar.<br/><br/>Overall I really did like the movie. It develops well, splitting the characters and re-uniting them in a steady flow for the finale. The plot resonates with the zeitgeist of the world with parallels being drawn to many recent events. Ignoring these it's still a kick ass bit of entertainment, so if you want to be bothered with the themes of acceptance and hatred of those that are different or just want to see an F-16 get knocked out by a tornado there is something there for all.<br/><br/>Mutation has allowed X2 to leap to the top of the pile of this year's blockbusters and allowed it to plant a very firm foot there. It'll take some shifting."
"Milla-M","8","2","3","10 May 2003"," Yep, it's as good as they say it is...
","My older brother and his friend decided to go and see X-2 on Thursday night, since I had nothing better to do I decided to tag along (but believe me, I didn't go for the company). I think I was going to see this film at the weekend anyway as my friends were talking about it but I wasn't really excited about seeing it. I have seen the first X-Men and I thought it was fine and maybe a little overrated, my Dad, when he was little, was a big fan of the X-Men and he has a big dusty cardboard box filled with their old, mildewed comics. So one boring summer when I was up in the attic I had a little flick through them. I didn't know a lot about the X-Men but I discovered that I knew more than others. This is my first time reviewing a really big film still in the cinema, so don't mind me if I sound a little bit nervous at times, what with all your big, top quality reviews floating about.<br/><br/>Anyways I'll start with the acting. They cast for this film is incredible and they really make this film just that bit more excellent. Some of the actors that really stand out are Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). Thank god Hugh Jackman was chosen to play Wolverine. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the feral gentleman, Jackman was excellent in the role, switching between berserker rage and gentle and dry. His relationship with Jean Grey is also quite intense, Jean Grey's character is wonderfully acted by Janssen, and this lady seems good at playing deeply troubled yet sophisticatedly sexy roles. Then McKellen and Stewart give an electric performance, the terse conversations, the familiar yet totally obscure relationship between them and their unsurpassed wisdom is excellently pulled off, together they're a wonderful combination. The rest of the acting is really good, I won't name all the actors but Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler), Halle Berry (Storm), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro) execute their roles perfectly, bringing the film to life to an even greater extent. I was also glad to see Romijn-Stamos' role exploited more, she plays Mystique brilliantly and her character seems much more human with much more character than before. Kelly Hu gave a great performance (if you can call it that) as the silent but deadly Deathstrike. I also liked the inclusion of some of the other, younger X-Men, Collosus, Siryn, Jubilee and Kitty Pryde (however I hope, if there is a sequel, they will have much MUCH more screen time).<br/><br/>The film was basically story integrated with a lot of action. The action sent my already quivering spine shaking all over again. The opening sequence with an assassination attempt on the President's life played out with some excellent classical music was amazing. Other parts of the film such as the storming of the mansion, Mystique's invasion and Wolverine's cat (tiger) fight were all also astonishing action sequences. The dialogue in the film was quite good as well but it doesn't really stand out in a film with amazing special effects such as this. The special effects were delectable; they made the film seem much more realistic than it could've been. I especially liked Bobby Drake/Iceman's (Shawn Ashmore) mutant abilities as well as some others. Again I have to applaud Mystique as one of the most enjoyable characters in the film; her shape-shifting skills are brilliant to watch. <br/><br/>The story wasn't as intelligent as the first X-Men's but I still enjoyed it, there weren't many heart-stopping twists in the storyline until near the end (of course I'm not going to tell you), a real tendon-tweaking moment. A lot of the characters aren't fully explored either. I think the director should've tried to incorporate the use of flashbacks more often. I thought for a moment we might've delved deeper in Lady Deathstrike's past (when she starts to get all fidgety when she is with William Stryker and Professor X) or Pyro's past (when he sees all the happy family' photographs on the wall in Bobby Drake's house), but we didn't. These characters were likeable characters but just weren't explored enough for me. Also I think Lady Deathstrike had a past with Wolverine right? This wasn't even touched on in the film, either. The theme of the story was colourfully highlighted. I think basically they were trying to display the intolerance of the human race, how we are always looking for a scapegoat and how people shouldn't be afraid to be themselves:<br/><br/> - `Then why not stay in disguise all the time? You know, look like everyone else.' - `Because we shouldn't have to.' <br/><br/>Besides the lack of character development I found the pace was a bit off at times (this is very minor) and also that some things could've been explained a littler clearer but overall it was a brilliant film. Once I sat down in the cinema time just slipped through my hands like sand, I didn't even notice it go past. It was a truly brilliant film and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's an improvement upon the last film and I hope another sequel is made. I think the director (Bryan Singer) and the cast all deserve a round of applause. Watch this film; really, you won't forget it!<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/> - Milla."
"miredita","8","2","3","4 May 2003"," Great moments though the whole doesn't quite gel
","***WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT***              ***WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT***<br/><br/>There are some great moments in this film, the beginning sequence of course, but others as well: cameos by Colossus and Kitty Pryde; the touching and dramatic scenes at Bobby Drake's parents' house; the nice but all-too brief scene with Storm and Nightcrawler discussing religious faith and the struggle to survive; the siege on X-Mansion and Wolverine doing a ""Weapon X""-like counterattack on the intruders; the escape of Magneto; well I could go on and on -- this movie has a lot of moments but ultimately I think it fails to gel as a whole picture. The many new characters were a welcome addition and the movie clocked in at a healthy 2 1/4 hours, which should've been enough to do justice to all the storylines. At times though I felt the movie sacrificed character focus and dramatic build-up for plot efficiency and needless ""show"" scenes. What follows is a mix of cheers and jeers.<br/><br/>Certain moments could've been left out entirely (and I know many will disagree with me on this) - to begin, the Lady Deathstrike/Wolverine encounter at the end was a disappointment. You knew it was coming the entire time (from the previews, mainly) and it was too short and served no real purpose other to show-off some cool effects. In my opinion this whole sequence could have been edited out since it added nothing and didn't deliver even as a side-item. In contrast the Sabretooth/Wolverine final conflict in the first movie was more effective because the personal animosity between them had been established early on. I think bringing in the fact that Wolverine and Sabretooth once worked together as allies with Stryker (again going back to the books) would have been a very effective and suitable subplot. I guess Tyler Mane wasn't interested in an encore.<br/><br/>The ending was very reminiscent of ""Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan"" and the death of Spock and his eventual return, and yes, I understood the Phoenix reference from the comic storyline. However, I think that was a misplaced concept -- did anyone noticed that noone even bothered to find Jean's body? It's not like it was incinerated (like in the original Phoenix story), this is a flood! I guess they don't believe in ""leaving no man behind."" Or am I missing something here? If they weren't able to find it, that's one thing, but they didn't even bother to look for it (for Scott and Logan's sake if nothing else). In addition, this was supposed to be the unexpected dramatic high point of the movie, but there wasn't any dramatic build-up to it -- it just happened (in contrast, consider the ending of STII which was alluded to in various ways through the entire movie, thus creating a dramatic build-up and a more satisfying result).<br/><br/>Professor X again gets incapacitated here, though he isn't taken out most of the movie as in the first one. Patrick Stewart is an incredible actor, and sad to say but he made many of the other actors look simply boring. I would like to have seen Jason survive the ordeal with Xavier, after all, wouldn't a mutant capable of controlling Professor X be worth having as a possible ally? Especially when his greatest enemy (his father) is now (presumably) dead. As with Jean, though, they left him behind to get crushed by the collapsing Cerebro.<br/><br/>As far as characters go, my biggest problem here is with Storm: when she was discovered (in the comic series) she was an African queen using her weather powers to (benevolently) rule over her people, very dramatic personality. This personal history would create a more intense personality-type for anyone. However, for the first movie and this one she is simply another somewhat introverted and angry mutant. I don't know whether it's by design or not, but I think Halle Berry *IS CAPABLE* of playing a character with a showy personality. I mean if you could control the weather and used to be a queen, wouldn't you have a more extroverted personality? I don't understand the reasoning behind this. She's always been one of my favorite characters in the books BECAUSE of this rich mix of personality and powers.<br/><br/>Wolverine didn't take center stage like in the first movie, but once again he was one of the bright spots. The casting choice was and remains perfect. I would've preferred a return of Sabretooth (thus continuing the drama from the first movie) over the brief and wasted introduction/demise of Lady Deathstrike (who was never even named in this movie).<br/><br/>The Stryker character was effective, especially the scene where he was describing how his wife took a power drill to her temple in an attempt to release the illusions that her son was planting in her mind. I think Stryker's relationship with Wolverine was one of the better developed subplots.<br/><br/>And how could I leave out Mystique, who was definitely the eye-pleaser of the movie (for us guys that is). It would be nice to have Storm's personality developed along those same lines as a counterweight. Every scene she was in was worth the price of admission. Great action, wonderfully mischievous and sneaky character. Another perfect casting choice! Loved the Mystique/Wolverine seduction scene (and who was that blond she appeared as in the bar?)<br/><br/>And like Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan is a wonder to behold, I actually enjoyed him more in this one as a sort of Hannibal Lecter-type. The brief interplay between him and Pyro was great, definitely a good choice for a protege. Again a perfect casting choice.<br/><br/>Pyro (John) was a wonderful addition here as the mutant with an attitude. Great personality, at the same time sympathetic, the kind of bad kid you definitely want on your side. That whole scene at Bobby Drake's folks' house (including the few tender moments Bobby and Rogue spent together) was excellent. Very memorable, very dramatic. I should add that Rogue and Bobby had great chemistry here both and Rogue's brief appearances were NOT wasted (after all she ""persuaded"" Pyro to stand down from his fiery assault on the cops).<br/><br/>The best new addition was, hands-down, Nightcrawler, played to perfection here......using CORRECT German, I might add (even when he was praying). I really wanted to see more of him, he sort of took a back seat for the second half of the movie. Maybe some flashbacks of his past as a circus freak would've been a nice touch. The introduction of a significant religious element here is a nice touch. And the involved make-up could not be improved upon.<br/><br/>Jean's personality came out more in this movie (she was rather flat in the first one), and her scenes with Wolverine were great. I think her unfocused condition and ultimate ""demise"" should have been developed more throughout to give the ending more a reason-to-be. Maybe in the next one her return as Phoenix (though I still fail to see how a flood will cause this -- being consumed by fire and rising from the ashes, that is what a Phoenix is) will create a much more forceful personality for Jean (and maybe force Storm to come out of her shell as well). I wouldn't mind seeing more personal histories overall in the next one as well (as we have gotten nothing so far about Scott and Jean's past).<br/><br/>Overall I recommend this movie: it has a more substantial plot and many improvements over the first installment. But I think it could have spent more time developing the quieter moments to give the dramatic moments greater impact. Some of these worked (Bobby's folks, Nightcrawler in the church) but the more crucial ones didn't (Jean's self-sacrifice). It would have made the movie longer to do so, but, hey if it works, who cares? Maybe some of these will show up on the DVD as deleted scenes or (better) a restored director's cut. Still, lessons learned for the next installment - maybe the third time's the charm."
"stn71186","Null","2","3","3 May 2003"," The best comic movie ever.
","X-Men 1 was a good but highly forgettable film.  I just didn't care about what happened but I still had high expectations for the second film and the second film saves this series.  This is the best comic film ever.<br/><br/>
The plot is fantastic.  The plot is lead by an ensemble cast which is absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>The best characters are:<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman-Wolverine has less screen time than in X-Men but is still a focus character.  He is continuing to get answers to his past and he can get them from Stryker (Brian Cox). -Bran Cox as Stryker is evil and he is new to the cast and gets quite a bit of exciting screen time.  Famke Janseen as Jean Grey definately has a upgraded role this time around.  Jean Grey is the lead actress and she has to go through a very emotional time in this film. -Famkee Janseen portrays Jean perfectly and we witness how amazing of a actress Famke is in this film. -Ian McKellan is amazing as Magneto.  He actually *SPOILER* sides with the X-Men team for most of the time. -Rebecca Romjin Stamos also has alot of screen time as Mystique.  Her character helps Magneto through out and we actually see what she really looks like for one scene in the movie. -Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler is fantastic.  Nightcrawler is new to the movie series but he is very developed and caring. -Pyro doesn't have much screen time but he has jaw dropping powers and his character does have one very interesting twist. -Profesor X has a interesting storyline and has to go through a mental journey which is very interesting.<br/><br/>The other characters: -Halle Barry as Storm simply is just marketing material for this film. She is a huge actress but for this film and the last film she has had a throw away part.  She has more to do in this film but still isn't a very memorable character. -Anna Paquin as Rogue definately is a no show through most of the film. All we see is her love story in this film with Iceman (Shawn Ashton). -Shawn Ashton as Iceman does have more screen time this time around but still we only see him for his love story with Rogue. -Kelly Hu as Nightcrawler has 1 line and most of her screen time is based on being in the background.  She however is in the best scene of the film, the fight between her and Logan.  I hope she comes back in the next movie though. -Cyclopse has one scene in the beginning and like two scenes in the end and nothing happens to his character except for a grieving scene.  His character is wasted more than any other character.<br/><br/>As you can see the cast is vast and they can only have so many characters as lead roles.  The characters and plot are bigger and better this time around. This film is a must see!"

","X-Men.  The first one was by far and away the best comic adaptation I've seen for a good long while, but X2 blew me away.  A problem I had with the first movie was the fact that only Wolverine and Rogue had any real character development, but it's been made sure of that everyone (except, for some weird reason, Cyclops) gets more involved roles in the movie this time round.<br/><br/>As if the characters in X-Men weren't cool enough (Toad!!!), the second outing has offered up some really choice mutants.  There's Yuriko Omaya (Deathstrike), who couples good looks with slice-and-dice claws to rival ol' Wolvie's, the flame-controlling Pyro (some pretty decent torn-between-good-and-evil acting from Aaron Stanford) and finally the unbelievably awesome NIGHTCRAWLER!!! The blue-skinned teleporter steals the show with his acrobatics, and it's one of Alan Cummings' best performances undoubtedly.  Then there's the old faves, by which I mean the delicious Halle Berry as Storm, the always-pleasing Ian McKellen as Magneto (the same goes for Patrick Stewart as Professor X) and the brillian Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  I don't know how they found him, but I'm bloody glad they did!"

","I got the chance to see the new x-men during a preview for the journalists. I am also a journalist but working for an internet website.<br/><br/>So what about the movie? Just have to say : WOW! The sequel is better than the first one, that I also like very much. It has excellent scenario, great characters development and of course, spectacular action sequences... but it never loses the emotions and the lyricism that comes from the story. In fact, it is actually very moving... And I don't want to ruin your pleasure talking about the ending...<br/><br/>The new characters (especially The NightCrawler) are great and looks wonderful on the screen. The directing of Director Bryan Singer is the same as the first one and the actions sequences are even better because it has much energy and punch... Don't miss the combat between Logan and DeathStrike!<br/><br/>The movie has also a very interesting message under all the blockbuster and entertainment with reminiscences about politics, socials and war. It can contents all the stuff to fulfill any kind of audience.<br/><br/>For my pleasure, the great composer John Ottman takes the place of Michael Kamen for this sequel and writes a FAN-TA-STIC score... With a large orchestra, chorals and his magnificent direction the music of X2 is both martial and emotionnal... And i don't tell anything about the use of classical music in certain sequences.

"Michael Heide","9","2","3","24 April 2003"," Best Superhero-adaption ever.
","X-Men 2 had everything a comic book adaption needs. A strong story not just rehashing old plots from the comic, great actors and exciting special effects. Plus, it had tons of references to the comics only insiders get (Remy LeBeau and Franklin Richards are mentioned, one Dr. Hank McCoy appears in an interview).<br/><br/>Let's start with the story. I'm trying to keep this mostly spoiler-free. After an assassination attempt on the US President, Vietnam veteran William Stryker appears in the Oval Office, asking to take out a training camp for mutant terrorists. Said training camp is the Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters. Those who watched the first movie or are familiar with the comic books know that this is the headquarters of the X-Men, mutants who protect a world that hates and fears them for being different. The problem is, most of the X-Men are away when he strikes, leaving the mansion (and Cerebro, a device with which you can track every mutant on the planet and, if you are telepathically skilled enough, kill them) vulnerable...<br/><br/>When the first movie was an analogy to the Black Rights movement (with Xavier and Magneto standing for Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, respectively), this is a movie about homosexuals. One mother asks her child if he hasn't tried ""not being a mutant"", and another man demands Professor Xavier ""heals"" his son, a mutant. Nightcrawler asks Mystique why she doesn't blend in with the ""normal"" people, and when she replies that she doesn't think mutants have to blend in, it's clear what this movie is about. People have to accept what they are. No one has to hide because he's different. And the rest has to respect that decision, has to tolerate those who are born different. And this is what makes this movie so important.<br/><br/>While the first X-Men movie featured mainly Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), this one is an ensemble movie. With the single exception of Cyclops, everyone gets their great moment to shine, especially the youngsters (Rogue, Iceman, Pyro) are convincing. Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler is great, but he speaks a horrible German. Well, at least that's true to the comics.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie with a surprising ending, but it leaves me with some kind of dilemma. On the one hand, I want Bryan Singer to continue making movies for the X-Men franchise. But on the other hand, although X-Men 2 is the best superhero-comicbook-adaption ever (beating even Richard Donner's Superman), it's still nowhere near The Usual Suspects..."
"boywithmucharmadillo","8","2","3","24 April 2003"," Big mutated head and shoulders above the original
","I was mildly impressed with the first X-Men, simply because it was a comic movie that didn't completely suck, but its sequel is far better than that. It's impressive because its good. It captures that combination of high end action and meaningful plotline that most action films miss but ones like The Matrix and the original Star Wars capture. X-Men maybe isn't in that league yet, but it's getting there, and the third instalment is already at the top of my hotly-anticipated list.<br/><br/>The big strides X-Men 2 makes are in storyline and characters, with both becoming more complex the second time around, thus injecting a bit of meaning into all the explosions and stuff. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, and whoever the guy is who played Nightcrawler as Nightcrawler are the breakout performances this time around, each being a dominating presence on screen, while Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin and Patrick Stewart are again solid performers. A sweet feature of the sequel are all the little mutant kiddies at the Xavier's mansion, who get to show off their powers, which goes beyond being mere eye-candy to being an enriching touch -- you get a real feeling for the extraordinary nature of the school. In addition to all this heartwarming emotional stuff, of course, are the special effects. They're not as impressive as some perhaps expected, but there are numerous occasions which will knock you back in your seat and say ""W"

","4 May 2003. Mix together a good ending, with numerous weak plotpoints and warmed over cliches for most of the movie, add an attempt with a more serious human relationship element and you have X-2. In one of the most outlandish superhero plot outlines with unbelieveable attacks on the White House, a super-secret prep school, and the easy capture of our superhero gang, X-2 falls victim to plot devices ask to much of the intelligent audience to make us believe this movie. While the movie going audience can suspend their disbelief some of the time, X-2 gives us an attack on the United States President as its beginning opening scene, but come on really must we have to accept how defenseless the President is, how superheros are so easily left defenseless? This sequel really isn't that original for most of its running time. The scriptwriter just really wants play with the audience's mind and screw up the frustration factor until it wants to burst without consider some of the logical elements of the movie.<br/><br/>What really saves this movie is the ending...in one of the more powerful statements of societal responsibility, the climax of X-2 has many of the trappings of other movies, including Indiana Jones and Die Hard, but with a soul. The weaker attempts in X-2 at including the obligatory human dimension are laudable too.<br/><br/>So besides yawning and squirming in the seat from pent-up frustration at how should have happened throughout most of the movie, X-2 barely makes it tolerable by the end."

Not only would most of the original cast come back, we also got a few new faces, including Kelly Hu (of The Scorpion King), Alan Cumming (Boris Grishenko from GoldenEye), and Brian Cox (who first played Hannibal Lecter). They all contributed to a pretty darn good sequel. I was hoping to watch this movie the summer it premiered but never got around to doing so, but I got to watch it that fall and was pleasantly surprised (though there was a spoiler revealed between that aforementioned summer and the following fall, but I won't say what for those of you who haven't seen the movie). Lots more action and plenty of cool characters as befitting the Marvel Comics franchise. It made me interested in the sequel, which did not come out until three years later. But this was the best of the original X-Men trilogy. It's got some fun moments and lots of character development. Nightcrawler, Lady Deathstrike, Iceman, Pyro, and William Stryker are the ones who really steal the show in this movie. Stryker was originally the villain in the X-Men comic book God Loves, Man Kills as a military man turned religious nut. Read that one if you're interested in the back story of this movie.

","'X-men 2 (2003)' is a definite improvement upon the first, making it the rare sequel that surpasses the quality of the original. It's incredibly entertaining because it features visceral action and compelling character depth in equal measure. It's consistently enjoyable, but maintains a layered narrative approach that set its predecessor apart from others in the genre (which was still young at this point). This time, Singer really lets loose with the action sequences and provides some memorable, well-choreographed and genuinely tense scenes far improved from the first. This is perhaps the best film in the series - the main 'X-men' series, that is, as 'Logan (2017)' knocked it out of the park entirely - and ranks among the best in the superhero genre. 8/10"

The movie may seem a little silly for non-superhero fans, but I think any veteran superhero fan will find it enjoyable; it is one of the best superhero films (maybe top 3 when it came out, now it's probably somewhere between 5-10). The film is more enjoyable if you've seen the first, but if you have to watch it without seeing the first, it probably would just seem mediocre. This is because it focuses on developing new characters more, while the story relies on characters developed more in the last film. In addition, the humor does not seem misplaced or overused (one of my problems with current superhero movies). People may not also like how there is not a clear cut protagonist, but I think that's kind of the point (hence the title). All in all, a really enjoyable movie that I definitely recommend."
"Floated2","9","1","1","3 December 2017"," Bigger and Better than the Original
","X2 is an all around bigger and more explosive version of its processor the original X-Men. First, X2 is longer and includes more characters (such as Nightcrawler- who steals his scenes and Pyro- used for some comic relief) which gives them more screen time and is able to create more chemistry and more dimensions for the other mutants. The cast is also more familiar and the bonds are great. The action and overall plot is more enjoyable and entertaining, including more emotion and suspense throughout. We see more details brought in and more explanations about Wolverine's DNA and origin about his claws and genetics. Also Rogue (Anna Paquin) is less of a focus which works better and her acting has improved. <br/><br/>Left with an ending that was an another clear cut sequel ending, the studios and everyone involved had knew this film would become a hit safe keeping a sequel (which was 2006's The Last Stand). Another thing which is an improvement in X2 is the overall character of Wolverine, he's still there talking but now we see more action scenes from him (this time around using his claws more in action and actually killing enemies). Less campy scenes and one liner dialogues including for comedic relief as well. X2 is overall a well directed, acted and thoroughly entertaining film which delivers what is was supposed to do."

","In the 1980s and 1990s, Marvel wasn't the company it has become today: the company teetered on the verge of bankruptcy and they had to auction off the film-rights of its characters ranging from Spiderman, Captain America, The Fantastic Four and The X-Men to film companies that included Sony, Fox, Paramount, Universal and New Line Cinema (oddly Disney didn't have the rights for ANY Marvel characters before buying the company outright in 2009, for $4 billion). Does this film honor its source material? Yes it does.<br/><br/>X-Men 2 is easily one of the finer fruits coming from Marvel's circumstantial deal-brokering and near-bankruptcy in the 80s and 90s. Hugh Jackson, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are the stars of the show here, and they're in a much higher-stakes adventure than the original X-Men. Humans and mutants are on the brink of all-out war with each other (as they always are in these movies), and the X-Men are the arbiters of justice stopping all that chaos from hitting the world.<br/><br/>While the film has become slightly dated with its effects, it's still a good Marvel-yarn and respectable take on everyone's favourite mutants."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","1","5 June 2017"," Started strongly and stays that way
","""X2"" or ""X-Men 2"" is an American (mostly) English-language film from 2003, so this one will have its 15th anniversary next year. It is the second film from the long-running X-Men franchise that culminated in ""Logan"" this year, my favorite film of the year so far still and that one got me curious to check out some of the older films from this series. Watched the very first not too long ago and I liked that one, even if for other reasons compared to this one here. This second film is considerably longer than the first, namely it runs for 2 hours 15 minutes and that's quite a lot. The cast includes many actors that also appeared in the very first and also some from Logan still. But back to ""X2"": Anna Paquin is back too of course, even if obviously far from being as much in the center as she was in the first film. It's not really possible to identify a single character or actor as lead here. It is basically an ensemble performance and it would be interesting to see who has the most screen time. Jackman perhaps? I am not sure. The script is also an ensemble piece as it includes a massive quantity of five writers with one of them being Bryan Singer who also already directed the first film. Sure 135 minutes is very long, but this amount of writers is perhaps still a bit too much. And there were moments when you could talk about too many cooks spoiling the broth. I would say that this applies mostly to the middle part as these 45 minutes were packed with action, but in terms of storytelling it was a bit of a letdown compared to the first 45 minutes, the best part of the movie. The final 45 minutes are somewhere in-between quality-wise.<br/><br/>Anyway, it takes quite a while to understand who the main antagonist is. Early on, it seems as if it may be the character portrayed by Alan Cummings (""The Good Wife""), but that perception changes drastically when we see the antagonist is oh so human only. But he is still powerful enough to convince even Ian McKellen's evil mastermind character to join forces with the good guys. Politics are a major component in here, not only because the President of the United States appears pretty quickly, but yeah, it is once again about tolerance, acceptance and witch-hunt when it comes to mutants. And in the end, it seems as if there are losses for both sides when one major character loses her life apparently, perhaps also to keep the writers from having to elaborate further on love stories in the X-Men universe and (SPOILER) even if I like Famke Janssen as an actress (sure more than Romijn and Berry), it may have been an okay decision. Then again, I see she is back for future films again, so we will see what explanation they will give us for that. So yeah there are pros and cons for this film. It is obviously not on the same level as ""Logan"", but it is still a fairly decent achievement overall and a convincing sequel. I just wish they could have kept the effects-packed second third a bit shorter as it really would have helped the film's focus overall. Nonetheless, what happened in here did actually get me curious about the third film from the franchise. I will make sure to check it out at some point in the coming weeks/months. ""X2"" gets a thumbs-up from me and I recommend checking it out."

Everything from acting, action and story goes bigger but it also makes it better.<br/><br/>Would Recommend.<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart was excellent as Professor X as was Ian McKellen as Magneto. I love the relationship between Charles and Eric and think that it is very well done. Hugh Jackman was born to play The Wolverine and that shines through here. Halle Berry was a good storm as was Rebecca Romjin as Mystique and Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler. Famke Jansen was good as Jean Grey. Brian Cox was amazing as William Stryker as rivals Magneto for my favourite X-Men villain. Stryker's lack of powers made him an interesting and compelling villain and stood out for me in the film. Every character is used to appropriate potential and was used effectively.<br/><br/>The story was great and the doomsday weapon used was very interesting and unique. The twist on the weapon at the end was also great and made the movie more tense. Superb ending with a shocking sacrifice. As much as I loved the way they played around with Wolverine's past, I hate the overwhelming focus on Wolverine in these movies and wish more could be given to other characters.<br/><br/>There were some nice shots but the editing and some poor lighting let the movie down in the cinematography department.<br/><br/>There were some pretty cool and interesting effects.<br/><br/>This movie provided great action and gave justice to all the characters. The oddball attempts at humour fell flat for me but I imagine they may hit for some people.<br/><br/>Personally, I really enjoyed this movie and think it was much better than its predecessor(which was also really good and I recommend). <br/><br/>9/10"

","Bigger, bolder, and more passionate than its predecessor, Bryan Singer's ""X2"" is not only an ideal sequel, but it is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Expanding the canvas of the original film by adding memorable characters and exploring existing characters' mythologies, ""X2"" at once has a larger scale and a more personal set of themes than the earlier ""X-Men."" It is a wholly riveting experience.<br/><br/>Beginning with on attack on the President of the United States, the film starts out quickly and colorfully. ""X2"" wastes no time in setting up a new collection of stakes involving the eventual extermination of mutant kind. The narrative reintroduces favorite characters, sending them off on journeys that will culminate in salvation and sacrifice. The story beats are emotional and archetypal.<br/><br/>The production is as refined as the film's new story. Editing is sharp, and the cinematography is bathed in evocative blues, metal grays, and deep shadows. The film's score is powerful, and the production design blends shiny future tech with derelict power complexes, the clean and streamlined with the classic and textured.<br/><br/>Singer's direction is deft, and his cast is ideal. Characters fill emotional beats only hinted at in the original film in bursts that give the comic book audience all they could want. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine explodes in full berserker glory while giving the film its haunted backbone. Famke Janssen's Jean Grey embodies the power of mutant kind with its potential to destroy and save. Alan Cumming is funny, moving, and soulful as Nightcrawler. He is tortured and human. The film has both great characters and great performers.<br/><br/>Beyond hitting emotional notes, humorous, romantic, and tragic, the film has a thematic depth that only underscores its quality. ""X2"" is about discovering one's true self and embracing it. It is about understanding the power of one's own history. This is a human story wrapped in comic book clothing.<br/><br/>The strength of ""X2"" is that all of its elements, cinematic, thematic, and narrative, come together seamlessly. The film is an epic opera of thrillingly executed drama and exhilarating action. It is a personal, powerful experience that has rarely been rivaled in its genre. It is a superhero film for the ages."
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","1","20 February 2017"," Firing On All Cylinders
","The first X-Men is a fine film but it follows a similar formula than plenty of other comic-book adventures. It felt original and fresh at the time, but it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings as X- Men 2/X2/X2: X-Men United does. In fact, X2 gets better every time I watch it. Exceptionally directed by Bryan Singer with just the right amount of action and timely emotion, X2 is one of the best X-Men films to date.<br/><br/>I'll always contend that the X-Men films are best when Magneto and Professor X aren't necessarily on opposite ends. Magneto has never been a cut and dry villain. There's always a grey area to him, and I think X2 nails that as well as any other X-Men film. Just like in Days of Future Past, he doesn't have an agenda until he's brought back into chaos. This time, the chaos is brought on by none other than William Stryker. Stryker is in charge of the facility which keeps Magneto captive, and is also the one who holds the answers to Wolverine's past. That in itself boasts some fascinating prospects for the film.<br/><br/>But what's more impressive is how well this film once again balances all of its story fighting the ""bad guy"" while also having the ultimate antagonist (humans) feature so prominently in the story. It's not to the extent that the original deals with it (registration act), but at its core you know this film is about humans vs mutants. The two butting heads has always and will always be the way to take the X-Men's story.<br/><br/>We get introduced to a few new mutants, and an extended look at Pyro and Iceman, but it's Nightcrawler that makes the biggest impression. The opening sequence at The White House is known as one of the best comic-book scenes to date, and rightfully so. It's terrifying and thrilling, which doesn't really describe his presence throughout the rest of the film, but it's quite the opening. Iceman is used more as a love interest for Rogue than anything else, but Shawn Ashmore is charismatic enough to verify his presence. Pyro, however, feels like the prototypical kid who was inevitably going to turn on his friends. You never truly believe that he's going to stick it out on the good side.<br/><br/>With much higher stakes than the first film as the human race is at risk, it's no wonder the runtime is significantly longer than 2000's X-Men. There is rarely a second wasted, but having the entire last hour of the film take place at Alkaline Lake was risky. With so many mutants running around, it's easy to find someone to take up screen time, but that's a long time to spend at one particular location. So I can see where it may feel a little long and dragged on by the time we leave the place.<br/><br/>The important thing here is that Singer keeps us on track with the story he wants to tell. It has more action, characters, and surprisingly more heart than I expected. X2 is a triumph on almost every front and set the franchise up for limitless possibilities and adventures. Unfortunately, we all know what happens in X-Men 3.<br/><br/>+Balanced<br/><br/>+Magneto blurring the lines<br/><br/>+Emotionally resonant<br/><br/>+Higher stakes<br/><br/>-Could have done without Pyro<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"generationofswine","10","1","1","20 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","X-Men 2, X2, it's really not the right title is it? At least not for comic book fans. It should have been Weapon X, that is really the story-arc that they were depicting and, honestly, it worked just as well on film as it did in the comics.<br/><br/>Although, I would consider it one of the best X-Men movies, it does have more of a comic book feel that seems a little less serious and more fantasy than then reboots...and that is not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>In other words, not matter how serious the first Singer films get, there is still an element of fun that is hard to really capture in a franchise that is lately trying way too hard to bank on dark and often times failing.<br/><br/>The focus in this is Wolverine.<br/><br/>Was it Steve Jobs that said ""Find out what the people want and then give it to them?"" In any case, that is exactly what they did with X2, just like in the comics, the audience wanted more Wolverine and they gave him to us in X2, an entire plot that revolved as much around him as it did the rest of the team with the promise at the end of more Wolverine to come.<br/><br/>It brings us to the heart of the Weapon X program with a plot that hinted, if vaguely, at the 1990s tumultuous story arc that brought about the Age of Apocalypse and instead promised to continue the franchise with the Dark Phoenix Saga from the 80s.<br/><br/>The movie was great, it was honestly a ton of fun and remains one of the best of X-Men franchise, the set up for the continuation was perfect...unfortunately they switched Captains after X2 and almost killed it entirely.<br/><br/>Now it remains a shining example of what could have been. Even then, this remains that one, if you are only going to see one X-Men movie, make sure it's X2, it sits at the top of the franchise."

This film is the bomb and it is my second favorite film alongside with X-Men, X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: First Class. The effects are a lot of better than in other X-Men movies. The movie itself is great. I liked all of the X-Man trilogy a whole lot, but this one is by far my favorite!<br/><br/>This was the only movie that I watch the last one of the X-Men trilogy, it is really awesome movie. I would say by far the best one of the X-Men movies far way better than First Class, Origins Wolverine, The Wolerine, X-Men and X-Men: The Last Stand, the third X-men movie. My favorite fight scenes were fight between Scott Summers Cylops and Lady Deathstrike the Asian chick. She way played by Kelly Hu, she was really hot. William Stryker played by Brian Cox was fantastic he wanted to find and kill all the mutants by using Professor X. This time Magneto escapes from jail he and Mystique join forces and team together with the X-Men to bring and stop common enemy together. This time battle begins in Canada. After Wolverine left for Canada at the end of the first movie to find answers about his past. Here he did not find anything about his past, in stead of that he found an underground that was Stryker's secret lab for torturing Mutants.<br/><br/>In the first movie the final battle took place on Liberty Island in New York. In the second movie takes place the finale battle in Canada Alkali Lake. The third movie takes place the finale battle in San Francisco Alcatraz. The attack on Xavier school mutants academy was fantastic and how Wolverine killed most of Stryker 's men. Fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was fantastic. This movie was really the best one. Wolverine did defeat Deathstrike at the end. I love this movie. Patrick Stewart is the best Professor Xavier. <br/><br/>One of the best X-Men films ever made and my favorite team one, sorry Avengers but you got nothing on X2. The themes here are so awesome and are perfectly in line with X-Men, the character stuff is fantastic and the action was bad ass. The scene where Wolverines cutting through dudes in the X-Mansion was classic Wolverine. I loved the Nightcrawler in the White House so cool! I wish that I would go in the theater watching this film in 2003, by that time I just wasn't interested watching an X-Men movie, because I didn't understand the first movie, but I do now and It is my favorite superhero film now! I love Wolverine! he is a bad ass! Hugh Jackman is a great actor.<br/><br/>X-Men set the standards far as how a great comic supposed to be. This movie is the best out of the 3. Entertaining, fast paced, great storyline. Even if you're not an X-Men fan you will enjoy this. X2 is the movie X1 should've been. The action, storyline and CGI were all improved. Just an overall better, more complete movie. <br/><br/>I love this film and it is a bad ass film forever!!! <br/><br/>The plot about this film is: The evolution continues in the next thrilling adventure in the X-Men saga.

"oneloveall","5","1","1","29 September 2006"," A little better, but essentially the same
","Decent sequel pulls all the expected punches to topple it's predecessor, albeit in it's fanbase appeasement way. Continuing right where we left off, viewers are pretty much treated to a parallel go-around, although there have been a few noticeable tweaks. Action scenes, while still not nearly as stylish as potential would have, are filmed more fluidly and hold more intrigue then some of the undercooked action of the original. While the film still suffers from it's callous, measured approach, thankfully the cast's principal leads outshine the duller supporting ones. While Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey look and perhaps feel the part, their dry interpretation as usual takes away from some of the excitement, thankfully carried by the core actors. Fans will surely be pleased with a continued focus to bring the Xmen to screen, but casual movie-goers will likely feel indifferent as they enjoy their dosage of eye candy.."
"rparham","8","1","1","5 June 2006"," X2 a sequel worth watching
","After the box-office success of X-Men in 2000, revitalizing the comic book film genre that had fallen on hard times after Batman & Robin successfully chased audiences away, it was inevitable that the X-Men would return in a sequel, and that is precisely what happened with 2003's X2. Director Bryan Singer was back on board, supported by many of the key creatives that ushered X-Men to the screen, and in the process crafted a sequel that was stronger than the original.<br/><br/>X2 opens some time after the conclusion of X-Men, with Magneto (Ian McKellan) held in a plastic prison after attempting to mutate the world leaders on Ellis Island, and things back to semi-normal at the Xavier School for Gifted Children. But things don't last that way for long: there is an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a mutant, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) which gives General William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military official running a special mutant research and development wing of the military, license to crack down on mutants, including raiding the Xavier School.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), has gone searching for some answers to questions about his past, but found very little. Returning to the fold of the X-Men, he goes on the run with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) when Stryker attacks. Stryker kidnaps Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and plans to use his telepathic abilities to destroy all mutants across the globe. Into this fray, Magneto, aided by his shapeshifting associate Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos), escapes, meets up with the still free X-Men and the two groups plan to join forces to assault Stryker's base and stop him from carrying out his plan.<br/><br/>X2 takes most of what was good about X-Men and serves it up again in a much better package. X2 has a noticeably bigger budget, and while impressive special effects are rarely the sole reason to see a movie, when the film calls for it, they help immeasurably. Still, as with X-Men, Singer and company know when to hold back, and X2 is not ruled by it's visuals. Again, the material at the film's heart takes center stage, and this time the combination proves much more compelling.<br/><br/>Essentially, X2 naturally steps up the first film, pushing the plight of the X-Men to the next level and further developing the obvious rift that exists between normal humans and mutants. The film is helped by the introduction of Stryker, a good villain who, while certainly appropriately evil, isn't without his shades of grey. He is a man driven by some dark demons, and while the lengths he goes to are extreme, they are not without some basis in the character's development.<br/><br/>X2 once again falls a little short in one area: character management. The X-Men are a group of characters that have been around a long time and there are so many that it becomes difficult to introduce new ones and not begin overcrowding the film. Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter manage to balance it most of the time, but still you can't help feeling that some of the X-Men are coming up short on screen time and development, robbing the film of some of it's emotional power. When the characters are borderline strangers to you, it is difficult to really feel something for their plight.<br/><br/>One strong point about X2 that improves over the original is the music score. John Ottman's entry is much more memorable and energetic than Michael Kamen's good, but at times restrained score for the first film. The actors are all in good form, with Hugh Jackman proving to be perfect casting again as curmudgeonly loner Wolverine, and Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart always bring touches of class to the material. Brian Cox is good as the maniacal Stryker and Alan Cumming proves memorable as Nightcrawler.<br/><br/>So, X2 proves to be that rarest of beasts: a sequel that is actually better than it's original. X-Men was a proving ground that led the creators to push the boundaries on the sequel and make appropriate improvements when necessary. It's too bad all filmmakers didn't follow their example."
"magratk","8","1","1","5 March 2006"," What I learned from this movie: be kind to people with glowing eyes.
","A wonderful movie about exclusion and alienation. With kick ass fight scenes. <br/><br/>I'm a sucker for superheroes, and this move is crammed with them. And some of the best actors out there: Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen . . . man, I believed. <br/><br/>The kick ass fight scenes did not hurt. <br/><br/>The thing that is so marvelous about the X-Men is how redemptive it is. Many of us who were ever bullied as a child, all of us who have ever been oppressed and exploited want to rise up; want them to crawl at our feet. <br/><br/>But it's not just about revenge fantasies, though the revenge fantasy was a major, major, component of this story. It's surprising subtle story about the line between revenge fantasies and building a just society. <br/><br/>There was a whole lot of stuff going on. I'm no X-Men fangirl, but I've read a comic book now and again (at least the ones written by Joss Whedon) (everyone should read every thing ever written by Joss Whedon, btw) and I'm not sure I would have tracked what happened but for that. <br/><br/>I work for a politician, and I love him. But man, I bought the venality of these political men. <br/><br/>The metaphor of the dam finally breaking . . . wonderful. Cathartic, but also frighteningly Brechtian. The dam has broken, the long leashed waters unloosed, and we all have to live after the flood. Innocent or not. We still have to live in the world created by our ancestors. <br/><br/>One of the best popular major motion pictures ever. Go see it. See it again. Go build a better world afterward."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","1","1","16 March 2004"," By the powers, they actually got it right this time!
","""X-Men"" was a bit of a disappointment to me. Don't get me wrong it was entertaining and fun but it didn't had the right comic book/cartoon feeling to me. ""X2"" is an huge improvement and it really surprised me how good this movie was! One of the surprises of the year!<br/><br/>Advantage of ""X2"" is that it doesn't have to waste time on character introduction because it begins were ""X-Men"" had ended. As a result the action starts right away! And what an action this movie has, the opening attack of Nightcrawler is truly spectacular and an achievement in movie making. The movie has many, many more spectacular fights of which you never get bored and that are all done wonderfully.<br/><br/>But not only the action has improved. Also the character have improved in a major way. Storm and Jean Grey have finally become much more interesting and had a bigger role to play, especially Jean Grey plays an important part this time.<br/><br/>Also the story has improved a lot. It is a much more interesting story compared to the first movie and it actually has the same feeling as the comics/cartoons, something the first movie was also lacking. I also like how they ""teamed up"" Magneto and Mystique with the x-men this time.<br/><br/>Another thing that had improved was the music. I'm sorry to say but Michael Kamen's score for ""X-Men"" was simply not good and didn't fitted the movie. John Ottman's ""X2"" score suits the movie much better and even gives it a more ""superhero"" feeling.<br/><br/>So all in all there are only improvements and there isn't much negative to say.<br/><br/>Great action, great characters, great story, great movie! Bring on part 3...and 4 and 5 and... See it, even if you didn't liked the first one very much, this movie is an huge improvement.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","As one of the newest fans of X-Men, I was very excited for this film to be released.  I had only DISCOVERED the first film about 3 months ago, and was BLOWN away.  Last night, my wife and I attended the late showing and had the WORST MOVIE THEATER experience in our lives.  No air conditioning, noisy crowd, JAMMED seats, spilled concessions, and fat ladies in the row who wouldn't move for us.<br/><br/>Well, in SPITE of our miserable experience, I must admit that X-MEN 2 was one of the BEST summer films in a few years.  This was not just a good film, this was an EXPERIENCE that movie magic is all about. <br/><br/>
Yes, there WERE a lot of characters to focus on, and in order to do that, some of our favorite characters from the first one were sacrificed for newer ones, but even the NEW characters were interresting enough that I could forgive the absence of a few others.  Cyclops got the worst screen time than anyone else, I actually MISSED him in this film.<br/><br/>But in order to develope the new villian, story-lines, and character developements, I thought Brian Singer did OUTSTANDING and gave us MAGIC.<br/><br/>Now, can I wait till the NEXT X-MEN?  I'll just have to see this one a few more times."

"vila_uk","10","1","1","18 April 2003"," X2 review
","I was lucky enough to manage to get a ticket for a screening of X2 at London's Odeon Leicester Square at 10:00 am this morning.  I enjoyed the first film immensely but agreed that there were some flaws in it.  This film however totally blew me away.<br/><br/>I was wondering how they would top the opening of the last film with its clever and dramatic retelling of the Magneto origin but I am pleased to say that they managed to provide a stunning and heart stopping sequence to open the film that will have fans and non fans gasping in delight.<br/><br/>The film is superior in almost every aspect to the first.  All of the characters get extended screen time and seem more settled in their roles. Halle Berry has thankfully dropped the dodgy accent and left us with just a slight twang that works far better than her attempt in the first film.  We see a much more complex side to Storm than before and it works well. Hugh Jackman continues to develop what must be a very challenging role and manages to pull it off with a charm and flair that IS Wolverine.  He, as ever, gets pretty much the most screen time and we get to delve a little deeper into his past.  Alan Cumming's nightcrawker was something I had reservations of before I saw the film, but I can honestly say that he is fantastic.  Every scene he is in he steals and I nearly died of excitement the first time I heard a 'BAMF'.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen is excellent in the film, her character Jean Grey is used very well indeed and fans will be pleased to see how Jean develops in this movie.<br/><br/>The effects are superlative.  No dodgy glowing white balls of energy this time.  All powers are rendered superbly and are used very well indeed. The set pieces are mind-blowing and received rounds of applause in the cinema, something I am not used to seeing over here in Britain.  I can't wait to see this film again and it is a definite must for my DVD collection.  Now I only have to wait for the third instalment."

"crowrobot","10","3","6","19 July 2005"," The rare sequel that is better than the original...
","Sequels are simultaneously the joy and the banality of Hollywood. They're fun because we see favorite characters again, and they're banal because all too often they repeat their predecessor. 'X2' is an improvement over the already good 'X-Men', and it's a great comic-book film.<br/><br/>I prefer to leave plot details to writers, so let's get down to the cast. Hugh Jackman, I don't care what you say about his other movies, IS Wolverine. Every time I read the comic book now, I hear his voice. He's intense, animalistic, brutish, but he also has a sweeter side that too many action heroes don't have. Jackman pulls all of this off spectacularly, and I love him in this role. James Marsden is criminally underused, but he's not bad. Famke Janssen is oh-so-lovely as Jean Grey, and Halle Berry does a nice job as Storm. I liked Rogue (Anna Paquin), and her relationship with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) is all the more heartbreaking because it's not forbidden love, it's a love that can never blossom. Patrick Stewart radiates authority as Xavier, as does Ian McKellen as Magneto. Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is sexy as Mystique, and I liked her ""real"" cameo (you'll know it when you see her).<br/><br/>My favorite characters are the new ones: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a blue-skinned German teleporter who is deeply religious. Cumming pulls off the humor and pathos of his character well, and he has some nice scenes with Halle Berry. Kelly Hu does the silent killer thing as Lady Deathstrike. She, like Wolverine, has an adamantium skeleton and she has claws that come out of her fingernails. Wolverine's response? ""Holy sh**!"" That throwdown is a film highlight. Brian Cox is the villain of the piece, William Stryker, a man who wants revenge on all mutants. Cox exudes evil here, and he adds another fantastic notch to his belt. I also liked Aaron Stanford as Pyro, and I want to see more of him in the next movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are bigger and badder this time around, and director Bryan Singer actually makes CGI look cool. The script gives everyone their moments in the sun, and the acting is great. 'X2' is yet another film in the steadily increasing line of great comic book movies."
"theclash_classicrock","9","3","6","27 June 2005"," The best comic book movie so far! (although I am biased)
","I love comic books. Ever since I was a little kid I would watch the TV cartoons with my brother, and read his old comic books. X-Men has always been my favorite, and, of course, Wolverine was always my favorite character. <br/><br/>I understand there were a few things ""wrong"" with this movie. For example, Lady Deathstrike's background was not explained at all. But, overall I think they handled this movie wonderfully. I adored the first X-Men, but I absolutely LOVED this one. I think X-Men is probably a more difficult comic book movie to tackle because of all the characters. One must try and develop several heroes as apposed to just one or two. I think, for the most part, they did a wonderful job with this. <br/><br/>A lot of people complain that too much time is spent on Wolverine, and not the other characters. However, this is the correct way to go. Wolverine is, by far, the most popular of all the X-Men, so in order to appeal to the masses they must focus on him. He also has a more complicated and interesting past than most of the others. He is probably the closest one can get to a ""main"" character in X-Men. Wolverine, is probably going to get his own Spin-off movie, so this might help. I think Hugh Jackman (apart from his height) is the perfect Wolverine. Anyone who thinks he overacts this part obviously knows nothing about Wolverine or the X-Men series.<br/><br/>I would, however, like to see more time spent on Storm. I would also like to see Rogue get the rest of her kick-ass powers so she can start kicking people's asses, as she is supposed to do. Personally, I would like to do away with Iceman, Jean Gray, and Cyclops altogether, but I have never been a fan of theirs. But, I know that isn't possible. :P To be fair, they did a great job portraying their characters, and I know the story wouldn't be near as interesting without them. (I was pleased to find out that Cyclops will probably be getting a smaller role in X3 because the actor is also filming Superman around the same time. *wink*) Everyone else, I am pretty satisfied with. I have been happy to hear that Halle Berry will probably not be seen in the next installment (personally, I think this ""I'm too good for you"" Oscar brat needs to get out of this picture). Unfortunately, Alan will not be returning either, and neither will Nightcrawler (at least that is what I have heard). However much I like Nightcrawler he is not really a primary character, so maybe this move will be okay. I would really like to see Gambit and Beast in X3! <br/><br/>I think that covers the good guys. :)<br/><br/>As for the bad guys, I can never argue with Ian McKellen. He is the perfect Magneto, and I was pleased to hear that they will be doing a spin-off on Magneto as well. He is my second favorite character. I find him very fascinating as well, and I think he deserves a film about him as a young man. Mystique, was great as well. I like how they started to intertwine her feelings for Logan. I think Pyro was sufficiently evil, and he will be a joy to watch in the next movie. Stryker was also great and he built a lot of tension to Wolverine's story. I saw recently that the girl who played Lady Death Strike has signed on for X3, which makes me believe that they may explore her past and who she is in relation to Wolverine. Exciting!<br/><br/>I can't wait for X3! I think the X-Men series has been the greatest of any comic book movie series, but then again, I am partial. Still, it is worth seeing! :)"
"swax","2","3","6","17 July 2003"," When will people realize that marvel makes lousy movies?
","I would consider writing a long and complex analysis of this film since I generally hate to review. However, I just can't bring myself to conjure up the mind numbing images of the movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't understand why everyone feels that X2 is vastly better than it's predecessor. They are the same movie. Let's get that down. All of marvel's movies are the same. They are horrific misuses of once dynamic characters rehashed into<br/><br/>personality-free clones.<br/><br/>X2, like all other marvel movies thus far, also suffers from the Neo phenomenon. My major complaint about reloaded was that Neo, who was at least a little bit fallable in The Matrix can now be thrown into brick walls at hundreds of miles an hour with no sweat. When this happens, there is no suspense. The hero of X2 is arguably Wolverine and thanks to the blatant misuse of his regernative powers in the movie (in the comic regeneration is a longer, more arduous process) he is genuine carrier of the Neo phenomenon. Surely, this is what many films are like, but it is one of many problems with X2.<br/><br/>This movie also has a total lack of compelling characters. Everyone is either completely undeveloped or a total cliche`. The acting prowess of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Brian Cox is utterly wasted on their poorly conceived and forgettable characters while the other characters meander through this waste of time twidling their thumbs and generally carrying on.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is just another glitzy schlock movie like The Core or Jurassic Park 3. Marvel is most certainly 0/5 (no, spiderman was not at all good and Ang Lee's presence does not make the Hulk an artistic triumph). 2/10 (I'm being generous)."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","6","3 May 2003"," Good fun, but where is X-3 heading?
","Spoilers<br/><br/>Since the release of X-men in 2000, quite a few of the members in the original cast have attained more prominent recognition, although not yet comparable to the status eventually reached by the cast of The Magnificent Seven. Halle Berry (Storm) an Oscar, albeit undeservedly. Ian McKellen (Magneto) gained worldwide recognition from his portrayal of Gandalf in Lord of The Rings. Rebecca Romijn-Syamos (Mystique) has made her mark in her alluring double role in Femme Fatale. Anna Paquin (Rouge) got considerable exposure, albeit in supporting role, in Almost Famous and Finding Forester (even if her achievement in ""The piano"" might have been forgotten).<br/><br/>The discarded duo of Toad and Sabretooth from X-1 is amply replenished in X-2. Of the newcomers, I particularly like Nightcrawler, with his fascinating persona of religious good guy cum exotic outsider. Visually, he makes a perfect pair with Mystique, for obvious reasons. Most stunning is the visual interpretation of his teleporting feats, fruit of a perfect marriage of creative imagination and superb techonology.<br/><br/>The new pair of Fire and Ice gets only an introductory exposure but will obviously fuel the main plot in X-3. In conjunction, Rouge gets disappointingly little screen time, particularly in comparison with the key role she had in X-1. Disappointing it may be, the strategy is understandable. The new teenage triangle is to be saved for X-3 while in the meantime, the old triangle of Wolverine, Jean and Cyclops has to be sorted out first in X-2.<br/><br/>Somewhat wasted is black belt holder Kelly Hu's Yuriko. Again the strategy is clear. Yuriko is introduced specifically as a villain in X-2 and is not going to stay around as a member of the mutants. Therefore, it would not be cost-efficient to devote any footage to developing her character, particularly when there are already too many characters to cover.<br/><br/>As the temporary alliance with Magneto ends, we can look forward to resumption of the good old confrontation in X-3. Wolverine will likely continue to be the central character but as the attraction in the searach for his origin is beginning to wear thin, new elements may need to be brought in. Dr. Jean Grey did not really die, as comic fans told me, and will come back. Cyclops however may receive even less attention in X-3 than the pitiably little coverage he has in X-2. As mentioned, the teenage triangle will take a more prominent position. The fate of Nightcrawler, together with that of the earlier members, still remains to be seen. Magneto's camp needs some reinforcement in addition to the fiery guy he just picked up. Hopefully, there will be some wonderful new surprises.<br/><br/>As to X-2, it delivers what I purchased my admission ticket for. In addition to the teleporting I mentioned, there are two things I particularly enjoyed, and they both come from Magneto. The idea of infusing the jailer's blood with an overdose of iron for Magneto to manipulate is ingenious. Annihilating a whole group of soldiers by simply removing the safety pins in their grenades via magnetic influence is also pretty clever. Great fun. Marvellous movie."

I've seen X-Men 1, it was a great superhero movie (much better than Spiderman, anyway), good story, nice effects, etc. You won't find any of that in this sequel: most scenes are dark, sometimes it's hard to see who does what. There is hardly any action scenes, but the ones there are not exciting at all. Usually I like good action movies, but I was yawning all the time - I'm a movie fan, so that's a bad sign.

The first 30 mins of the movie move along rather well and have some nice special effects, but that is where the fun stops.  The last hour is so drawn out and boring that I and my co-watcher were nodding off at times.  The plot is bad, and the script is poorly written.  Can anyone answer me these 2 questions?  (1) Why is it ok to kill off goverment soldiers, but it is not Ok to kill police officers? For some reason no police officers were hurt during the filming of this movie, there faces however were covered in soot from exploding cars 1ft from them.  Meanwhile army special ops soldiers were gutted left and right with no limbs spared.  (2) Why can this band of mutants accomplish incredible feats time & time again without fail, but when faced of the task of trying to avoid a wall of water closing in on there location with 30 mins to act the best solution they can come up with is to sit in a broken down state of the art 'mutant' jet (which for some reason has no ejection seats) and look dumbfounded? WTF? And people are raving about this pile of junk.  The damn teleportin' crawler could have teleported them all 1 by 1 to a nearby mountain top in 5 secs. Nice script writing.

"TheLittleSongbird","8","2","4","24 July 2014"," Better than the first film
","Not that the first film was bad, because actually I still found it good, well-made fun for all its flaws. It's just that whereas the first X-Men film did feel like the beginning of a franchise that was yet to properly find its feet, it was found with X2. X2 isn't perfect either but still a very good film that is bigger and darker than the first and all the better for it. Again X2 is very well-made, with the dark visual style still maintained yet with a slightly grander look. The photography is beautiful and atmospheric, and the special effects are better here too, they were good in the first that they're slicker, bolder and eye-popping in the way that the first film didn't quite but almost did achieve. Whilst Michael Kamen's score in the first was fine, John Ottman's score here is an improvement being more in tune with the atmosphere and what's happening in the story. <br/><br/>The script is even sharper here and with more depth, the humour and comic one-liners are witty and genuinely funny, they are not cheesy or out-of-place nor are they too much. There is a melancholic tone too that is dark and quite poignant and the romantic elements are sweet but never too soap-opera-ish. The story is where the darker and bigger terms most apply, apart from a couple of parts that could have slowed down and explained themselves more you are glued to your seat almost the entire time and emotionally connect with scenes and characters too. The assault on the White House sequence is exciting and a brilliant way to start the film, and it is true that the climax here puts the climax of the first in the shade, it's not contrived in the slightest and you are biting your nails. X2 does a great job mostly with the characters, where they are more complex and relatable. <br/><br/>Although once again Storm and Cyclops are underdeveloped, otherwise Wolverine is a gritty and identifiable anti-hero, and of the other characters Nightcrawler was most effective. Though once again credit is due for making Magneto much more than a stereotypical villain. X2 is very well played by the cast, with the standouts being Hugh Jackman's charismatic Wolverine, Ian McKellen's menacing Magneto with shades of melancholy, Alan Cumming's camp yet affecting Nightcrawler and Brian Cox who plays Stryker with relish without falling into cliché territory. Also good are Rebecca Romijin-Stamos who continues to be sexy and icy, and her transformation sequences are among the visual highlights of the film and Patrick Stewart still is cool and fun though his screen time should have been longer. <br/><br/>Only three cast members don't quite work, and they were James Marsden who's even stiffer than he was in the first(not helped by his character not been used as well as he could have been), Halle Berry who looks bored and Shawn Ashmore does look awkward at times. Other than a couple of rushed, under-explained parts, a couple of characters given short shrift and a couple of performances that didn't quite make the grade the film is a touch overlength, but the film on the whole is very good and lots of fun in its own right.

","X-2 is one of those rare sequels that outshines the original. I liked the original X-Men. While it was good, X-2, X-Men United is superb. It picks up where X-Men left off. Logan (Wolverine) is returning from his quest to discover his origin. Meanwhile, a new Mutant, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) makes at attempt on the President's life. Enter Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who vows to stop the Mutants for good. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) asks for Dr. Jean Grey (Fahmke Jansen) and Storm (Halle Berry) to find this new mutant. Meanwhile, he must consult with his old nemesis, Eric Lynch, or Magneto (Ian McKellan). Dr. Xavier and Cyclops, aka Scott Sommers (James Masden) are captured by Stryker. At the same time, a hit squad goes after the young Mutants at Dr. Xavier's school. Barely escaping are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Rogue (Amanda Paquin), Iceman, and Pyro. Then, Magneto escapes with the help of his co-hort, Mystique (Rebecca Rojmin Stamos). The plot may seem labyrinth, but it works well, again showing why Marvel superheros always outdid DC Comics. In the first place, Mavel characters are reluctant heroes, often having a downside to their power. Rogue can never touch another human being, isolating herself from others. Cyclops can never look at someone with his own eyes. Second, the Marvel superheroes are thrust into the real world. People fear them, hate them, and want them relegated to the fringe of society. The movie also goes deeper, cutting into society and their reaction to the Mutant ""threat."" In X-Men, the villain was Bruce Davison who plays a Senator reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy who used the Red Scare in the 1950's to alienate his enemies as ""Communists."" In X-2, the villain is Stryker. He does not want to use politics, he just wants to eradicate the Mutants--more like Slobodan Milosovec. The movie also takes the end of the struggle for equity. In both movie, it seems Dr. Xavier has the idealism and hope of Dr. Martin Luther King, whereas Magneto is a separatist who strikes back like Malcom X. Laced between the depth is a good-paced story with credible acting, good action sequences, and special effects that do not overshadow the story. The performances are another praise. James Marsden actually does a decent acting job as Cyclops. Ian McKellan is able to make the audience sympathize with Magneto, despite the character's cynicism and dubious methods. Brian Cox also does well as the real heavy. For a change, the villain is not over the top or a megalomaniac. He is the true, subtle type of evil--convincing himself he is doing society good. Rebecca Rojmin Staimos does her acting with her moves and stare--emitting a subtle, yet powerful evil. On the other hand, Alan Cummings gives us a Mutant who not only has a love of life, but also a faith that does not come off as self-righteous or preachy. X-2 may lack a beginning, middle, and end, but it works so well as a great superhero movie."

","I've decided to re-comment on this movie as I for some reason unknown to me, decided to sit down and watch it all over again.<br/><br/>This surpasses the first film and explores other characters; Bryan Singer does his best to stay close to the comics but there are big errors....Yet this movie still thrills a hardcore fan....Just about...<br/><br/>This film carries on after the first, Magneto is in his plastic prison and is regularly visited by General Stryker who has a way to make mutants co-operate...Brainwashing them with a serum. Rogue is now dating Bobby the Iceman while Jean is having troubles with her power and Cyclops feels unloved. And Wolverine returns from his 'soul-searching' adventure to find out a mutant has attacked the President. With the Jean, Storm, Cyclops and Charles Xavier away and Wolverine babysitting the mansion is attacked by the US Government.<br/><br/>Now Wolverine is thrown in a 'unwanted' role as a leader and protector, he slices and dices through the intruders and rescues a few....And now its time to face the past and make a new future...<br/><br/>I loved Wolverines berserker rage as he unleashes hell on the soldiers that decide to walk into his house and threaten his 'family'...I loved Hugh Jackman's fight scenes at second glance. On second glance I found many things endearing, like Jean and Cyclops deteriorating relationship, Nightcrawler's scenes especially his own self-introduction, the bonding scenes with Storm and Nightcrawler; but something I found very sad was the use of Cyclops, loved his fight scene but then he gets cut out, he should have been given a more pivotal role and Lady Deathstrike should been a main villain.<br/><br/>All in all a nice comic book movie."

","When we left the X-Men in the first movie, Magneto was caught and placed in a plastic prison and Wolverine was leaving Professor Xavier's school for mutant children in a search for answers to his past. We are now re-united with the X-Men in the second film of what looks to become a series in `X2: X-Men United.' 	This is the first of many sequels due out during the 2003 summer box-office season. One thing may make this film stand out among every other sequel this summer-the fact that it's very good. In fact, `X2: X-Men United' is the rare case in which a sequel didn't follow the conventional clichéd patterns that so many sequels do by rehashing everything the first film; thus, the reason why sequels are generally inferior movies when compared to their predecessors. 	The story centers on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seeking clues to his past-an experiment that left his skeleton covered in a very strong metal. And of course, this metal makes his character more deadly considering the fact that he has blades that protrude from his knuckles whenever he senses danger. But things change for all mutants when a mutant assassin named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), tries to kill the president in protest of a Mutant Registration Act.' This attempt only increases the fear that many have for the mutants and leads a military leader named William Stryker (Brian Cox) to lead a campaign against the mutants, beginning with Professor Xavier's school. It's now up to all mutants, be they friend or foe, to unite against an enemy that could eliminate all mutants. 	It's clear that director Bryan Singer (`Apt Pupil,' `The Usual Suspects') had more freedom in the production. The film is longer than the first film by about 30 minutes. What's more, it isn't as flashy as the original film. Point in fact; it is a far darker tale that leaves its central characters in the worst possible situation, a rule that is often ignored in sequels or trilogies. 	I did like the fact that this film united all mutants, putting aside their differences in an attempt to save their race. After seeing the first `X-Men,' I felt that there were some gaps in the dialogue, and the film quickly moved from one scene to the next. But that complaint was minor, as the first film was rather impressive. Nonetheless, `X2' is more than a worthy sequel; filled with great action sequences along with impressive visual effects that it doesn't rely on to tell the story, it's arguably better than the first film. Patrick Stewart (`Conspiracy Theory') returns as Charles Xavier, as does Ian McKellen (`Gods And Monsters') as Magneto. Anna Paquin (`25th Hour') returns as Rogue who takes Iceman's breath away, played by Shawn Ashmore. Aaron Stanford (`Tadpole') ignites the screen as Pyro. Dr. Jean Grey, played by Famke Janssen (`Goldeneye') tries to avoid temptation with Wolverine, while Scott Summers, played by James Marsden (`Gossip') tries to control his temper with Wolverine. And of course, the X-Men wouldn't be complete without Storm, played by Halle Berry (`Monster's Ball'), around to wreak havoc.<br/><br/>	 Released on what has become the typical starter weekend of the summer box-office, `X2' looks to become a huge smash hit with early weekend estimates predicting the film to make nearly $86 million in nationwide ticket sales.  It's not as large as last year's magnanimous opening weekend for `Spider-Man,' which made $114 million, but it is doubtful that Twentieth Century Fox will be complaining much about the success of the film.<br/><br/>`X2: X-Men United' is a true blockbuster that is a real crowd-pleaser in which it is difficult to find something to criticize. ***"

While it did deliver on most of the characters, i certainly agree the nightcrawler and wolverine sequences were spectacular, i thought there were too many plot holes.<br/><br/>the kindof 'the cell' sequence with professor x at the end was well done and very spooky but i didn't feel like it fit. it was very heavy. on the other hand magento's recruitment of pyro was trite. pyro reminded me of anakin in epII, a whingy little arrogant crapster, hollywood needs to get more sorted out about what turns people to evil - i think they should be just driven and passionate and cunning like magneto himself, or oppressed and exiled like mystique. spoiled childs are evil but not because they choose to be.<br/><br/>i never really read or watched the comic, so i don't have any expectations for the characters. thus i didnt really care that cyclops was missing, although he could be a lot more useful than he has been so far. but storm seems like such a lame duck, they have to come up with the most contrived excuses to use her.<br/><br/>anyway i can't say i wasn't impressed. go and have a look. but don't expect no1 again."

","A lot has been said about this movie, as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. While I truly respect everyone's opinion, I really don't see the point in some criticisms brought up against this movie.<br/><br/>(Definitely NO spoilers ahead.)<br/><br/>First of all, we must realize that X-men comics have been around for decades. They existed before many of you were born. Still, the producers had to assume that the average audience had little or no idea about the mutant phenomenon, but Bryan singer did a very good job (as always) in the first film, and introduced the audience. Besides, adapting such a story with so many characters to the screen is no easy job, and is also risky, considering it's Hollywood and it must return all those millions. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained, the characters and their abilities introduced, and the plot (which actually had a story, unlike many action flicks) was carried out smoothly. All in the running time of one film. good job.<br/><br/>The second film, however, had to concentrate (naturally) on more characters and a more thorough story. This is why I object (in the title) to people criticising this film for ""lack of character development"" etc. Many of the characters WERE developed in the first film. If you never read x-men comics, and did not even see the first movie, and see this one right away and still expect the director/writer to spell things out for you, well, you'll be disappointed. ""Where did Colossus take the kids during the attack?"" someone asked. To hide them somewhere, THAT'S where he took them. I don't think people would like to see the director spell out everything, such as Colossus' inner voice saying, ""Well, let me take these kids somewhere beneath this multimillion dollar facility, to hide them from the bad guys.""<br/><br/>And the newly-introduced characters were introduced well enough. You see their abilities, you see whose side they're on, you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. What else do you need to learn? Which team he supports?<br/><br/>The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes, very well done.<br/><br/>The movie had many shortcomings, of course, the pace slowed down more than once, some main characters, especially Cyclops, were almost lost, but the plusses were way more than minuses. Especially Nightcrawler, who almost stole the lead from Wolverine. I must also add that Wolverine is much more violent in this film than the first, much more like the original comic character.<br/><br/>As for the people who complain about the abundance of characters. Well, bad news for you. X-men is not a story of a couple of guys and their girlfriends. There are much more characters, hopefully to be seen in the next sequel(s). Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus were all hinted in this one. Though I'm eager to see Gambit also, I can't wait to see how they will do the Beast. Of course, I can see the ""no character development"" people asking each other, ""Who is Beast?""<br/><br/>In short, this movie does what it's supposed to do: Gives us entertainment, and shows us our favorite characters on screen."

It just worked perfectly.<br/><br/>The X-Men are forced to join forces with their enemy Magneto to battle a tremendous threat to them all when William Stryker and his son kidnaps Charles Xavier to fulfill his diabolical scheme against all mutants in the entire world. During the chase we learn more about the origin of Wolverine without solving it completely, leaving room for future installments which is also quite obvious with the ending.<br/><br/>Some of these settings are actually very eerie and atmospheric helped on by the power of most performances. One in particular is Christopher Lee as the imprisoned Magneto after his capture in the first movie, he just gave me the chills. Another highlight is Brian Cox and Michael Reid MacKay as William Stryker and his son Jason respectively. Stryker is just diabolical and Jason, even though he never utters a word, is powerful in his own right.<br/><br/>Many good action scenes and effective moments of suspense, because you don't want it to end in tragedy for anyone.

","I've often held that the sequel of a superhero film is better than the original. Most superhero film franchises start out with an origin story, so by the time the second film comes around, all the ""exposition"" is out of the way and the heroes can really take on some powerful villains. However, since X-Men (2000) didn't have much of an origin story, its sequel, X2 is almost relegated to the fate of a ""flashback"" sequel. Still, the darker tone does help set it apart from its predecessor, which is nice.<br/><br/>Granted, the choice of exploring Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) past was a good one, considering the strength of the character. Heck, he got two more movies outside the main X-Men saga, so clearly he's a fan favorite. What's nice about the superhero sequel is that most comic book story arcs are short enough that they can be incorporated into a single film. In this way, X2 could almost stand by itself, much like its predecessor could. In fact, X2 almost follows the same formula as X-Men by not actually delving too deep into any single character's origin story. All the supporting characters are useful and relevant, which is important for a series that relies on the teamwork of a group of mutants.<br/><br/>This film also mostly avoided the trope I like to identify as ""the trilogy conundrum"". Because it could stand alone as its own film, especially for those already familiar with the characters and premise, there isn't a need for it to be a cliffhanger to motivate people to see the third film in the trilogy. If you can ignore the glow in the water at the end of the film, it hardly has much of a connection to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) at all.<br/><br/>Pretty good as far as first sequels go, I give X-Men 2 3.5 stars out of 5."

","Bigger, better, bolder and quite simply brilliant. Not only is this the best 'X-Men' instalment, and yes I'm controversially including 'Logan' as well, but one of the best superhero films of all time. Now that the foundations have been built from its predecessor, Singer is able to build upon the relationships within the mutant world to create an infrastructure that boasts impeccably executed action and dark twists. A genocidal colonel leads an assault on Xavier's school so that he can build his own version of Cerebro, capable of destroying every mutant on the planet. What really makes this film claw its way above the rest, is its various storylines. The primary plot being the prevention of Stryker's Cerebro, one that allows Cox to be an enigmatic and memorable villain. Enabling the X-Men to unite and develop their relationships even further without being detrimental to the main story. This includes Jean Grey's uncontrollable powers, Rogue and Iceman's romance, Pyro's hatred for humans (although slightly underdeveloped) and Nightcrawler's Catholicism. Lesser subplots that give life to these characters, preventing them from being wooden superheroes. Singer's balance between each subplot was near perfect, with the focus still being on Wolverine and his attempts at finding solace. This ensemble cast contains an array of captivating performances, particularly Jackman, Stewart, McKellen and Cox, that allow their characters to be investing. The action sequences limit the amount of visual effects and create some well choreographed scenes, especially when Wolverine battles Lady Deathstrike. I do take issue with the underwhelming ending, forcing a sacrifice upon a character just to quantify a sequel (to which they easily could've survived). This then results in the concluding ten minutes losing that sharp pacing. Oh, and Paquin still can't act. Still, this sequel achieves that rare feat by bettering its predecessor by a substantial margin. Just a shame that the franchise peaks on the second film..."

The reason is simple: in those movies, we get into the skin of the protagonist, whether it's nerdy Peter Parker or bumbling Clark Kent. In X-Men and its sequel, there are simply too many heroes running around. Unless you're a fan of the comic book series, you need a cheat sheet to keep them all straight. Having said that this is an impressive sequel with some standout sequences and for any fan of Superhero films in general this one is an unmissable film."
"filmtogo","8","0","0","5 June 2018"," Better than the first one
","Such a great sequel to the 2000 original X-Men. Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming has a fantastic opening sequence and an equally good ""recruiting"" moment with Storm and Jean Grey. Every X-Men (Rogue, Iceman and Pyro joining the team) has his or her moment and their mutant powers are in different ways important for the story. Stryker - the bad guy - is used and played very viciously. Magneto becomes the ""Loki"" of the story. He and Mystique have to join forces with the X-Men to stop Stryker but at the same time they scheme their own diabolical plan. Once again Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan show what they can do just with their mimics. Strongest players in this game. Sad - very sad - that the third part of this original trilogy was not as good as any of the past and future X-Men movies. This could've been a nearly perfect trilogy."

","Remember the significant problem of Marvel movies being not great, but awful in the 70s, 80s, 90s. Well, Bryan Singer did go and make marvel movies great. But there's still a problem: they're definitely good, but not great. I've got to honestly say, I've never really seen a perfectly good marvel movie except the avengers and spider-man 2. Well, i really liked avengers 2 but that was because of its plot warning people about not doing a intelligent machine. But just like with marvels greatest movie franchise the x-men, there's still the trouble of "" just good, but not great"" . There are good things in the movie , like the way it shows mutants not as all powerful, non-trouble having godlike mutants, but as normal people, who also have their own big problems. And there's definitely a joy in seeing the battle between lady death-strike and wolverine.<br/><br/>But as i already told , its not really great and no matter how big the joy is, its still not so good to have 10 out of 10. After all, the humanity thing is already sawed and have to say its really not smart to make the end into the movies best sequence. The movie must be an altogether piece that goes better and better and sometimes before the end stays into the same piece it is. But here it seems like Bryan Singer is letting the movie to be in the whole same level making the end the movies best sequence. Thats the only reason why I'm giving the movie this rating."

"sam_smithreview","8","0","0","17 May 2016"," X-men great Sequel for fans
","They've done a great franchise justice, to not let the fans down. That's my response to Singer's X-Men films; they're slick, funny, emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations, X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Admirably, the film allows the majority of its characters a genuinely engaging story-line amongst the bigger picture, and although the story is not without its fault (using Cerebro as a major plot point two films in a row is like building the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi; been there, seen it before) it is certainly worthy of high praise. It's amazing that in just two films we already have a real appreciation for the relationships between such a considerable group of characters, and it is for the continued development of these relationships - and not the cool story line and action sequences - that makes me look forward to another X-film.<br/><br/>I would love to say that it's the casting that makes the films so brilliant - and it's true, the casting is great - but a couple of these characters have been woefully miscast. Iceman stood out for me, bringing an uncomfortable Backstreet Boy vibe to the role, and although his role in X2 is small, James Marsden just doesn't seem to have it in him to hold a commanding and authoritative position among the X-men as Cyclops. In the first X-Men film he managed to at least stand beside the Wolverine with some great gags, but he's been left in the gutter for X2, and in the single scene toward the end of the film where Marsden is allowed to genuinely act, his emotional response feels awkward and forced. I am sure he is capable of more than this, and hopefully when X-Men 3 comes around he'll have more to work with. I've never been happy with Halle Berry as Storm, and she looks bored out of her skull in this film. I hope not to see her return.<br/><br/>Thankfully, most of Singer's new cast are admirable. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. In fact, Alan is the only actor in the film who comes close to matching the quality of Jackman's Wolverine and McKellen's Magneto. These wonderful actors all appear to genuinely revel in portraying their characters. Janssen steps her performance up a notch too and it helps the film no end. I really hope to see her in the next film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there are just a few slip-ups here in an otherwise classy and supremely entertaining film. With such an established canon of characters everyone is going to have their own opinion on how particular character should be portrayed, and for the most part X-2 does the job. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out and we'll see a sequel of equal or greater quality in a few years. I'm certainly excited at the prospect."
"tankace","8","0","0","16 April 2016"," The best of the original X-men trilogy
","X2 is easily the best of the original X-men trilogy. OK to be better from the Last Stand does not mean much, but from the first X-men which was consider before 2002 one of the best superhero movie is saying something. Also what makes it, in my point of view ones of the best comic book movies, is the fact that unlike the other two of the trilogy, even today with much better superhero flicks ,like the Dark Knight trilogy and the MCU still holds up and can stand in, at least, decent terms with this two mega-blockbuster-Francaise. To write down now about the flick itself, the plot is amazing ,the action is well executed and the characters here are even more likable than its predecessor. For example the best aspects is the fact that Wolverine here has to make a choice about him as a person and the older students by the end have become part of the team. Those 2 story lines perfectly capture the essence of the X-men, which are the fight for human rights and though diversity and straggle a group of people becomes more than a team,they become a family. All in all it is a great film and has aged really well. Just for the record I wrote this review in order to get all as many users of IMDb excited for the X-men Acocalypse ,which will come out this spring. Fingers crossed ,I believe that the director and the actors will justify us with a great finale of that trilogy."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","0","0","6 April 2016"," One of the all time best superhero films
","1. Sitting firmly atop my Mount Rushmore of superhero films, X2 fixes my only gripe with the first X-Men (cheesy acting) and maintains the wonderful themes and heart that made it so good. Toad and Sabertooth are gone and replaced by Brian Cox and Alan Cumming. What a trade.<br/><br/>2. Ian McKellen continues to be in his element here. Even when prisoner to the US Government, he walks a fine line between being beaten and still being proud and strong. He comes across almost like a Mandela-esque figure for his movement (violence notwithstanding). Magneto's revenge on Stryker at the film's end is so subtle you might even forget about it, but you can hear the venom in McKellen's voice as he leaves the man to die. <br/><br/>3. Brian Cox is literally one of the best film villains ever. He is as slippery as an eel but when he gets worked up he almost channels Paul Giamatti in that great guttural yell. Every word that drops softly from his lips makes the film better. His Frankenstein/Monster relationship with Wolverine acts as a wonderful arc for the latter.<br/><br/>4. Cox is best in show, thanks in part to his properly written motivations. With modern X-Men films tending towards silly mutant villains like Sebastian Shaw and by the look of it, Apocalypse, brilliantly written characters like William Stryker are becoming a thing of the past. In many ways, X2 is the smartest of the X-Men films because of its intricate political maneuvering and the way the characters frame each other. Were it not for the protagonists, I could very easily believe Stryker caused a state of emergency where all mutants were detained illegally. Some would see that outcome possible in the current Muslim-fearing world.<br/><br/>5. The rest of the cast do great work as well. Jackman is a complete animal as Wolverine in some of the most dramatic scenes, but he has a great sense of comedic timing that Singer gets just right. The death of Jean is some of the best acting he has ever done as this character. Paquin has changed from a child to a young woman, and new confidence holds her up but she still keeps that innocence in the scenes where she is out of her league. The best addition to the cast is an amazing Alan Cumming as the German, religious teleporter Nightcrawler. He's a very gentle soul but carries with him an unsettling reminder that he's not human. <br/><br/>6. The techs are still amazing, especially the makeup and prosthetics on Nightcrawler and Mystique. The visual effects of Pyro's fire, Iceman's frost and the rapid healing of Wolverine are hugely impressive, not to mention the mass explosions and breached dam. <br/><br/>7. Apparently Ian McKellen helped write the scene where Bobby reveals his powers to his family to resemble a scene where a boy comes out to his family as gay. The misunderstanding, the question ""have you tried not being a mutant"" - these quiet but vital scenes make the X-Men films so different (and so much better) than their counterparts. Just like the previous film, these themes could equally be applicable to people who have mental health problems.<br/><br/>8. The action in this film ups the anti significantly. Not even counting the fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike, there's the attack on the White House, the jet chase, Magneto's escape, Pyro's attack on the police and the attack on the school. It's breathtaking. The fight scene with Lady Deathstrike is utterly amazing, with top notch choreography. While Wolverine fights like an heavy axe, Deathstrike fights like a rapier - fast and deadly. But the end of their fight, with the draining liquid adamantium, there is almost a sense of sadness and tragedy.<br/><br/>9. For a film with one swear word allowed for its rating, Singer places it perfectly. He's the king of directing superhero films, with an impeccable sense of drama, comedy, even a little bit of horror, mystery and epic. He constructs amazing scenes, even with something as little as having Magneto simultaneously pull a platoon's worth of grenade pins. Especially brilliant are the Mystique impersonation scenes, with nifty camera-work and seamless editing transitioning between Stryker as himself and Mystique as Stryker. <br/><br/>10. Rebecca Romijn appears as herself for the only time, seducing a prison guard to help Magneto escape. Take note Jennifer Lawrence. Romijn was dedicated to her art. She went three movies with those prosthetics and only appeared as herself when it made sense."

","X-Men 2 surpasses X-Men. And sequels never usually do. Bryan Singer has royally upped his game, with a bigger budget, astonishingly in-depth mutants (old and new) and a story thick with layers. Starting fiercely with a mutant attacking the Whitehouse, X2 focuses on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and his hazy past with military man William Stryker (Brian Cox), who's now against all mutants after the scare in Washington. The mutant/human divide is constantly marred in various ways. The young Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) struggles to maintain a relationship with the familiar faced Rogue (Anna Paquin). He also has to contend with his family discovering his secret. Mystique (Romijn) breaks out Magneto (McKellen) to form an uneasy alliance with the X-Men, and stand against the opposing government and their new anti-mutant laws. All sub- plots are equally distributed. There's a huge amount to process in 134 minutes, with Singer and writing partners David Hayter and Zak Penn creating a superhero sequel others should inspire to be. Now for the grand finale."

","X2: United(X Men 2) as its known as is a 2003 Comic Book film adaptation based on the X Men series and tells the tale about mutants fighting for mankind. This time however we are introduced to Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler a blue-skinned creature who can tele-port anywhere he wants to go. We first see him at the Presidents house as we later meet our new villain Skyler(Brian Cox) who gate-crashes into Professor Charles Xavier's(Patrick Stewart) mutant school and also happens to know Wolverine(Hugh Jackman)and he wants to defeat all the mutants and get to use his son as an experiment to enter Professor Charles head to get the mutants and defeat them. So can the X-Men team defeat Skyler and save Professor Charles while teaming up with former baddies Mystique(Rebecca Romijn)and Magneto(Ian McKellan)?<br/><br/>Bottom line is X Men is a great Comic Book movie and this sequel is a lot better than the first installment as we get to see more of the charcthers, as the first outing focuses way too much on Wolverine and Rogue(who are still in this film BTW). The cast is fantastic,especially Hugh Jackman. This guy is multi-talented at what he does and every charcther he has played so far(in some of the films I have seen him in) he always acts different in every film. For example he can be the dashing prince charming like charcther in Kate & Leopold,a bad ass in X- Men,a magician in The Prestige the list goes on. <br/><br/>James Marsden was great too but I feel like he never gets enough screen time as like I said before Hugh Jackman is the star of X-Men and I have no idea who is gonna replace him in the next 20 odd years or less.<br/><br/>Like I said I loved X Men 2 and if you never seen it I highly recommend it.

Its emphasis on the rights of mutants seems to mirror the real life plights of homosexuals, various discriminated races, and other such people who are often met with much prejudice.

One sequence in particular, when the school is attacked by soldiers and Wolverine single handedly fended off the invasion, is quite thrilling and is amongst one of the finer action sequences ever put on film.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer truly outdid himself here. With the top notch action, mixed in with some true thought and genuine emotion, X2: X-Men United is a definite must see.<br/><br/>I give X2 a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","X2: X-Men United now how can you sum up this amazing sequel to 2000 X-Men, not in 300 words I'm sorry to say. X2 is one of the best comic book sequels ever made and still number one on my list as the greatest comic book ever made. X2 has the entire cast who made up X-men back and doing what they do best, giving you one heck of a wild ride. X2 picks up right where X-men left off, with Magneto in jail and the world feeling a little more threatened by the mutants of Charles Xavier, William Stryker a high ranking military official gain permission form the president to exterminate all mutants. Now it's a race against time for Logan and the Reaming X-Men to stop Styrker before he destroys all mutants'. X2: X-Men United is an amazing treat for the eyes and the sense's, it's a visual stunning and magnificent movies that people of any age can love. X2 introduce a new member of the X-men, night crawler(He was an original member in the comics) he plays a very pivotal role in this movie as do all the X-men, they all share traits from there comic book counterparts and that's what makes this film so enjoyable. All the actors bring a special style and pizazz to old friends and make them seem so new and exciting. If you enjoyed X-Men then X2: X-men United is the movie for you."

","I'm definitely not a fan of Bryan Singer. Not in the slightest. The man manages to consistently annoy me with his mediocrity as director, and while his work is not staggeringly bad to the point that ""X2"" doesn't work, it does prevent the film from reaching its massive potential. I don't think I'm a fan of the X-Men universe either, the concepts, the themes, the characters, at all, and it is testament to the quality of ""X2"" as a standalone story that I found ""X2"" overall to be one of the better blockbusters of the decade, though Singer single-handedly keeps it from being on par with the few great comic book-based films.<br/><br/>It helps, of course, that Hugh Jackman's wonderful Wolverine, easily the most interesting and likable character in these films, is perhaps the main emotional focus of the film, or maybe it's just that I was most drawn to his story. To my surprise and excitement the rest of the film this time around is as good as Wolverine is (well, not really, but good regardless). The concepts presented in the first film and the obvious metaphoric significance of the mutants and the way society treats them are not merely presented as in the first film but expanded on and are actually overall quite interesting and well-handled. Of course the film is not intellectual and remains a summer blockbuster, but it's not as dumb as I expected it to be.<br/><br/>Overall as a total outsider whose only familiarity with the X-Men universe and characters I found ""X2"" a surprisingly rewarding film after being slightly disappointed by the decent but underwhelming ""X-Men"". This film is richer, bigger, smarter, and features better storytelling than the first film, as well as more convincing characterizations. Bryan Singer is not the worst director around and I'm sure Brett Ratner messed things up far more, but I still found Singer's work to be uninspired and disappointing. This film could've been an absolute knockout, but I found too much of it visually bland or occasionally downright annoying for me to really fall in love with the movie. I expected ""X2"" to disappoint after its excellent opening scene, but it was consistently entertaining and even emotionally involving at times."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","11 February 2009"," More explosive but just as character-focused as the first
","Before ""X2: X-Men United,"" there was always this dreaded fear of sequels. Finally we see how follow-up films can really outdo the original.<br/><br/>There was nothing that wrong with ""X-Men,"" in fact it was a great imagining of the comic by Bryan Singer and it brought our attention to the importance of character development in a film with so many to follow. ""X2,"" however is more explosive, has slightly more characters and the plot blows the first film out of the water. The reason is story.<br/><br/>The first film was a pathetic plot to turn world leaders into mutants by X-Men nemesis Magneto, (Ian McKellen) who believes in mutant supremacy. This installment is a brilliantly conceived plot that successfully interweaves various story lines like Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) mysterious past and Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) suddenly irritable powers into the main plot. While some of the subplots--not unlike the first movie--are under-developed, the ones that matter the most work fluidly.<br/><br/>In ""X2,"" the president of the United States is attacked by a teleporting mutant, later to be revealed as famed comic character Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). From the first scene you can tell the special effects budget is going to yield a film more visually awesome than the first. Nightcrawler evaporates into puffs of purple smoke and reappears to stylishly kick butt. First film shape-shifter baddie Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) also gets more CGI attention as does flame-thrower Pyro (Aaron Stanford). The attack puts the country on high alert and the president authorizes a man by the name of William Stryker (Brian Cox) to raid the X-Men Academy. Of course Stryker is a little more intimately tied to the mutant controversy than anyone realizes, soon forcing both evil mutants and good mutants to team up to defeat him. It would be shameful to spoil any more of Stryker's plan, but it's brilliantly drawn up by the writing team that includes director Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>Singer brings the same style to this film as he did the first and the bigger budget just gives him more room to deliver great action in addition to character-driven story. He's really a great director for the franchise--not too over-the-top but capable of filming in that action movie style.<br/><br/>Another great choice by Singer and story writers Zak Penn and David Hayter was not to go overboard with new mutants. Nightcrawler is the only substantial addition to the X-Men and Pyro and Iceman (Sean Ashmore), who made appearances in the first film, get further development. On the villain side, Magneto has no cronies other than Mystique, to account for Stryker and his deadly assistant Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama). This basically allows the script to dig further into the existing characters, even if some of them (Halle Berry's Storm and James Marsden's Cyclops) still get glazed over.<br/><br/>""X2"" is just more exciting and clever than its predecessor. Knowing that ""X-Men"" was a hit but not a critical success, it seems the producers decided to be careful even with the film getting fasttracked by the studio. It definitely paid off."
"unklarjason","10","0","0","13 November 2008"," X-Theology
","The X-Men graphic novels and movies are rich materials for any budding theologian who wants to examine about the relationship between popular culture and theology, and vice versa. This is perhaps truest of all with X2: X-Men United. The film explores issues of identity, estrangement, reconciliation and sacrifice.<br/><br/>The X-Men are of course a group of beneficent mutants with various powers. Some can never be injured; some can teleport; some can move objects with their minds and even enter the thoughts of others. But the mutants use all of their powers to combat the nefarious Magneto and, in this movie, a non-mutant who is even more dangerous. I feel justified in making comparisons with Christians (who were also excluded and viewed as mutants in their original culture). Some have the gift of healing; some have prophetic gifts and some are teachers. And Christians use their gifts together to combat injustice, inequality and excluded.<br/><br/>Jean Grey was the most interesting mutant in this movie because of her struggle to remain on the same level as the other mutants, although very early on we discover that there is something very different about her. Something is swelling and growing inside of her and everyone soon recognizes that there is something very different about Jean Grey. I believe her character could be understood as a Christ figure, with the man Jesus praying that the cup would pass from him, but who nevertheless does the will of his father. There was a tension inside him just as it was in Jean. Will she sacrifice herself as well? Next, the X-Men realize that the only way that they can defeat the villain of the film is to unite with the Brotherhood--mutants who do are not full of good will. Only when all of the mutants combine their power will the twisted Stryker be defeated. I believe this represents the church's acceptance of elements that have traditionally been outside of itself. It is only when we think outside of the church box and embrace women, minorities and everyone who has been excluded from Christianity in the past, that we will finally have the power to overcome evil.<br/><br/>Lastly, as all of the X-Men are on board the jet, Jean finally reaches her moment of decision. When she discovers that she has the power to save her colleagues even though it will cost her everything, she sacrifices her own life and even thwarts their plans to save her. I think it bears a clear resemblance to Jesus' sacrifice and of his condemnation of those who would try to fight their way out of it (Peter).<br/><br/>This review could be the product of a young theologian who has left X-Men on too many times while reading his theology homework, but I believe there is enough familiar material to us to consider the series, but especially X2, as theologically oriented."

","Focus is an important word. The first ""X-Men"" movie has it. It is a short movie but carries a simple plot and has no unessential moment. The sequel is full of such moments. The characters are now established so there is more room for fun. Second chapters can use that to their advantage. ""From Russia with Love"" is the best of Connery's Bond movies. ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" which comes after ""GoldenEye"" re-introduced Bond to the public, is the strongest one starring Pierce Brosnan. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" remains the pre-eminent Star Wars movie, and ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"" and ""First Contact"" are the fan favorites. All of those movies had focus. ""X2"" gets so wrapped up in itself that it does not know when to quit.<br/><br/>THIS IS YOUR WARNING TO STOP READING IF HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST MOVIE.<br/><br/>""X2"" begins where its predecessor ends. Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains incarcerated in a plastic prison; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos), still masquerades as Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is checking out a location that may be the key to his past. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Gray (Famke Janssen) continue to teach young students at Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for the Gifted. Rouge (Anna Paquin), Bobby aka Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and John aka Pyro (Aaron Stanford) are among the best students.<br/><br/>A mutant attack on the President (Cotter Smith) shatters the peace between ""normal"" humans and their mutant kin. Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), a man with Hitler-like hatred of mutants, seizes the opportunity to attain authorization for a raid on Xavier's school. At his side stands Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), a mysterious mutant whose cooperation stems from reasons initially unknown.<br/><br/>For the first three quarters, ""X2"" is markedly better than its predecessor. Character interaction is briefly put aside in favor of story setup, but its strength from before remains. The subtitle ""X-Men United"" indicates that this will not be a typical X-Men story. Everyone knew that a third chapter was coming, so we have an easy time accepting these sacrifices. Sadly, an axe-murderer mangled the dead-on-arrival third installment.<br/><br/>The opening White House scene sets a high standard for the action and the writers develop Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) into one of the movie's most complete characters. Wolverine gets his first berserk scene. Many mutants have their own showcase moments: Bobby's ice wall, Banshee's ear-bone-busting scream, and Colossus' beat down of the military are some examples. The most awe-inspiring is Pyro's excessive assault on the police.<br/><br/>The final assault on Stryker's base contains the best moments. It is at this time that writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter do not know when enough is enough. The action ends at minute 96 and the major conflict is settled at 99. That leaves nearly 30 minutes of dead space before the credits. A plot contrivance extends the act, but even that takes only a few more minutes. I am not averse to character time. The first movie is my favorite and it has the most.<br/><br/>Cox turns Stryker into a more-than-memorable villain. Jackman again proves why he is the best actor to play Wolverine. The other standout is Kelly Hu. She mainly has to act with her face and does so flawlessly. It helps that she is a finalist for most beautiful woman on the planet.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of glass balls to juggle, but after the Wolverine/Deathstrike fight, they all fall to the ground and shatter. The interminable ending includes one more contrivance with cheesy special effects. The anticlimax causes ""X2"" to fizzle long before it is over. Only because a majority is so great do I give it a recommendation."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","0","21 October 2008"," Why is evil always contained?
","This second opus is bringing the war inside the human camp because one military scientist who had had the chance, though not to his taste, of having a mutant son and who had manipulated him so much that he had managed to take complete control of him, is provoking, or at least trying to, an open war of total destruction against the mutants. This time bad and good mutants unite to defeat that man though the bad mutants take over the game of the bad human and redirect the weapon from total destruction of mutants to total destruction of human beings. This drastic situation is saved in due time and just in time by the good mutants though the bad ones manage to escape and the good ones must sacrifice one of themselves to assure the escape. That will be essential later and it builds a promise because the death of a hero is always compensated by his or her resurrection, generally in that type of literature with an inverted personality. But the film is well built, the special effects are interesting, rich and at times funny. The dramatic tension is perfect and the President of the USA who was going to declare the state of emergency to take control of the mutants is informed by the good mutants about the actions of his mad scientist, and also head of some kind of national security, and we understand this President of the USA changes his ideas and convictions and moves towards a compromise with the mutants. But of course we know it can't last since the President was more or less forced to act that way and the bad mutants are still out there somewhere plotting evil.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"retroguy02","9","0","0","29 August 2008"," An intense, darkly fierce and psychological superhero film that succeeds in everything it tries to do
","A tastefully dark, serious superhero film = pure gold for me. Having said that, am I glad that I believed in the hype for X2.<br/><br/>X2's story is more complex, engaging and deeper than its predecessor's; even though it is fairly graspable, I had to play closer attention to understand it than the previous movie's story; otherwise, it can occasionally get confusing. The character development is also more even here than the first X-Men, although the focus still tilts towards Wolverine.<br/><br/>X2 also introduces three new big players to the series  William Stryker, Yuriko Oyama (also known as Lady Deathstrike in the comics) and Kurt Wagner / the Nightcrawler. Stryker is a human military scientist hell-bent on eliminating the mutant race because his mutant son caused his wife's suicide by 'playing' with her mind; the X-Men and Magneto's mutants are urged to unite against his heinous plans. Oyama is Stryker's assistant and henchwoman, and a mutant he has successfully 'experimented' on; she is basically a sleeker, sexier, female version of Wolverine. The Nightcrawler is a blue-skinned freak of a mutant who is capable of teleporting; he is recruited by the X-Men after he attacks the president, and he's a religious Christian from Germany (talk about mutant fundamentalists) who used to work in the Munich circus before. All the characters from the previous movie return, along with cameos from some new characters; the most appetizing cameo by far has to be Colossus' (unfortunately it's just a cameo).<br/><br/>The action scenes are also better than the first movie this time around. They're more intense, more abundant and more diverse  everything from visceral combat action to pure smash-fests is here. My personal favorite is a violent, nighttime raid by Stryker's soldiers on the X-Mansion, with Wolverine deliciously stabbing the soldiers on screen. X2 is probably the first movie to kick off the trend of dark, serious plots in superhero films (more importantly, it's the first superhero film to do so successfully), and the movie's action is fairly violent. The movie ends with a classic quote (said by a major X-Men member believed to have died) in an optimistic, aptly epic way; and since a movie's ending has a huge impact, X2's couldn't possibly have been better. To top it all off, John Ottman's epic soundtrack is the best I've ever heard in a superhero film since 1977's Superman.<br/><br/>The acting is decent and slightly better than last time from the entire cast, with no one standing out once again, but Brian Cox towers moderately above the rest with his shrewdly sinister William Stryker, who makes his first and last appearance in the series. The production design is top-notch throughout as usual. The costume design is also subtly enhanced, the X's on the X-Men's costumes are more pronounced and plentiful, and the costumes look slightly more superhero-like than the previous film, for the better.<br/><br/>Overall, X2 is a great follow-up to a decent movie, and improves upon every aspect of its predecessor  much like what ""Spider-Man 2"" did for the first Spider-Man movie. X2 is one of the few superhero movies that are serious and fun at the same time and is the best superhero film I have ever seen since ""Spider-Man 2"" (since this review is belated anyway, I may also add that I've also seen the overrated ""Dark Knight""). RATING: 9/10."
"vip_ebriega","8","0","0","18 July 2008"," Fun to the Xth level. (With DVD details)
","My Take: Better than the original and the best in the series. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer's big-budget sequel X2 (X-MEN UNITED) learns from the past to create a better, more streamlined comic book adventure that has a sharper script with just the same wallops of action and special effects. I enjoyed the original X-MEN film, but not for most parts as I should. While it had no further problem with visuals and action, the film is fatally flawed by weak writing. X2 is much better, continuing the legacy started by the first, and offering much more to it as well. The characters, not just Rouge (Anna Paquin), the evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), are taken into much deeper characteristics. The love-triangle subplot between Wolverine, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclops (James Marsden), which were given much irregular treatment in the original, is given much better treatment here. The characters have so much more to do, and the plot is more complex, even if it isn't even borderline clever.<br/><br/>During the great opening sequences (after an elaborate narration about mutants), a mutant poses an attack on the President of the United States, nearly killing him. The ever-benevolent X-men of Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) Mutant Academy believes Magneto could be behind it, but Xavier believes otherwise. Meanwhile, an obsessed scientist (Brian Cox) sees a chance to finally start a war against the mutant race, once he frames them as a threat to mankind. The X-men now must aid help from their own adversary Magneto (McKellen) and his sultry shape-shifting accomplice Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) to prevent a war that could destroy the world... and either race. The mutant gang also get a little help from a new batch of ""gifted"" beings including a self-transporting ""Incredible Nightcrawler"" (Alan Cumming), freeze-powered Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and fire-powered Pyro (Aaron Stanford).<br/><br/>X2 is not free from its flaws, and while I never really gotten myself in the X-MEN fad, X2 is an agreeably enough thrill-machine on its own. Leave your brain to dry and let the pure 'X' quality flow right through you.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5.<br/><br/>The DVD: <br/><br/>A real treat on the big-screen, X2 will be much of the same delight on DVD. I suggest you get a hold of the 2-disc widescreen edition which features the film in a 2:40:1 Anamorphic widescreen format. The picture is not only clean, it rivals (if not outdoes) the quality featured on the big-screen. The sound is presented in a crisp Dolby Digital sound that's bound to blow you away, and don't you think it's safe to turn it down a little. If you're interested in the film's backstage drama, the DVD has a basket-load of special features, including an Audio-commentary with the director (Singer), cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, and another with the writers and producers. Disc 2 offers more, including a a making-of documentary called ""The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men"", as well as a series of informative featurettes and Multi-angle screen study of the famous Nightcrawler Attack prologue. Included as well, is an in-depth look on fight scene rehearsals. Finally, there's 11 deleted scenes and theatrical trailers. With English, Spanish and French subtitles/spoken languages."

","With X-Men, Brian Singer introduces us to the mutants with great conviction and admiration in the spirit of the politically and socially complex comic book series; bringing them all to stunning life. In X2, Singer not only expanded upon established material, but improves upon it with some very great ideas. Having seen the first film, I can say with honest sincerity that X2: X-men United outshines the original for many reasons: Case in point: Character development is highly prominent in this second installment with returning and new characters being fleshed out at the same time. There's seems a more open-mindedness to the atmosphere overall of the mutant hysteria with both human and mutant at each other's throats; very relevant to our current post-911 world. And with one of the main characters going out of his way to explain the dilemma of his true nature, that alone rings all the more true.<br/><br/>The story is more tighter and focused this time around with a morally ambiguous government agent (played by Brian Cox) who seeks genocidal extinction of all mutant kind, even going so far as to justify the means in order to accomplish such goals. Some may say he's conventional but I tend to digress; especially the twists and turns surrounding his character and the ultimate revelation to one of the main characters which I will not spoil for anyone.<br/><br/>And the special effects. Oh my HOW SPECTACULAR they are in the skillful manipulation of pyrotechnics and mega kick-ass action brought ever so eloquently by one of the finest craftsmanship in the business!! Singer doesn't go overboard like most action movies of Hollywood's ilk despite being a Hollywood production, but plays it straight with balance and sheer innovative technical skill required of such direction. When you have a script combined with the right amounts of action, there's a great film for your eyes and brain. And sometimes you get the impression that the powers the mutants display are not just for the action, but also for subtlety.<br/><br/>And who can forget Nightcrawler; a charming, charismatic, bad-ass mutant and one of the BEST things EVER to happen to the franchise the first time you see him. He nearly stole the show from Wolverine!!! This gives the film a sense of a ""competitiveness"" seldom seen in a superhero flick. But there's also a human side to him that conflicts with his faith and identity; again reinforcing one of the human aspects and themes of the comics and first film.<br/><br/>But the main selling point of the movie is heart. The comic book series left no stone unturned when touching on taboo subjects like intolerance, fear, prejudice, loneliness, acceptance, and even to a certain extent, genocide. Although the film is science fiction in nature, there is also a sense of verisimilitude that anchors the film to a fundamental level.<br/><br/>My only faults are that Cyclops and Storm seem undeveloped but those are only minor quirks in a ""X-citing"" action/sci-fi flick.<br/><br/>X2: X-men United delivers in bucket loads of superhero goodness with flair and style and mental stimulation. But what followed later on in '06 is another story."
"pyrocitor","10","0","0","18 May 2008"," Impeccable blend of cultural commentary and comic book action; the definitive superhero sequel
","The X-Men series has always demonstrated more promising opportunities for deeper poignancy than the typical superpowered slugfest, a trait which director Bryan Singer embraced for the first film adaptation of the timeless comic book series. And while the fear that the unique gravitas and social scope of the first film might be lost in a flurry of mindless action associated with the typical sequel, X2 exceeds any seemingly insurmountable expectations by exemplifying and even expanding upon every successful element of the first, making its mark as one of the few sequels to not only match but surpass the quality of its predecessor. <br/><br/>What could have been simply played as an all out action film instead retains laudable cultural context, as returning director Singer tackles his source material with a slightly more fun, enjoyable tone without losing an ounce of the serious realism or societal commentary which permeated his first effort. As prejudice towards mutants becomes more pronounced and the rift between them and ""normal"" humans grows ever larger, morally ambiguous fields emerge and extremes are taken by both sides of the issue to eliminate the other, giving the film ample opportunity to touch upon issues of discrimination (Iceman's ""coming out"" scene to his parents draws explicitly poignant parallels to homosexual repression) or other issues of impressive complexity for a superhero blockbuster. As such, certain storyline similarities to the first do emerge, but these are hardly apparent and utterly insignificant in the face of such a uniformly superb work. <br/><br/>The film's clever script balances its wide array of characters just so unlike the slightly rushed and chaotic feel of the third instalment, as each character shines given their appropriate moment without the film ever feeling cluttered or imbalanced. Similarly, many knowing winks of humour result from throwaway references for fans of the comics (watch for fleeting mentions of Gambit, Sebastian Shaw and Dr. Henry McCoy) without ever jeopardising the credibility of the film. The film similarly boasts more streamlined action setpieces than its predecessor (Nightcrawler's opening attack on the White House is a breathless, superbly gripping piece of work), as computer animation is seamlessly melded with practical effects and makeup, culminating in a laudably realistic depiction of superpowered beings in a frighteningly real world. <br/><br/>The quality cast inhabit the potentially daunting material with a passionate urgency, fusing potentially laughable subject matter into an affecting and exhilarating work. Reprising his defining role, Hugh Jackman once again effortlessly essays the animalistic charm of the savage Wolverine, his roguish charisma remaining pitch perfect for the role. The calm dignity of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan provide dramatic backbone as opposing mutant figureheads, the peace seeking Professor Charles Xavier and ruthless war mongering Magneto, bringing class and distinction to the film and helping to sell many of the less realistic moments while also both demonstrating surprising vulnerability during respective captivity sequences. Returning cast members Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and James Marsden continue to impress, expanding upon their previous incarnations of their roles, and Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore contribute a surprisingly feasible youthful existentialism subplot. Despite minimally written roles, Rebecca Romijn and Kelly Hu provide suitable menace instead of simply statuesque forms as the shapeshifting Mystique and ominous villainous Deathstrike respectively.<br/><br/>Yet most commendable are the new cast members, as Brian Cox chews scenery with the utmost of bottled fury as military extremist William Stryker and Aaron Stanford inhabits simmering defiance like a second skin as the unpredictable Pyro. Yet the film's most resonant and ultimately affecting performance without question is provided by Alan Cumming as outcast teleporter Nightcrawler. His soulful interior poignantly counterbalancing his demonic exterior, Nightcrawler serves as a figurehead for humanity's close-minded discrimination, and Cumming's masterclass of a performance extracts every possible ounce of humanity and sympathy from the character - one of the most moving and fervently felt performances ever seen in a comic book adaptation. <br/><br/>With exquisitely thrilling action to put most summer blockbusters to shame and an undercurrent of thought provoking profundity which could give most dramas a run for their money, X2 proves an almost faultless piece of quality film-making as well as easily one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever released. Even those usually put off by superhero films will have much to appreciate, and fans of such material will be hard pressed to find a film nearly as bombastically satisfying as X2. <br/><br/>-9.5/10"

Tragedy and intrigue, combined with awesome over-the-top super hero battles are what make the source material stand out on the comic rack, and so too does it make this second part of the trilogy.

","Though personally this movie is my least favorite X-Men film (for reasons I'll detail later), it is still an amazing movie with engaging plots, awesome characters, and killer graphics. I love the new Nightcrawler character. His teleportation powers were portrayed in a unique and masterful way. I love how he just poofs into black smoke and then re-appears behind his foe. My favorite scene in the movie was when Storm and Jean Grey encounter Nightcrawler in a church. That scene was just really moving and symbolic of how far mankind has fallen short of God's standards. Nightcrawler was a tortured soul, haunted by the sins of his past, and yet he found redemption of a sort as the movie progresses. Through an all-or-nothing leap of faith, Nightcrawler gains new powers and finds peace. In addition to the character of Nightcrawler, another plus this movie had was Ian McKellen (who played Magneto). The sinister sophistication with which McKellen portrays Magneto is awe-inspiring. I love the scene where Magneto and Mystique were laughing together in a corner over Rogue's new haircut.<br/><br/>Now, I'll explain why this movie was my least favorite of the X-Men trilogy. First off, I DID NOT LIKE THE VILLAIN. I found the scenes with Stryker in them to be boring and undramatic. As far as I am concerned, he was just a whiny bigot and perhaps the biggest jerk I have ever seen in any movie to date. Now, being a jerk is a fine quality for a villain, but only if that unsavory trait is accompanied by some sort of power. Yes, he had a small army at his disposal and a neat compound. But what threat did he alone pose to the X-Men? None really. Let's face it. A non-mutant bad guy in X-Men is just boring. Additionally, was it just me, or was that brawl between Wolverine and Deathstrike just kind of . . . well . . . boring? That was one cameo they could have left out, as I don't really think it served a purpose to the storyline. I also thought that Magneto joined up with the X-Men just a little too quickly and unconvincingly. But, a few flaws aside, X2 was a jewel of a movie that soars above the average film."

","'X2' did not make a very strong impression on me, but like the middle parts of many movie trilogies (Star Wars I-III & IV-VI, Godfather) its significance only becomes apparent once you've seen all three films. In this sense X2 falls perhaps slightly short of its immediate predecessor and successor but is still an impressive movie.<br/><br/>Everything is done professionally from the production side and the characters and their personal stories do colour the main plot nicely. In all it, however, doesn't feel as definitive a movie as it's predecessor and many of the events herein are only really setting up the third film.<br/><br/>None the less, the film is impressive with its depictions of the characters and all around opening the X-Men Universe further to the cinema-screen. It's not as exciting as the other movies but a fair effort none the less."

","Great movie!!! Had a tough time understanding this the first time I watched it, but after watching it a few times I finally understand it perfectly and enjoy watching it all the time. Out of all the X-Men movies this one I would have to say is the best one!!! May be a little lengthy, but it describes things very well. X-Men 3 is way too short. The first X-Men movie was great but this one has much more action and a better story line and it's way more fun to watch. I love the fact that it starts from where the first one left off and it has a following of the first one to this one and right into the third one. Overall it is the best X-Men movie yet!!! the two disc edition is great because of all the extra features, but the one disc edition doesn't have any which is not worth buying, unless you're not into watching all the extra footage and behind the scenes and etc."

","The first installment of this series of films was real good but focused a little too primarily on Wolverine and Magneto. This one however was much more evenly spread among all the mutants. This is one hell of a cast and can always produce a real good movie. The movie rarely stays still and is on the move from minute one. A new mutant is introduced in this, Nightcrawler played by a scene stealing Alan Cumming and he is used to discredit mutants. When the truth is exposed the X Men investigate and produce a roller-coaster of a movie. When the American government try and raid the mutant school we get to see some new mutants from Colossus to Jubilee. The near last scene in the White House is fantastic. A brilliant movie that will be enjoyed by anyone who liked the first."

","Okay, let's start with that they did right with X-Men 2. They continued the battle between bigots and mutants. They show that Magnus isn't all bad. Lady Deathstrike is cool, but they forgot the Lady part in the name. All the good points make it worth watching, but is it perfect? No, I'm afraid not. Again, Director Bryan Singer does not use the X-Men costumes. What's the point of having code-names if everyone can see their faces? Plus, I learned from a documentary on SUPERMAN that Bryan never read comic books and that was a good thing. How is that a good thing? That's like having my mother direct a horror movie, she doesn't watch horror movies, she doesn't like horror movies. So, how the f*** can she direct a bloody horror movie? I think know the source material is a good start when directing something is based on something else. I'm sorry, but knowing what your working with seems important to me. There are changes in characters and situations that I don't approve of. But all and all I guess I give this movie 8 STARS."

Big films, big money, big stars but this often meant poor plot less films, devoid of intelligence and point. The original X Men went some way to break this mould and, am I pleased to say X Men 2 goes one better, in this season of the Super hero summer.<br/><br/>As an avid fan of the comics, I loved the story led character action of the first film and X2, much like the original is truly an ensemble piece, with almost all the actors getting nice scenes, strong diaglue and a great story.<br/><br/>This is a great super hero movie, one of the best in fact, which is as strong on action as it is story, character and development with each character advancing emotionally in the film. More than that it's a great movie.<br/><br/>Oh and the action scenes ROCK! The fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is vicious, brutal and very well directed, proving that Usual Suspects director Brain Singer has finally got over his directing of action block.<br/><br/>Every one shines in this movie. But that's the thing, as much as everyone tries stand out amongst the crowd, just like the original it's Wolverine's movie. Hugh Jackman steals every scene as the furry, cigar smoking mutant. And finally we get to see Wolverine's famed bezerker attack.<br/><br/>And with a support cast of Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian Mckellum, Halle Berry, Alan Cummings and the always great Brian Cox as General Stryker this film is the perfect example of what can be done when time is taken, and when a crew and cast genuinely care about the film they are making."

","""X2"" was considerably better than the first. I believe that it being better had more to do with a bigger budget than anything else. They obviously put more into the CGI and special effects to show off the X-Men abilities (I mean why else are we watching it?). After the opening scene I knew I was in for a fantastic treat. The movie starts with an awesome display of Nightcrawler's abilities. The camera perfectly captured Nightcrawler teleporting from point to point to just absolutely dismantle the secret service. It was a supreme use of CGI and stunts to make a spine tingling good scene. The story in X2 was good as well, it stayed true to the comic book and the constant battle between homo-sapiens and homo-superior (humans and mutants). We got to see more mutants and a better display of their skills. X2 did not disappoint and it even offered a little teaser at the end with Jean."

This sequel would be completely ordinary were it not for a few clever touches.<br/><br/>With the benefit of confidence, it gels better than its predecessor, powered by a more dynamic story (which doubles as a metaphor for homosexuality) and rock-solid performances by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, all of which lends it a bit of substance.<br/><br/>On the debit side, it remains fluff (a major character dies, for instance, and I found myself totally unmoved), some characters' superpowers are too vaguely defined to be compelling, and the special effects are mediocre."

Bryan Singer must come back to the franchise if more sequels are to be made as Brett Ratner clearly showed he had no idea about the X-men universe and ruined which could possibly have been one of the greatest comic book trilogy's ever made which now will surly end up belonging to Spiderman later this year.

","I would definitely say this movie was way better than the first film, which definitely tells you what? See this movie. Every single thing was well put together and interestingly plotted and organized into one stylish action-packed thriller. This film had better acting than the first one, even though the first had pretty good acting, there was more action and the characters were stronger than ever. The new ""villian"" is played very well and I think he replaced Magneto for half the film well.<br/><br/>We are now joined with a new group of characters. We have Pyro, played by the gorgeous and extremely talented Aaron Stanford, he did an x-cellent job, Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, I would say his performance was way superior, Brian Cox as William Stryker, the new ""villian"", and Kelly Hu as the small part of Lady Deathstrike. The small performances by say Colossus were good even though he only had a line or two. Anna Paquin returns as Rogue and tops her performance in the first. He character is now stronger and more developed. We also have Iceman in there who I think was played in a great performance by Shawn Ashmore.<br/><br/>One more thing I loved; the writing. Most action movies are brought down by awful writing(i.e. Star Wars Episode 2) but this film was very well written. This movie showed a certain wit to it and had some great humor added into the lines. The movie was never rushed nor was it ever slow. I really liked Famke Janssen in this movie because her character, Jean Grey was also developed and her powers grew stronger. Storm, played by the beautiful Halle Berry, had more screen time and a bigger role in this installment and had a great relationship with Nightcrawler. Patrick Stewart was great in this one again and he also seemed a little more into his character in this movie.<br/><br/>One more thing; the action and the special effects. Brilliant. This movie had more action than the first and great special effects. They all looked very real to me! All the characters that had action put a lot into their performances and looked like they actually had the powers their characters did. My two favorite battles were Lady Deathstrike v.s. Wolverine and the scene in Boston where Rogue(Marie), Bobby(Iceman), Logan(Wolverine), and John(Pyro), where Pyro started burning all the police cars. Those were my favorite scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is the best so far and it does not disappoint."

","The basic idea of the 'X-Men' series of films is a good one: humans seek to exterminate a race of highly evolved mutants, who themselves plot to take over the world. Meanwhile, a second group of mutants attempt to broker a compromise. Although there are obvious villains, the fact that compromise might not be possible, and the understandable motivation of the warring parties, add some interest to the scenario: Ian Mackellan's evil Magneto, for example, is a far more complex character than his Gandalf in 'Lord of the Rings'. The films are still based on a comic book, which means, in a film, lots of special effects and extended action sequences that can grow tedious; but if anything, this sequel is superior to the original, because there's less need for exposition and the role of Magneto is more ambiguous: as a self-contained story, it works better than the second parts of 'Lord of the Rings', 'The Matrix', or 'Star Wars', to give three examples from other trilogies Ultimatelty, it's all hokum; but mostly entertaining, and far from brain dead."

","Wow, am I late to the party or what? It took me this long to watch the sequel to X-Men thanks to the fairly average opener in the X-Men film series. X2, however, corrects the shortcomings of its predecessor, and shows that comic books *can* work with movies.<br/><br/>X2 revisits the main X-Men motif of mutants versus humans and, as is usually the case, has the fate of everyone involved hanging in the balance. But this is would hardly suffice as a good summary of the story, as it goes many miles deep and many acres wide. Many elements of human behavior are explored in this film - love (Jean and Wolverine/Cyclops, Rogue and Iceman), retribution (Wolverine and Stryker), malice (Stryker), conformity (mutants), personal victory (Jean), prejudice (humans in general), anger through ignorance (Iceman's brother), and anger for its own sake (Pyro) are just some of them.<br/><br/>The direction is crisp and the flow of the story taut and natural. With so many characters and so many ideas, it is easy to bombard the viewers with a blurry roller-coaster of a ride, but this movie avoids those pitfalls with aplomb. Visually appealing, the movie packs a few breath-taking scenes without really trying too hard. The heavy smattering of action scenes, necessary for a genre film, are well-done as well. The film is a shade darker than other comic book adaptations. Non-gratuitous violence is meted out as appropriate. For its own good, uneasy comic relief scenes (especially those between Wolverine and Cyclops) are avoided.<br/><br/>That I love X-Men as a comic book series makes it easier to like the movie. The characters are way cool, even the ones that appear only for a short while (Colossus, Lady DeathStrike). Newly-added crew member NightCrawler dazzles with mad teleportation skills. His scenes strongly remind me of the ghost Twins in The Matrix Reloaded. Mystique is awesome, as always. Wolverine, spending uneasy nights and restless days trying to find out about his past, is the dominant character. Magneto, Professor Xavier, Rogue, Jean-Grey, Storm, Iceman, and Pyro are some of the other major characters.<br/><br/>Overall, a smart, thoughtfully made movie packaged into a wholesome sleek summer blockbuster package. A winning formula indeed!"

I was watching X2 the other night just for the hell of it, and I noticed that at one hour, twenty-seven minutes and fifty seconds (1:27:50), the scene where Storm and Nightcrawler finds the kids in their prison, if you pause the film (and hoping you have a really good screen), you'll see Nightcrawler in the dimlight in the background. Storm then tells the kids that they'll save them and then Nightcrawler teleports to down below to help the children. I'm guessing is that they filmed the Storm part after they filmed Nightcrawler saving the kids and then just edited it the way they did.<br/><br/>Hope you all spot that blooper."

","Perfect. That's all there is to it. Better than the first by leaps and bounds, indeed! Singer brings the same care to staying true to the characters and ups the stakes by making more action to replace all the heavy exposition of the first film. The plot is more just an excuse to comment on social problems and to develop Logan's mystery. Yet, it still makes sense and is well thought out. However, the true heart of this film is in the characters. *Spoiler* By far, the best scene as far as acting and character driven drama is the moment after Jean's death when Logan hold Scott and says ""She's gone."" Scott's response is the thing that sells Jean's death. ""No, you don't say that!"" It is by far the best performance in that movie.

","Not only is X2 a rare sequel that manages to top the original film that it was spun off from, but it also emerges as one of the best superhero movies ever made. Director Bryan Singer and his small army of screenwriters have fashioned an impossibly tight little film that grabs you right from the beginning and refuses to let go. Inventively and successfully merging the expected superhero elements with a finely tuned story of political intrigue and unholy alliances, X2 also provides popcorn audience with plenty of marvelous action set-pieces and top-drawer special effects. As with the first film, X2 is definitely character-driven, but unlike the first film (which admittedly felt a little rushed) Singer takes his time here and gives everyone something interesting to do.<br/><br/>Once again, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen really make the picture with sharply-defined, fully-realized portrayals that always feel real and genuine, although the brilliant performance of newcomer Alan Cumming is just as impressive. Brian Cox and Kelly Hu make memorable villains, and X2 also gives the striking Rebecca Romijn and the always-underrated Famke Janssen more screen-time, the latter of which manages to quite nearly steal the show in a surprising moving climax. As with any movie that features so many characters, not everyone is going to be featured as prominently, and, as a result, the screen-time of Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, and James Marsden is rather limited â€“ but they all have strong moments and together form a terrific ensemble. Exciting, entertaining, and though-provoking, X2 is top notch action."

The Phoenix storyline was set up well - even if X3 eventually did what it did. Some characters, even few of my favorites, didn't get much screen time, but even the short scenes they had were handled with care.<br/><br/>Singer is one hell of a guy creating suspense and developing characters especially when he's working on an X-men movie. Yes, I liked ""Usual suspects"" and even ""Valkyrie"", but you got to admit that superhero movies are very challenging to make in a lot of different ways. And while I don't consider him as an action director, the action scenes have that much more of an impact when we really care about what's happening. <br/><br/>Acting is mostly top-notch. From the new cast members Brian Cox especially stood out and continued the tradition of (mostly) excellent casting in X-men movies. <br/><br/>The first film was also good and I liked it, but this one was just pure greatness. To this day, X2 remains as the best superhero movie I have ever seen. I can not find such flaws or shortcomings from it that I can find from other superhero movies. And yes, I have seen The Dark Knight, First Class and The Avengers.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say it's a perfect movie, but as an X-men movie it comes very, very close. Considering it was made 10 years ago and still holds up today...definitely an achievement. I can only hope that upcoming ""Days of Future Past"" comes even close to this. If that happens, I'll be more than happy.<br/><br/>(If it didn't translate well - yes, I like X-men a lot. If you, the reader, aren't so much into these films, take a couple points off my review.

Each of these characters could support a movie in their own right, but coming together, they create a tour de force of a movie that is poignant, intriguing, exciting, and though provoking. The final thirty minutes are the perfect climax, with incredible acting and a haunting score.<br/><br/>But it was not until I had the ""privelege"" of seeing X-Men 3: The Last Stand, did I truly begin to appreciate X2. Needless to say, I did not find X3 remotely satisfying. Shortly after seeing it, I decided to watch X2, which I remembered as being near the best of the trilogy, to ""wash the bad taste out of my mouth"". It did all that and more.<br/><br/>I found myself completely immersed in this movie. I sat on the edge of my seat during even the opening scene, wherein Nightcrawler single handedly defeats the entire staff of the Secret Service to reach the President. Another favorite is the scene outside of the Drake's house where the police have all of their guns trained on Pyro, who is losing his patience, and the score is slowly climaxing, and he says ""You know all those dangerous mutants you hear about on the news? Well I'm the worst one."" It is simply scenes like this, coupled with the intense chemistry of the cast, along with excellent leads by Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen (who steals every scene he is in), and Famke Jensen that make this one of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>As I said before, I was watching this to recover from the travesty of X3. During the last scene, in which Jean selflessly sacrifices herself to allow the others to escape...I suddenly found tears streaming down my face. It was a combination of mourning for the true end of this excellent franchise of movies, as I knew that Jean was truly dead and things would never be as superior as they were in this movie, coupled with how emotionally jarring this scene was. The ending to this movie was perfect, so well crafted by Mr. Singer and his excellent crew that one hopes and prays that the Phoenix under the murky waters of Alkali Lake will rise above and return the X-Men franchise to it's glory, but it shall never be. Watch this movie to see the truest, most triumphant synergy of comic books and the silver screen."

The action sequences in the film are quite intense or plentiful as they were in the original and some of the great characters get a bit of a toned down story in this one which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>The entire main cast returns and they are still one of the best cast group in film history...especially Superhero films. Hugh Jackman is still basically the star and he's as good, if not even better than he was in the original. He doesn't do as much fighting but more of his story is explored. Everyone else in the film takes a rather toned down, back seat to Wolverine's story. In some ways this is a good thing and unfortunate in other ways. Whereas James Marsden's Cyclops seemed to be a terrific character with witty one liners and a great screen presence in the original, he's almost wrote right out of the second installment. He gets a couple of emotional scenes involving his love interest (the still very wooden Famke Janssen as Jean Grey) but his lack of tough leadership makes the emotional scenes seem out of place. The addition of some new characters are very welcomed and well done. Alan Cumming is brilliant and a great character as Nightcrawler. Seemingly a bad guy he turns out to be an amazing hero. Cumming's performance is great and I hope he returns in the future. The slightly increased role of Iceman played by Shawn Ashmore is decent and not overused thankfully. I think his young character could be easily an annoyance to the big action scenes. Brian Cox as the newest bad guy, William Stryker is good, although I don't know if he's good enough in the sense that he takes on some powerful adversaries including Magneto played brilliantly by Ian McKellen and Wolverine (Jackman.) <br/><br/>X2 relies heavily on it's story and it's purpose is likely to bring together the original installment and the supposed final installment currently in theaters. As a story driven Superhero film it really works but after the non-stop intense battles and action scenes from the original you definitely feel the absence of the really big battles. Still that's not to deter you from an amazing series with a deeply rich character driven story. This is one series that is worth seeing absolutely, even if you're not familiar with the X-men of comics. You'll become familiar with them, Singer has done an incredible job thus far. 8/10"

","The X-Men are back in this sequel with great new characters and a great new story. Following an attack on the president, the X-Men discover that an army general named William Stryker is planning to destroy every mutant in the world by controlling Charles Xavier and forcing him to do so. The X-Men are forced to team up with Magneto and Mystique to fight Stryker. Meanwhile, Wolverine continues to search for clues of his past, and he discovers that Stryker is connected somehow. X2: X-Men United is a great film for action fans and X-Men fans alike. Whereas the first film was mainly to introduce the characters, Bryan Singer was really able to cut loose in this movie and make it more fun.<br/><br/>A couple of new characters are added to the mix this time around, including two of my favourites, Pyro and Nightcrawler. Pyro is an amazing character that comes across as an angsty teen who doesn't know where he stands. His main action scene is the most amazing scene in the movie...To me anyways, but I love fire, so...As for Nightcrawler, Alan Cumming does an amazing job in the role, and the opening sequence with Nightcrawler attacking the White House is just awesome. The characters from the last film are given bigger tasks this time around, and it's great to see what they can do now. Wolverine even has one of his trademark ""berserker rages"", and tears through the X-Mansion killing his enemies left and right. Once again, Ian McKellan is perfect as Magneto.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is so much better than the first one. It manages to go deeper than before and explore some real issues that relate to the way mutants are treated. For instance, a scene where Bobby Drake/Iceman telling his parents he's a mutant is reminiscent of a homosexual coming out to his parents. His mother even uses phrases such as ""We still love you Bobby"", and ""Have you tried...Not being a mutant?"" The plot even looks at political views as the president struggles over what to do about the ""mutant problem"".<br/><br/>X2 is an all around better film and makes for a really fun time. The best part about it is that you don't necessarily have to have seen the original to enjoy this. It's a stand alone movie as well as a sequel. Bryan Singer did a great job with the X-Franchise, and he gave Brett Ratner a difficult task when he left to do Superman, and Ratner took control of X3.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The struggle between humanity and the mutant race has grown stronger and reaching critical point. After an attack on the President by the mutant Nightcrawler, military scientist William Stryker uses this to take action into his own hands. Returning from Alciline Lake after finding no more clues to his past, Logan returns to Xavier's school of the gifted. Rogue and Bobby are currently dating; yet finding it challenging to be close to each other due to Rogue's power. Jean's powers are acting erratic, unintentionally affecting things around her. When Xavier locates Nightcrawler, Jean and Storm go after him, while Xavier and Scott visit Magneto. With Logan looking after the children, Stryker attacks the school. During this confrontation, Logan realises Stryker may hold keys to his locked past.<br/><br/>In an explosive, opening sequence of Nightcrawler's attack in the White House, it's easy to see Bryan Singer has taken this installment to the next level. X-Men 2 does follow the pattern of most sequels; increase the action, mind blowing stunts and special effects, yet there is something different too X-Men 2 that makes it stand out. While the action has increased, there is still character development, while bringing new characters to the mix. Wolverine's past is uncovered more, the love triangle between Logan, Jean and Scott is explored deeper. Rogue's and Bobby's love is tested with their inability to be close. Bobby's life is fleshed out more, with his revelation to his parents that he is a mutant.<br/><br/>X-Men 2 tapes back into the subtext set up in the first X-Men. Themes of acceptance, intolerance, fear of the unknown, are explored deeper, when they could have easily been dropped over the action. Missing from this installment are the quieter moments between characters; which made the first film so strong.<br/><br/>Bryan Singers direction is on a all new level. Action sequences are done on such a high standard with great detail. The opening scene of Nightcrawler's on the President is mind blowing. Wolvernie's fight with Deathstrike is greatly orchestrated; moving a such a fast pace. The original cast return to reprise their roles. Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos make for a stellar cast and are perfectly suited to their roles. Adding to the list Brian Cox is perfect as Stryker. Alan Cumming makes for a great Nightcrawler.<br/><br/>X-Men 2 is one of the greatest comic book adaptations. It has everything a fan wants; and more, with an ending that just leaves you salivating for the next installment."

","X-Men 2 was better than the first film. There were more action scenes, and the storyline was also a lot better.<br/><br/>X2 starts with an intense sequence in the White House involving the mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). He is sent to attack the president in order to start trouble for mutants everywhere. He was under the influence of a government official named Stryker(Brian Cox) who has a special serum that allows him to control any mutant's actions. He is the antagonist that all the mutants, including Magneto(Ian McKellen) and his group, have to deal with in order to stop from using Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)as a tool to kill all mutants with his great mental powers.<br/><br/>All the main characters from the last X-Men film return, with the exception of Sabertooth and Toad, for the sequel which had a more thought out storyline than last time. We also get a new mutant called Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) whose mutant ability is almost the same as Wolverine's. It was fun watching the two of them do battle.<br/><br/>X2 was incredibly fun to watch. Most of the performances were right on, but there were a few that still could've used some work just like in the first film. However none of those weaker performances detract from the movies overall appeal. I'm sure most people will enjoy it."

This is one of the best action film i've seen in a long time. With a very good fighting scenes, a very interesting plot and a breathless action. The actors are perfect for all the characters, with a surprisingly good acting for being an action film. OF course the best are Ian and stewart, who give their characters so great and unexpected strengh that makes the film much better as one should expect. The special effects are very good and effective, and the action scenes are very well filmed. Much better that the first part, which is unusual. Maybe the best adaptation of a Marvel comic is ever made on film. Congratulations. Any fan should forget to watch this film. The main problem is that, if you don't know about the comic, probably, during most of the film, you will not understand anything, as the film consider that you know about the setting (this makes the mark a little lower, though)."

","One of the best movies of the year. Of all the comic books made to film, there is only one which convinces. Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Daredevil, Catwoman, Wonderwoman, you name it, to me they are all boring and unable to bring across the intensity and essence of any of the comic book writers, especially when they copy George Lucas' idea of creating a prequel. I think the director was able to capture the essence of the story and the feeling of the mutants. The CG FX were pretty good, not great but good. The actors, cinematographers, and producers did a pretty good job at creating the picture and realize the directors vision. The script was well written and the cast well chosen. ""X-Men"" is a good movie, not like the Godfather but definitely the best of all comic books brought to life by film. Entertaining and worth the money.

","Seems that X2 has been a movie that has gotten the love or hate treatment, just not the the extreme with movies like Alien 3. To get one thing straight, X2 is not as good as the first X-Men, but it's still a fun and stylish watch that actually comes out better than what typical movie sequels deliver.<br/><br/>X2 starts out acting like the audience knows who everyone is, so if you haven't watched the first X-Men then you'd better watch it before this one, but why wouldn't you? Anyway, the character development isn't that deep since thanks to the first X-Men we all know who most of the mutants in X2 are, with the exception of Jason, Deathstrike and the infamous Nightcrawler, whom is awkwardly portrayed but still has a cool part in the beginning. Some of the main characters from the first movie don't have as big of a role in X2, instead, X2 allows the audience to get acquainted with some of the more or less underdeveloped mutants from the first like Iceman and Pyro.<br/><br/>The plot in X2 isn't anything special, but it's worthy to say the least. All you really need to know is Logan finds out why he became Wolveriene, who gave him his powers and that the school gets overtaken. X2 does however set the stage for X3, so expect to see that coming at us soon.<br/><br/>The special effects in X2 are certainly impressive, which help nicely to compliment the stylish action sequences that made the action in X-Men so fun to watch. It's these action scenes that make X2 so fun to watch and worth viewing multiple times. That and some humorous dialogue in a few areas will give fans of the first X-Men plenty of reason to like this movie.<br/><br/>Does X2 prove to be as good as the first, no. Does it do anything to change the way we look at movies, no. But X2 does give us plenty of reason to have faith in X3 and proves to itself that stylish action is enough to make a movie watchable, but relying on it isn't good enough."

","This next instalment of the marvel comics that set of the comic book superhero films has certainly lived up to my expectations. The film offers the same as the first film and more. Once again we get to see our favourite action hero's save the world from a growing threat, this time with the x-men and brotherhood working together. Xavier (Stewart) has been captured by a mutant hating military scientist, William Stryker (played by Brian Cox) and its up to the mutants to save him before he is tricked into using his powers to kill all the mutants in the world. As we see a return of the mutants from the first film as well as some new ones, we get to see more action and powers. We see Storm (Halle Berry) expand her powers to create powerful tornadoes, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Jean (Famke Jansen) struggle to keep their feelings under control and we also see Jean go through a power struggle and a personal sacrifice to save the ones she loves. This film has a lot to offer with action, sci-fi, comedy and romance. However, I felt that it could have been cut down by 20 minutes to get rid some unnecessary scenes and I was disappointed at how little of Cyclops we got to see.

","I think people have already agreed on the fact that this is the best comic to movie translation ever done (perhaps until X3), so I won't get into that.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so good when I total the tally can be squarely put on one director: Bryan Singer (And no, I'm not a friend of his or being compensated by him in any ways). What makes this movie better than other Marvel translations into the big screen is the following: First of all, casting is perfect (or direction is good enough to mask any flaws in casting). They're not selecting the actors based on their previous work but is an uniquely original mix of talent that when brought together, works. The cinematography is also excellent with special effects, props, lighting, background, color and mood is perfectly integrated on each scene. Plot and subplots all enhance the interesting quality of each superhero and villain, and it's not just a blurr of characters showing their super powers one after another.<br/><br/>The movie shows that you can be respectful to the original plot of the comic and yet tell a meaningful story in 2 hours. Unlike some other movies that are just superficial translation of character's name, costume, and powers. How deep the script writing, and screen play went into digging into the interesting aspects of the original comic is evident in this movie, and bringing them into life in the big screen shows the true genius of people who've worked on it.<br/><br/>I just wished that all other movie rendition of Marvel superheros are as good as this one. But for now, I'll be satisfied that at least one director's got it right."

"Bogmeister","8","0","0","3 September 2005"," They are gods among insects
","The sequel to X-Men(2000) is a slicker, more complex vision, expanding on the groundwork laid out in the first one. It lacks the raw energy busting out in the first X-Men, which introduced all the major characters, so here we're sort of coming into the middle of a story. The first scene in the White House (intro Nightcrawler by Cumming, very effective) actually mirrors the original aspects of the first film, but after that, you see Wolverine (Jackman) briefly on a quest in snow country, then ambling back to the X-Mansion. You already know all about him and his friends at Xavier's place. It's almost like the 2nd episode of a TV series, with a $100 million budget.<br/><br/>The film seems to lack a focal point, which, in the first, was Magneto (McKellen) as the master villain planning a super-terrorist act. Here, Magneto is forced to briefly team up with the X-Men and the only villain is a lowly obsessive human (Cox as Striker, very good, as usual). A strong theme, however, emerges. The mutants in this film are hinted at and depicted as even more powerful than believed by comparison to the first film. Magneto spells it out in conversation with young recruit Pyro; in his view, mutants are gods among the human insects, who are just bothersome. Professor X (Stewart) especially, is revealed as capable of wiping out the entire planet's population under the right (or wrong) circumstances. Even without the help of special machinery, he can affect crowds of normal people effortlessly. It's a scary and exciting subtext to the usual super-heroics. It also shows that maybe normal humans have a right to be fearful and untrusting of these superior beings.<br/><br/>Another strong point to the film is the further development of many of the characters. More of Magneto's and Mystique's relationship is subtly revealed. Rogue & Iceman try to expand on their's. Wolverine, again, is hi-lited, more of his past is explained. After the wild action in the first scene with the President (adding epic scope to the story), we have to wait for the big fight between Wolverine & Deathstrike (Hu) for a similar adrenaline rush - and it's a doozy, surprisingly vicious and energetic. It's this scene where we get to see Wolvie unleashed, not the earlier one in the Mansion with the soldiers, which is somewhat subdued and darkened. With so many characters, it's not surprising that at least one would get short shrift, in this case Cyclops (Marsden), who disappears for half the film. But that's not really to the film's detriment. It does slow a bit in spots around the middle, tho not seriously. I think the only ones who would actually be let down by this entry are viewers whose expectations were way too high, such as expecting hordes of Sentinels to run rampant over the world."

","X2: 6/10: X2 solves the biggest problem I had with the original X-men movie. I am no longer rooting for the wrong side. <br/><br/>You see in the first film I quickly found myself agreeing with the bad guys led by Ian McKellen rather than the good guys led by Captain Picard himself Patrick Stewart. I simply felt the so-called bad guys were right and on top of that simply had a better plan. Since McKellen and Stewart are working together in this film (however temporarily) that point is mooted. <br/><br/>The other improvement over the last film is more coherent and effective action sequences. Part of this is due to a bigger budget and better F/X technology, but director Bryan Singer also seems to have a better grip on the pacing and shooting of both the action sequences in particular and the entire film. <br/><br/>A better grip on the characters on the other hand still seems the series weak point. Part of this is my fault.I am simply not familiar enough with the X-men universe and their powers. For example we have Stewart's character able to kill everyone on earth with his thoughts but unable to escape the mental influence of a little girl. The rest of the powers are often as sloppy. <br/><br/>One great example is the groaner when Magneto draws the iron from blood to make bullets. Even the characters get confused as nobody remembers that there is an Iceman on the plane when the killer tidal wave approaches.<br/><br/>Also, as in the first film, a chunk of time is spent on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character. He is cool and all but I still am not sure why he is considered a mutant? (If he has a metal skeleton surrounded by flesh and was built by humans I thinking cyborg) <br/><br/>Throw in another dozen or so good and bad guys to keep track of and the confusion seems clear. As a result there is no real emotional attachment and a lot of confusion regarding the characters. <br/><br/>Add on a clumsy coming out to your parents parable and a generally PC vibe of the good guys and I can't recommend the film. Also where exactly in McKellen's clear jail cell suspended from the ceiling is the bathroom?"
"mhajs","8","0","0","5 May 2005"," The evolution of Bryan Singer along with the mutants!
","***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>This time, Bryan Singer has proved that he is much more talented directing a sequel for the X-Men series. The first one was alright, but the second movie is superb. You don't get to know many more characters (at least from the comic books), only the Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), whose make-up make him much more different and strange than in GoldenEye, where he plays the hacker Boris. But you get to know more characters who help in the plot analysis like William Striker (Brian Cox) and others. What really makes X2 a much more fun movie than its prequel is not just the action sequences which are not only great, they are much greater than the almost none action from X-Men (2000), but also the plot, which is told in a very better way and the script too. <br/><br/>The movie begins much more ambitious than the first one, showing us scenes of attacks like the attack of the Nightcrawler in the white house, the incident in the shopping center and the assault from the Striker's squad in Xavier's teaching school. And not only the film-making of the movie is much greater, but the cast improved a lot their performance, specially Halle Berry, who gets a bigger role as Storm. Rebecca Mijoln-Stamos is much greater as Mystique also, and as sometimes it happens in some movies (like Star Wars - Episode II : Attack Of The Clones [2002], where Anthony Daniels not only plays 3PO but plays some guy in the bar in the beginning of the movie without 3PO's costume), Stamos also plays Grace, the girl who seduces the guard who later gets killed by Magneto by absorbing from his body metal pieces which got inside his body because of Grace's shot in his back. This is really interesting because it shows us that not only the actor or actress can play a better role, but at the same time, can play multiple roles, one with a fantasy costume and another without it. There are also other new actors like Kelly Hu and Aaron Stanford who plays Pyro. There's also bigger participation in the movie by Bobby (Shawn Ashmore). The rest of the cast including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin and others are still here for our happiness. <br/><br/>In X2, Striker manages to find a way to control mutants in order to make them do what he wants like when Magneto tells him everything about Xavier's mansion so he can find where Cerebro is. Actually Striker's goal is to make his own Cerebro. After Nightcrawler joins the party, they go to the underground base where Striker is trying to recreate the Cerebro. That leads to more action sequences and more plot analysis. There's also something that goes wrong with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) at the end of the movie, but this I prefer not to spoil. <br/><br/>Overall, X2 is a great sequel and not only I'm looking forward to watch it again, I'm also looking forward for X3.

","Almost every major Hollywood blockbuster of recent years has had its sequel,and more often than not,the sequel has outperformed the original in terms of both quality and box-office success.This movie is no exception.X2 is a pleasure to watch,right from the beginning to the end.First of all,this film has many new characters.By introducing us to the school for the mutants,Director Brian Singer gives us a colorful cast of teen aged mutant heroes,thus making the film more attractive to the younger audience.As was the case with the first movie,here too it is Hugh Jackman who takes center-stage with his realistic performance.Of course,Halle Berry as Storm and Famke Janssen as Gene are both brilliant.Special mention must be made of Alan Cumming who plays the Nightcrawler.He delivers a credible performance and his character plays a pivotal role in the story too:it is he who leads Storm into Cerebro and it is he who saves the life of Rogue(played by Anna Paquin).Anna Paquin shows a lot of promise-she does her role a lot better than she did in the previous installment.Now to the action.X2 has fantastic special effects,easily outdoing the first film.I especially liked the scene where Magneto(played by Sir Ian Mckellen) breaks out of his plastic prison.Great stuff.this ! I also loved the fight between Hugh Jackman and Kelly Hu-what a pity that this beautiful 'Scorpion King 'leading lady didn't get a bigger role !The big surprise in the movie is when we get to see Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as she really looks-in one,oh so short scene !Makes you wonder why the CGI guys had to be so cruel to her. All things considered,this film is indeed a great sequel -and I wouldn't at all mind if Singer gives us X3."

","X2 <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS<br/><br/>Following an attempt on the US President's life by what appears to be a rogue mutant (Alan Cumming), the school for 'gifted youngsters' established by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is raided by military factions opposed to the integration of mutants into American society. The X-Men are subsequently forced into a collaboration with their mortal enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) to clear their names and destroy an all-powerful threat from humankind...<br/><br/>Opening with one of the most astonishing action set-pieces of recent years (underscored by the 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's 'Requiem'), and closing with an extended confrontation between Good and Evil that tops anything in the original X-MEN (2000), Bryan Singer's powerhouse sequel ups the ante in terms of spectacle and excitement, whilst simultaneously expanding and developing the radical subtext (a minority group forced to take a stand against prejudice) inherent in the original Marvel comic strip. Beautifully filmed, and performed with gusto by a dedicated cast (including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox, relegating Patrick Stewart, James Marsden and Anna Paquin to secondary roles this time out), the narrative unfolds with bold precision, constantly surprising the audience with inventive visuals and heartfelt emotional drama (the mutant 'coming out' scene - played with knowing irony by young Shawn Ashmore - will resonate especially with gay viewers). Also, this is one of the few movies in recent years to use the Super 35 format in a defiantly cinematic manner, with none of the concessions to television which usually characterize this 'fake' widescreen process. Followed by X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006)."

","The first ""X-Men"" movie had plenty to recommend it--good action sequences, strong cast--but it was, ultimately, a set-up for a franchise. While the film was on the surface about a group of super-humans fighting external prejudice and internal threats, it was also establishing the world and the characters for future installments--at least for those who have little to no experience with the comic books on which the franchise is based. But it's hard to complain, as ""X2: X-Men United"" fully justifies the effort.<br/><br/>We pick up where the first movie ended: telepathic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) presides over a private school where budding mutants can nurture their minds and talents away from the cruelties of humanity, the renegade Magneto (Ian McKellen) languishes away in a plastic cell (his mutant powers, as indicated by his name, would render metal bars an insufficient restraint), and lone wolf Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still trying to piece together his past. But an attack at the White House stirs up anti-mutant sentiment in the public, and it isn't long before the usual assortment of government thugs are after our heroes. All of this ends up tying into one General Stryker (Brian Cox), a militant who's made it his goal in life to subdue and destroy mutantkind, forcing the mutants who were enemies in the first movie into an uneasy alliance.<br/><br/>This sounds like a lot for one movie to handle--and there are several subplots we don't have time to go into now--but Bryan Singer is more successful at keeping the various characters and story lines in play than he was in the first film. Part of this, of course, is due to the fact that a large majority of the characters were established in part one, but ""X2"" on the whole is a tighter and more cohesive screenplay, resulting in a more satisfying film on the whole.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is, once again, very good. McKellen has the opportunity to take Magneto and run with him, and unsurprisingly creates a character both sympathetic and reprehensible (considering Magneto was established in the first movie as a Holocaust survivor, his actions towards the end of this one are the height of irony). Likewise, Cox's Stryker is a vile man, but one whose actions spring from a very understandable place. Jackman reminds us why Wolverine proved to be his break-out role, playing a fine balance between the character's feral strength and rage and his carefully concealed inner turmoil. Strongest among the newcomers is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler, the mutant who attacks the president in the opening sequence but who soon proves a useful ally to the good guys. He also has the distinction of being one of the few openly Catholic characters I can recall who is neither a hypocrite or a self-righteous bastard, and his deep but unforced spirituality is very refreshing.<br/><br/>The end for ""X2"" contains what is blatantly a set-up for a third film, but who's complaining? If they can keep up the good work like this, I'm more than happy with the implied ""To Be Continued."""

","I went to see X2 with a couple of buddies and found the movie to be thoroughly entertaining. After the movie, I thought about the problems of being unwanted, hated, and the tragedy and violence against others, all presented in more comical ways in the film. The film comes back from where the first X-Men (2000) left off. The school is normal order under Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his mutant teachers: Storm (Halle Berry),Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), and the rebel mutant Wloverine (Hugh Jackman).<br/><br/>After the government invades the school and capture a few students, the mutants must come together to stop the evil scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox) with the help of Magneto (ian McKellen) and a tele-porter named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming).

","Sequels are notorious for being sour flops and dragging down the franchise of their successful predecessors. But it seems recently that things might be looking up for those directors who want to pull their films back out of their attics for a sequel. You just have to look in the media to see the names of sequels buzzing around with respectful reviews: Spiderman 2, Shrek 2, and Harry Potter.<br/><br/>And X2: X-Men United is a much better movie all round than its 2000 predecessor.<br/><br/>The new movie is once again based on the admirable Marvel Comics of heroic mutant superheroes who battle for their place in the discriminating world. The movie follows on from X-Men, which was used as a form of ""prologue"" for viewers to get to know the characters of the X-Men world. X-Men was an action-fuelled film of heavy character development padded by popular but widely exaggerated extravaganza of special effects, topped with some amusing one-liners  ""Don't you people ever die?"" and some deep thinkers, ""Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand."" <br/><br/>However, I'm pleased to say director Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"") has certainly got more confidence in his actors and the storyline. And it shows wonderfully. Simply by the way in which the actors have got deeper into their roles and how the script unravels without any glitches  he has allowed the movie to progress with more intelligence since he is now fully aware that the fans out there love it!<br/><br/>X2 brings back actors from the previous film who all continue to shine in their designated roles. Hugh Jackman, who made his big debut in Hollywood in X-Men returns as the notorious Wolverine, also the wheelchair bound psychic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and the visually stunning Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Also not forgetting to mention the one-eyed leader, Cyclops (James Marsden), ivory-haired beauty Storm (Halle Berry) and the untouchable Rogue (Anna Paquin).<br/><br/>The change in the new film is not overly dramatic; it feels more as if it has got a good kick up the backside to help get it into proper working gear. As in 'X-Men' the film revolves around the mutants continuing the traditional and tiringly clichéd battle between the good guys and the villains. At least here the double enemies of Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) and the human population give it a personalised flavour of a three-sided war.<br/><br/>The film explodes onto screen in a sizzling cloud of blue smoke, revealing Bryan's first new entry to X2, Nightcrawler, played captivatingly by Alan Cumming. I have to say that this film opening has to be one of the best I have ever seen. It's as if we never left the world of 'X-Men' behind as we are pulled into some delicious special effects portraying an assassin battle in the Whitehouse. Intended as a hook, it sure launches us in right off our cinema seats and reels us into the world we have grown to love.<br/><br/>Replacing the late Senator Kelly is the hulking and menacing William Stryker (Brian Cox), a vengeful human scientist who is determined to eradicate the mutant population from the world, using the imprisoned Magneto and Charles's Cerebro to try and accomplish his potentially devastating plans. He is side kicked by a silent but deadly beauty Yuriko Oyama/Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) who illustrates some suspiciously familiar traits as she takes part in a final battle with Wolverine.<br/><br/>Whilst William Stryker and his battles form the focus of the plot, it is cleverly intertwined by Wolverine's ever-continuous search for his past. And after a night of reluctant babysitting, he is forced face to face with his creator, which is displayed after a visual feast of roaring brutality with Wolverine slicing his way through forces of soldiers  and whilst we would normally object to such unmerciful killing  the Wolverine is protecting the kids who live at Xavier's mansion. So, naturally, we are on his side!<br/><br/>As expected, this film has a barrage of special effects and some are so good that they almost go unnoticed (Iceman icing up Wolverine's Dr. Pepper is one!) but they seem to settle in comfortably in the plot. Rather than being there to impress, they are there to tell the story, like they should be. The action scenes of this film are high standard, but amidst all the exploding and striking there is the subtle charm of Jean and Logan's (Wolverine) toying affections, which travel throughout the movie, leading to a wonderful mid-movie crescendo.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a big step up from 'X-Men' in all respects. The special effects are superb, the character portrayal is spot on and this time round, the plot is oddly refreshing (even though, as mentioned before it is the same good guy/bad guy fodder.)<br/><br/>This film is another that proves that sometimes, sequels are well worth the money.<br/><br/>(The two disc DVD also has a lot of juicy extra's any X-fan would want, so if you're considering buying it, do so today!)"

","I really liked X-Men, it was one of the few comic adaptations that really made it big, and also made it right. So I was keen to see if X2 had managed to carry the successful conversion to the big screen again. Word of mouth had it that it was good, but I didn't realise just how good.<br/><br/>The movie is excellent. Truly as a movie fan there's not much I can find wrong with this film, and as a comic fan there's not much I can find wrong with the adaptation. If I were pressed then Cyclops is perhaps too wooden and Storm not quite angry enough, but these are tiny failings, tiny.<br/><br/>The story is very well written and the characters paths pulled together very skillfully. The introduction of Nightcrawler is superbly done, with the first action scene kicking the action and effects into top gear. Alan Cumming plays the character wonderfully, and despite my first thoughts at being such an odd choice, he fills the role perfectly.<br/><br/>Each strand of the story that involves each character begins to pull in different directions, but as the story moves along the strands cross and begin to merge, before all of the characters return to fight the one cause, and the one enemy. What is so different for this movie is the fight as truly moved to humans against X-Men, the war is upon them.<br/><br/>Acting talent abounds here, with Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and they all manage to lift the performance of even the smallest character. The weakest links are slight blemishes and really require some serious investigation, Cyclops slightly wooden style and the slightly bland performance of Halle Berry who seems to fail to capture the true anger and strength of the Storm character.<br/><br/>Let's be honest though, I am nitpicking, and otherwise this is a truly excellent movie, great entertainment and tension throughout. It's also one of the best comic book adaptations, perhaps even the best to date."

","There are no words to describe how great this movie was. Much better than it's predecessor and doesn't even compare to Daredevil or the first Spiderman.<br/><br/>This time around, our X-men encounter a military group who is bound to kill any mutants at any costs. Led by Brian Cox who has a much bigger desire to kill the x-men than before Sentor Kelley died. Where his part is now being taken by Mystique ""Rebecca Romjin Stamos."" This movie takes a very unpredicted situation at the end where Jean Grey ""Famke Janssen"" meets her end and a very wet one at that. I wasn't expecting that at all. Which this ending has led no where to turn but enter a very huge part of X-Men. THE PHONEIX SAGA. Which is nice because i was watching the extra's for the first X-men film and Ms. Janssen clearly said she never really wanted a huge part. Well, now your gonna have take on one because The Phoniex is huge part and you'll finally take the spotlight from the recently rejected Halle Berry ""Storm"" who has reluctantly given up X-men 3 for roles like ROBOTS which will be a flop and the oh so great Catwoman.<br/><br/>Now, since Jean met her sticky end, this seriously destroys Scott ""James Mardsen"" and suffers huge emotional problems. I think he will have a hard time fighting when the love of his life fell for the sake of him and the others to safety.<br/><br/>Anyway, the rest of the cast return, Hugh Jackman, Ian Mckellan who by the way escaped his plastic prison, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and Shawn Ashmore who is given a bigger part this time. And some new characters where added Kelly Hu ""Kelly Who,"" Alan Cumming who plays Nightcrawler in which i didn't honestly think that he would do all that great but i was wrong, and Aaron Stanford who plays Pyro and basically follows our hero's around and which evidently ends up with Magneto ""Ian McKellan"" in the end.<br/><br/>All and all, this movie is great and shows us what people are willing to do and still be criticized for who they are.

","""X2""(Or ""X Men 2"")is one of those rarities in which the sequel surpasses the original. After an attempt on the President's life by a mutant, a war between humans and mutants is on the verge. Stoking the flames of hatred is General Stryker, who uses the situation to forge ahead with his own agenda: the total annihilation of the mutant species. This film is much darker than the first film (Jean Grey's increasing powers, Cerebro being used for a weapon of mass destruction against the humans AND mutants). Ian McKellan almost steals the film (Favorite line? Before he disposes of a guard in his plastic prison,with the help of Mystique, he says ""Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman, especially one that is interested in you.""). However, it is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and Kelly Hu as Deathstrike that pretty much take the film."

","Wolverine is back! And so are the rest of the X-Men, I guess. This time around, we have a new bad guy, and some new X-Men.<br/><br/>'X2' opens with a teleporting mutant attacking the White House and making an attempt on the President's life. Instantly recognizable to anyone who reads the comics, this new guy is Nightcrawler, and he seems to be under some sort of mind-control. Soon after, the Xavier Institute is attacked by General Stryker, a mutant-hater who seems to know secrets about Wolverine's past. The X-Men are scattered, and Professor X missing, they must team up with former foes to find Stryker and stop his dastardly plans.<br/><br/>It must have been hard to top 'X-Men', but Bryan Singer and David Hayter did it again. While 'X2' doesn't blow 'X-Men' out the water, it is better. With most of the characters already introduced and a longer running time, we get treated to a better story and some new characters, and even nods to the fans with a great many references to other characters, events, and places from the comics. The human / mutant bigotry remains the main theme, but this time the villain is a human with anti-mutant intentions, as opposed to the mutant with anti-human intentions from the first movie.<br/><br/>Action and special effects are still top-notch. Colussus even makes a small appearance, and his metal skin is done very well. All the fight scenes are better, and Wolverine's final fight with (Lady) Deathstrike completely outshining the showdown between Wolverine and Sabretooth in the first movie. Other scenes (including Nightcrawler attacking the White House and the assault on the Xavier Institute) are exciting and executed perfectly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have a few more complaints this time around. Cyclops has even less screen-time than he had in the first film, and he is supposed to be the X-Men's leader! Like seemingly everyone else, I didn't like Halle Berry as Storm. She just isn't the wise, but powerful Storm from the comics. On a similar note, I didn't like the film's interpretation of Lady Deathstrike. She has one line in the entire movie, and should not be playing second-fiddle to General Stryker. I have a feeling she was thrown in just because of the association with Wolverine.<br/><br/>Speaking of Wolverine, he is my favourite of the X-Men, but the movie does center around him again. Either make a Wolverine movie or an X-Men movie. In more Wolverine news, Kitty Pryde appears in one scene, just as she did in the first. She is another of my favourites, and I'd like to see her do a little bit more than appear as a nod to the fans.<br/><br/>Overall, 'X2' is better than 'X-Men', but you really have to see 'X-Men' before watching this, especially for those who aren't fans of the comics. It has a nice ending, leaving room in 'X-Men 3' for one of the biggest story-arcs in 40 years of X-Men comics - 9/10"
"Jexxon","9","0","0","11 January 2005"," This is how you do it!
","The best comic book/superhero movie to date. Singer et al takes an already good first film and improves it on every level. A rather simple story - mutants must unite in order to fight off crazy general Stryker, who's out to kill them all - works excellent, and is all you need to hold the film together.<br/><br/>Before I saw the original X-Men, I knew nothing of the characters. This is, however, not a problem in any of the two movies. I can totally buy the myriad of characters and the universe which they inhabit. And let's face it - there are a lot of characters. X2 has a huge number of participants and the real miracle is that everyone (even Halle Berry) works so good. I was never lost, but could easily follow what was happening on screen.<br/><br/>This really is an ensemble piece, and everyone steps up to the challenge. The two ""blues"", Nightcrawler and Mystique, rightly have a lot of screen time. The mix of veterans like the wonderful McKellen, and newcomers like Ashmore creates a nice dynamic to the film.<br/><br/>The bigger budget has allowed for better and more effects that certainly are impressive. The opening attack on the White House is one of the best individual action sequences I've ever seen. Overall, the film looks fantastic and it has a nice dark tone to it. The two-hour-plus runtime whisks by fast, and if it wasn't for a slight lag in pace towards the end of the film I would have given it a ten. Bring on X3! [9/10]"

"Cephyran","9","0","0","4 October 2004"," Best comic sequel ever!
","I went to this with my friends opening night, and we were all quite pleased. From what I gather, the studio made decent cash from the first one, and thus they were able to take everything that made it really cool as well as meaningful, and crank it up by a lot in the sequel. They went a little more intense with the sequel, too. for an example, in the first film, you can account for about six people who actually die. In this one, Wolverine matches and exceeds this headcount in five minutes during his most action-intensive scene. I don't want to spoil it for you, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, go out and rent it, for gosh's sakes! It is studded with great moments. In the average movie, there is a spot where you can walk away for about five minutes, which is about the typical bathroom break you'd take while in a theater. As far as I'm concerned, there was not one of these moments in X2. It keeps moving, keeping the action coming, and if it's not an action intense scene, then it's a decent scene showing the human element or the emotional weights of the characters. And of course, there's always a tiny sliver of comic relief, played out in this movie by the interaction of Logan's less than pleasant personality and most everyone else. Overall, this has to be the best comic-movie sequel yet. Spider-Man 2 was decent, but it wasn't as balanced as X2. I highly recommend you see this movie. If you're an X-Men fan, and you haven't seen this movie (the odds of you actually existing is exponentially low, but you never know) you have have HAVE to see this movie! You will enjoy it."
"jayfrenchstudios","Null","0","0","29 September 2004"," I have to say, one of the best superhero movies to date...
","Though that's hard to say, mostly because a sci-fi/action film like this goes well beyond being a ""great superhero movie"". I'm a long-time fan of the X-Men, having read the comics (on and off) since the '80s, then going back and reading the beginnings from the '60s. I was very excited when the first movie came out, and enjoyed it thoroughly, though I found some faults to it (pretty much everything involving the senator seemed unnecessary and boring). X2 has actually managed to surpass it's original (which I've noticed a lot of sequels outdoing their firsts). The whole thing started with an overqualified staff. Oscar winners Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Shakespearian greats Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Even Bruce Davison and Famke Janssen have been around quite a while and have many great films under their belts (hell, Bruce was the original ""Willard""!). The thing that really got me excited as I researched the first film before its release was Bryan Singer's direction. Oh my God! The ""Usual Suspects"" guy is directing! Talk about overqualified for the source material. As a comic, X-Men was an entity unto itself, several other titles and characters have had truly great stories and runs (Batman was a household word long before any movie serials, cartoons or films), but few capture the times and hearts as much as our friendly mutants. Alienation. Racism. Sexism. Isolation. Teamwork. Love conquers all. That's what X-Men was about. So I was quite happy to find they'd gotten ""over-qualified"" participants. X2 did what can probably only be done by a sequel. Now you know the characters (we had to spend so much time introducing them and their world in the first one), let's tell a real STORY about them. Yeah, the women are hot, but name me a movie (especially in sci-fi or action) where the women AREN'T hot. More than that, they embrace their characters. Famke IS Jean Grey, authoritative yet gentle. Brilliant but feminine. An underlying rage of power beneath her calm exterior. Halle is wonderful as Storm, taking after her later, more angry and violent persona. Paquin redefines Rogue, who is cocky, flirtatious and rambunctious in the comics. This Rogue is lost, confused and just trying to fit in and find her strength. This was what Jubilee did in the first animated X-Men series, or what Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat did in the '80s. They gave us a connection of someone on the outside, discovering their mutantcy and joining this strange new world. Marsden plays a PERFECT Cyclops. Cool, commanding, militant, yet his underlying passion for Jean is a volcano of emotion. Would've liked to have seen a little more of his character, but... *****WARNING! PLOT SPOILER****DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!***** ...his powerful scene of grief with Logan towards the end is breath-taking. <br/><br/>Stewart as Prof. X, who else could it have been? Not just because he's a paternal, bald man, but because he's known to us, the audience, as a cerebral man (mostly thanks to Star Trek: NG). McKellen's Magneto was more than I could've hoped for. Even though the big M is depicted as a big, muscular, grim looking son-of-a-b** in the comics, McKellen managed to get that across despite being an older, shorter, gayer man himself. Amazing. <br/><br/>Jackman was a perfect selection for Logan. I was a little taken aback by the first film, because I knew the Wolverine in the comics. He was shorter, much older looking, and a lot less pleasing to the eye! Jackman was able to make all these physical differences forgettable, as his character was dead-on (despite even being written a little less obnoxious than the comics' version). I've enjoyed Jackman's other work, Kate & Leopold, Swordfish, Van Helsing... but he was born to play Wolverine, and I believe he does his best work at the role. In reference to some negative comments I've heard about this movie... Was Prof. X's ability to kill every mutant or human over the top? Not according to the comics. Many forget, both comic readers or film viewers alike, just how powerful Charles is. Was there some ridiculous love-plot going on between Storm and Nightcrawler?<br/><br/>I don't think that's what the director or writers were going for. Just because people of opposite sexes are having a connection and developing a relationship in a movie doesn't mean it's romantic. I myself am married, but most of my best friends are women. Go figure. Wasn't Deathstrike's role pointless and robotic? Maybe it's just me, but I thought that WAS the point. Yukio in the comics was a former lover of Logan's, who turned on him and became a bloodthirsty, evil person. I liked this tactically cold, calculating and nigh-unstoppable Deathstrike. Showing just a clue of her humanity at the end, and a brilliant shot of Logan's sorrow that her villainy wasn't the real girl's fault or decision, though he knew he had no choice. Ah well... I'm babbling. A truly great film in general and in it's genre. Thanks!"

","Unique - a special effects extravaganza SEQUEL with fascinating, well-played characters and a truly scary plot. Professor X, the X-Men, their arch-enemy Magneto and his cronies find themselves sort of on the same team against absolutely evil mutant killer. McKellen and Stewart really fit and play off each other as well as any two actors in movies today. I was disappointed by underwritten Paquin role while Jackman continues to grow as a lead, they almost have too many good characters to spread enough around. *Spoiler* Docked two entire points (the biggest penalty ever!) for two major killings late in the movie - they occurred in the film's two hokiest sequences and proved absolutely nothing. If they felt like they had to kill the characters off they could have picked a more poignant reason and scenario than they did. There's a lot to work with here if they can just keep themselves under control. 8 of 10 (after assessment of the penalty)"

","When the first movie came out I thought it was the coolest movie. But then the second one came out. Wow this one the best yet. Storm was hot as usual but, the person that surprised the most was Jean. She was the movie basically. In every scene you would see her powers advancing and turning into the great phoenix. If your a fan of the cartoons, you have been waiting for this for a while, and hopefully all of you fans were satisfied as I was with these 2 films. I know if the first one was great and the second even better, the next one is bound to be amazing. Unfortunately, the next one will won't be coming out until 2006.

","This is a good super-hero movie. They still had the problems that they had the problems that plagued the first one, with a little more, but I won't go into it. <br/><br/>Wolverine's past is still a mystery from before he met Stryker. I think it's because his mind blocks out anything that happened before he met up with Stryker. It has to do with his healing ability (apparently it's mental as well as physical, and in the comics, he did something very horrific). Cyclops taking on Jean like that was great. The idea to use Stryker's son to make that chemical (not sure if it's original or from the comics) was very smart, I thought. I notice that a lot of people I talk to also think that Storm and Kurt(Nightcrawler)have a romantic thing. I think they just have a great friendship and respect for each other. <br/><br/>I think that Cyclops and Prof. X were kind of underused (well, maybe not the Professor), but that was to help us ask where did they go and what the heck is Stryker up to? <br/><br/>This is another good movie. However, what really clinched it that the first one was better was the fact that they ended with a voice-over by Jean about the process of Evolution. This not as good as Spider-man, but it is better then Batman. Very nice. I just wish that there was another way for them to have their powers besides Evolution. Oh, well."

","Well lets just say it starts at very fast pace no messing with this. Special effects are superb. Better than the original X Men. It leaves off from where the first one ended. Wolverine searching how he became what he is. Patrick Stewart does a great performance along with Ian McKellen. There is quite a few twists in the film but it is easy to follow. It was also nice to see a few more mutants in it which did lack in the first one. Plenty of action in this one very little time to relax. Brian Cox does his bit too with a convincing performance. Overall I recommend you go watch this very entertaining. Lets hope that Bryan Singer is going to do another one a fine piece of work."

Peter Wingfield as cute but evil soldier guy.<br/><br/>6. Yay slash! Scott and Logan so slashy esp after Jean ""dies"". And I thought Scott was going to kiss Prof X just before that.<br/><br/>7. Yay Bobby! Liked Iceman much better this time around, less of a kid.<br/><br/>8. More psycho-Wolverine! It may be wrong but he just wouldn't be the Wolvie we know and love if he didn't gut a few people along the way. Also loved the putting the cigar out scene.<br/><br/>9. Ian McKellen, Magneto so much camper than Gandalf. So wry, so sad when betraying Xavier, so cool when breaking out of prison. Mystique also muchos cool.<br/><br/>10. Patrick Stewart. The only man they could ever have cast as Prof X.<br/><br/>In short. The movie is a masterpiece of nerdish comic-book heroism, tight outfits, slash and groovy effects matched up to some pretty good acting and is thus best film in world ever. Wolverine is a sex god beyond belief. Aragorn's ass is out the window. But I still want Orlando Bloom to play Gambit in the next one because I am strange that way."

Magneto and his cronies, determined to wipe out humanity must once again be halted by those who have decided to safeguard humanity from the embittered Magneto. It is world order that can only exist through co-existence of Humans and Mutants.

"colonel_green","10","0","0","9 August 2004"," What every comic book movie should be.
","2000's ""X-Men"" was the first majorly successful comic book movie in many years, and it revived the entire genre.  It's sequel ""X2"" arrived in theatres one year after ""Spider-Man"" broke box office records, and with adaptations of many other comics either delivered or on the way.  Fans were legion in their anticipation, and the general public was waiting to see if the franchise would falter, or if it would soar.  It was the latter, clearly.  ""X2"" was truly glorious, perhaps the greatest comic book movie ever made. Director Bryan Singer returns to his creation (sadly, he will not finish the trilogy with ""X3""), and brings with him crack screenwriters like David Hayter.  The massive cast of the original film also returns, with some (Halle Berry) having significantly increased their star power since the original film. The villain this time around his Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox, the original Dr. Hannibal Lecter), and his mind-controled mutant assistant Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu, a menacing presence, but with little to do). Stryker schemes to rid the world of all mutants, with the unwilling help of both Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart).  Stryker's plan involves using Professor X's mental powers to kill every mutant on the planet, and uses mind-control to get information from the imprisoned Magneto.  With Professor X and Cyclops in his grasp, and the remaining X-Men reeling from Stryker's assault, Magneto executes his escape from his plastic prison; he, Mystique, and the X-Men head to Canada to stop Stryker. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) feels that Stryker was involved in his past in some capacity, and this ads an additional level of intrigue.  Another addition to the X-Men is Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a deeply religious mutant who was once controled by Stryker. Singer finds an excellent balance between action and character, and gives screentime to his entire cast (although some, like Professor X, are shortchanged).  He crafts some truly brilliant action sequences, the best being Nightcrawler's assault on the Oval Office. The cast is as good as before, with Berry making some improvement (but remaining the weak link; I'm not sorry that ""X3"" will be without her). I give it a 9/10, and I hope that we can look forward to many more X-Men movies."

","If you are a fan of the X-men comic books it is impossible not to like this movie. Some of the best characters from the comic book are here (Professor Xavier, Storm, Rogue, Wolverine) and the adaptation from comic book to film is very successful. But even if you are not a fan of the comic book or you have never heard of the X-men (though this is highly unlikely) this still is a great movie.<br/><br/>It's visually great, the score fits in perfectly, the acting ranges from adequate to very good (Ian McKellen is great as Magneto), it's packed with action and, like any good comic book, raises some issues (like prejudice) which are treated superficially. There is enough character development to actually care for the characters and Singer's changes from the comic book work just fine.<br/><br/>The first movie was pretty good but this one is even better.

It was the same friend who introduced me to this web-site, and it is addictive, looking up quotes and checking up on actors and actresses. During X2, I loved the humour Wolverine brings to the story, and his 'hate' relationship with Cyclops. I really felt for them both when they are crying near the end, but I wont give away what happens. You will have to watch it and see, then get sucked into the marvel world with me!

","The second movie in the X-Men universe is very satisfying. It might not look like the comic book, but that's understandable. In fact, I think that it was appropriate, as the themes in the mutant world are serious, and therefore, the film should look serious. If the X-Men were living with us right now, they would look like they were here. Do you think Cyclops would wear that blue-spandex suit? Or would Wolverine don the pointy mask? See, it would look silly. I also admired how they visualized Nightcrawler's teleporting ability. Black smoke goes well with the somewhat looks-deprived character. The Blackbird was great, as was their mansion. See, they brought to life a lot of things from the comic, but they did not do enough. I mean, guys, are you not itching to see Psylocke? Now I think when you do X3, and if Psylocke is there, please don't give her too much clothing. I think what's in the comic is fine as is. Also these characters - Omega Red, Forge, Mr. Sinister, Beast, Banshee, Gambit, Cable(hey, he's also a mutant)."

"coy_dog0","6","0","0","12 June 2004"," Derivative title says it all.
","This film is tighter and more coherent than the first film (X1?); but overall, I would say that Brian Singer is an unfocused, mediocre director. There are some great (if derivative) action sequences, but the story seems pieced together from other sources, all in way that guarantees the viewer will be momentarily pleased (simply because the film reminds them of OTHER blockbusters), but in the end, one walks away feeling a bit unsatisfied. <br/><br/>Once again, the film is saved by the actors (some of them at least). Ian McKellen turns in another brilliant performance. Hugh Jackman continues his reign as the best leading man in Hollywood (despite appearing in inferior product over and over again), and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) brings a dimension to the character that never came to fruition in the comic book's long history.<br/><br/>The other ""actors"" aren't really actors at all. James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn- Stamos and Halle Berry are all former models that should've stayed in that profession instead of sullying this one. Famke Jennsen, another former model, is an adequate actress, but radiates none of the qualities that Jean Grey possesses in the comic (wise and commanding, she is the matriarch of the team).<br/><br/>In the first film, the team seemed lost in their own story. Here, they're a little better off, but they all still seem a little insecure in those black, leather outfits. No one (including Singer) seems to be certain how to treat these characters. On one hand, we've got a somewhat realistic rendition of the superhero (bravo, for once), on the other hand, we're stuck with YET ANOTHER b-movie plot that involves the 'bad-guy' trying to do harm to the ENTIRE PLANET--just as Magneto did in the first film (well, he tried to change everyone in NYC into a mutant, which is about as plausible as the Black Panthers detonating a bomb to turn everyone Black.)<br/><br/>In the end, this film looks and feels better than it actually is. You have to really pay attention to see how lame some of the scenes are, so here are a few examples I picked out for you:<br/><br/>In the final act, Stryker becomes frantic when he learns that the damn is going to burst, and thus release millions of tons of water on his head and probably kill him (or something). Immediately after this revelation, we find Wolverine lurking through the same room where he gained his metal skeleton and claws. Stryker walks in with Lady Deathstrike and says something like: ""I thought you were the only mutant that had a healing factor.....I WAS WRONG!' (this is followed by Deathstrike popping her claws). Oohhh! This sets up the fight that ensues...and makes NO SENSE in the context that it takes place. Stryker just found out he has a limited amount of time to save his skin, so he takes a pause to dramatically introduce Deathstrike in the most clichÃ©/summer movie way possible.<br/><br/>Another: Wolverine is in the Weapon X facility with the team. He decides that he is going to take off his 'walkie-talkie' thing, and go 'search for his past' on his own. Someone turns around and notices he's gone. ""Where's Logan?"" Jean Grey then notices his walkie-talkie thing. She looks in the distance and says: ""...He's gone..."" OOOOOOHHHHH! It's so dramatic! So tragic! See, Jean's delivery of the word 'gone' implies a deep, metaphorical meaning to Logan's departure. And the metaphor is...NOTHING. It's nothing. It's all nothing.<br/><br/>And one last thing: when is this stupid letter/number trend in movie titles going to end? T2 ID-4 MI:2 LXG et cetera, et cetera Not only are these titles annoying, they defeat the purpose of a movie's title in that they tell us NOTHING about the story, characters or genre. Wouldn't 'X-men: God Loves, Man Kills' been a far more descriptive, poetic and tantilizing title? (this is the title of the comic that the movie is partly based on).<br/><br/>As long as Singer and his crew continue to mold the X-men films into the summer movie mold, these films will continue to fall short of their massive potential. For the real deal, I recommend 'The New X-men: E is for Extinction' by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely (Marvel Comics)."

New characters include a vanishing monk named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and a conflicted teenager with firepower named Pyro (Shawn Ashmore). Of course, we're treated to a brand new villain (Bryan Cox), which adds a new dimension to the battle of good vs. evil as the good guys and bad guys are forced to enter into a temporary alliance and some riveting complications result thereafter. Overall, Bryan Singer has the challenging task of navigating the complexities of this comic and showing the appealing side of this band of misfits, and he comes through in flying colors"

","It may well be the best action movie in five years, and definitely the best comic book conversion since Blade. I didn't enjoy Spiderman as much as I expected, and it has been VASTLY overrated since it's release, but I hope for better things in the sequel. Anyway, this continues where the first film ended, strangely enough, with Magneto in confinement, and the X-men struggling for political acceptance of mutants. But of course, Magneto escapes, and with the help of dodgy politicians, a war between mutants and mankind seems inevitable. For an action movie, where one would expect stunts etc to overthrow the plot, X-2 gives an excellent story, one we can relate increasingly to in today's messed up, but balancing world. I'm still waiting for Gambit, and The Beast, but that isn't too important when Wolverine and the others are kicking ass. Yes there are mistakes, but they are mostly insignificant, and when watching an action movie of this calibre, it's hard to care. The massive cast is faultless, with Paquin proving she can make the transition from child to adult actor without problems.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

Some of the students escape - thanks to man of steel Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) - and some of them are captured, Wolverine kills some of them and escapes with a still wimpy Rogue (a still miscast Anna Paquin), her in movie only boyfriend Bobby Drake/Ice Man (Shawn Ashmore), and John/Pyro to be (Aaron Stanford, replacing whoever that was who was playing him in the first movie) to Bob's house, where his family finally learns he's a mutant and his little brother rats them out to the cops. Well, Magento escapes thanks to Mystique (Rebecca R-Stamos) and a reluctant alliance is formed between the X-Men and Magento to rescue Professor X from Styker, who's trying to use him to kill all the mutants on Earth and is then switched by Magneto to kill all the humans.<br/><br/>
Faster, more action, more special effects, and more humor, this is all in all an improvement over the first. However, the climax in which Jean Grey apparently sacrifices herself by using her telekinetic powers to hold back the water spilling out of the dam so as not to bury the X-jet and is herself engulfed by the waters and apparently destroyed, simply doesn't ring true. I mean, Storm and Ice Man were RIGHT THERE, why didn't they just get out and freeze the damn water? Oh right, because that would make sense, would be too easy and the writers were too lazy to think of a more convincing way for Jean to bite the dust. Of course, we all know that Jean will be back in an adaptation of the Phoenix saga...<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen less Night Crawler (despite Alan Cumming's snappy performance) and more Colossus, and there is still too much focus on Wolverine, but all in all, it's not a bad film. Watered down maybe, but not bad.<br/><br/>Trivia note: in the comic books, Mystique is Night-Crawler's mother, but this is not mentioned in the film."

","While I enjoyed the first X-MEN, it just didn't feel enough like a full-length movie to me. There was a lot of material to introduce, there were several things that were unrefined and not as good as they could be, and I think this might have been because of the music, but the film just reeked of a typical action film style. It had a good story, and it was much more science fiction then action, but it felt too much like another action film. Bryan Singer's direction didn't have much style, it went by too fast, and there was just so much about it that made it feel incomplete and not really a movie. X2 solves all these problems.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the X-Men book GOD LOVES, MAN KILLS, X2 raises the bar from X-MEN and goes above and beyond expectations. The film has much more style to it, it's longer, it feels more like an epic, and the action, special effects, story, characters, acting, direction, and music are all so much better than X-MEN. The film has spiritual messages within and maintains the underlying message of the X-Men universe; the irony and evil of racism and being against the very people who want to help you. As always, the X-Men are hated and feared by the world that they are sworn to protect. Unlike the first film, the X-Men fight not for humankind, but for their own kind."

","I thought this movie was a brilliant movie that can be watched over and over again. If you didnt have the chance to read the comics in your youth then this sequel is no problem, it easily explains who, what and why about every part of the film. I saw this film in the cinema and i was on the edge of my seat. Having not seen the first at the cinema, i was anticipating and wondering what it would be like. I was amazed at the complexity of the story, yet i was not baffled as it seemed to just fit into place, as if it all rolled off the directors tongue as you were watching it. I would have to say my favourite part of the film had to be the use of characters throughout. I was glad to see the usual characters that i was familiar with from the 1991 cartoon series, such as cyclops, storm, wolverine and jean, and i was amazed to see some of the other characters from the X-Men world, such as Iceman and Colossus. I feel that the film used stunning locations, and i loved the fact that they didnt do a matrix style CGI effect in every scene. Ok, cyclops eyes are obviously not real, yet it was a good job on behalf of the actors to but up with wearing the ""restraining"" leather costumes and the fake claws in Lady Deathstrike and Wolverines case. My only improvement would have to be more of a team battle, with the camera showing everyone using their moves against seperate enemies at the same time, e.g. the sentinels. I would have also liked to have seen more mutant powers shown in the mansion attack and the cerebro attacking mutants sequence. It would have been great to see them use even more characters, even though they would only be suffering, showing their powers in some shape or form, e.g. marrow and gambit. Overall I think this film is a briklliant watch and i reccommend it to anyone, even if they are not familiar with the X-Men concept. Amazing, 9/10!"

Needless to say, some did better jobs than others: Jackman did well as Wolverine. Paquin, Janssen, and Marsden are almost exactly how I'd envision the characters (especially Paquin).

X-Men United brings together a collection of rich personalities, each armed with their own M.O. and yet none of them come off as a stereotype. None of them are not real. None of them have been cut out of the typical cardboard character reservoir, Hollywood is known for. For every Kurt Wagner, for every Pyro Boy -- for every man and woman whose wanted to actually talk to the President of the United States, and say -- hey ""You're removed from the day to day reality of your country, dude!""

"the_match_maker","6","0","0","31 January 2004"," Less Character, More Movie.
","While there is more movie here than in the first one, there is much less of the characters involved.  Instead of ""X2: X-Men United"", they should have titled this ""The Story of Wolverine"".  Whereas the last movie was an ensemble piece, in this movie everyone takes a backseat to Logan.  This is especially glaring in the cases of Rogue, Professor X, and Magneto.  In the last movie they (along with Wolvie) were the main characters, the main focal points of the plot.  In this movie everyone outside of Logan is reduced to set dressing.  One gets the idea that if the actors weren't contractually obligated to return for the sequel that they wouldn't have (because the script gives them nothing to do).<br/><br/>In addition to that, certain plot lines are suddenly dropped while others are begun and go no further.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong; this isn't a bad movie by any means.  For instance, the fight scenes are better this time around, and the general story isn't bad at all, it's just that the overall feel of everything is different here.<br/><br/>The story is bigger than last time (the whole world is at stake), but the time devoted to characterization is smaller (Cyclops is MIA for 3/4 of the film).<br/><br/>It's a different balance this time around.  In the first flick the story was small, the characterization was in the forefront, and the number of characters utilized was many.  This time around the story is big, the characterization is in the background, and the number of characters utilized is few.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should spin Wolverine off into his own film series."
"grimjac100","Null","0","0","20 January 2004"," X3?
","Okay, I have to admit to being a serious X-geek in my past. Yep, got a complete run of Uncanny 1-300+, complete New Mutants, X-Factor 1-100 or so, Wolverine 1-100+, Exacalibur 1-40 (or so), most of the 4-issue mini-series, graphic novels, etc, from ancient history to early/mid-90s. I have *always* wanted to see my favorite team brought to the big screen, and with the original X-Men, I got my wish. Summation of first movie: the best comics adaptation ever. Sure, a few things were changed, to consolidate 40 years worth of comics into a movie for the new millenium, but the changes were minor and forgivable. Not quite enough action for my tastes, but the director was obviously trying for something a little bit more than the average action fantasy. Over the years I've spent almost every action movie thinking, ""Hrm, would So-and-so be a good (X-man name)?"" With the first movie, I have to admit, I cannot for the life of me think of another actor or actress I would rather see in that particular role.<br/><br/>So, X-Men fulfilled the majority of an X-geek's expectations.<br/><br/>X2 exceeded them. Seriously, I've been reading the comments here, and wondering if some of these people saw the same movie I did. Gee, the plot wasn't enough for you? Let's see...a mutant attacks the President; you don't think that will initiate a rather violent response? William Stryker just ""pops up"" with a plan? Now, let's think about this logically. We had a Senator last movie trying to pass legislation to require mutant registration...anyone with a functioning brain cell will realize the mutant problem is obviously well known in this universe, to this government. Obviously, the military is going to have some sort of Mutant Response Team, such as...oh, how about William Stryker?<br/><br/>Thin plot, you say? Perhaps, to those more used to sub-titled art films whose main claim to brilliance is their incomprehensibility. I think that's the definition of ""plot"" to these people: ""If I can understand it, it can't be any good! If I have NO idea what's going on, it must be a great plot!""<br/><br/>Too many characters? Well, you have to understand there's been scores of X-men, and every X-geek has their favorite. Wolverine was the hands-down favorite; he had to be in the movies even though in the comics he didn't show up until the series hit the mid-nineties. I was well pleased with those they included, and focused on...to someone familiar with the comics, it gives a lot of interesting avenues of exploration.<br/><br/>Now, my main complaint. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is simply awesome. There's nothing I can complain about as far as his portrayal (except his height, but even that is minor).<br/><br/>BUT!!!<br/><br/>C'mon...Wolverine is arguably the most experienced, battle-toughened, kick-ass guy in the WORLD! (Possible exception of Sabertooth, but that's another plot line that can be explored).<br/><br/>So how come in BOTH movies, he gets his butt handed to him by a girl? Seriously...in X1, Mystique basically treats him like a used redheaded stepchild. In `reality' (comics or otherwise), she'd have hit him once and broke every bone in her hand. Adamantium, folks. Try punching a steel girder with all your strength, see what happens. She's a shapechanger; she doesn't take on the powers or characteristics of her `target'.<br/><br/>Then, X2...better fight scene against Deathstrike, but still...once again, the girl kicks his butt and only through luck does he win. That really harshes my mellow.<br/><br/>I mean...is the director/screenwriters going with the easy out? His memory got scrambled so he forgot how to fight? We have to be PC and because Wolvie is so bad-ass, we have to have a girl beat him up?<br/><br/>Never mind there was zero explanation for Deathstrike. Sure, she had the mind-control thing going on, but it wears off. Why, in all the opportunities she had, did she say nothing about her motivation. Not even an aside, saying something to Stryker.<br/><br/>This leads me to my hopes/thoughts for X3. We're obviously going to be seeing Phoenix in the future, as well as (hopefully) more of Colossus. Now, they could run with the Phoenix thing (probably will), but I'd like to see Wolverine exploring his Japanese connection. Perhaps tracing Deathstrike, etc.<br/><br/>And please do something about Rogue. She's about a waste of film right now. Anna Paquin does a great job with what she's given, but if ever there's a character screaming ""Damsel In Distress"", it's Rogue. She deserves much better. Perhaps in X3 they'll do the Ms. Marvel thing so Rogue actually has some use.<br/><br/>Those are concerns for a future movie. I suspect they'll wind up doing a franchise, rather than a strict trilogy. Wolverine deserves his own movie, as do the New Mutants. There are so many characters to introduce and explore...there's no way we'll truly be satisfied with just 3 movies!"

Now, I wanted to share the X-Men phenomena with my parents, but I'm not sure they really got what the big deal was.  Watching it with this new perspective in my mind, I admit the plot can get kind of confusing with the numerous characters and their unique and peculiar mutant abilities.  Nevertheless, I think they still enjoyed the movie especially for its awesome special effects.  Unlike a lot of action movies, the special effects enhanced X2's story rather than dumbing it down.<br/><br/>It is probably a better movie if you do understand the characters though.  I never really was ever confused myself as I enjoyed the X-Men cartoons when I was little.  Nearly all the mutants in X2 stood out in one way or another. Wolverine was awesome as always, Nightcrawler was a great addition to the sequel, Jean Grey became much more interesting in this movie, and I think Mystique stood out the most with her great efforts to save Magneto and all of mutantkind.  However, I do think Cyclops definitely took a backseat in this movie.<br/><br/>So overall, X2 is just a top-notch action adventure.

","I´m not a huge fan of movies based on comics. I´m not into comics either. I didn´t care that much for Spider-Man which was way too overrated. X-Men, on the other hand, was a movie that I liked a lot, though I had no idea what the comic was all about. The only thing I knew was that there were these mutants and... well, that was it. The first X-Men movie was given quite good reviews and that might have been the reason why I went to see it. The movie also had a very promising cast. In wrong hands X-Men could´ve been a real turkey. Luckily the filmmakers succeeded in creating a wonderful adventure with fantastic effects and interesting characters. Since the movie did well at the box office a sequel was guaranteed. Part One being such a good movie it wasn´t bad news at all. When watching X2 I got the feeling that this movie wasn´t a ""compulsory"" sequel. Men In Black II, for example, was obviously a sequel that just had to be done. That was so obvious and the MIIB was a major disappointment. It´s still possible to create a sequel that´s on the same level with its predecessor. Take the Mummy, for example. In my opinion both parts were equally good. It´s the same thing with X-Men: Part One was great, Part Two is at least as good.       One of the strong points of X2 is its talented cast. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Alan Cumming... They all do great work in this film. My favorite X-Person is Famke Janssen who looks stunning with red hair. She and Halle Berry prove that even Bond girls can have real movie careers if you work hard. The special effects are also first-class stuff and there´s a good amount of humor too. X2 was a bit long and had it been a not-so-good movie it would´ve been a negative thing. But since the movie keeps the momentum going all through its running time I´m willing to overlook this minor thing. Now we just have to wait for X3..."

","It's very rare that a sequel is better than the original. It's even rarer that a very good movie has an excellent sequel. But super-hero movies manage to do that; Spider-man 2, Batman Returns, Superman II and X2 all improved their originals.<br/><br/>The first movie had interesting themes concerning intolerance against mutants. It was compared to hatred against Jews, communists and homosexuals. Unfortunately, the movie's action was a bit dull and it seemed that its edges weren't smoothed down quite enough. Some sub-plots didn't get anywhere and the movie seemed too short. Nevertheless it was a happy surprise, that an action movie can be so thoughtful and woke an interest to the X-men comics in me (I can't tell the difference between Dr. Doom and the Hobgoblin, so don't think I only liked this movie because I love the comics!)<br/><br/>This one gives a lot of thought to the themes too. Iceman ""comes out of the closet"" to his family, who react by saying ""Have you tried not being a mutant?"" Also casting Alan Cumming and Ian McKellen, who are both openly homosexual is a clear hint to the themes.<br/><br/>This movie does it all better. Some characters, like Jean Grey and Mystique have more time on the screen as they did on the first movie and new character Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) almost steals the show. However, some characters, like Cyclops and Iceman are still left in the background, but you can't have all in one movie. Maybe in X3 we'll see some stunning scenes with them.<br/><br/>The story's focus is on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who will find out more about his past, as hinted out in the first movie. Another primary character is Professor Xavier (Patrick Steward), who is being used against his will as a tool to destroy all mutants. The bad guy isn't Ian McKellen's Magneto this time, but general William Stryker who holds a grudge against the mutants because of his son, who is also a mutant.<br/><br/>This movie has more action this time, but fortunately it doesn't interfere with the plot. This is how more action movies should be made; the action alongside the story, not showing only neat CG-sequences, although this movie contains CG, too. Mystique's shape-chancing's are wonderful, but Pyro's flame attack doesn't look quite real. But I'm not complaining, the movie's too good to start nitpicking.<br/><br/>**** 1/2 (9/10)<br/><br/>The best part (SPOILER): Magneto escapes from the prison in a quite cunning way; He takes the iron out of a guards blood and floats on a disc he's made from the iron, while killing the other guards with smaller iron balls."
"tombstone81","8","0","0","22 December 2003"," Potential for a classic sci-fi but falls just short
","I gave this one an 8, for marvellous special effects and score that complement rather than detract from the movie...and for acting in which all the main players take their characters and related abilities seriously...allowing us to suspend disbelief.  Where it falls just short is in trying to string too many storylines together all at once and never really allowing us to just be absorbed in the drama or adventure...because we're always trying to figure out which stream we're now following.  The downside to this is that if people haven't seen the first movie...they don't really get to know the strife that each of the characters is suffering within themselves and society.  Overall though, an excellent job of putting comic book to big screen with mostly believable action sequences...a few good quips for Wolverine (though not as many as X1, I thought)...and a pretty good story.  Needed just a little bit extra though to match up to Raiders of the Lost Ark or Aliens."

The reason why Scott attacked Jean was because Strykor had put that little liquid thing on the back of his neck. As Scott is walking when he first attacked Mystique and Magneto, you can see the same scar on the back of his neck that Magneto, Lady Deathstrike, and Nightcrawler had on the back of theirs. As for the other questions, like where Colossus took the kids or why Wolverine's past wasn't fully resolved, personally, it would've annoyed me if the movie had explained EVERY little thing.

","A better version of the first movie. The power of the X-men is used more like in the comic cartoons. Introduction of new characters which give a better sense that mutants are a minority that is rejected by a few people who deny to accept people that is different. The same thing happens on the other side where a few mutants reject human people. But in the good side appear human and mutants who are willing to accept their differences and try to find a way to work a way to coexist.<br/><br/>Mystique show up with her real disguise in two scenes and this time we can enjoy better views of her famous body painted costume. Wow!!!<br/><br/>To my taste too many couples were paired: Psyche & Cyclops, Rogue & Iceman, Storm & Nightcrawler, Mystique & Wolverine!!! Was there any mutant woman left for the fans?<br/><br/>In this film, we had a chance to view evil characters just as human which really give us an understanding that in this life there is no good or evil, but only people fighting for what they believe in.<br/><br/>Good Plot! Good Acting! Good Effects! 2 hours worth of watching for science fiction fans like me."

","OK let me start off by saying that I really wasn't enthralled by the first one. This sequel however was better then the previous one with greater action and the introduction of several new characters. Viewing this film through a critic's viewpoint: the acting is weak, emotionally vapid, and almost detached with the exception of Ian McKellen who is brilliant as usual. But forget the critics and go see this film one of the best summer blockbusters in recent years."
"Various_Things","9","0","0","5 December 2003"," A fantastic action movie
","This comment contains some spoilers.<br/><br/>The X-Men have always been a fantastic concept. The central themes of prejudice and intolerance have always been relevant to our own world, as well as making for interesting scenarios  perhaps best demonstrated in the situation of the planet's greatest heroes being loathed by the very people they save, simply because they were different. So when the first X-Men film was released in 2000 it had a lot to live up to. I'm glad to say that I really enjoyed the movie, although it definitely had its flaws. It was a little short, and because it was an introductory movie it had a lot of ground to cover so the plot itself was a little ropey, but it had great characterisation and was highly entertaining. But perhaps most importantly, it proved that comic book adaptations could survive the insult that was Batman and Robin and still make money. Hence, a sequel was assured. And thank goodness it was, because X-Men 2 is a fantastic film that breaks the unwritten rules of sequels always being inferior than the original by surpassing its predecessor in almost every respect.<br/><br/>The story, which is loosely based on the classic X-Men graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, begins with an unprovoked attack on the White House by a mysterious mutant who has both amazing agility and the bizarre ability to teleport around, leaving little more than a puff of smoke in his wake (played by Alan Cumming). The president survives the ordeal, but unfortunately the panic caused by the incident will have dire consequences for mutants - and humans - everywhere. General William Stryker (Brian Cox), a war veteran and expert in mutation, reveals that he has uncovered evidence of a training facility for mutant terrorists, and is given the go-ahead to capture as many of these mutants as possible before they can cause any more trouble. But the invaders don't find things as easy as expected, because the location of this facility is Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters - better known to us as the headquarters of the uncanny X-Men!<br/><br/>What we have here is a rare thing: an example of a truly brilliant action movie. Not only does it have some of the most phenomenal visual effects shots and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best action movies (Terminator 2, John Woo's The Killer and the first Matrix film, for example) it also has the brains to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterisation. As the first X-Men comic was published 40 years ago, there's certainly no shortage of potential candidates to appear in the movie, and the filmmakers were careful to pick a balanced mix of characters and varied mutant abilities in order to make the film as interesting as possible. Even better, they chose talented actors and actresses who portray the characters perfectly - almost as if they were born to play these roles. So what if Hugh Jackman is taller than the comic version of Wolverine? Who cares if the costumes are ""wrong""? Who cares if in only the second movie, the characters have relationships that did not develop after many years in the comics? What matters is that the movie is faithful to the spirit of the comics, even if it doesn't stick to the letter.<br/><br/>But despite all this emphasis on characters, there's certainly no shortage of ""eye candy"" here to astonish even the most experienced action movie veteran. The undisputed highlight is the opening attack by Nightcrawler on the White House, an elegant blend of fist fighting, acrobatic wire work, gunfire and the best special effects money can buy. However, every X-Man (and woman) gets their chance to shine. For those who complained that Wolverine wasn't brutal enough in the first film, look no further than his reaction to Stryker's invasion of the X-Mansion. Ouch. Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) escapes from his plastic prison in a truly spectacular fashion, Storm (Halle Berry) conjures up a few tornados to take care of a few pesky fighter planes, and even Cyclops (James Marsden) gets a short fight sequence to show he's got more to him than just glowing red eyes. And as for Jean Grey, aka Marvel Girl (Famke Janssen)... well, let's just say that there are more than a few nods to a classic X-Men story of days past...<br/><br/>Of course, no film is without its faults, and as good as X-Men 2 is, it is certainly no exception. Even though the film begins promisingly, and contains many outstanding individual set-pieces, the overall plot  of Stryker capturing Xavier and brainwashing him to use as a weapon against the mutants  is, it has to be said, a little dubious. I won't give away any more plot details, but I very much doubt whether Xavier is that powerful. Also, Magneto in the comics was always an interesting character because he merely had a different ideal to Xavier's dream of mutant-human peace, and a more militant way of trying to achieve it. And considering his experiences as a child (as the first film explained, he was a young Jew at the time of the Holocaust), he had every right to be bitter. He was ruthless, yes, but he very rarely took pleasure in his killing, and only did what it took to achieve his aims. Yet in the latter part of the film he's portrayed as a fairly stereotypical homicidal maniac baddie, a far cry from the multi-faceted character of the comics. But fortunately these slight blemishes on the landscape don't completely obscure the fact that this is a truly brilliant film.<br/><br/>The DVD release is marvellous as well. There's one in-depth documentary that is more than just publicity and hype, taking us behind the scenes of the movie and examining why certain decisions were made during its production, as well as why it's proved such a popular film. There are also many other features, including some fairly mediocre deleted scenes (which were obviously taken out for a reason), short documentaries on X-comics in general and Nightcrawler in particular, and not one but two audio commentaries. A comprehensive package, indeed. Not only is it a better film than the year's most anticipated movie, The Matrix Reloaded, but it doesn't just blow the DVD of the Wachowski brothers' movie out of the water; it slices it up with its claws, freezes it solid, shoots it with beams of unstoppable force before teleporting it a mile in the air!<br/><br/>In short, X-Men 2 (or X2 for short, and it's even been known to be called X-Men United on occasion) is a fantastic example of the action genre that shows just what superhero movies are capable of. But above all, it's hugely enjoyable entertainment, and on a par with Finding Nemo as the finest film I've seen all year. Although of course, the king hasn't returned yet..."

","When I saw this movie on the big screen, I was blown away. I loved the movie, and I could not wait to see it again. I have just recently bought the DVD, and I have already watched the movie twice. I like the movie, and I think that the plot is great. However something is lacking in X2.<br/><br/>   The entire cast for the movie is great, it makes you believe that these people are the X-Men. All except Wolverine, because I think that Hugh Jackman could of sounded alot more like Wolverine. Especially his movements, it is not enough that one has the hair and the cigar.    William Stryker is a cool badguy, I like the sick and tortured badguys. The plot of the movie involves human hatred, mutant revenge, and a broader look at humanity. This is perfect for X-Men.    The action scenes kick butt, especially Wolverines scenes in the mansion. Jackman really does a good job as Wolverine when he releases his anger and tears up people. I personally think that they could of done another scene with Jean turning into Phoenix.    The ending begs for another sequel, and leaves the veiwers hanging. The entire cast works well together to make each character real. Cyclops, Jean, Storm, Professor X, Magneto, Nightcrawler, Pyro, these are some of the characters that make the movie great.    But I still feel that something is missing. Maybe the action was not really great, or the movie dragged on in some points? Maybe Jackman's performance bothers me more than I admit? Maybe my tastes in comics are changing? I do not know, but I still like the movie. I give it about a 90% ranking, at least now."

","Not only evolution leaps forward but also a trilogy - Bryan Singer brings superheros to another and better step of movie-evolution. Was the first one only the exposition of the story, X2 works just like a modern-empire-strikes-back-movie - but better, than George Lucas would have ever done. Based mainly on its characters not forgetting the story, X2 is a far more faster and more humane than Lucas cold heros. Especially Hugh Jackman (once more the leading role), Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Ian McKellen and Alan Cumming (his german is much better, than my English) must be named when you talk about X2.<br/><br/>Sad part is that it would take too much time to translate my over-3-pages-summary that if have written into English.<br/><br/>So, I just say that X2 must not hide behind Blockbusters like Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions or The Lord of the Rings. Nope, X2 contains emotion, action, well (and better) acting stars, brilliant special effects and a story that still is not brought to its end. On the other hand Singer knows how to make a self-working movie that ALSO is a part of a trilogy better than anyone else. He's got (-like we say-) `a hand' for making the X-Men compatible to the movies - everyone just gets what he or she wants. The fans of the comics and the newbie in the X-World. His interpretation of the X-Men comics he transfers into a movie makes X2 the best superhero-movie up to now.<br/><br/>Intelligent action-entertainment with metaphors to the past of the 3rd Reich that can also be seen as a reflection of the future human understanding of genetically enhanced or cloned individuals .."

","X2: X-Men United shares the tradition of Aliens, Dawn of the Dead and The Lost World: Jurassic Park as a sequel far superior than their original counterparts. If i had words to describe this movie, and that is ""Ultimate Bad-Ass."" The film doesn't waste any time with getting to know the characters as a mutant known as Nightcrawler (A.K.A. Kurt Wagner, played by Alan Cumming) goes on an attack in The White House almost succeeding in killing the president until being deter by an agent. It is then where humans want to do something to efface the gifted mutants from the face of the world by brining in William Stryker (Brian Cox) to capture and illuminate those who have powers.<br/><br/>From the first movie, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) returns from the Alkalide Base in Canada where he discovers that there was nothing left; everything had been deserted. He goes back to the mansion/school in New York to see that nothing has change with the fellow X-Men members Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Gray (Famke Jansen), Cyclops (James Marsden), even Rogue (Anna Paquin) has accepted herself in the school of the gifted. Wolverine learns from Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) that not only is Magneto (Ian McKellan) in a facility, but there is a mutant that almost killed the president.<br/><br/>The X-Men leave Wolverine to take care of the young students where Jean and Storm head up to Boston to meet with Nightcrawler just as Scott and Prof. Xavier meet with Magneto where the head teacher discovers that Stryker has met with the fellow nemesis and giving all the details about the mansion full of mutants. Later that night, Stryker sends his team to capture a few of the students with Wolverine saving a couple of students including Rogue, her boyfriend Iceman and buddy Pyro. With the mutant registration in place, mutants from all sides unite to fight for civilization and the right to live.<br/><br/>X2: X-Men United has more heart pound suspense and savvy action than it's original predecessor. Fans do get to see Wolverine slice and dice things up more than in the first movie; but the real treat however is Alan Cumming's portrayal of the demon Nightcrawler for which everything from the German accent to the design of the creature will have fans talking about him for ages to come."
"eamon-hennedy","10","0","0","17 November 2003"," Fantastic sequel that betters the original.
","The first X Men was a perfect comic book adaptation. It was flawless, keeping the action until the final act and instead focusing on plot and character development. It worked a charm and its success meant that a sequel was a foregone conclusion. Some sequels to comic book films are usually better (Superman II) or almost on a par with the first film (Batman Returns). X2 should be added to that list. In fact, it is more of a Superman II. Bryan Singer has bettered the original, and boy has he done a great job. First of all there is an increase in action, resulting in some of the most spectacular scenes outside of the Matrix series for 2003. The attack on the President at the start is spectacular with some superb visual effects, fantastic camera work, superb stunts and superb music. This launches the plot superbly and introduces us to Stryker, played fantastically by one my favorite actors, Bryan Cox. Never over the top and playing it with a realistic, yet disturbing fashion, he is a great villain and plays a magnificent part in the ensemble. <br/><br/>Bringing back everyone that survived at the end of the first film, increasing the roles for some of the characters only seen briefly in the first film (like Iceman) and introducing some enthralling new characters like Nightcrawler, what we get is a Hollywood action packed blockbuster with heart and soul. Nearly every character gets their moment (even neglected Cyclops) and Singer shows us that not only can he do an intelligent and cerebral superhero movie, he can also do one with the best action sequences money can buy. The fight scene between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is superb, not to mention graphically violent for a film rated 12 in the UK, the dream plot that Professor X is caught up in fantastically done and never confusing, while Jean's sacrifice is brilliantly handled and ensures that an emotional element is here that fits the film like a glove.<br/><br/>
Performances are once again superb. McKellen and Stewart chew scenery fantastically, Hugh Jackman is fantastic once again, Famke Janssen almost steals the film with a performance that is moving, especially in the final moments, as Jean comes to terms with her increasingly stronger powers. Halle Berry gets more to do this time, mostly sharing scenes with Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler, the two sharing fantastic chemistry. Cumming almost steals the film with a performance that is at one moment funny, the next incredibly moving. <br/><br/>X2 goes beyond a comic book movie. It is without doubt one of the best blockbusters of the year. The template that Singer was working too was The Empire Strike Back, and like the best Star Wars film, we have a sequel that is better than the original that was a great film anyway. What we have here is a more confident production. Singer seems more confident at handling the increased input of action as well as the smaller character moments (Scott and Logan's sadness at losing Jean, and the moment of her decision to sacrifice herself to save her friends is almost as memorable as the action sequences). It is very rare that we get a Hollywood blockbuster like this. When was the last time you can say you watched big bangs and fights galore and still found the film moving. <br/><br/>This is shaping up into a wonderful series of films. I only hope that X3 is more of the same and less Superman III."

","The first film was so dreary and contrived that I was expecting not too much from X2.  Thankfully, this sequel is leagues beyond the 2000 original in every way: story, pacing, action scenes, and character development are all brought up a notch, and the result is an entertaining ride from start to finish.  Nightcrawler in particular is a showstopper, and Halle Berry has finally figured out the angle of her Storm character, and used it to her advantage.  Of course Cyclops is as boring as ever; actually, the filmmakers must have realized this because he has almost no role in the movie! Wolverine is still a fan favorite, and he finally gets to show off his violent temper here in more ways than one.  The acting is solid all around, but Kiwi Anna Paquin needs to decide if Rogue has a Southern accent or not. Ian McKellen is fantastic as Magneto, and Patrick Stewart is still the perfect Professor X, even if his role is somewhat diminished this time around.  There's also a surprise ending that will please X-fans (the allusions to a particular era in X-history are obvious).<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me about X2 is Kelly Hu's Yuriko; I won't spoil anything, but it's a minor plot hole that bugged me (or maybe there's something I missed).  Still, recent titles like X2 are proving that superhero movies don't have to suck if they're done keeping both the average filmgoer and the insatiable uberfan in mind."

","There may be a new trend in Superhero sequels, and I have to admit, I like it.  First seen in Blade II, where the bad and the good join forces to fight an even more menacing force, it is perfected in the new X-Men sequel X2. The movie picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first and we are quickly re-introduced to the mutant gang of Professor Xavier's school for the gifted.  For those of you not up to date with the mutant cast of characters, Patrick Stewart (Star Trek) is back as Professor X, Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) is Storm, Anna Paquin (The Piano) is Rouge, Famke Janssen is Jean Grey, James Marsden as the laser eye shooting Cyclops, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and everyone's favorite Canadian Superhero, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is back as the adamantium clawed Wolverine.  Some of our favorite villains are back for an encore also as Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) returns as the metal manipulator Magneto, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is back as shape-shifting Mystique.  And finally, what would a superhero sequel be without the marketing of new characters?  Introduced in X2 are Pryo, Deathstrike and Alan Cummings who steals the show as the blue faced teleporter named Nightcralwer. With a cast of characters as strong and diluted as X-Men 2, you would think that no character would have time to establish themselves with the audience, however, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) manages to string each of the mutants out in comic book fashion ensuring that no matter who your favorite, a satisfying dose of that character will be administered. <br/><br/>The story in X2 is thin, but lets face it, we throw down the $10 per ticket for a movie of this genre to be bedazzled by the special effects and blown away by the rumbling sounds.  For what script there is, the President of the United States is convinced by the evil Mr. Stryker (played by Brian Cox), that the mutants are a threat to mankind and must be rounded up to for the safety of humans.   Since all mutants are targets regardless of their good or bad nature, Magneto (once freed from his non-metallic cell) and Mystique join forces with the X-Men to rescue the Professor has been forced to locate and destroy all mutants through his unique ability to telepathically connect with those of unordinary powers. There are many subplots in X2:  IceMan and Rogue continue their teenage foreplay, Wolverine continues to try and understand his past, there is the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine that continues to sizzle and there is the wild card Pyro who seems to have problems with authority and requires anger management.  But when you get right down to it, the story doesn't matter much.  Brian Singer spends his $150 million dollar budget wisely, with top rate special effects and a body count (missing from the first movie) piling up fast. Wolverine again commands the biggest presence on screen and his battle with the intruders to the mutant school and later with Deathstrike, is better than anything filmed in this year's earlier release Daredevil. X-Men comic book readers will have an advantage over the average movie screener.  I sat next to such a character that grinned with unprecedented glee with glimpses of Colosses and Kitty Pryde and the screen time given to the Blackbird jet, however, do not be dismayed, the movie is interesting and strong enough that a history of the characters and their origins before screening is not necessary. For the most part, Brian Singer does what Peter Jackson has done before him. He made a film that is a lot of fun, but is a tease for the third installment.  Although no official announcement about X3 is evident, X-Men 2 ends with the death of major character (no worries, the Pheonix will rise) and with Pryo taking his place amongst Magneto and Mystique as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  Both stories require a third segment to explain in whole. In today's real world, it is promising and refreshing to see both good and bad characters joining forces whenever evil threatens all.  Now, don't expect Bullseye and Daredevil or Batman and Joker to team up, but that just keeps movies like X-Men 2 even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>In short, a good film.  Better than the first and hopefully, just a launching board for the third"

My expectations were sufficiently met.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men per say, but the comic and the current cartoon series are so much better than these movies. Perhaps it is because there is not enough scope to tell the whole story properly in the time of the movie. Perhaps it is the huge overuse of pretty standard special FX, which are more boring than dazzling these days. I suspect it has more to do with the general malaise in the screenplay itself. Although there was a story it seemed to be a case of connect the dots between the big set-piece sequences than a properly developed narrative. This gave the movie a bit of a directionless, aimless sort of feeling.<br/><br/>The photography was superb in a safe Hollywood sort of way but despite this in its favour the movie still lacked something important, namely a soul.

","And there are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. During the invasion on the school and the Oval Office are highlights. Wolverine goes ballistic on an intruding army and the introduction to newcomer Nightcrawler makes for an intriguing watch. But it's action with a good deal of intelligence. One such instance is the incredibly bloody escape of Magneto. It was so cool that I find myself supporting the bad guys and not feeling guilty about it. This new spin on the inclusion of familiar bad guys Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation. I can be on both sides of the fence and simply sit and watch it unfold. During the second part plot threads are trying to get resolved and action slows down (a bit). Jean Grey played by Famke Janssen is a shining example that her own evolution in powers not only make a great finale but will prompt notions of a third film (can anyone say Phoenix :-).<br/><br/>In the end there is nothing new developed in the growth of the X-Men. We have a flipped coin where they put Men against the Mutants instead of the Mutants against Men scenario of the first. But at the same time there is more to offer in this superior sequel. Better action, humor, effects and a stronger connection for our heroes and villains. X2 never undermines the audience and does all that is expected of it. Direction is great by Bryan Singer and though they take us nowhere new the script was smart and fun. Sound is sharp and vigorous, as you'd expect from an action film. Design is suave and the collaboration between Singer and John Ottmen continues from their Usual Suspects project. Ottmen did a brilliant job in the editing room and the scoring studio. Ottman's score had a more heroic theme than the one used in the first film by Michael Kaman. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced for a long film, spellbinding visual effects and with that gripping final  well let's just say I'm counting the days until we meet again. <br/><br/>Score - 4 out of 5"

"the-movie-guy","Null","0","0","19 October 2003"," Incredible special effects
","Synopsis Spoiler!  The film opens with an incredible sequence of special effect and stunts that are fantastic.  The story begins with the Nightcrawer's (Alan Cumming) assassination attempt on the President in the Oval Office of the White House.  This starts the anti-mutant fear among the people, which sets forth the Anti-Mutant Registration Act that eliminates peaceful coexistence.  A retired military scientist, Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) who hates and wants to destroy the entire mutant race, launches a treacherous raid on the School for Gifted Youngsters run by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart).  Most of the X-Men are away when Stryker attacks the school.  However, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is at the mansion, and he unleashes his true abilities and rage during the attack by slashing a lot of soldiers.  Professor Xavier and several children are captured and taken away. With this attack the X-Men unite with their arch-nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen) who has recently escaped from his plastic prison.  Another scene in the movie that will blow you away is Pyro's (Aaron Stanford) response to the local police.  The best thing about X-Men 2 is the fact that the X-Men are not held back in using their powers to prevail.  The movie runs at 135 minutes and I liked the story line and all the action and special effects. Fox spent more money on this movie than the first, and you can see the difference.  I hope X-Men 3 is even better.  If you like a lot of action, go see this movie. 9/10"

","X-2 rawks! I mean, that pretty much goes without saying. It's an awesome action flick that totally lived up to it's predecessor. I'm a big X-Men fan, and I was so excited by the original and how well they actually portrayed the comic book. These movies aren't classics that will be preserved for future generations, or anything like that. What they are, is a whole lotta fun. The opening scene with Nightcrawler was just beyond cool. And the quick shot of Colossus transforming was everything I hoped for. But of course, the best parts were the fights with Wolverine. Hugh Jackman fits the part so well. And yes, there are some grey areas where things don't completely match the comics or don't even come close, but it's forgivable. I mean honestly, when my biggest complaint is that Colossus didn't have a Russian accent (for his maybe 4 lines), they didn't do too bad. Go see it. Now! I mean it!!"

","The X-men are back, many of them with better hair!<br/><br/>""X2: X-Men United"" possesses many of the qualities that made the original ""X-men"" notable. <br/><br/>For one, Hugh Jackman is again superb as the all-important Wolverine. Newcomer Alan Cumming is also excellent as Nightcrawler, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is better than ever as the shape-shifting Mystique.<br/><br/>
""X2"" also has a sense of humor about itself without descending into the campiness that made the ""Batman"" franchise crumble. Admittedly, ""X2"" does have a lighter touch than the first ""X-Men"", focusing more strongly on whiz-bang thrills than its character's inner conflicts. Thankfully, the whiz-bang thrills actually work. The opening sequence (set in the White House) is dazzling, and Wolverine has an intense bout of berserker rage as well as a great showdown with his femme equal, Deathstrike.<br/><br/>""X2"" seems proud to be a summer movie thrill ride - and you'll want to take this ride again and again."

"theredfox","10","0","0","3 September 2003"," The best comic adaption ever
","In my eyes this film is one of the rare ones which is much better than its predecessor. The movie is faster, the fighting sequences are better and the characters of the ""evil"" mutants are not shallow anymore (in the first movie Mystique, Toad and Sabretooth just spoke about 5 sentences all together).<br/><br/>
But I still think that the focus of the film should be taken more away from Wolverine (he's a cool character, but he's not the only one in the film) and more towards Storm and Cyclops (They never show the leading capabilities of the comics and don't get enough screen time for their cool characters if you ask me). Additionally I would like that Shadowcat, Colossus, Siryn and Jubilee get a more than 5 second appearance in the film (I know, I know, there's already a whole bunch of mutants, but its about a group of mutants not just about some of them) and show a little bit more of their powers.<br/><br/>
So for the third part I just hope that Sabretooth and Toad come back (they are surely not dead, they are much too tough for that), the reappearance of Jean Grey aka Phoenix and perhaps the introduction of Angel, Beast and Gambit (Angel & Beast are the last two of the original 5 X-Men to be still missing, but Beast was already mentioned in X2 and Angel shouldn't be too hard to introduce, because he worked as ""independent superhero"" before joining the X-Men. And Gambit, Gambit is just a cool character.).<br/><br/>
If the improvement from X2 to X3 is as good as the one from X1 to X2 the 10 point scale won't be enough anymore. 10/10 points"

","It's not just that this movie, directed by Bryan Singer, is more chockablock with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the first one, though that's true. Nor that Singer depicts more mutant super-powers, though that's true also. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here, unlike in the original film. That 2000 release felt cramped and crabbed by comparison - so much exposition and backstory were required to introduce these characters and their universe that the plot couldn't start moving until the final half-hour. ""X2"" starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here seem less interested in the action than the subtext: the effort by a high-handed majority to control and eradicate a minority it finds undesirable. The script examines the other side of that equation as well: the desire to strike back, to return hatred for hatred. In that sense, Stryker is the flip-side of Magneto, who believes that the mutants, rather than submit to discrimination or attempt peaceful coexistence, should use their powers to rise up and rule over humans. Not that this is a movie with a lot of touchy-feely talks about brotherhood. It's just that ""X2"" has more on its mind than super-powered butt-kicking. Still, there's no denying that those super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. But ""X2""'s script delivers, skillfully weaving together character, plot and action - and the action is more coherent and just plain spectacular."

","Warning: My opinions are just that, opinions. They often offend- but are not ignorantly stated. If you are immature, of looking for an argument... by all means skip my review.<br/><br/>*Some Spoilers Included*<br/><br/>
This movie was great. I am a huge movie goer, even though I can not stomach half of the movies out there. I can't sit through a movie as though it is ""mindless entertainment"", being a writer and an artist I unwillingly break the movies apart. Judging them by these things:<br/><br/>1. If the Director was able to capture the heart of the film, while over coming predestined obstacles.<br/><br/>2. If the Graphics were wisely choosen.<br/><br/>3. If the movie used its own ideas or stole from others. and finally,<br/><br/>4. If the actors, cinematographors, and producers were able to flow with the directors vision.<br/><br/>OH YEAH, and I didn't have to be on drugs to see it.<br/><br/>That being said, ""X men 2, X men United"" was a great depiction of the trade paperback, ""God Loves, Man Kills"". It was originally called that for two reasons: metaphorically (man is constantly at war with his brothers) and because Stryker in the comic was originally a pastor. And when Jason was born (his son) Stryker killed him, and his wife too. When God did not punish him, he reasoned that God wanted Mutants dead and that what he did was just. But the moral of the story is ""God loves man kills"". Now it was a little too cheesy to make Stryker a pastor so they made him a general. And instead of the story being geared towards one mans beliefs that God kills... it was geared to, ""What man wont sacrafice for a cause"". This movie did so well (for me) because of the casualties of war. This movie had casualties lost in their fight for their own individual causes. (HERE COME THE SPOILERS) First off is:<br/><br/>DEATH STRIKE: she was under mind control when she was killed. And as she is dying you see her come out of the control of the drugs...and she looks confused. Was she really bad- if so why was she being controlled.<br/><br/>MAGNETO: Beat in his plastic pen, and then forced to release the information of his old friends establishment.<br/><br/>Jean Grey: Nuff Said! (dont argue that she was not a casualty, even if she comes back- she still lost herself and left her lover in the name of a cause.)<br/><br/>JASON: Being controlled for all those years by your own father. Truely a sad tale. Xaiver had the chance to help when he attended the school but was unable to reach him in time. Then again he can not save Jason in his final moment, because of the potential power and control jason could have over him. So he was regrettably left behind.<br/><br/>PYRO: One of the most important roles in the movie was that of Jason and Pyro. The allusion to Proffesor X not being able to help Pyro like he was unable to help Jason. And you can tell at the end of the movie that Prof. X is sad over not reaching Pyro and being able to offer him a ""better life"".<br/><br/>Jason's Mother: Who killed herself due to the visions that she was having from Jason.<br/><br/>Boy I Guess those are spoilers.<br/><br/>Anyways* for the task of making a great sequel... that offered more then the first and was able to expand on to an ongoing story- it met all those requirements with FLYING COLORS! The film the movie was shot on was better, the effects were better, the writing was better, the additional characters were nicely patched in, Wolverine's Flash backs kicked ass, and over all this is the best film of the SUMMER '03!!!!!!<br/><br/>

","Let me first of all say that I have never been a comic book fan, and the ones I have read (with the possible exception of Alan Moore's work) I usually found either mind-numbingly dull, idiotic or both, so I was probably not the intended audience for this film. In fact, the first X-Men movie remains my only introduction to these highly popular characters and boy was I confused when watching this next installment. Waaaaay too many characters and sub plots, in my opinion. As far as I could tell this movie involved nothing but a group of strange Jungian figures in silly costumes beating the stuffing out of each other. If I want to see that sort of thing I might just as well watch any of the old Steeve Reeves Hercules films.<br/><br/>What a shame considering the `deep underlying themes' my comic book friends claim this movie explores. But let's face it, it doesn't. Whatever underlying themes this movie had, they were mercilessly crushed by an endless barrage of special effects and Ed Woodian lines like `You are a God among insects', though admittedly well delivered by the great Ian McKellen, this film's saving grace.<br/><br/>While it might alienate the die hard fans, Singer seriously needs to eliminate characters and sub-plots to narrow the focus of this franchise."

X2 benefits from the same thing as The Two Towers in the sense that, because it's a sequel, the filmmakers don't have to waste time introducing all the characters. They can hit the ground running and go straight into the story and the action. And one thing X2 has going for it is great action scenes. The sequence where Nightcrawler breaks into the White House is simply outstanding. <br/><br/>The movie is done very much in the same tone as the comics. The story was great and the characters were handled really well. I especially loved the scene where Wolverine met Iceman's parents. Iceman's father: ""What exactly do you teach, Mr Logan?""

","X2: X-MEN UNITED / Starring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry and Alan Cumming / Directed by Bryan Singer / Written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter / Rated PG-13 / ***<br/><br/>
In the year 2002, the summer blockbuster season opened theaters with Sam Raimi's comic book adaptation of the web-slinging hero SPIDER-MAN and also opened a record-breaking weekend. In the year 2003, Marvel strikes again with the sequel to the popular 2000 film, X2: X-MEN UNITED. After a fun yet ultimately uninspired first installment, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry) Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and many more mutants return for which could quite possibly be the best comic book adaptation yet. The movie gets so many things right that I can't see anyone being disappointed.<br/><br/>The film opens with an impressive action scene, with mutant Nightcrawler attacking both the White House and the President himself (he even looks a little like George W. Bush). We then learn that a military operative known as General William Stryker is planning a secret battle between normal humans and mutants. As Wolverine and others try to protect the school they call home, mutants Storm and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) look the mysterious Nightcrawler somehow tying into the plot. Professor Xavier must also confront his arch-nemesis, the dangerous yet imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan).<br/><br/>The first X-MEN, while usually enjoyable, was merely nothing more than an introduction to the world of mutants, though not really made to tell it's own interesting story. However, all that exposition is thrust aside in X2: X-MEN UNITED. This movie is probably twice as good as the original. It has the pleasure of being a sequel, where character introduction and backstory is irrelevent. This helps the film greatly as we witness spectacular action scenes somewhat lacking in the original. What's probably the movie's greatest strength is that the FUN switch was turned on to full throttle. There are action scenes I have only seen in my dreams. Not only that, they seem to have much more of them here.<br/><br/>Though, maybe, there is still one flaw in this movie that even it's predecessor had possessed: There are a touch too many characters. It doesn't mean that it was difficult to keep track of them all. It wasn't. That there are so many characters the film does not have time to go very deep into them is it's only glaring flaw. Like the first, X2 is still a bit Wolverine centered. I was much delighted that Halle Berry had more screen time than before. I have never read any of the X-Men comics, nor seen the television cartoon series that I fell in love with Storm the first time I saw her on screen. Jean Grey I am also happy got more screen time like she deserves. But like last time, the acting falls to the two greatest performances, veterans Patrick Stewart as Xavier and Ian McKellan as Magneto. They seem to have kept dead on with their characters from the last movie.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer also seemed to have grown in touch with the characters. While the first spent time with introducing characters, X2 spends time with character interactions. There's even a little romance between Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) and Wolverine. The chemistry between experienced mutants Professor Xavier and Magneto in the prison was also great to watch. Though I am left a little cold that the character of Cyclops, played by James Marsden, is almost completely shunned from this movie like Halle Berry was of the last movie. Maybe Singer is just not interested in the character enough to give him more screentime.<br/><br/>
There are flaws, yes, but this is probably the best comic book adaptation yet. There is alot of things to absorb and enjoy in this movie, and proved to be a much smarter and better summer action flick than the extremely hyped and deeply flawed THE MATRIX RELOADED. Heck, it's everything you would ever want in both a comic book adaptation and a summer action flick. The film opened with an impressive $85 million in it's first weekend, but was completely forgotten the nearer RELOADED came to hitting theaters. And after seeing both movies twice, I can easily tell you that you will enjoy X2 more. Just have some fun with it."

Sorry, but I was incredibly attracted to him, both because of and in spite of his appearance.  I loved his personality, and then I realized that his appearance made him a somewhat taboo object of desire.  So that ""forbidden fruit"" factor clinched it.  I love him.  And how great is it to see a devout Catholic character in a movie?  I'm so sick of the media's portrayal of dorky, intolerant religious people.  But Nightcrawler is one bad mutha', AND a sweet, good Catholic guy.  SOOOOOO irresistable.  Ok, now that I've said how great Nightcrawler is, let me just say that the reason that Iceman couldn't freeze the water in the end is because there was so much of it, and his powers are still developing (he's just a kid). Second, it would suck really bad if they ""revealed"" that Mystique is Rogue's mom. First off, she's just her ADOPTED mom in the comic books (NOT biological). And we see Rogue's real mom in the first film, so COME ON.  Wouldn't it be better to reveal that Mystique is Nightcrawler's mom?  Because she is his real, biological mother, and the movie hasn't made any contradictions to that fact (not yet, anyway).  Ok, so there you go.  That's my review.

I didn't think that Halle Berry would be a good storm (too pretty, not regal enough) but I was wrong.  I thought that they picked a terrible actress for Jean Grey, and I was right.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the sequel.  I can handle the black outfits (they actually look really cool, though a splash of yellow...maybe just the X symbol...wouldn't hurt.  I could handle the discrepancies between the film and comic book (accents, origins, and the like...after all, what fun would it be if we knew EXACTLY how it was going to turn out) but I cannot stand the horrible mistake they made in casting Famke as Jean Grey.  Not just in relation to her own role...but let's face it:  she looks like she's Scott's aunt, not his girlfriend.  And she lacks any of the sensual appeal that the character has.  Jean Grey is a knockout.  Famke is a pretty girl but more of a coutre model: skinny, no curves, that hard non-emotional look.  She'd make a great villain though, as seen in Goldeneye.  She just seriously stands out against the rest of the cast like a fish out of water.<br/><br/>I didn't complain this badly for the review of the first film, but Jean plays a more important role in this movie so it bothered me more. <br/><br/>

Some of them (led by Professor Xavier) want to work with the rest of mankind towards a better future, and some (led by the evil Magneto) want to destroy it.  Broadly speaking, the X Men comics can be taken as an allegory about whatever minority group one happens to sympathise with.<br/><br/>The first X Men film was good, but felt distinctly like a warm-up, and that the real story was yet to come.  Sure enough, in X-Men 2 we have a sequel that in almost every way outdoes its predecessor.  It seems George Lucas set a template of how to do a good sequel with The Empire Strikes Back and sure enough, this film follows that kind of formula very well (ie its funnier, darker, more complex and has a surprise downbeat ending setting up a third film).<br/><br/>The plot is interesting and unexpected.  Xavier's X Men are forced to form an uneasy alliance with Magneto against an evil US general named Stryker. For reasons of his own, Stryker is conspiring to start a war between mutants and the rest of mankind.  During the alliance, Magneto exerts a corrupting influence, which threatens to turn some of the X Men to his side.  Almost all the X Men from the previous film are back and have significant parts to play, and there are new additions to the cast with the likes of Pyro and Nightcrawler (who thankfully retains the Christianity so essential to his character in the comics).  However, once again Wolverine is the main focus, as he discovers Stryker holds the key to his dark past.<br/><br/>Performances are all good (as ever, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart take top prize).  The special effects and action scenes are all good too, particularly in some of the `smaller' moments (eg Magneto's escape from prison).  Better still, it has a decent music score this time (John Ottman). The screenplay is very good (based on a story from the comics) and its brilliantly directed by Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>If I had to pick nits, I'd say the tornados in one particular scene looked a little ropey.  That said, there is much to praise in X Men 2 and it is a fine slice of summer blockbuster excitement."

","My only complaint with the original X-Men was that the tempo was awfully slow for an action film.  Which was fine, since it was the first in the series.  But I was afraid that the sequel would drag on and on, with only half a plot worth of script...<br/><br/>Thank you, Mister Singer.<br/><br/>The tempo picks up, and there's enough plot in here for three movies by a lesser director.  Logan's past, Marie's control issues, some of Storm's issues...and you know that we have to explore the bad guys issues too.<br/><br/>And then there's the action scenes.<br/><br/>My one complaint: two of my favorite characters, Ice-man and Cyclops, are little used, little explored.  There's a little about Bobby being from a hostile family, but other than that these two are ignored.<br/><br/>So my one hope...the next sequel is all about Scott.  And Logan...and Iceman...and Jean...and...<br/><br/>Only a trilogy, Bryan?  Waah!"

","I recently saw X2 and was extremely happy with the results. I think it is a great sequel, especially with the on-slaught of comic book adaptations and sequels that the movie studios has been ""pumping out"" over the last 2 years.<br/><br/>
X2 picks up were the first left off and with a great story plot. The introduction of Night Crawler was great and Alan Cummings portrayal of the teleporting mutant is great. <br/><br/>Overall the development of each character was fantastic and the (spoiler) the sacrifice of Jeanne Grey's character at the end was good for the movie storyline. Granted I thought the love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jeanne is a little dry, I understand the intention and design to entice those who like romance in the movie stories. <br/><br/>Overall a great movie and will be an excellent movie to add to the DVD collection."

","But that's not saying much. The first one was an OK TV episode. This was a good movie (not great). I liked the action and the story line held my interest only there were are a few problems. I like the more mutants the better, but when you get so many you pretty much can solve any problem with so many abilities flying around. Even the ending could have been shorten up by the kid who can freeze water. Good rental/cheap theater. 8/10"

","I liked the movie but they messed it up a bit. In the first one Wolverine (aka logan) was traveling around in canada and trying to find out stuff about his past, since in the movie he has no memory of it. When realy he has some memory of his past that mixes reality and illusion, at that time was with alpha fight. After that he joined the X-men. Wolverine also seemed like a dude with horrid addicions to beer in the first and second! Also characters were missing or didnt get much screen time. There were also other character probs, but other then that  there are some cool fighting scenes and they kept to the story OK  and i recomend it.<br/><br/>cya"
"bburns","8","0","0","18 July 2003"," The best superhero movie of the year
","Just this past week, I went to see both ""X2"" and ""The Hulk"".  In many ways, these movies are similar:  Both are based on Marvel comic book superheroes, and both try to make a fun action film with serious themes.  However, I thought ""The Hulk"" was by turns boring, depressing, overly-stylized, overacted, stupid, badly written, and relied too much on sub-standard computer animation.  In short, it wasn't much fun.  ""X2"", however, was by turns thrilling, well-acted, uplifting, and relied mostly on the Oscar-winning and Oscar-worthy set of actors hired to play the various roles.  In other words, it is an unusually good film of its type.<br/><br/>The main focus of the film is Nightcrawler, played with unusual pathos and restraint by the normally flamboyant Alan Cumming.  He is a blue guy with a pointed tail who can turn himself into dust and then re-appear at any space within a few feet.  He is also a devout Catholic and a German expatriate, and he gives moral weight to the story.  As the film opens, he is engaged in an act of civil disobedience that nearly kills the President of the United States.  This act is connected to an attempt (I can't say how without spoiling the plot) by William Stryker (Brian Cox at his most evil since he was the ""original"" Hannibal Lecter) to commit genocide against all mutants with the blessing of the government.  As the film goes along, Nightcrawler teaches the other X-Men about the power of faith and love being a sensible and equally potent alternative to the power of rage and fear.  He also forms a close emotional bond with Storm (super-hot Oscar babe Halle Berry).<br/><br/>Stryker's plan eventually means raiding Professor X's school for mutants & kidnapping all the students, as well as Professor X (Patrick Stewart) himself.  The remaining X-Men then have to unite with Magneto (Ian McKellen in too small a role) & Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, hot as ever) to free the professor.<br/><br/>I will say nothing more of the plot except that (*spoiler alert*) one of the main good guys dies at the end, which is something rarely seen in big-budget blockbuster series such as this one.  In fact there are a lot of unusual things about this film that I liked.  Particularly, the moral tone about faith, love & tolerance trumping fear, anger and prejudice.  I also liked the fact that there was lots of good acting and--with the exception of the X-Men jet--the computer special effects didn't look like computer special effects.  I just hope the series can keep it up and ""X3""--unlike another 3rd film of a long-running sci-fi/fantasy series that also eventually featured Patrick Stewart--will not be about how the mutants all make a voyage to somehow preposterously resurrect their fallen comrade.  8 out of 10."

","This is the best movie of the Summer, hands down!!! I'm just posting this review right now coz i wanted to veiw all the other potential contenders for that title and I'm very happy to say that X2: X-men United is best of them all. Yes. I saw Terminator 3, Hulk, and the much-hyped The Matrix Reloaded and none of them comes even close to X2 in overall quality.<br/><br/>
I saw X2 on the second day of its release with my parents and two sisters(one younger, one older). I,personally, loved the movie and I'm a diehard fan (ie. the hardest to please) of the comics even before the first movie came out. The restof the family tho, where novice to the mutant world and they (with the rest of the sold-out theater)laughed, ooohed, ahhhed, cheered at the right moments. Even after the film, everyone was abuzz especially regarding the ending of the movie (re: one character's ultimate sacrifice and her inevitable evolution into Phoenix).<br/><br/>The best scenes are Nightcrawler's attack on the President, mansion raid by the rogue military, Magneto's escape scene, Nightcrawler and Mystique's little moment (they're mother-son), the whole jet chase scene, the whole Dark Cerebro scene, Wolverine vs. Deathstrike, and foreshadowing to Jean's inevitable Phoenix, etc.<br/><br/>I also happen to think that this has the best ensemble cast in recent memory. Patrick Stewart as Prof. X (Star trek films), Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto (Gandalf in Lord of the Rings), Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm (Monster's Ball), Famke Janssen as Jean Grey (Golden Eye), James Marsden as Cyclops, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, Anna Paquin as Rogue (The Piano), Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler (Anniversarry Party), Brian Cox as Col. William Stryker (The Ring) and Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike.<br/><br/>
I highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to have a good time. Of course, it wouldn't hurt to rent the first movie first (i recommend the X-men 1.5 with plenty of X-tras)."

","Unfortunately, I watched x1 and was completely and totally thrilled with what they had been able to do.  The adaptation from comic book/cartoon was absolutely astounding.  The way the film maker was able to duplicate the special mutant abilities of all the characters AND keep the human relationships involved made x-men 1 a hands down 10!!!<br/><br/>That said, x-men 2 got a 5 from me.  There were some great action scenes *although too dark to see most of what was happening* and a much more serious feel to x2.  But one of the best attributes of x1 was that Wolverine was the focus of the movie.  In x2, Wolverine didn't play near as big of a role as he did in x1.  Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, but there was no one in the movie to take Wolverine's place.  It felt like there was just a big hole in the movie with action taking place but no focus for it."

","Years ago, when I first heard that X-Men was being brought to the screen I cringed. How could they translate the numbers and complexity of characters within a movie's short time span? Well, Mr. Singer did a good job of it, but had to spend much valuable screen time establishing his characters and their universe. Not so in the sequel, and the previous work pays dividends, allowing him to better develop the plot  and probe deeper into the character's personalities. Also, and this may be a result of having so many subjects to work with, Mr. Singer is not afraid to kill off his main characters, from any of the three conflicting camps. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies. The result is that X2 surpasses the original across the board."

","""X2"" focuses on the same (and many more) characters as the first comic book film.  At the start of ""X2"" it shows a fierce mutant, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), attempt to assassinate the president.  This entire sequence is probably the best in the movie.  Nightcrawler flips, kicks, punches, ""BAMFS"", leaps, and, most importantly, he entertains.<br/><br/>When Nightcrawler escapes rumors start suddenly arising about a mutant registration law.  Nervously, mutant Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) sends to of his proteges - Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Storm (Halle Berry) - to find this ""Nightcrawler"" and question him.  At the same time, evil Gen. Stryker (Brian Cox) is looking for the president's permission to attack Prof. Xavier's school for mutants.<br/><br/>There are four very fun, cool performances in ""X2"".  First, Cumming's Nightcrawler is the funniest character, his religious attitude brings humor to the moderately dark and edgy script.<br/><br/>Second, Cox's Stryker is one of the best movie villains I've seen in a long while.  Stryker says he's hunting mutants for the safety of humans, but it clearly is just for his own agenda.  Stryker is the kind of villain to do or say something evil, but with a calm coolness that sends a chill down your spine.<br/><br/>Third, Berry's Storm.  Just something about the ""female action heroin"" that makes you like the character (they tried to do the same for Jynx in ""Die Another Day"", but failed).<br/><br/>Fourth, of course, is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.  In the first movie, Wolverine was too much of a nice guy.  That changes in ""X2"", where he becomes the real Wolverine, who's not afraid to spill a little blood if it helps.  Wolverine's also a funny character, with a fierce, clever wit.<br/><br/>In the end, ""X2"" gives thrills, chills, laughs, and excitement.  Almost a perfect sequel, 8/10."

","X-Men 2: 7.5/10<br/><br/>X2 was the sequel to the original live action X-Men movie. I'd only seen the cartoon once or twice, and never saw the original movie, so I wasn't sure whether I'd be lost plot/character-wise watching this. Thankfully, I wasn't, as they sort of re-introduced the characters, displaying their skills and traits. This was a really good super hero flick, probably the best of the year unless Hulk (which is released tomorrow here) or LXG are better. One of my favourite actors, Ian McKellen, was in this, and was typically great as Magneto. Hugh Jackman also starred as Wolverine. The movie was well developed, and the first five minutes so good that nothing else in the movie could compare to it. Finish was so/so, but seemed to set up a sequel."

I've only gone by the movie and my very knowledgable cousin's presentation of this. Yes the dialogue was cliched but when your making blockbuster hits like these you have to be accommodating and square. I thought that parts of the last act sucked but it didn't infringe upon a good movie. And Wolverine looked anorexic to me. The character(s) that stood out the most was the Nightcrawler's and Jean's.

X2 always has you guessing what will happen next with a few major plot twists that should keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. X2 introduces some more good and bad mutants like Pyro, Iceman, DeathStrike, and my fav Nightcrawler.

","X2 was not what I believed was going to be my type of movie. I usually go for dramas and suspense, historical, and nonfiction types of shows. This one jazzed me because of the theme that is diversity empowering. Mutants can come to be figuratively compared to any minority status and social stigmatized group. The script and plot ably present insights into social oppression of difference.<br/><br/>Sir Ian McKellen's ""Magneto"" delivers some swell GLBTAQ affirming lines. His performance was one of the strong points for me.<br/><br/>X2 was also a techno delight for this middle-aged viewer. Even though there's the usual comic book character violence, and I'm a practitioner of nonviolence, it was the kind of unreal violence that didn't have the effect of bothering me. Although I suppose I should analyze myself for why it didn't! ::winking cutely::<br/><br/>Overall the fantasy type of presentation of real life social justice and human suffering issues was uplifting and I had a feel good kind of experience at the show.

","Well, after being treated to a heavy disappointment in the Matrix Reloaded, I began to believe the old saying: ""You can't make a good sequel to a good movie"". Well, whoever invented that old proverb hasn't been to see X-Men 2! I can't go into too many details without revealing the plot, but let me tell you: this one will keep your bottom in your seat and your mouth shut!<br/><br/>Unlike other superhero films, this one has a myriad of special powers that contrast one another. In some situations, a powerful mutant can be weak and vice versa, and you constantly imagine in your mind stuff like: ""Oooh, I wish X would get to fight Y, she'd really kick his ass!"". There are of course these comic one-liners here and there that will make sure your facial muscles are exercised every once in a while.<br/><br/>Be sure not to be late for this one. Right off-the-bat, we're treated with a sequence affirming this film is action-packed to the bone. For those who like pauses between the action to contemplate the plot, better rent some ""Love Boat"" reruns - this movie won't supply them. The action, along with the great plot and stunning effects, keeps you focused on the big screen instead of on the girl next row. My only regret was that the theater decided to cut the break right in the heat of a fight sequence - if there isn't a good place to cut it, don't!<br/><br/>In conclusion: I'd rate this film 9 out of 10. Action is great, plot is there, effects are top-class, and it will leave you begging for more."
"SnobbyDude","9","0","0","24 June 2003"," Almost perfect!
","This movie is really exciting and action packed.  The first movie laid all the groundwork down and this one picks up from there.  Since we all have seen the first x-men movie, and, for the most part, know and understand what these movies are about, things can and do start with a bang.  I don't know how they filmed the beginning but it is one of the best action sequences I have ever seen. There is a philosophical message here, but the movie leaves a lot of it open to interpretation and it's a better film for that reason.  You don't sit there and feel like you are watching a sermon like you do in Matrix Reloaded. So why is the film, as my summary says, almost perfect and not a perfect 10? I rated the film a 9 because Famke Janssen looked a little too old (or maybe James Marsden looks too young?), and I thought there were one or two lines of weak dialog.  Also, we are going to always be bothered by the ""why didn't he freeze the water?"" question at the end. I feel like I'm being picky raising these issues because they are very minor niggles.  It's a pretty solid movie overall and I'm eagerly awaiting the 3rd part of the series."

","""X2"", made three years now after the original, is a slick, spectacular but in the end only passable sequel to X-Men.  This one has increased the action and special sequences to an almost numbing degree and intended developments in the storyline fail to bring it any further at all.  Worst of all, despite all efforts, this sequel does not give us the empathy with the characters that was a strength of the original film.  Still, it's not a complete loss and has one or two memorable moments.<br/><br/>The story is now a few months on from the original, and the President has come no closer to passing his law regarding the registration of mutants. After a near-fatal White House attack by a blue-skinned teleporter (Alan Cumming), he sides with Stryker (Alan Cox) a military maniac with revenge and genocide on his mind...<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Logan (Hugh Jackman) has come no closer to finding out about his past while the imprisoned Magneto (Ian MacKellen) craftily plots his escape...<br/><br/>The storyline and script are not quite on a par with the original and there is a touch of a disappointment that the story has not really been brought any further and only leads to yet more set-up for future films (producers have revealed they intend to make at least three more).  Humour is also very limited in this film, deadening a great many scenes.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are inconsistent.  On the plus side, MacKellen and Patrick Stewart (reprising his role as the benevolent Professor X) turn in their usual dignified performances.  Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore (as Rogue and Iceman) make a quietly convincing romantic couple.  The best performance is Alan Cumming as NightCrawler, who makes a colourful, zesty addition to the X-Men and is especially good when paired with Halle Berry's Storm.  Berry and Cumming are not an obvious pairing, the principal reason why their on-screen relationship works so well.<br/><br/>However, neither Hugh Jackman or James Marsden (as Cyclops) add anything new to their roles.  Alan Cox is a major disappointment as Stryker.  He plays the role with just a little too much subtlety, to the point where he is unable to evince any menace or threat.  Famke Janssen's Jean Grey is given a more pivotal role in this sequel, but Janssen does not have the necessary range to make the audience sympathise with her character.  This is especially crucial in the film's closing finale.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very many in this film, but notable standouts include Nightcrawler's opening attack on the White House, as he teleports and punches his way around numerous armed guards.  Best of all is Magneto's ingenious escape from his ""plastic prison"".  The action is a little overdone though, and a bit more restraint with these kinds of scenes would have maybe let them have a little more impact.  <br/><br/>Whilst not without it's high points, it's the law of diminished returns for this follow-up.  Here's hoping director Bryan Singer recovers his form and delivers a more satisfying ""X-Men 3""."

","When i walked into the X2 theater, i was thinking that the first one will probally be better, but i was wrong.  This movie has so much more action and better speical effect, and Nightcrawler had a very good fight scene.  The only about the movie that was bad was that some of the characters did not have a story following them, like Cyclopes. The best part of the movie i think would have to be the begining, when Nightcrawler tries to kill the president, it had great speical effects.  The movie was great and better than the first, so i would give it an 5 stars out of 5."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","0","18 June 2003"," No way!
","Not only do we get a good comic book based film (a rarity), now we have a good comic book based sequel to a good comic book based movie.  This hasn't happened since Batman Returns.  (Please don't let X3 go the way of the Batman franchise).  <br/><br/>Bryan Singer reunites most of the cast of the first X-men film and we go on to chapter two.  The first big surprise for me came right at the beginning with my new favorite character from the X-men universe--NightCrawler.  The X-men based comic books and video games cannot do this mutant's power justice.  X2 you find out how bad the little blue guy really is.<br/><br/>The second big surprise comes with Wolverine's first berzerk sequence in the film--the creators are no longer afraid of a body count in the movie.  Now we see what the mutant powers can really do, and the blood they would really bring out of us mere mortals.  <br/><br/>I found it funny that this film's pacing seemed just a tad too fast and the first film felt just a tad too slow . . . but it's not even significant to mention really.  Pacing is good, but not ""perfect.""  For the most part, X2 expands the universe of the first film, incorporating more characters and plot lines and tangents from the comic book universe. <br/><br/>
At first, I felt one underlying tangent (X-men veterans will know what I'm talking about) was't appropriately developed, but after watching the first film again I did notice the seeds were actually planted there with a Cerebro sequence and X2 exploits the first budding glimpses of one of the next film's plot.<br/><br/>X2 improves everywhere where the first film can be improved, and everything else matches the first film eye to eye.  And initially I was disappointed that Michael Kamen did not return to X2, though I thoroughly respect John Ottman (I'm just a big Kamen fan).  Ottman's score took me by surprise . . . for the first time in film history has a sequel taken an almost entirely new musical turn and not disappoint me.  Ottman offers a very different musical interpretation of the X-men characters, and though if I had to choose I'd lean towards Kamen's score . . . I really like Ottman's vision too.<br/><br/>So I'd say for people who enjoyed the first X-men film, X2 will not disappoint."

","X2 is, in many ways, the movie X-Men could have been but wasn't.  The story is crisp and very well-paced (at about 2 and a quarter hours running time, the film just seems to fly by).  The characters seem much better developed, and the acting is much better than typical genre fare. <br/><br/>
That Hugh Jackman is becoming a huge star should come as no surprise with his work here.  And McKellen (his interactions with Romijn-Stamos and Stanford are absolutely priceless) and Stewart are even better than before, with Brian Cox a more than welcome addition to the cast.  Alan Cumming makes Nightcrawler more real than I would have hoped and even Halle Berry adds much more depth than she had been previously permitted(in a role likely beefed up after her Oscar).  Although Raimi's ""Spiderman"" came closer to achieving the feeling of that particular character, X2 is perhaps the best embodiment of the Marvel Universe put on film.   <br/><br/>The ending actually had me light up with glee at the mere suggestion of something lurking beneath the surface of Lake Alkali.  Never has a film made the world of the fanboy more accessible and admirable than X2."

","Hi there,<br/><br/>I wont bore u with the story and a large comment. First of all: Must see for comic book movie fans because it is one of the best ever made. I liked it better than all of Superman films, better than most of Batman films, and miles ahead of what I call last year's debacle 'Spiderman'. Beats the eaelier X-Men too. Great special effects, good storyline, and above so many fascinating new characters, Nightcrawler in particular. Also REbecca Romjin Stamos is really hot as Mystique.<br/><br/>Now for the one mistake I discovered in the movie, but a warning first: dont read further as it concerns the climax. Now, instead of Jean Grey going out to stop the flooding water and helping the Jet take off, Iceman could have freezed the water  Jean grey could have helped jet take off and then Nightcrawler cud have put them back in the jet. Thus Jean Grey wud not have died."

","When I went to the cinema I was very apprehensive of what I was going to see. After all, I had (unfortunately) already seen the Matrix sequel, and my expectations for X2 were significantly lowered. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the main characters were well-rounded, the plot easy to follow for someone who isn't a reader of the comics, and with a little research in the original story-line, I was able to understand more subtle points of the plot, like Jean Grey's transformation into the Phoenix. The actors did a great job in portraying their characters, special effects were very good, all in all, a very good movie that builds well on the first X-Men and although there is resolution in the end of the movie, we get the groundwork for X3 (probably the emergence of Jean Grey as the Phoenix?) My only grievance is that I have read some reviews on how injecting iron into the guard, or similar actions, were not 'realistic'.<br/><br/>Well, in a movie that is about mutants who can change shape at will, control others' minds, have claws emerge from their hands, get encased in metal, etc., I do not mind if pumping liquid iron into the guard's blood stream is not physically or biologically possible. If I did, I would watch a documentary about sickle-cell anemia instead, not a fantasy movie based on a comic."
"aces_high_4","Null","0","0","10 June 2003"," X-men 2 is X-cellent
","Are you an X-men fan? To tell you the truth it really doesn't matter. This is the best action film of the year so far. I will be surprised if even the much hyped 'The Hulk' can better this comic book conversion. This might, and I stress the word MIGHT better Terminator 3: Rise of the machines in the box office.<br/><br/>After watching Bryan Singer first conversion, X-Men, you couldn't help but feel it left a lot to be desired and that it wasn't fully for filling the great expectations of the legend of the comics or even the cartoons. However, upon watching the second installment it will leave you wishing for the third film in the series.<br/><br/>The film starts on a great level of excitement that is upkeep through out the film. The opening scene is with the soon to be new addition to the X-Men team, Nightcrawler. He is rampaging through the white house getting attacked by dozens of men from the secret service and dodging them using his brilliant mutant skill to teleport. It was the sort of scene that leaves you yelling up to the projectionist 'REWIND THE REEL AND SHOW IT AGAIN'. This attack is what starts the much highlighted war, in the comics, between the mutants and humans which is what lacked in the first film and comes out in abundances in X2. X-Men 2 mainly revolves around the mutant verses humans war and goes in to deep character development with everyone's favorite character, Wolverine.<br/><br/>Allot of people complained that in the first film there was too much character development than made it a little boring at times. However, it has to understood that not everyone are big fans of the X-Men, so it's necessary for them to show the not so familiar audience what  X-men is all about. As director of X-Men 2, Bryan Singer has done a terrific job of having just the right amount of Action, Romance and Character Development.<br/><br/>
All characters in this film did a great job, but the best actor award has to go to Hugh Jackman for his absolutely performance as one of the most loved X-Men, Wolverine. And unlike the cartoons or magazines, you get to see what Wolverine's adamintium claws can really do when applied to human flesh. Also credit has to go to Patrick Stewart for performing to a level we have come to expect from him as Professor Charles Xavier. Ian McKellen also did a great job of acting out the role of Professor X's good friend, Magneto. It took the make-up crew 2 hours to turn Alan Cumming in to the night crawler, but it was well worth it. And he gave a performance as if he owed them something for their hard work. The question is who had the best make up, Nightcrawler or Mystic? You really won't be able to chose between them, except any man would have loved to have been Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' make-up aid.<br/><br/>My Rating 9/10 'You have to go and watch this film whether you are an X-Men fan or not, I promise it's a stunner from the begging till the end'<br/><br/>Final Comments A great film! The first film was good but nothing compared to this. It really is a must. Even if it is just for the opening scene and to see how great Nightcrawler is, you will get your moneys worth within the first 10 min's. When the film is over you will get be left wanting more. All I can say is roll on X-3. The next film I am looking forward to seeing is Sean Conerys latest chart smashing block busted 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'"

The way Pyro has done his expected turn and joined Magneto, I saw it happening and being an X-men fan, I knew Pyro wasn't gonna be good for long. The action was better, all the characters were portrayed much better, even the actors seemed comfortable with their roles and how the character speaks and moves.

","Hep me, Jesus!!!  I would have to say that I do need help because I was blown away.  When I saw X-Men 2 I was down in Witchita, Kansas and I saw it at the Warren Theater.  A very huge theater.  I begged to my mom to see and I did see it with my sister.  She didn't see the first X-Men,but as soon as she saw the second one she had only one mission in life to see the first one.  I don't know if it was because the sound system's volume was up way to loud or it was my sister cutting off the circulation in my arm.  I don't know but, I had bruises on my arm after I watched it from her.  But after I saw it I bought the X-Men 1.5 DVD and I was stunned.  But it looks like Bryan Singer had down it again and is on the verge of X-Men 3 and making it bigger and better. I was very immpressed with all the new characters and I hope to see more of them in the next movie.  I also hope to see more villians and X-Men in the next movie.  My brother encouraged me to see it and I am glad I did.  I asked him what new characters were coming and he said he hopes that beast and the card throwing guy.  I don't know his name. I also hope to see Wolverine and Jean getting a little more romantic.  I also hope to see what Jean looks like and what her new powers are.  I asked my brother what she had become and he said that she had become a new mutant. Whatever she is now its going to be rocking in the next movie.  I thought that the end was very suspensful and left everybody on the edge of there seats and hanging. The best part about this movie is that it leaves a lot of things un done and left you wondering what was going to happen to the love triangle of Jean, Wolverine, and Scott.  What I hope to see in the next movie is that Magneto starts getting a little bit more serious about killing off the human race and I hope he has more mutants go along with his cause. I am also wondering when the next movie is coming out? E-mail me if you know. I would love it if you could. Anyway that figure in the water at the end is sweet and I do know its Jean and that she is still alive and kicking.  I hope that Bryan Singer will make the next movie a lot longer because I couldn't get out of my chair afterwards.  I wanted to see it all over again. Well this takes a lot off my mind.  And as the critics say ""This is a movie that grabs onto your attention and keeps it all the way from the first scene to the last scene, and keeps hanging on till you get the movie.""

What I found really interesting from the beginning was the irony that filled the film, a very smart irony, that many couldn't understand. The scene where the president has to give a speech was an obvious intelligent comparison to what was/has been/is happening in the world, and always concerning USA's position. It was very courageous from the crew and cast to face what's going on in such a creative way. Of course I can be wrong and the movie was supposed to mean other thing, or not to mean anything, or to mean everything in general, but as we were going through a hard time that had to do with the States and Iraq, I felt that from the film, and felt deeply touched.

","...which isn't saying much, I know.<br/><br/>Let's get the pros out of the way first:<br/><br/>--Alan Cummings.  Welcome to the cast, Nightcrawler.  You kicked hindquarters.  And I'm so glad your religious devotion wasn't written out of your character.  Fan-freaking-tastic.<br/><br/>--Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.  Mystique gets a MUCH bigger role in this movie, and it's well-deserved; Romijn-Stamos is outstanding.  Forget the would-be romantic chemistry attempts between Jean and Logan or Bobby and Rogue; the real honest-to-deity romantic angle that works is Mystique and Magneto, which is due in no small part to some great chemistry between Romijn-Stamos and...<br/><br/>--Ian McKellan, who just flat out rules as Magneto.  He's vulnerable, he's powerful, he's fatherly, he's overlord-esque.  He's altogether brilliant. We are not worthy.<br/><br/>--Hugh Jackman.  I love Wolverine.  And boy, does Jackman ever own this character.  Perfect mix of brooding and heroism.<br/><br/>--Aaron Stanford makes a great first impression as Pyro.  He is truly bad-boy material and does an outstanding job with a small character.<br/><br/>
But the cons on this movie are pretty big, too:<br/><br/>--The story both drags and rushes.  You want to see more of the other mutants in the school, particularly during the fight against Stryker's armed forces, and they get short-changed.  But a plotline involving Xavier being forced by mind control to use his awesome psyche to kill every mutant on the planet through Cerebro just drags and drags--will Xavier ever finally concentrate hard enough?  Wake me when he does.<br/><br/>--Some of the acting is REALLY bad.  Halle Barry is merely collecting a paycheck.  Anna Paquin, who is normally very good (and even in the first movie wasn't sleepwalking this badly), is dreadful.  Kelly Hu looks great but conveys zero in the way of personality or attractiveness.<br/><br/>--The movie is claustrophobic; practically every scene is set in some small room or underground chamber.  You long for big set pieces ala SPIDER-MAN in Times Square after a while.<br/><br/>
On balance, it's good and certainly worth seeing, but falls short of the gold standard of SPIDER-MAN by a large margin.  7/10"

Storm was amazing and she simply blew me away.<br/><br/>There might be a battle for which mutants came out as the favorites for the audience but in my opinion Storm, Wolverine and Mystique easily won. Everyone has their favorite X-Men characters and neither Pyro nor Iceman could change their minds.<br/><br/>The latest mutant added to the movie lineup, Nightcrawler, at times added the right touch of humor but at times he was straight out of Sesame Street. He is still not a bad addition to the mutant cast. The RX7, and hopefully not a mutated version, was a great choice for the X-Men 2 car. Storm and the 7, that should have been the combination.<br/><br/>Well aware of the parallels between 'mutantism' and virulent intolerance in the real world, Brian Singer lends real gravity to the proceedings, injecting dramatic urgency into a continuing franchise that in lesser hands, might've grown patently absurd."
"FilmOtaku","6","0","0","5 June 2003"," A fun, exciting sequel
","I walked into this movie really hopeful that my appreciation for the first X-Men film wasn't a fluke.  While I am a self-admitted comic book geek from way back, I tend to not like the films derived from comic book or graphic novel origins.  There are a few exceptions: Ghost World, the first two Batman films, and for camp value, the first two Superman films  but the bad far outweigh the good.  Having this opinion, I didn't expect much of anything out of X-Men three years ago but ended up being very pleasantly surprised.  I am delighted to say that I did walk out pleasantly surprised again this time, but because I actually liked the sequel better than its predecessor.  <br/><br/>In X2, we once again have the same characters we left off with from the first film along with a few interesting additions  most notably Nightcrawler, who was brilliantly portrayed by Alan Cumming.  I can't imagine that projecting feeling from behind pounds of blue makeup and prosthetics can be easy, but he absolutely made it work.  X2 had more thrills and back story than the first film as well as more of a compelling story line.  Fortunately, it isn't completely necessary to have seen X-Men before viewing this film; however the exposition used to transfer viewers from the first to second film was subtle enough to clue in first time viewers without irritating fans who know the background.  Without providing spoilers, I will commend the film for taking chances and for providing hints for readers of the comic book of things to come.  <br/><br/>--Shelly"

And I can't deny the fact that the rest of the movie is full of lots of awesome action. But I was still let down by the characters/plot. The plot, while interesting, made it seem as if Wolverine was the main character and all the others were along just to lend a helping hand on his quest towards self-discovery. Sure, Rogue and Iceman jumped in occasionally with relationship issues and Jean Grey had her moments of being great, but ultimately I was let down by how little the characters of Cyclops or Storm were explored. They were main characters in the old show/comics. And on that note, where's Gambit? I know he wasn't in some of the 'Evolution' shows or whatever but he was still a main character in most of the comics and shows and I liked him a lot! Still, I am glad they included some of the other old main characters like Kitty, Colossus and Jubilee. Hopefully we'll see more of them. Sorry for the rant. All in all, it's worth it to shell out 7 bucks to see 'X-Men 2' and all it's fight scene glory on the big screen."

Sometimes it's necessary to look at a movie for what it is: an adaptation of a classic comic-book series, and a damn fine one at that!<br/><br/>X2 may not be the box-office hero, partly due to a poor choice of release date.  But Fox managed to do the unthinkable - namely, to make a sequel which is better than the original.  This is a feat worthy of mention, given the typical sequel fare these days.<br/><br/>The story was great, the acting was believable, and the effects were spectacular.  Sure, I could spend all day picking this movie apart for the tiny mistakes made here and there.  Sure, I could hack the actors to shreds.

","That's precisely what, in the end, resumes all of this magnificent journey into the world of mutants for the second time. The sequel that took three years to make, with an ensamble cast of 12 leading characters had all the ingridients to fail; but Bryan Singer knew what he was doing. It isn't too much to say that this X2 actually manages to surpass the original movie in every single aspect you can point out. For our luck, both of Bryan Singer's versions of the X Men are, as Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart said, worthy of being Shakespearian. All the characters have depth, are given a background, and enough room to move around and show off without clouding anyone else. This time, the storyline goes in deeper than it was three years ago, so the plot isn't quite just an underlining matter for the special effects. While all the action movies lately that were worhty of recognition first built up in the first part of the movie so they could ""burst"" in the other half. Well, X Men 2 starts with that ""burst"", with one fo the best action sequences in recent memory: an homicide attempt on the President of the US, by the new mutant around, Nightcrawler, played by the surprising Alan Cumming. What we could all fear whereas the movie would drop down from there on, it didn't happen. It kept the pace, never leaving the plot behind. Anyway, the movie's big winner is once more leading star Hugh Jackman, that walks away once more with an extraordinary performance and a character compositing that makes us like this Wolverine personna even more. So we wait anxiously for the hopefully upcoming sequel with the whole cast returning, and Hugh Jackman's next leading role on Van Helsing. PS - It is a great start on a movie summer, when the first blockbuster is as greatfully rewarding and mind uplifting as X MEN 2! 10 out of 10"

","Through nearly two meaningless hours, I watched the movie X-Men. If it had been not my friend's warm invitation, I would not have wasted time watching this ridiculousness and stupid movie.<br/><br/>Like many American action movies, X-Men has simple content: a righteous power fights against an evil power to preserve peace in the world. As it is so mediocre, I knew the result at the movie's beginning: the righteous power will surely win. Do not worry about the righteous leaders because they can live to the end of the movie even though it seems they have died.<br/><br/>
The leading characters in X-Men are imaged roles with a terrific appearance, which are only natural in nightmares. Many exaggerated movements in American action movies often seem the same, out of usual life. I think that it is really a bad thing for children to watch them because they are so quick to imitate what they see. Sometimes, the movies seem not to promote good behavior, but to induce persons to do bad things with methods from the movies. Maybe it is the reason that crimes always are more and more horrible than before in our real lives.<br/><br/>We must reduce the quantity of such movies or improve the quality of them in the future. Let's look to old American movies to give us clues on how to produce good movies for people in the world."

","I just saw Matrix: Reloaded the other day, and yes, in many aspects it was far superior to the original, but as far as the best sequel so far this summer, I hafta give it to X2. and here's why...<br/><br/>1) It had much better character development. Neo and the gang were pretty much the same from the first, but you actually felt for Bobby Drake when he ""came out"" to his parents, and his younger brother's actions. The love triangle between Cyclops, Jean, and Wolverine was top notch. The scenes between Storm and Nightcrawler give the impression of a budding relationship<br/><br/>2) It broke some new ground, special effects-wise. Don't get me wrong, Matrix: Reloaded had some pretty cool scenes, but I felt it was nothing new. The first 10 minutes of X2 is a great example, plus lots more of Storm, Iceman, and Colossus's brief scene stand out<br/><br/>3) X2 had a better set up of things to come. X-Men 3, anyone?? I completely forgot about the guy at the end of 'Reloaded'<br/><br/>4) A very interesting human villain, (granted, he's much different in the comics) which made the X-Men's struggle against humanity feel a little more personal.<br/><br/>So those of you who loved the first X-Men, definately see this if you can't get in to 'Reloaded'. Oh, hell, go see it anyway! A good 2 1/2 hours well spent!!"

","Here we are again at the beginning of another summer season of blockbusters and, to start it all off, Hollywood has delivered unto us X2 (or X-Men 2 if you prefer).  And a little blessing it is.   Especially if you like your social rights movies with tight, leather costumes. Bryan Singer has taken to heart the ideals of this comic book world and has outdone the first X-Men.  Sure there are some great action sequences, but the real beauty of the film is he allows us to get to know these characters with all their flaws thus we have a chance to care for them between the butt-kickings.<br/><br/>Basically the entire X-Men universe is a story about intolerance of people who are different.  Those who collect the comics know that this gives the story real depth and believability in a world of spandex wearing crime fighters.  There are several layers to the intolerance.  Magneto (the role Ian McKellen's terrified is the one we'll all remember him by) is at one end of the intolerance by means of the extermination of the entire non-mutant population.  He briefly joins the X-Men and has a little heart-to-heart with one of the new kids, Pyro.  He tells Pryo in a character defining moment, ""You are a god among insects. Never let anyone tell you different.""  The scene where Bobby Drake aka Iceman ""comes out"" to his parents as a mutant is played with some humor (""Have you tried to not be a mutant?""), but turns into the moral heart of the story as he is finally struck with the truth that not even his own brother accepts him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Washington, the fear of the mutants' powers is still building and there are several people who don't want to settle for registration and surveillance of all mutants.  They want them completely destroyed.  Enter one of the most despicable villains to grace the screen in a while.  General William Stryker is a military experimentalist with a personal vendetta against all mutants.  Brian Cox plays him beautifully.  Just when you think he can sink no lower, he throws out something else that makes you love to hate him even more; however, he never plays it for camp.  The character is a heartless, bitter man who will do anything to rid of the world this pestilence.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is an explosive introduction to Nightcrawler played with uncommon restraint by Alan Cumming.  Hugh Jackman is back as Wolverine and this time really does get to break loose when a troop of military men breaks into Professor X's school.  The violence in the scene was surprising since the first movie had very little death.  In other words, let the summer movie body count begin.<br/><br/>After winning her Oscar, it seems that Halle Berry is trying very hard to remove the aftertaste of her performance in X-Men (""Hold on to something"").  She portrays Storm with more vigor and it helps that they gave her a little more to do as well. There is confidence in her acting that wasn't there the first time around.<br/><br/>All in all, X2 is pretty extraordinary.  Here is a well-made superhero movie about real, current problems in a world of mutant human beings and villains with Hitler-esque intentions:  A fun, action film with a message.  If this is an indication of this summer's blockbusters, then hooray for Hollywood."

","I am not a big fan of the comic books, and I saw very little of the X-Men TV show.  As a first viewer of the X-Men universe in the first flick, I was instantly captivated by the realm of the X-men.  These movies are testaments to the technical achievements available in today's movies, where comic book style action can be accomplished realiztically. These movies do a great job of making the special effects an integral part of the plot and development of the movie, and they are amazing as well.  Couple the novelty of the mutant powers with generally good acting and a decent script, and you have a great action flick that I would not mind seeing over and over again.  By the way, this movie is much, much better than the Matrix reloaded!!"
"stamper","8","0","0","26 May 2003"," They've listened to my plea and made a sequel
","X2 (what people invent such a clever title?) was released here in the Netherlands on May the 1st, but I had to wait until today (May 25th) before I could finally watch it, because as a poor student I was a little short of cash (plus I'd planned to waste my last few bucks on seeing The Matrix Reloaded on the REALLY big screen and watch X2 in the village cinema which gets movies a few weeks weeks to three months later than any other cinema). Anyway I was pretty excited to see it and when it came to my notice that the film would be playing th the village cinema on the 25 of May (a mere 3 weeks after it's release) I immediately reserved me some tickets. A few hours before going to the theater though I came to realize that I hadn't seen a preview of X2 yet. No trailer, no teaser, nothing (or had I simply forgot about it due to the Matrix hype?). The only thing I new was that the mutants had to stand united for something. Now why was I going to watch a film, if I didn't know what it was about? Well I was going, because I had seen the first X - Men film, which in my mind (I don't know if that is a good method to measure by) was awesome. To make it even more plain and simple: I was going because this film roughly had the same cast and crew as the first X - Men film and because I trusted them to make a good sequel. I didn't need noisy trailers or samples of the special effects and action scenes that were to be seen in the film. Being responsible for making X - Men (with Spider-Man THE BEST Marvel comic adaption until now) is all the credit you need to get me to the big screen.<br/><br/>
X2 kicks off with a very nice fighting, scene which certainly owed some of it's visual finesse to Andy and Larry (you know who you are and so do most movie buffs). After that shine and turbulent intro the film continues where X - Men had ended, namely with Wolverine's quest to find out what exactly had happened to him. From that point on, these two events become entangled into each other and a story unfolds which builds on quite well on the previous film, without neglecting new elements. The new elements in the story are mainly new characters or characters that get a bit more attention than in X - Men (Pyro, Nightcrawler, Colossus) who were all portrayed in an acceptable manner by the actors. The only exception to that was Nightcrawler, who was portrayed excellently by Alan Cumming. He was very believable and rather sweet as the faithful and shy mutant from Germany and he even managed to nail the parts in the film in which he spoke German (correct German without too much of an accent and none of that: 'Schiess den Glas' crap they pulled in Die Hard). The rest of the film pretty much built forth on the things that were established in the first film (so if you haven't seen it I can advise you too, it will make some things much clearer). The film does so in an excellent manner and I've really got no complaints to the film overall. The action and the story were good, there were some emotional elements and one or two laughs as well, without any big misstep's. But comparing the film to it's predecessor (something which one always does) I must say that the film could have been a bit more dramatic. Not just to add drama, but to give the film more depth. Yes that is the word. The film could have had a bit more depth. It could for instance have explored the relationship between Jason and Charles Xavier a bit more or there could have been a bit more focus on what Stryker had done to Jason, so we (the viewers) could have felt a bit more for that pitiful 'creature'. Now mind you that these are all minor pointers to the makers and it does not mean that the film was not good. It just means that it wasn't as good as the first one, it wasn't perfect. But is still was a very good sequel. I (yes I too answer the question that has held a lot of movie freaks in their grip for quite some time this year) even thought it was better than The Matrix Reloaded. But that does not mean much, simply because The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions are to be combined into a 5 hour long film and I've only seen half of it. I am as it were currently in the lobby of the cinema drinking and eating some refreshments, waiting for the break to finish.<br/><br/>
Singer, cast and crew have once again managed to make a good film and I am truly grateful for it. I sure as hell hope that they'll make a third film in the series and I hope that next time they'll inject a bit more of that Marvel-dilemma into the story. But this time I cannot be quite so sure of a sequel. None of the actors had signed a contract for more than two films and to be honest I think that there could be some problems with getting the entire cast to return. Academy Award winner Halle Berry might be the biggest trouble, but I certainly hope there won't be a problem a bigger paycheck can't solve. I don't care how much money the actors ask, give it to them they've earned it (on performance AND profit).<br/><br/>
If the X - Men return, so shall I.<br/><br/>

I would've been happier if there were more character introductions, like Gambit or Psylocke, but the cast would've got too big.<br/><br/>On to the new characters:<br/><br/>Nightcrawler - Alan Cumming was great as Nightcrawler. At first I thought it was a bad choice, because I've only seen him in childish movies before. I've never got to see the... action side of him. The opening was amazing. He did well, but I was hoping for a teenage version, as seen on X-Men Evolution. But that's okay, cause this version worked for me, as well.<br/><br/>Pyro - There wasn't enough scenes with him. I always thought he could MAKE fire. Plus, the lighter thing was getting on my nerve. Click, click, click...<br/><br/>Deathstrike - Just as Pyro, she wasn't given enough scenes. She got the worst speaking part in the whole movie... a simple ""What are you doing?"" I think they killed her off too early. They could've developed her character more, even though Kelly Hu still shone.<br/><br/>Also, there were cameos of other X-Men. They included Siryn, Colossus, Jubilee, Beast, and Shadowcat.<br/><br/>Now, to the original cast. Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashomre and Halle Berry were all good. James Marsden (Cyclops) wasn't given lots of screen time.

As to the curious rest of us, it was a horrible miscalculation and an insult.  Slow, boring, uninspired, meaningless, and shallow.  I gladly walked out before the climax, after sitting through a pointless hour and a half.  If we are supposed to feel so sorry for mutants, develop their characters.  Give us a reason to like them.  Tell a story, at least.  Do not assume that we have seen the first movie or that we have read the comic book.  I am a man, and I played sports and read about sports when I was a kid.  I did not read silly, nerdy comic books.  That is why I can satisfy women.  This movie can't satisfy anyone with a brain and guts."

","As a fan of the original X Men cartoon, I was a bit disappointed by the first movie. It felt weak and hurried. That said, my expectations were pretty low, and I was pleasantly surprised. So many good decisions were made in the creation of this movie. They let Cyclops show that he's human; that was my favorite bit because I really didn't like him in the last movie. The cameos were sweetly tantalizing, and I loved the scenes with the kids, all of them. I am so looking forward to the next one it's scary :)"

","I couldn't but help while watching this movie to put it into the context of our times.  How we would react, or over-react to ""mutants"" within our midst? I was quite impressed with the restraint most of the mutants showed in exercising their powers.  They have the capability to really wreck some havoc.  ""X2"" had circumstances where all the mutants had to unite.  I look forward to future episodes where they will battle each other over how they should or shouldn't live with humans.<br/><br/>Aside from the philosophical aspects, ""X2"" is action-packed and compelling.

","I very much enjoyed X2. I have been a fan of the comic for years and I appreciate the job Singer did. While I wish more characters had been introduced I love what they did with the existing characters. The development of Wolverine was great (Plus Logan finnaly got the go berserk on the enemy). I also love what they did with Gene. Her transition to Phoenix is very creative (Hope I haven't ruined anything for non-comic readers). I can't wait to see the third movie.

","There are an awful lot of characters in the X-Men comic book series (and the movies too, as a result).  Therefore, character development becomes a time-management issue for filmmakers.  How much time can you spend developing the characters and still have time left to tell a story?  In the first movie, this problem was apparent.  Although it developed the characters in a way the audience could relate to and it contained a good plot, it somehow fell short of capturing the true ""essence"" of the X-Men comic book series.  Viewers who were unfamiliar with the comic books series were not really given insight into the deeper issues associated with the human condition that the comic books addresses so well.<br/><br/>X2 addresses this criticism and goes well beyond what was needed to address it.  Through X2, viewers unfamiliar with the comic book series are provided a much deeper and more complex view of the ""mutant issue"" that goes beyond special effects and the mechanics of filmmaking.  There is real substance here.  But the movie is not boring, it is fast-paced and action-packed.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine, and brings additional depth to the character.  Patrick Stewart is as distinguished as ever.  But it is Alan Cumming who steals the show.  He is truly awesome as Nightcrawler.  He places a human face on the mutants in subtle ways the other actors strive to achieve, but he does it with his own unique style and in a much more evident fashion.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!"

","Okay, it's true that most sequels are far worse than the original film. However, this is not the case with X2. X2 is a heart pounding, hold your breath 'til this ride is over flick with excellent visual effects. The viewer definitely gets to know more about the characters (the ones who are not die-hard comic book readers) and what makes them the ""exceptional"" people that they are. Their humanity is just as defining as their superhuman powers.<br/><br/>X2 comes at a great time when there is so much turmoil in the world.

","this may come across as some fanboy rambling, but i really don't care. this is the best movie i have seen this year, hands down. to say that this was an improvement over the first installment would be a gross understatement. my one and only complaint about this movie is that now i have to wait, impatiently, hopefully and dedicatedly for the, dare i dream, third installment in the x-men franchise. with the multitude of characters inhabiting the marvel universe from which to choose, the possibilities are endless for not only a continuation of the x-men series, but also for any other of the marvel characters. with the star wars saga drawing to a close (long-windedly and thankfully, thanks to the abysmal episodes I and II), we need a new mythology for the new millennium. marvel comics has provided meaningful escapism through it's comics for decades. now that technology has advanced to it's current state, and will continue to only expand and further astound us all. the ability is there to bring the escapism formerly only available in comic form to the big screen for more people to enjoy. so, to all of the true believers out there, keep showing your support.<br/><br/>and if i may be so bold as to quote the great Stan Lee: EXCELSIOR!"

Even my non-comic reading fiancee LOVED this movie.<br/><br/>Here's why you should go see this again and again.<br/><br/>1. Action Scenes that are driven by drama instead of just effects - Nightcrawler's attack on the White House is a fantastic set piece... and that's the first minute.  Stryker's futile attempt at capturing the School is even better, with new Mutants popping up everywhere, anda furious Wolverine defending his turf.<br/><br/>2.  The new characters are terrific.  Nightcrawler's nothing shy of perfect. PERFECT.  Pyro.  Ten seconds of Colossus.  Stryker.  Bryan Singer's real feat is juggling almost a dozen major roles with such panache.<br/><br/>

","Worth seeing just for the incredible opening sequence with Nightcrawler in the White House...otherwise... ...this ""superhero"" movie failed for me for several reasons:<br/><br/>1 - it's all set in warehouses and underground complexes...there's no ""city feeling"" (like Spider-Man, Batman etc).  No civilians to save or interact with (the first X-Men movie had this a bit). 2 - mutants are 2-dimensional (Wolverine is moody and grunts, guy with shades moans a lot, Jean Grey is just a ""nice"" person, Storm is ""caring"", Professor X is Captain Picard) 3 - the action/fight sequences suffer from choppy MTV-style editing (like Lord of the Rings) - don't sit near the front or you'll feel ill by the end. The camera shakes and chops every second. 4 - two huge plot holes I've described below (to avoid spoilers)<br/><br/>Spider-Man was far more enjoyable.  This one wants to be an epic on the scale of Star Wars, but feels like you're on a set.  There's no feeling of wonder or scale.  The first X-Men movie was better - seeing how the humans react to the mutants.<br/><br/>Roll on Hulk!<br/><br/>If you've seen X-Men 2, here are the two plot holes I noticed:<br/><br/>
**SPOILERS**<br/><br/><br/><br/>
a)  When Jean-Grey sacrifices herself for the team.  Nightcrawler blatantly could have teleported out, grabbed her, teleported back into the ship. But when asked to do this, he replied with a really duff line: ""She won't let me,"" - and Wolverine was like, ""Oh, okay, then.""  He should have nagged him a bit more!<br/><br/>b)  This was a biggie.  Wheelchair-bound Jason (son of Stryker) is a mutant. So when Professor X is concentrating on ""all mutants"", it should have affected Jason as well!  It was loop-back feed and would have destroyed him too.  And if you argue that Jason was not a mutant, he was human, then he should have been affected when Professor X was ""switched"" by Magneto to think of ""all humans"" instead.  Perhaps the X-Men devotees will correct me on this somehow?"

","I need someone to X-splain to me the purpose of this sequel. I don't usually go to see these new-aged sci-fi flicks, but I was taking care of my nephew Romel so I took him to see it. Now I'm a hardcore all-American who has seen a fire fight or two in his life, and I have to say that the action scenes in this film were terribly done. They were worse than making Mac-N-Cheese without milk or butter. What this film needed was a clear goal. I'm American so I believe in goals, apple pie, and that Tasha Yar should have never died on Star Track, because she was a true patriot. This film was a poor mix of crappy one-line jokes, action scenes that were not nearly gory enough, and cheesy X-plosions for X-citement. In my opinion, the director of this film should have designed the movie for an NC-17 rating and then went to work...instead of making it fit for all the kiddies out there. In addition, the casting was inX-scusable. Billy Drago should have been cast as Xavier, period. Chuck Norris and Rutger Hauer would have added the needed thespian punch. Instead you get a sour mix of second-rate actors that resemble that five-year old MGD sitting in your garage. All in all, I give this movie a 2 out of 10. BOOO!"

","***MILD SPOILERS*** I've read many of the old X-Men comics and watched the old X-Men animated TV show.  I felt 1) the characters didn't really develop in this movie--it was just a shot-them-up show, 2) the X-Men didn't appear very heroic or stick with the basic values shown in the old comics, 3) there were too many characters, so some were vastly under-used and several cool X-Men were quickly introduced (ShadowCat, Colossus), then disappeared from the story, and 4) Nightcrawler was great and the main kid X-Men did very well.<br/><br/>Spoilers coming, so don't read if you haven't watched the movie and want to be surprised. In the comics, the X-Men _always_ save people, even at risk to themselves. If good guys fire at them, they get out without harming people. If it's bad guys, they (except for Wolverine) try to stop them without killing them and will even save their lives so that they can be put in jail. In this movie, Pyro (a boy) is verbally slapped down by the X-Men every time he uses his powers. X-Men are doing this?! Okay, they're only human, but... Anyway, due to a misunderstanding caused in part by Pyro, two fighter jets are set on their jet's tail. Storm uses her powers to make a bunch of tornadoes right in their path, destroying the fighters and should have (but didn't) kill the pilots. Um, why try to kill the good guys and not just use the wind, etc. on any missiles? Next, at the end, an old student of Prof. X is left behind to die. Wolverine leaves someone behind to die that holds the key to his past. Why? He was determined to learn the truth at the beginning, usually would save the idiot and interrogate him, but suddenly decides (no real development) that he doesn't need to know. Finally, an X-Man supposedly dies (a set-up for return in X3 all over it), preventing all rescue (even though it could have easily been done). Why? No real reason is given. Oh, well."

Anyway this is a MUST SEE movie. Run and see it if you haven't yet.<br/><br/>So here is the point. Everything in the movie is great: costumes, sceneries, landscapes, production designs, cast direction AND, of course, screen-writing. I had enjoyed the first x-men film, but in comparison it looks awfully pale. Prepare for a sharp, clever, keen, brilliant script -with all the ideological prospects about racism, homosexuality, difference in general- along with a SORTED piece of entertainment. You get 2 hours of a movie which brings about both thoughts and enjoyment due to some outstanding performances from every member of the crew.<br/><br/>But let's talk about something even more remarkable. The cast. All the actors were perfect in the first one -and they still are-, but in X-men 2 they are joined by breath-taking artists: Alan Cumming, Aaron Stanford, Brian Cox (oh god Brian Cox what a GENIUS!), Shawn Ashmore, Kea Wong, Daniel Cudmore...<br/><br/>I'll close out with, in my opinion, the BEST, MOST ROCKING part of the show. Her name is Kelly Hu. Yes she is from martial law, the scorpion king and so on. But however short her lines might be, she delivers a sweeping performance as Lady Deathstrike, a fascinating, deadly, ice-cold and slightly cruel traitor which keeps challenging Wolverine and all the mutants on earth to serve Stryker's cause.<br/><br/>So take a breath and prepare for the Hu-rricane."

Nope, but it's pretty damn close. Is it better than the first 'X-Men'? I'd say it's on par with the first film.<br/><br/>(Minor spoilers)<br/><br/>The film opens with an attempted assassination of The President of the United States, by an unknown mutant named Nightcrawler. This causes Professor X and his school of mutants some worry, as they are ultimately striving for harmony between Mutants and Humans. The President grants General Stryker power to hunt and seek out Xavier's school, and the X-Men find themselves separated from each other. Stryker captures Professor X to utilise his powers, and the rest of the X-Men must regroup and join old enemies to try and save him.<br/><br/>'X2"" brings back Wolverine in full onslaught mode, as well as introducing a very cool Nightcrawler. Bobby Drake, aka Iceman, gets more screen time as well as fiendish friend in Pyro. Storm, Rogue, Cyclops, Jean Grey all come back in full force, as well as some nice cameos from Colossus and Hank McCoy, aka Beast. Magneto and Mystique return as well as old rivals. Add Lady Deathstrike in the mix, and you've got one gigantic mass of super powers. There is some great scenes, particularly involving Wolverine, and I'm sure all the fans of this stuff have seen this film already. It's also got a poignant message that is very relevant to issues concerning reality. I'm glad they didn't overkill it. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and Brian Cox (Stryker) shine in this film in their respective roles, and the rest of the cast do admirably as well. Strong hint at the end for comic lovers as to what might happen in the X3, and Bryan Singer should be given kudos for directing a sequel that could be debated as being better than the first film.

Even though I'm not an effects maven, the variety and sheer visual wonder of the effects in ""X2"" bowled me over.  They wouldn't have been as worth watching, however, if Bryan Singer & co. hadn't balanced them off with effective character sequences as well.  Though these aren't necessarily up to the level of those in a good movie for grown-ups, they make the film come closer to capturing the ""soap-opera"" appeal of the X-Men comic than the first movie did. Superhero movies seem to be steadily improving, so to call this one ""the best in the genre"" isn't exactly an original tactic.

Certainly not as imaginative as the first movie's plot.

I didn't really care for the first X-Men movie when I first saw it either, I was hoping for something more out of the comics so maybe this one will grow on me too. That being said, this movie looks like it was made in a hurry, like they didn't have enough time to make it. A lot of the plot lines are really quickly put together and are not explained hardly at all. Also, where are the main characters? You only see Cyclops for a total of about five minutes in the movie. He's the leader of the group! I think they have strayed too far away from the comics and this movie is off track not knowing where it wants to go. Hopefully they will just leave this franchise as is, or give it to someone else to try and push it in another direction. Also, the music for this movie is terrible. Where is Michael Kamen?

But X2 never lets up with it humorous moments that you can't help but laugh at: Wolverine, Iceman and Dr. Pepper to Jean ""wink, wink"" Grey in the tent with Wolverine.  Then there is the excitement factor: Magnoeto's escape, Nightcrawler's Rogue rescue and Mystique's breaking into Striker's base all had the audience stomping their feet and clapping with joy.  In M2, it was more of a glazed fascination with the amazing effects, but without true story telling and characters that are more than fighting machines who never lose, you will never satisfy an audience emotionally.

","Spoilers Herein.<br/><br/>
Those who view this movie should not expect this movie to be terrible just because of the plight of the first one.  This movie is much superior to the first in most facets.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is well done, for the most part.  Hugh Jackman portrays the internal conflicts of Wolverine well.  He also complements Famke Janssen who plays Jean Grey.  The two contrast well, and they seem to be able to pull off the forbidden romance thing quite well.  Patrick Stewart is more than adept as Professor Charles Xavier.  Ian McKellen is a pure genious.  His portraying of Magneto is absolutely marvelous.  There might not be an actor out there who could have played the part better.<br/><br/>
The storyline of this movie is filled with its share of action, and keeps the audience engrossed with the movie.  While the sequences may not be as impressive as something in the Matrix, they do hold their own and are interesting to watch.  The script and the plot do not have major noticable flaws, and internal conflicts and treachery that many of the characters experience enhance the movie a great deal.<br/><br/>This movie was definately worth a watch for both comic book fans and non comic book fans alike.<br/><br/>Rating:  4 out of 5."

","X2 is a common blockbuster fare.  It's better than most, but it also could be vastly improved.  Since I am a major X-men fan, I was able to spot the insider's jokes.  Mutants who are not named or featured constantly pop up during this film, delighting insiders, but confusing newcomers.  If you are a major X-men fan, this will impress you.  If not...I'd suggest seeing it with an X-men fan, in order to get the jokes."
"jeev7882","9","0","0","16 May 2003"," Flat out incredible
","Grade: A<br/><br/>There's so much to talk about in a two-and-a-half hour movie that it's absolutely overwhelming. The movie starts with a highly original special effects sequence; something of a rarity in today's copycat special effects market. This sequence involves Nightcrawler's assassination attempt on the President where he takes out all of the Secret Service Agents in the White House. This ""poof"" special effect used for Nightcrawler's teleportation is one of the many wow-factors in this movie. Unlike most films, the opening sequence here is a good indicator of things to come. On a side note, director Bryan Singer makes an excellent decision to not mimic any special effects from The Matrix. X2 succeeds in the one department it's predecessor fell short in: special effects. Not only does it succeed, it's one of the few movies each year that effectively utilizes special effects (Minority Report and Harry Potter 2 were the only two from last year's effects filled pics).<br/><br/>Beyond the first sequence the movie flows effortlessly through it's plot points. The only complaint I really have is that the editing was not as good as it could have been. The scene-by-scene editing was fine, in fact I would have more than gladly stayed in the theatre to watch a 5-hour version of X2, but the in-scene editing could have used a little work at times. The storytelling is all but forgotten with a director like Singer aboard and with screenwriters that seem to know all the beloved characters inside and out. Fans of the series are given tastes of characters like Colossus, Jubilee (for about a second), Shadowcat, and most exciting is the preview of Jean's Phoenix character which I will mention later. This movie uses a perfect balance of characters from the first film while adding just enough to keep it interesting and not convolute it. I'd love to see Apocalypse, more Sabretooth, Morph, Beast, Gambit, and a whole lot of other characters in the next few films, but I can wait for them as long as the movies are of this high quality.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much from this film because of all the problems that were rumored during production (the most prominent was about some or all of the actors storming off a set when they, the director, and the producers all had some disagreement). But, most of the cast is absolutely flawless. Halle Berry and James Marsden (Cyclops) are the only weak links in the chain. Cyclops' crying scene towards the end drew quite a few chuckles from the crowd and besides her Oscar winning turn in Monster's Ball (which she did deserve), Berry has been one of the worst actresses in Hollywood. This time around her character has about the same number of lines, but none of the lines are as ridiculous as her ""do you know what happens to a Toad..."" line from the first movie. Besides, Storm kicks some major ass in this movie, especially in the tornado sequence where the Blackbird escapes two ensuing F-16's in breathtaking fashion.<br/><br/>What I liked most about his film was that even though it was PG-13, the characters even more closely resembled their comic book origins. Wolverine finally got to go absolutely berserk and actually stab people. When the mansion is invaded by government agents, Wolverine is shown stabbing a whole lot of them. Needless to say, this was one of the best moments in the film for me. Wolverine's character in the first installment was done as well as possible for the first film in a series, but in this movie his character will please the fans a lot more. The use of mutants' powers was so creative that I smiled even when I knew what was coming. Even when I knew who the shape shifter Mystique morphed into, I was able to appreciate the way Singer and his crew were able to use the camera in such a way as not to disappoint. My favorite use of mutant power has to go unmentioned because it is somewhat of a surprise, but in short: Magneto detects the iron in someone's body and extracts that iron to form balls which he uses to propel as bullets. I hope you can ignore the run on sentences, because after a midnight showing of such an incredible film, I'm definitely on a energy high.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't even mentioned the names Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, or Patrick Stewart yet. Then again there's also Brian Cox, Famke Janssen, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Anna Paquin, and Alan Cumming. In a summary of cast praise, the newcomers are all great with Cumming being the standout, and you get what you expect out of the cast from the first movie. I've said this before and I'll say it again: no actor has ever nailed a comic book character as well as Hugh Jackman has nailed Wolverine. Jackman is probably the most fortunate last minute casting change in movie history.<br/><br/>The character development is as good as it can be in a movie with so many people. I'm really unqualified to comment on how well the movie developed the characters because I new everything about them coming in to the film. Still, my friends who were not X-Men comic veterans didn't seem to have a problem grasping anything at all (another plus on Singer's resume). That being said, they also weren't fully able to appreciate the meaning behind the glimpses of Jean's full power. Everything from her nightmares in the beginning to her decision in the end is indicative of things to come in the next movie. Now, I can't comment for sure, but my bet is that the next movie will be about The Phoenix Saga. The last scene in the movie scans over the water where the damn burst with a running narration from Jean. Under the water we see a glowing firey object flying though the water just before the closing credits roll. What an absolutely incredible tease of an ending. The movie concludes in itself, but like all other great sci-fi/fantasy movies, it gives a glimpse of things to come.<br/><br/>All in all I can't say enough about X-Men 2. The action and story are incredible; when they are interlaced with a highly capable cast and jaw-dropping effects, it all makes for one of the best summer movies I have ever seen. This movie is exactly what the box office needs right now: a good movie that will have people rushing out to the multiplexes in the weeks to come.  By the end of this movie if you don't find yourself debating which mutant's powers you most desire, I think it's safe to say your imagination is completely dead. I hope I don't have to wait another three years for X3 (a.k.a. The Phoenix Saga?). So, which mutant do you want to be?"

"jon.h.ochiai","10","0","0","16 May 2003"," An Evolved and Matured X2
","Director Bryan Singer's ""X2: X-Men United"" has evolved past a great comic book movie into a great movie. Singer along with David Hayter have stayed true to the spirit of the comic book story lines (of which I was a fan years ago..), and at the same time told a tale of humanity, tolerance, and heroes. Singer has the benefit of ""X-Men"" under his belt which was itself a good movie, though very expository by nature of being the first movie. In X2 Singer amps up the action and the characters, focusing on Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Framke Janssen).<br/><br/>Logan/ Wolverine starts unraveling his forgotten past with the introduction of human villain, William Stryker (Brian Cox), a paramilitary scientist with his own personal agenda of destroying all Mutants. Stryker has a grand plan. Jean Grey starts showing symptoms of awesome and yet uncontrollable power both as a telekinetic and a telepathic-- rivaling the prowess of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Like the comic this is an excellent foreshadowing of things to come-- in the next sequel. Jean also has romantic feelings for bad boy Logan (Jackman), though she is with Scott Sommers (James Marsden).<br/><br/>Along the way, X2 creates great drama. Returning as Magneto is a very effective and strong Ian McKellan. Magneto and Charles Xavier (Stewart) form an unholy alliance against Stryker. This is a great touch. Magneto and Xavier possess the same goals, though opposed by ideology, sort of like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. This is a presumptuous analogy, and much like the comic book it is ambitious. And it is better to have something smart to say, rather than having nothing to say at all. Singer uses some of X2 (not all of it) to comment on the insanity of hatred against groups of people solely on the basis of being born a certain way. The true heroes of the world do their best to alter the listening of this kind of discrimination-- be it X-Men or humans-- into what is possible.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman really powers X2. He is a movie star. He has amazing charisma. As my friend, Jennifer, reminded me throughout the movie: ""He's hot!"" He is a also a very good and versatile actor. Whether he is bravely defending the children at the Xavier School from Stryker's troops or confronting Styker in the icy forest, he is powerful. Famke Janssen is up the challenge of the evolving Jean Grey. She is beautiful, smart, and conveys a sense of honor and sadness. Brian Cox as Stryker is essential, because he is a threatening presence throughout which is key to the drama unfolding. There is a quiet and justified evil that Cox brings to the character. X2 also has Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as beautiful and absolutely deadly villains.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer and company have made a great movie--characters, action, and drama. Hopefully, Jackman and Singer will be back for X3."

"Sinnerman","Null","0","0","19 May 2003"," X2; A Message Film?
","Hmm, being a pontificating sanctimonious jerk that I can be, I'm prone to over-analyse. So why not lay out my thick self-gratifying thoughts on something as popcorn fluffy as Xmen? Yes, why not? ;)<br/><br/>Below thus my take on one of the many lofty themes covered by Xmen.<br/><br/>That, of prejudice.<br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Gay fans may identify with the veiled but sensitive treatment of their community in the pseudo coming-out sequence Iceman had with his family. But most incisive about that scene was his family's unknowingly hurting response(Bobby mom to him:""Bobby, have you ever tried, not being a mutant""). Therein lies the deep-seated ignorance and misguided beliefs held by most people and indirectly this ""force field"" caused many of those who are different to conform, to hide from others their own true selves.<br/><br/>Which was why there's an added echo of resonance from a short retort Mystique uttered to the Nightcrawler, with a deceptively revelatory remark, that one shouldn't be in diguise(even when one is capable of doing so).<br/><br/>Such sly yet poignant moments, nearly equalled the unexpected Jewish holocaust opening in X1. All of which underlines one of the basic themes of the Xmen series - that of the crusade against prejudices and fear, hatred and discrimination. Definitely one of the reasons this comic series is still so widely embraced since its 60's origins.<br/><br/>At any point in time, from civil rights(60's) movement all the way to women's/ gay rights advocacy(present day), people who felt victimised for being different will always be able to identify with the characters and themes introduced in Xmen's fictionalised world. For these comic superheroes too were asking for something as basic as mutual understanding and acceptance. One pertinent question raised by Xmen to us the unsuspecting public may thus be, ""after all these years, have we given it to them?""<br/><br/>(End of Spoilers)<br/><br/>Comic origins notwithstanding, Xman is a work of pure good. As long as there are victims who still suffer at the hands of others who perptuate prejudices, fear, hatred and discrimination, the Xmen universe will always be a relevant voice of reason for all times.<br/><br/>That's my humble opinion anyway."

X2 tries to give a bit more of screen time, this time, to most of the important characters. Fans will be extremely pleased because Colossus gets a bit of screen time too! There is a bit of romance, but its not all out. We see a relationship develop with Rogue and Iceman. Ofcourse Rogue does still have a girlish crush on Logan. It's hard not to.<br/><br/>Girls if you love Hugh Jackman, this is the film to watch.  There will be just a tiny scene with him and Jean Grey... Jackman, again, does a wonderful job portraying Wolverine. The film combines humor and action to create a film that is unforgettable. The casting is superb and nobody can miss the fighting scenes especially with Nightcrawler in the whitehouse and the fight Wolverine has with Lady Deathstrike. The fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is fleshtearing and very painful to watch. The fight is intense and moviegoers can't help but wince everytime Deathstrike stabs Wolverine. Special Effects was awesome, the movie excelled beyond my wildest imagination. All and all, this is one amazing film with awesome special effects. It is not to be missed!

","I must confess that I was hoping for a lot better. This happens a lot to me because I watch some films with too many expectations - X2 was the case. I really loved the first movie although my favourite X-Men characters (which are Nightcrawler and Colossus) didn't take any part in it - in fact, only Nightcrawler takes active part of this movie since Colossus' role is more like a cameo. X2 isn't a bad movie, in fact it is quite good. The problem is that it isn't any better than the first one, but it isn't any worse as well. I was expecting some evolution other than a technical one and Matrix-lookalike special effects. The storyline is as good as you usually get in a comic book adaptation and the use (again) of black suits instead of the traditional Yellow-Blue X-Men suits adds a bit more reality to this movie. I liked this movie a lot although I think it could have been much better. Being a comic book fan and guessing what the story of X3 is going to be like - which is easilly guessable by any comic book fan just by watching the ending of X2 - the wait for the third installment will be unbearable."

Wolverine starts to become the Wolverine we remember from the comic books and cartoons...simply losing it at times.  Just GREAT!  The acting was phenomenal on most accounts...even James Marsden whom I typically don't like very much.  Anna Paquin, however, was a bit off on some of her scenes but not so much to ruin the movie or detract from the overall experience.  Magneto, Mystique, Dr. X, Wolverine, Pyro and even Iceman all gave fantastic performances...leaving you wanting for more.<br/><br/>A definite must see!

","(spoilers??)<br/><br/>It's as though they attempted to overplot the movie.  I sometimes complain about poor plots.  This movie is over plotted.  They tried to shove to much story into the 2 hours they had.  In some instances, it created utter confusion.  It certainly wasn't as fun as the first.  The first movie had a comic book feel to it.  The second one is taking itself too seriously.  The score is somehow different and not as inventive.  Some of the special effects really suck, but in other cases it's amazing.<br/><br/>Then there's the obvious spoiler.  Throughout the movie they hint at something going on with Jean Grey.  So when you think she's buried under all that ice, was that really what happened.  So I had to ask an x men fan about that.  I guess most of them are laughing at those who think she's dead.  Oh well. ;)<br/><br/>Another gripe, the first movie was more open to outsiders.  You know, people who arn't X-Men fans.  X2 as they now call it (which will be really stupid if they call it X3 later....  Vin Diesel's gonna get some nasty one's on that.)  is not open to outsiders.  There's alot of need to know beforehand that you indeed need to know before watching the movie.  Frankly outsiders like myself will get utterly lost.

","X2 did for Xmen what Blade 2 did for Blade. This is an extremely good sequel and undoubtedly better than the first. The action is better, and with a bigger budget it'd better be. The opening sequence was mind blowing however it did make the rest of the movie a little dull since it was such a huge opening. They do a much better job developing some of the characters but i think that Cyclops is a lost cause. Storm is a lot better in this one but of course after the first, she couldn't be any worse honestly. At least she didn't spout off any cheeseball lines. <br/><br/>The story line is solid and lays the foundation for a promising trilogy. It lacks many of the storylines from the comics and cartoons but you can't ask for too much because it'd be quite difficult to pull off some of the things that the Xmen do on a daily basis in the comics and it'd take forever to explain the storylines and backgrounds or all the Xmen. Tackling the main characters and only the main ones seems to be the next best way to go and Singer does a good job laying it all out.<br/><br/>In my opinion, X2 is the real deal and the true hit of this early summer movie barrage, The Matrix to me is a huge flop. I don't care what anyone says, The Matrix Reloaded was trash. <br/><br/>My only suggestion for the next Xmen film is to have a new villain like Mr. Sinister, Juggernaut or Apocalypse. The whole Professor X, Magneto (with the bad costume) thingy is getting kind of tiresome. Also, when do they reveal that Mystique is Rogue's stepmother and is responsible for Rogue's powers? If she ever gets her powers in these movies. Maybe she's fated to stay a useless, maiden in distress.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Xmen 2: Xmen United gets a 9 out of 10"

","I was quite enthusiastic about seeing X2, and for the most part I left quite satisfied with the results.  I'm not quite ready to say that this film exceeds the first movie.<br/><br/>What we have here is a set of undeniably cool characters and fantastic scenes, but they are sewn together in predictable and almost cliche patterns.  Adding to the hurt is the fact that I watch movie trailers closely, and any big surprises this movie intended to deliver were drastically softened by the scenes shown there.  That may be unfair, but big blockbuster movies like this that plan on inundating people with marketing material should be more careful with what they reveal.  When you see 10-15 commercials plus 2-3 trailers for a movie, you are going to pick up on a lot of things unless you take better care to hide them.  Shame on the production team for that.<br/><br/>Character portrayals are quite good individually, but interactions are a little off.  Magneto and Mystique pull off the best chemistry in the movie amongst the characters from the first movie.  The scenes with Stryker where he interacts with Wolverine, Magneto, or Professor X are surprisingly good, pulling off a sense of real history that characters from the first movie got for free.  Other areas suffer.  Iceman's dealings with his family fell flat for me.  That should have been a pivotal scene, but it played out like a clip from 90210.  Luckily that scene doesn't last long.<br/><br/>The bad chemistry moments aren't really that bad, and they're quite hard to notice with all the action going on.  You rarely get a chance to breath before someone flexes their mutant powers for some reason.  Unfortunately, these displays of power often feel disjointed, like a bad fight scene. Punch, block, punch, block.  It feels like the script was divided up into one section for each mutant to show off his or her powers.  This gives the film overall an awkward flow.  The sheer coolness of most of these scenes tends to outweigh this awkwardness.  I'm going to rate this film an 8 out of 10 because I really did enjoy myself while watching it.  However I think that if I wait another week to review this film, it will drop to a 7.  The reason is because any thought after-the-fact on this film only further exposes its weaknesses, and that really isn't fair to a film that delivers some devastatingly good popcorn fun.<br/><br/>My advice would be to see this film without high expectations, and don't let the occasional brilliant scene get your hopes up for a smart film.  Set your brain on autopilot and bask in the great action.  In the end, the plot really doesn't fly, but pretty much everything else does, and marvelously. The opening scene alone should go down in history as one of the best fight scenes ever."

","Comic book movies get better and better as time goes on.<br/><br/>First it was Superman, which definitely was a groundbreaking movie considering what time it was made in.<br/><br/>Then it was Batman, which was my favorite movie of all time for about 15 years.<br/><br/>Then there was a big gap in the middle.  I do not want to consider sequels for some of these movies because they were not really groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Finally, in 1999, The Matrix.  This was a special effects masterpiece. Definitely in the top 5 of best comic book adaptations.<br/><br/>Then, in 2000, X-Men came out.  This was Marvel's first big hit, and paved the way for many comic books to become silver screen classics.<br/><br/>I personally did not like Spider-man.  I thought it was a 120 million dollar fanboy movie.  Do not get me wrong, it was very well made, but it was way too comic oriented, and the movies cannot be too much like the comics. Spider-man 2 will be awesome, though.<br/><br/>Daredevil is my #1 comic book movie of all time.  It was dark, violent, and I didn't have to take my mom to it because it was PG-13.  It is a shame it didn't do better in the box office.  If it was known more fondly by the world, it would probably have grossed almost as much as Spider-man.<br/><br/>Now we come to X2.  It is definitely the best written movie of all the comic book movies.  It should be nominated for an Oscar for screenplay, not just Visual Effects, which it will win, without a doubt.  The Nightcrawler beginning sequence was so breathtaking I had to whip out my puffer just to catch it (I don't have asthma.)  Mystique was also very cool.

","I must say I'm glad to see that we didn't just get to see a new movie with new characters and situations. We got to see our older characters grow as well, not leaving them behind.<br/><br/>Jean Grey, showed she new she had more power than she let on and was scared of it and we got to see the true power of Professor X.  We were shown Logan's Past, and Bobby's.  We got to see some of professors X's past as well.  We get to see Bobby's power work, and Rouge actually use her power to stop someone.<br/><br/>By far the best character was Nightcrawler.  Alan Cumming is great and this part was awesome.<br/><br/>The special effects were awesome and very believable for this Comic based movie.<br/><br/>All in all a must see for any Action Movie Fan."

The ending sure leads into the third movie. I hope they do it at least somewhat like the books. (issues 107 and 108, which I bought brand new too many years ago to count and still have) I strongly reccomend this movie. Parents and kids alike should enjoy it."
"egglestc","8","0","0","14 May 2003"," X2 and that means twice as good.
","What does this movie have in common with LOTR and star wars? Easy right, they are all examples of sequels that finally live up to the hype of the prequal and this is a good film.<br/><br/>I paid to see the first movie and was so disappointed a formulaic plot which does nothing to excite and very 2d characters acting through scenes that always left you wondering why they bothered. Ive heard it said that the first film in all three above examples introduced the characters. I have to question if 2 hours of introduction isn't a little excessive. If at the end of the Film your feel let down by the false expectations set by trailers you may not come back for the sequel. I believe the 'Introduction theory' is an excuse for shoddy film making or film making without real direction. There have been so many truly great one off films which didn't require a 2 hour intro to characters to set you up for the real film. Another point that should be made is that most of the time spent building characters in the first film revolves around Wolverine and in the sequel the director seems to have realised he's not the most interesting of  X People and has downgraded his amount of on screen time, so the intro film seems to have been somewhat of a waste of time. It is also a shame that Professor Charles Xavier doesn't feature more he is a bit part in the first film and although Patrick Stewart is given more scope it is much the same in the 2nd.<br/><br/>Anyway enough critique what about X2??<br/><br/>As if to disprove my own theory of not going back for more when you've seen a bad 1st attempt I paid up and again prepared Myself for another slow moving plotless and probably ultimately unfulfilling experience. Can you tell I was in a very positive state of mind?<br/><br/>Spoilers below.<br/><br/>So yes I have to say  I enjoyed it. Ian McKellon as Magneto has the best scene. His aid Rebecca Romijn as Mystique injects his Gaoler with a some form of soluble iron. Magneto extracts the  Iron from the Blood of his Gaoler which itself is so gory it deserves a higher certificate. He then uses the Iron  to break his cell and then to form a flat disc on which he stands and floats across the moat his cell is located on to the doorway. Here he turns the iron into pellets which he uses to break the glass door and kill his guards, its all truly great and in fact I wanted to see more of his escape it seemed rather dull to switch back at this point to a scene in a domestic house with Wolverine and rouge and some family rejection plot surrounding a minor character Iceman (who no matter how hard he tries isn't cool),  Bryan Singer definitely missed a trick there. The cell scenes are somewhat reminiscent of Silence of the lambs, Red dragon( why?) and Manhunter. I suppose you can only film a locked up a Brit in a set number of ways ! Alan Cumming as the night Crawler aided by having the best mutant powers available to the imagination and great computer generated imagery has the opening scene to himself. Breaking in to the US president's office beating up all his security guards before being shot just before stabbing the said president and having to make a quick escape. We discover he is in fact being controlled and is actually a rather Camp (Alan Cumming isn't that good an actor) German Christian unhappy clapper of a mutant. But who is controlling him?<br/><br/>No its not a Jedi mind trick its Willam Stryker, a Government baddy with predictably bad intentions. Yes Stryker is so bad and evil he wants to destroy the mutants in a very 'Wipe them out wipe them all out' kind of way. His reasons for this are somewhat convoluted apparently he's become twisted because he has producing a mutant boy of his own and cant stand the thought of it, mutants and himself all being in someway linked. I didn't really think this was needed he could have just been a nutter and it would have worked just as well. Stryker, as we find out, through the course of the film is also responsible for Wolverine. Chemical experiments, mad genius, Dr frankinstien etc etc. Its nice to see the characters especially the female ones being given a more central role and it pays off. We get more depth from the female actors and although there powers are somewhat predictably touchy feely. Storm is Mother Nature, Dr jean grey is a psychic obsessed by her emotions (which she can't control) and rouge whose powers only work when she touches another mutant. Even so the use of there powers is cleverly leveraged into the lime light and in Dr Jean Grey's case generates the set up for part III.<br/><br/>So the film was a success in my eyes a good plot some real character development and great effects that were backing up the great ideas and not attempting to make a film of effects. Should you see the first one? probably but hover over the fast forward button then go see X2 and enjoy."
"danm99","Null","0","0","13 May 2003"," Horrendous
","I am reviewing this movie from the perspective of someone who was never a big fan of the comic.  It is not that I didn't like the comic, but I never had the urge to get into it.  I preferred Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Superman, and the Hulk as opposed to the slightly more intellectual and sophisticated X-men.  Somehow my view of the x-men as a dull comic was just doubly reinforced by this exceedingly tiresome, pointless, and boring film. It was not funny, the plot stunk, and even the action was insipid in todays climate of ultra-special effects.  Film-making, is still an art form and this movie was completely artless even in the context of making a movie based on a comic strip.  The best scene was the opening scene with Night Crawler, by far the most intriguing character in the film. Wolverine was utterly predictable, lackluster and had no edge like the comic apparently had, and storm was lame as well, including her stupid storm power.<br/><br/>
The movie took on an endless drone of a plot which no one could possibly care about. I didn't even care about the surprise in the film.  Superman for instance, had funny interesting characters, such as the great Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty playing Lex Luther and his stupid sidekick, as well as Reeve who was quite humorous and enjoyable as the dorky Clark Kent.  The special effects were also somewhat ground breaking at the time but really the smarmy humor, story and characters made it enjoyable.  Not one actor in the x-men was worth a dime or given a chance to show any talent.  Did I mention Wolverine sucked?  Even the musical score was outstanding in Superman. The x-men, not groundbreaking in its special effects, lacked any semblance of humor and didn't make up for it with intensity.  It had a completely forgettable score and was filmed in this modern day plastic, generic style that put me to sleep.<br/><br/>As I said before, the only decent thing in the film was Night Crawler.  To all you die=hard adult x-men fans who give a crap about these comic book characters and their powers, etc., get a life, and don't let your loyalty drive you to spend a dime on this moron film unless you yourself are an artless moron."

","An entertaining super hero action film, that I enjoyed more than the original. Basicaly the plot has a sinister figure in the U.S. Government manipulating the President to try to wipe out the mutants once and for all... so they launch an assault on the X-Mansion and the X-Men wind up having to scatter and try to fight back. All the actors from the original film return and are joined here by a few other X-Men that have been brought in from the comics. A fairly faithfull rendition of the comic book storylines featuring decent acting and entertaining fight scenes (something lacking from the original). Halle Berry and Famke Janssen have more to do this time, Anna Paquin has less.. but the focus remains on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Patrick Stewart's Professor X. Still, it was vastly entertaining.. better than the original. GRADE: B+"
"stephenjames1979","Null","0","0","13 May 2003"," WARNING!!!!! SOME OF WHAT I SAY IN THIS COMMENT EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, DO NOT READ ON!!!!!
","With the exception of maybe Batman Returns, X2 is perhaps the best sequel ever made in movies. In this one, the movie really shows both sides of the story as to whether or not mutants should be allowed in society or not.<br/><br/>
There is more of a human side to some of the members of the new generation of X-Men. Iceman has a ""coming out"" talk with his parents who did not know they he was a mutant. Pyro is an outcast who never had a family (based on what I saw in the movie). In the first one there were subtle dialogue where it was hard to be accepted into society. Nightcrawler, in a conversation with Mystique in the movie, asks her: ""If you can change yourself to look like everyone else, why don't you?"" Mystique responds: ""We shouldn't have to."" Although this was a minor point of the movie, it did remind me much of how people that are different struggle for acceptance.<br/><br/>Another reason for loving this movie is due to some of the characters being much more closer to the characters in the comics. Some people may have heard that Wolverine really lets loose in this movie and trust me: HE DOES! He becomes more aggressive and releases his fury against the soldiers in a military operation against the school. Also, (in a possibility that there WILL be a third installment) Jean Grey experiences strange happenings throughout the movie. For true fans of the X-Men, they know what this means: PHOENIX IS COMING!"

","Storyless tripe.<br/><br/>Action? Yes.  Great characters?  Mostly.  Good actors?  Yes.  Special FX? Yes!  Good plot?  Nope!<br/><br/>The characters were already written, good special FX is a given, and the actors were already selected (in the 1st film).  The ONLY THING the makers of X2 had to do was write a good story.  And they failed.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie was neat.  Only because: 1. We love the characters so damn much, we ache to re-visit them, and 2. The special FX are cool (the few times they were not filmed in the dark).<br/><br/>For my $9.00 and the $1 Billion this junk will earn, I expect a good story.<br/><br/>I want drama!  I want build-up!  This story SUCKED.  Anyone who disagrees with me has never read a good book.  Nor seen a good movie for that matter.<br/><br/>Non-stop action does not make a good movie!  An explosion is NOT exciting. WAITING for an explosion, especially one that never comes, IS exciting.<br/><br/>From the previews, you already know that Magneto escapes and that the school is attacked.  THAT alone could've been the entire movie -- if they built up to it.  Instead, both things happen extremely early and rather abruptly. No build-up, no suspense.  It's over.  Unfortunately, the movie went on.<br/><br/>The music score of the first film was wonderful.  It resonates in my mind even now.  The music in this movie is just background mush.  Why?!  Oh why did they change it?!  What?  Were the royalties too high?  If you've seen this heap o' crap, try to think of the musical score.  Just try.  Can't even hear it, can you?  It was background garbage!<br/><br/>If you rated rated this pile of dung 8 stars or higher, let me just say this: you are easily fooled and easily entertained.  Go home and watch MTV.<br/><br/>Good story-telling vs Bad story-telling:<br/><br/>X-Men 1: We SEE Magneto in the concentration camp as a young boy, and we immediately understand his purpose and feelings throughout the film. GOOD story-telling.<br/><br/>X-Men 2: We are introduced to Stryker via a CONVERSATION between Magneto and the Professor. They say things like, ""Remember Stryker?' and ""Wasn't his son a student of yours?"" and then ""Wasn't he pissed at you because of this?"" and then ""he's in the military, remember?"" and then ""he's behind all this and he's coming to get us.""<br/><br/>Yeeeup.  That's how we learn about Stryker.  Man, is that GREAT story telling or what?  Watching the two heroes have a conversation about him. Anyone who's ever read a good book will recognize amateur hour when they see it.  Or in this case, Amateur 2 Hours plus commercials and previews.<br/><br/>THIS STORY SUCKED.<br/><br/>Think I'm being picky?  Okay, here's some details (and SPOILERS):<br/><br/>Wasn't that jet supposed to be ""super?""<br/><br/>The ""super"" jet is suddenly detectable by radar?  And can't outfly ordinary Air Force Jets?  And is simply shot out of the sky by typical air-to-air missiles?<br/><br/>What happened to the ""fantastic"" jet in the 1st film.  At that time, they simply said, ""If they have anything that can track us, they deserve to catch us.""  What happened to that wonderful weapon?<br/><br/>Forget it; it's gone!  Any poor writer given the task of creating a future X-Men story will have to do without it.  what's the point?  They can't fly anywhere if the American military can chase them down, and shoot them down, and even know that it's under the basketball court at the school!<br/><br/>Why would Cyclops SO suddenly stop attacking?  He was brainwashed, but 3 seconds later he's normal?  It's like watching Knight Rider get knocked on the head and get amnesia.  Remember that?  And 55 minutes later he gets hit on the head again and he's normal, remember?<br/><br/>I'm not even joking here.  One second he's trying to kill his own wife, and LITERALLY 2 seconds later he's crying, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I was brainwashed!""<br/><br/>Yeah, the writing in this movie was about that good.<br/><br/>Why fight when you're brainwashed?<br/><br/>Think of someone trying to write X3 or X4.  What kind of plot can they have? In this movie, it's established that the humans have the ability to brainwash any mutant.  This was stressed so much that the human Stryker even had a mutant slave!<br/><br/>Now, imagine yourself watching ANY future X-Men movie.  Whenever a mutant and human exit a room together, you'll have to ask yourself, ""Why didn't that human just brainwash him?""  Really?  Game over.  No story to tell at all.<br/><br/>Stryker: the omni-present bad guy.<br/><br/>In X2, Stryker appears in nearly EVERY DAMN scene.  Watch this:<br/><br/>1. He's in the Oval Office, 2. He's talking to politicians in the hallway, 3. He's in the plastic prison with Magneto, 4. He's attacking the school with the G-men, 5. He has a nice conversation with Wolverine, 6. He's there to greet his POW, Patrick Stewart, 7. He's in the fort, watching Wolverine approach on screen, 8. He's in nearly every shot in the finale, in the fort, 9. He's even OUTSIDE the fort, conveniently, when Wolverine comes back out! 10, But wait!  There's more!  He's still outside waiting to have a conversation with Magneto a few minutes later! 11. He's still outside one last time to talk to Wolverine again!<br/><br/>And I'm sure I've forgotten a crappy scene or two.  He was everywhere!<br/><br/>Remember that thing they had in the 1st film?  It was so cool.  That thing where Rogue was talking to Wolverine, as the characters were introduced to the audience.  It was there when we watched Wolverine discover the school and walk the halls for the 1st time.  That was called suspense!<br/><br/>Having been warned about the crapola story, you can sit and watch this vomit and enjoy some action scenes.  They're okay.  But this movie is only mediocre.<br/><br/>The well-trained lab rats who gleefully stand in line to give these people their $100 Million per weekend just make me sick.<br/><br/>5 outa 10.  That's ONLY for the special FX."

","I enjoyed X-Men 2, but I can't help thinking that it isn't as good as everyone is saying it is and it certainly isn't as good as the first film. Sure, there are great effects and lots of action, but there are too many characters - some of whom have absolutely nothing to do - and the plot is overcomplicated and the film too long.  X2 lacks the characterisation and relationships that set the first film apart from others of the genre.  None of the characters has been developed, and the relationships that were so strongly built in the first film are sacrificed to give the action more screen time.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are both wonderful as always, the rest of the cast have little to do beyond flex their super powers."

","The wait is finally over for all the fans of the comic book saga from Stan Lee. The sequel from one of the major blockbuster hits of 2000 has arrived; and it isn't to much to say that it has surpassed the original. By that, this movie makes history being one of the first, IF NOT THE FIRST sequel to actually manage to be better than the original. The budget is bigger, the cast is larger and better, the plot is deeper, the action and the situation are more compelling and the special effects, although outstanding, do not treat the plotline or the characters as secondary. X2 picks up where X Men left wrapped up, so the characters have little evolution from the previous situation they were: still unaccepted by society and now with a bigger problem: General William Stryker, a cold hearted man full of rage by his wife's death due to their son's mutation problem, goes much further than Senator Kelly ever did. He wants to use Professor Xavier and his Cerebro to put down every living mutant on the face of the earth, so things can come back to normality. All the previous characters and actors are back, this time better looking and with expanded roles and screen time. It's not to much to say that X Men is everything Spider Man could have been and isn't. It is already a new Star Wars saga, because the wonder, the beauty, the action and the actors manage to attract unfamiliared viewers, what also contributed to this success was the fantastic trailer, that was undoubtely the best trailer of the year, and actually didn't steal to much of the movie, because it still had much to give. Every one involved in the project specially the actors  should be congratulated for their work, most specially Hugh Jackman for his excellent composition of Wolverine. Professor Xavier ends up the movie with one magnificent sentence that should be applied to the X MEN saga: ""We're here to stay""!<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"supertom-3","9","0","0","14 May 2003"," Exceeds your expectations tenfold!!!
","This movie rocks big time! Where the first was just an appetizer and an introduction to some interesting characters, this movie adds more layers but also blows you away with the sheer scale and excitement. Now I liked the first movie but it wasn't a top draw movie, it was just a good movie, between 3 and 4 out of 5. This is a solid 4 and a bit more.<br/><br/>
The strengths of the first film are all evident again, but are significantly more increased. The supporting characters and bad guys are a lot better (with no offence to Sabretooth but complete offence to Toad) and the X-Men have even more interest with their characters. The action was good in the first but nothing that slapped your face and choke slammed you hard to your cinema seat like in this. The opening action scene in the Whitehouse is exceptional as is the fighter plane chase as well, and the face off between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is also very exciting.<br/><br/>Basically this has really launched the franchise as a tent pole film for the summer. I eagerly await X3. This film is very interesting with a real shock at the end, and the development of some character relationships is also equally interesting, such as Jean and Wolverine and Iceman and Rogue. Pretty much all the roles are better than they were in the first, including Mystique, Pyro, Iceman and most definitely the more central characters like Storm, Jean, Wolverine and also Xavier. Rogue was reduced but not to a massive degree.<br/><br/>Yet again Ian Mckellen is on scene stealing form as Magneto. Hugh Jackman exudes toughness and charisma and comes a close second to Sir Ian and then the rest are all fantastic, worthy of mention are Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart (of course) Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and the sexy ladies Halle Berry, a significantly improved role for Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos and the gorgeous Famke Janssen.<br/><br/>The effects and action are astounding; the only problem being that the end doesn't quite live up to the fantastic opening of the film. Wolverines action scenes are much better and his blades are used a lot more. All the action in this is great there are no flat scenes. <br/><br/>Overall this must go down as one of the best comic book movies, dare I say it better than Spidey last year. This certainly goes down as a personal favourite, and is well worth a repeat view. This film has set a great benchmark for this year's host of blockbusters. ****1/2"

"Pavel-8","6","0","0","13 May 2003"," Too Dam Much.
","**Warning! Plot Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>There's a reason that most superhero movies feature a sole titular character (""Superman"", ""Spiderman"", ""Daredevil"", etc.).  Delving into the life of one such person is plenty of story for one movie.  ""X2"" perfectly illustrated the opposite situation.  The major flaw with the original ""X-Men"" was the lack of development of a few characters, like Cyclops and Storm, who were basically defined by their powers.  Wolverine and Rogue were fleshed out, but that was about it.  So what did director Bryan Singer and company do for the sequel?  That's right...more characters!!  <br/><br/>While some new mutants are hashed out well (Nightcrawler), others are one-dimensional (Deathstrike...what was her purpose?  Just to fight Wolverine because Stryker couldn't?), or don't have enough screen time (Pyro, Colossus...I hope they are featured more in the inevitable sequels). Plus the veteran mutants whose backstories were shafted in the original were largely ignored again (Storm...seriously, tell me one thing about her character besides her power...or Mystique...any idea why she's bad?).  With so many people and storylines, it is difficult to truly become involved in each character and thus the story as a whole.  That is the core problem, one that is woven through the entire movie. <br/><br/>Having said that, I enjoyed much of this movie, which provided many  moments of sheer entertainment.  The opening scene of Nightcrawler wreaking havoc on the White House, brilliantly accompanied by Mozart's Requiem, was an excellent introduction to both Nightcrawler and the movie.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of ""X2.""  The scene of Pyro going psycho on the local cops was quite good, and I liked how that sequence was resolved.  Other scenes, like the invasion of the mansion and Magneto's escape, were entirely enjoyable; but there were also random scenes, such as Mystique's seduction of Wolverine.  The latter parts enhanced the unfulfilled desire to learn more about other characters, as they seemed to be part of a larger story that was shaved down in the final cut.    <br/><br/>The end sequence at the dam was the other major problem I had.  Too many disparate things were occurring simultaneously, and it took too long to resolve them all.  We know roughly what's going to transpire, so get on with it already.  That's another byproduct of so many characters.  And that series of events also raised the single biggest question I had:  Why didn't Iceman just freeze the dam water?  Wouldn't that have solved everything?  I suppose there is an unexplained reason behind this, but I couldn't discern it.  That unanswered query only exacerbated my frustration with the finale. And the ending quote was plain silly.  Everyone knows the social message that all ""X-Men"" stories are supposed to have.  Was it really necessary to beat the audience over the head with that point?  Quit trying to turn entertainment into politics.  <br/><br/>Given the circumstances of making a follow-up to ""X-Men"", I'm not sure how the sequel could have been improved.  More characters were virtually demanded by fans, and merely pitting the good mutants against the bad mutants wasn't going to work again.  The end result is a movie that was highly entertaining and visually arresting at times, but also lacked the necessary depth and character development to step beyond popcorn flick status.  <br/><br/>Bottom Line:  Wildly fun at points, but there was ""X2"" much to cover.  6 out of 10."

Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) along with the other mutants do battle against William Cox (played by Brian Cox) who wants to destroy them (his son happens to be a mutant,too!).  There ends up being a showdown between William Cox and the mutants at a remote alkalai dam, and somehow things get turned around and all of the humans are in danger in place of the mutants.  The question is whether Cox will be able to execute his evil schemes or whether the X-Men will be able to thwart him and avert catastrophe and the death of either all of the mutants or all of the humans.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is likeable as Wolverine.  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is fascinating (in more ways than one!) as Mystique.  Alan Cumming is intense and creative as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler who is hands down the most intersting character in this movie.  The rest of the great cast (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry, Famke Jansen, James Marsden, Brian Cox, Bruce Davison and Anna Paquin) are basically wasted in idiotic cardboard thin roles which they phoned in.   The film does utilize some terrific special effects and visuals, but even they get boring before this two hour movie is over.<br/><br/>However, that is about the extent of my compliments for this movie.  ""X-2"" is just plain 'dull', in a  word.  The story gets moving very slowly.  The action is routine.  The dialogue is corny.  The movie is too long.  Most of the characters are bland (with the exception of Nightcrawler).  ""X-2"" is a great disappointment after the first X-Men movie which I genuinely liked. The first one was quaint and imaginative as well as exciting.  My advice to you is save your eight bucks and wait for the DVD rental.  I give this movie a 69/100."

","Let's see. It has been three years since the last installment of the series based on the characters from Marvel Comics,but lets just say that this one has live up to its reputation. The second installment to the series,""X2:X-Men United"" is going to really satisfy its fans from the first one,including zealous devotees of the comic books that spawned the flicks. With this new installment,director Bryan Singer is able to leap into the foray without the cumbersome character and situation setups needed for the initial film,so with this one,""X2"" rips along at a faster pace,pulsing with wilder action sequences and more dazzling visual effects than ever before. Also added to the new mix and a new batch of characters mixed in with some of their most deadliest rivals,but in this one unlike the first,it sees the two rival mutant factions(led by Patrick Stewart's Xavier and Ian McKellan's Magneto) join forces over a governmental society that wants to get rid of mutants and here is where the action really flies off the ground,and it doesn't disappoint. Also,this one is more darker and longer than the first one(over two hours long)and it also explores into each one of mutants capablities. Call this one a installment worth waiting for,and it shows as one of the first post-September 11th blockbusters of the summer. Rating: ****1/2 out of ***** stars."

","Rule One of successful sequels: reprise the main characters.  The noble Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his friend Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the sinister Magneto (Ian McKellan) and his aide Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and most of the other mutants from the original movie are back with their varied gifts. <br/><br/>Rule Two: introduce some new characters. So this time we have Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox), a human who is as nefarious as any mutant, and some new mutants, including blue-skinned, German-speaking (really!) Kurt Wagner (Alan Cumming) and metal-taloned Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu).<br/><br/>
Rule Three: better the effects. While some of the scenery looks obviously artificial, generally the effects are extremely well-done with some great form-changing sequences.<br/><br/>Rule Four: develop the narrative. Ah, there's the rub ..<br/><br/>
The pacing of the sequel is better than the original, because we don't have all that scene-setting, but instead more sustained action. But the storyline is weak, when it isn't confused. And the script - with the rare good line (""You are a god among insects"") - is banal. <br/><br/>Where the X-men franchise scores over super-heroes such as Spiderman or Daredevil is that there are so many special powers to display. The down-side though is that the multitude of players allows no space for character exploration or development. So, the film is fun, furious but ultimately froth. <br/><br/>I expected a lot of the original and was a rather disappointed but, this time, I knew what to expect and it delivered on that limited level."

","It was MUCH better than the first one! The action and special effects sequences in this movie were top notch. I didn't much care about the first one and as I was watching it, I realized one of the reasons why: the first one was mainly establishing all the characters and their powers and left hardly any room for action and coolness. The second one basically devoted ALL of its time to action and coolness because all the characters were already established by the first movie. I also think Bryan Singer, the director, improved 100%. I thought he was wrong for X-MEN 1 and I wasn't a big fan of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but on X2, he did an excellent job. Maybe a lot of people helped him on X2 since the budget was a lot bigger. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (who worked on the first X-MEN movie and on THREE KINGS) was also really creative. I especially liked the scene where Mystique seduces the prison guard in the bar. It has really clever and weird angles. Of course the special effects and makeup was awesome (especially the stuff with Nightcrawler).<br/><br/>There really were only two problems with the movie: the screenplay could have been better and the acting could have been A LOT better. Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen all were pretty good, but everyone else sort of sucked.<br/><br/>My grade:<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","It was the very nature of the original ""X-Men"" that kept it from being the no-holds-barred action movie we all wanted.  This was for a number of reasons:<br/><br/>1) None of the principal characters could be killed, as they were needed for the sequel(s).  So nothing was really resolved at the end of the first movie.<br/><br/>2) Any significant twist of plot or revelations had to be saved for later installments to give them more weight.<br/><br/>3) Exposition, exposition, exposition.<br/><br/>Now comes the sequel, more of the type of movie we wanted from the first one.  The pieces are all in place to give us a deeper, faster, higher-octane entertainment.  Freed from the bounds of having to explain all the backstory, we move rapidly forward in each character's development (though some characters' day is still clearly to come).<br/><br/>However, this movie again ends with the feeling that the REAL war between humans and mutants is still in the future.

"woody-85","9","0","0","10 May 2003"," This movie *is* X-men. The first one should be renamed ""X-men -1"" or an introduction to the X-men.
","The 1st X-men was a very solid work for what it aimed for, but not quite accomplished.<br/><br/>Well it was good enough to deserve a success, good enough to please the spectators with managing to put on screen the X-men in a debatable but solid adaptation, but not accomplished. It was solid, not cheesy, and it resisted multiple views much MUCH more than the overpraised Spiderman. You could say it was too short for the material. Or just too short overall (unconfident producers? come on not even 1h30?), and much too short to all together introduce the characters, raise a bunch of unresolved issues, open for a sequel and make a few things happen. So yeah X-men seemed to me liked unfinished (good) work. The most solid superhero movie since Batman 2 though. Or a promise to make the most solid superhero movie since Batman 2.<br/><br/>Now seeing X2 makes me feel like i was right, by bringing much good stuff that was announced by the first, but kept out of it. Dozens of mutants fighting in a tornade of kick bottom special effects. Histories, ambiguities, a good progression and a good rythm. Dont mistake me though. It's not a Tim Burtonesque variation on the theme of superheros. It's just a very honest and very good big dollars work under huge constraints. The hardest kind of film making, some would say.<br/><br/>I think the beginning of the movie shows how much X-men is a very unique comics series. The multiplicity of characters and powers just blows you away for the 1st hour. I'm still feeling that the rythm of the movie is awkward though, because of this ""so many characters, so many powers, so many stories"" thing that must have made the script just has hellish to do as those of the LOTR trilogy. Maybe what this movie lacks, though, is 1 character to really focus on, and the focus on Logan is probably is even shyer than in the 1st movie (god i was relieved that the use of the unexpected stardomship of Halle Berry remained in marketing campaigns only and did not seem to interfere with the film).<br/><br/>Anyway, a weird rhythm due to hard adaptation, but all the expectations are satisfied. You'll get your investment back from the first movie, only 5pled!"

They actually gave Halle Berry some speaking lines.<br/><br/>I like how Famke Janssen looks here, better than the first movie (or the last, but the last there is a reason for how she looks). My favourite thing about this film was the way Nightcrawler was shown, and the way he was filmed teleporting was exactly how I imagined it when I used to read X-Calibur (The comic series where Nightcrawler spent most of his time).<br/><br/>Although I saw this twice in the theatre, I did not really recognise the ""Pheonix Saga"" until I saw X-3 and they brought out that part of the story.<br/><br/>What this story deals with is mostly Wolverine's past. They changed the ""Lady DeathStrike"" character just a bit, and I have to say I like the revision.<br/><br/>I think this film was the director's masterpiece, not really having been impressed by Superman Returns, I feel he is a traitor to Marvel for leaving the franchise and going off to DC-land.<br/><br/>Since the first X-Men movie came out, each subsequent Marvel movie has exceeded the quality of the previous one.<br/><br/>Looking forward to The new Hulk...

X2 tries to give a bit more of screen time, this time, to most of the important characters. Fans will be extremely pleased because Colossus gets a bit of screen time too!

The casting is superb and nobody can miss the fighting scenes especially with Nightcrawler in the whitehouse and the fight Wolverine has with Lady Deathstrike. The fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is fleshtearing and very painful to watch. The fight is intense and moviegoers can't help but wince everytime Deathstrike stabs Wolverine. Special Effects was awesome, the movie excelled beyond my wildest imagination. All and all, this is one amazing film with awesome special effects. It is not to be missed!

","Odd that a trailer would convince someone _not_ to watch a movie, as its purpose is the opposite. This movie's trailer makes it appear as though it is nothing more than senseless violence from two seconds into the film until the closing credits... The reality is that this movie has a very well thought out plot, and it was also very well executed. As a sequel, it certainly helps that the original movie had a very open ended conclusion, but also, this movie refers in meaningful ways to the original, giving people who have seen the first insight into what exactly is happening, while not simply embellishing on the original plot. The plot branches off the first one, while creating much of a new plot. That having been said, if you want to see this movie, you would be well advised to watch the first one first, although it is certainly not a prerequisite.<br/><br/>The special effects were implemented in such a way that they are a very major part of the film, but by no means do they dominate it! They are never used gratuitously, instead, only when it contributes to the plot. Other Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies could certainly take a lesson from this film. Two minutes in, the effects will have you utterly stunned, while still introducing you into the plot.<br/><br/>Onto another certainly shocking item: the acting. It can honestly be said that these actors were doing this film to make a great film. I take that back... not just the actors.... everyone remotely involved in this film was doing this to make it the best. Again, a shocking truth for a Sci-Fi/Fantasy film.<br/><br/>I finished watching this movie just an hour ago, and I can still hardly believe how well it was done. As a rule, sequels are generally thought of as being lesser films, with less plot, and more for thrill than anything else. This film is in near perfect balance. Not just as a sequel, but as a true film, X2 is in a league of its own.<br/><br/>I give this film a very well deserved Five Stars *****"

It never even comes close to the exceptional plots and events in the comics.  The stories are way too thin and light.  With the possibility of only making 2 or 3 X-men movies I would have liked to have seen something more substantial in plot department.

"sollthar","10","0","0","10 May 2003"," One of the best Comicfilms ever
","XMen 2 came to cinema in a very difficult time. Therefore I just saw the trailers for the upcoming bluckbusters ""Matrix Reloaded"", ""Terminator 3"" and ""the Hulk"" right before X2 in the cinema, wich made it kind of difficult for X2 to beat just those trailers. Another part that made it difficult is the fact that comicfilms - except Burtons Masterpiece ""Batman"" and Raimis smart and entertaining hit ""Spiderman"" - are mostly pretty average films that provide only small parts of intelligent entertainment.<br/><br/>
But I can say with good conscience, that X2 not only masters this task, but also raises the bar for exactly those blockbusters immensly!<br/><br/>
Director Bryan Singer has really made a character driven actionfilm, and these don't often succeed, but X2 is definately one of those that did.<br/><br/>So X2 offers lots of great action (even only the opening sequence with nightcrawler is more than awesome) and never loses it's characters, wich is an even more remarkable because there are plenty of characters in X2 that all want to share their bits and not just want to be a stereotype in the background.<br/><br/>So the adventure of Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Dr Jean Grey, Iceman, Nightcrawler and Rogue fighting side a side with Magneto, Mystique and Pyro against the evil general Stryker and his men, is pure entertainment and pure fun. The World of the XMen comes alive, and this for more than 2 hours.<br/><br/>
Next to the tremendous achievement of director Bryan Singer and the fantastic work of several SFX houses (just read the end credits for how many there were) this is mostly due to a great cast!<br/><br/>So Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Ian McKellen as Magneto give a great performance. Two actors with a simply breathtaking screen-presence. And in a time of Star Trek and Lord of the Rings the conflict will - at least in the heads of many viewers - be extended to Captain Jean-Luc Picard versus Gandalf the Grey. What more can you want?<br/><br/>A very good choice again was Hugh Jackman for the part of Wolverine, a very rough, animal and yet very human character who comes to believable life thanks to Jackmans performance.<br/><br/>Another pearl is Bryan Cox playing William Stryker, a man who hates every mutant, allthough or most probably just because his own son is one of them.<br/><br/>
As a result I personally can say that X2 definately belongs in my all time best list. X-Men 2 is cinema as it should be: fast, cool, beautiful and intelligent."
"cyclops2002","Null","0","0","10 May 2003"," A Fair Review
","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Before I even begin, I have to stress out my point that this is a review of X2 as a stand-alone movie.  We all know that this is a sequel, but to give a fair review, I have to write about this film without having to compare it to the first installment.<br/><br/>The whole plot of the film zeroes in on a military officer named Mr. William Stryker.  His disappointment in life lies in the fact that his son is a mutant.  Therefore he goes out on a mission to destroy every living mutant on the planet.  We also learn later on in the film that it is this character who was responsible for the creation of the X-Men character, Wolverine.<br/><br/>
Because of this sudden appearance of Mr. William Stryker, the X-Men and the other mutants Magneto and Mystique are forced to join forces whether they like it or not.  New X-Men characters are introduced in this film and are given more character depth- namely Iceman (a.k.a. as Bobby Drake), and Pyro. Iceman has the ability to create all forms of ice either with a simple touch, or one breath.  Pyro has a similar power, the difference is that he can manipulate fire in all forms and use it to destroy his enemies.   His weakness is that he can only control the fire, he cannot ignite it. Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Famke Jemsen all come back to reprise their roles as Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, and Dr. Jean Grey. The same goes with Ian McKellen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Magneto and Mystique.<br/><br/>In X2, the title can't be more apt because despite their differences in opinion about how to deal with the human race accepting the mere existence of mutants, they are uncomfortably forced to unite to defeat their enemy, Mr. William Stryker.<br/><br/>I find this film impressive because a lot of comic book characters have been turned into movies such as Superman, Spiderman, Batman, and Daredevil. However, director Bryan Singer manages not to create a film that is not too comic booky, silly, or downright stupid.  It has a PG-13 rating because kids are not going to totally absorb the lesson in this film.  Children may walk away wishing they had extra-ordinary powers and become X-Men as well, but they still won't be able to grasp the whole genesis of X2- with the exception of the (no pun intended) intellectually gifted kids.  Some of the characters of this film are given a lot of character depth; which is imperative in every film.<br/><br/>My disappointment in X2 lies in the fact that I its one hour and 55 minutes of screen time, they still fail to give character development in Cyclops, Storm, and Mystique.  We delve deeper into the psyche of Wolverine and why he has all this rage exploding inside him.  We also are entertained into how Iceman's family reacts when they learn that their son is a mutant.  I was laughing when Iceman's mother asks him, `Have you ever tried.not being a mutant?'  This can very well be a metaphor for homosexuality- mothers asking their gay children if they could convert to heterosexuality, which is an impossible feat.<br/><br/>All in all, X2 is an entertaining, sci-fi action flick that surprisingly makes you ask questions about yourself- was there a time that I was considered a misfit but I still felt better about it?  Was there a time that I feared someone because he or she had something out of the ordinary?<br/><br/>I give this movie three out of four stars.  It is very rare that I watch a movie and then find myself aching to watch it all over again until it surfaces on DVD format.  Go see it and you will see what I mean."

","After seeing the first Xmen movie, I was very excited when the second movie was released.

However I was disappointed, especially the at the end when Iceman could have easily solved the problem by freezing the water in the dam!!! The plot was spotty with some characters being developed (Woverine, Magneto, Mystic) and some were just used as extras ( Cyclops, Rogue, Pyro). Having said that the action sequence and the special effects were amazing, it was obvious where all the money were spent.<br/><br/>So overall it was a good action movie with the usual spotty plot, so typical of the action movies.

","It is rare that a sequel is better than the first, but that's the case for ""X2.""  Seeing it for the first time is exhilarating--and a bit creepy, since things keep going wrong (comparisons between ""X2"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are right-on in this matter).  The film isn't just a visual delight and action extravaganza, it's also has aspects of a thoughtful examination of bias, minority, and government power.  I've heard it said that a director's first job is in casting, and once again, Singer delivers by not only bringing back the core cast, but also in the addition of Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and especially Shawn Ashmore (Iceman).  Singer uses each actor perfectly (why not have Oscar winner Anna Paquin carry much of the non-action drama?), but his greatest feat is that he has made ""X2"" better than its predecessor.  Kudos to him for that, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for ""X3."""

In fact, I only went because I got to choose where we went to dinner, so my dad chose the movie.  That said, I loved it.  The characters were well-developed, the plot was interesting but never too complicated to follow, and once you got in tune with how the directors think you could almost predict what would happen, although there was always a twist.  The actors were all well-cast, both the younger ones and the older, and unlike many romantic comedies and love stories that have been coming out recently, there was definite chemistry where there needed to be.  Let me put it this way: With about 20 minutes of the movie left, the movie stopped and an ad came on.  We all left the theater, to find out that there was a big storm (the night before there were several tornadoes, so we were all kind of scared), and possibly a tornado near us.  A little while later, my dad and I heard the sound come back on in the theater... so we went in and finished the movie.  It was just that good-- we wanted to see the end rather than try to beat the storm home. (Which we did, by the way-- power was knocked out until 12 hours later in our entire neighborhood.)  So yeah.

Turns out I should have re-viewed the prequel ""X Men"" because this picks up exactly where the last one left off and there's many references to previous happenings (hmm, what was that about those scars?) -- but then I was the oldest person at the morning showing.<br/><br/>Director/story writer Bryan Singer has learned the lesson of successful comic book/super heroes' movies that it's the relationships stupid, though the kids in the audience do get restless during the scenes and dialogue that appealed to me (like the mutants looking longingly at warm family photographs with one who is about to ""come out"" to his parents) more than the predictable special effects (after all, what were we supposed to think would happen to a super secret hideaway built under a huge concrete dam?).<br/><br/>
There are a lot of good actors slumming here (Brian Cox's and Hugh Jackman's accents slip at the start but get stronger), giving the sidelong glances, sexual temptations, and repartee more gravitas than they were written with. Jackman also committed a lot of time to a trainer and nutritionist to develop that non-CGI body that fills the screen quite charismatically -- and aids the joke when he sardonically explains his teaching role at the school for the gifted.<br/><br/>While the women get crucial plot points, the actresses don't have a lot to do; not much Famke Janssen can do with her telekinetic Phoenix power but scowl or Halle Berry cloud over her eyes as the weather gets Storm-ized. I'm sure these women would have had more ideas about mutant foreplay to respond to the ongoing guy-to-guy running query to Iceman on how he and Rogue (of the lifeforce squeezing power) manage their budding romance than ""We're working on it.""<br/><br/>Alan Cummings leaving everyone in the blue dust of his teleporting mutant is fun and cool (and I enjoyed his repetition of his origins that reminded me of a running gag in ""Due South."" )<br/><br/>I did find a couple of plot points confusing, but could connect my own dots.<br/><br/>
The music never stops pounding, but then it was written by the editor."

","Blade was way underrated. X-Men was excellent. Blade II was amazing fun. Spider-Man was outstanding. X2 blows them all away.<br/><br/>I could go on forever, but there was just so much more of a ""this is the film we wanted"" after X-Men.  Singer knows exactly what he's doing and I can't imagine anyone else at the helm for the third one.  He at least has to write it, that's for sure.  Even if you've never seen the first one, X2 cleverly gives you all the info you need without beating you over the head AND makes you want to see the first one again.<br/><br/>This even beats The Crow as my favourite comic film.  Ignoring that, its one of my favourite of any films."
"andregpinto","Null","0","0","10 May 2003"," Some considerations about the movie
","I think some people here critisized some aspects in the movie without paying much attention in some parts.<br/><br/>At First, i think this is a very well done effort from Singer. I consider this a perfect mix between X-Men comics and the movie. The new cinematic mutant universe proves that it can stand in its own...<br/><br/>Lets see:<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Nightcrawler is a great character, although after the opening fight scene (arguably the best scene in the entire film) he changes into a completely different character almost immediately"".<br/><br/>The Nightcrawler character is different in the beggining because he is in Striker's hands. Its very clear in the plot. See Scott, Magneto and Xavier...<br/><br/>""Wolverine, for example, was created by a human (not a God, by the way), as was his worthy adversary near the end of the film"".<br/><br/>Wolverine was a mutant before get contact with Striker. He was chosen by the villain to have his bone changed to adamantiun because of his ""healing powers""...<br/><br/>""(spoilers) I was disappointed with the fate of Jean Grey, even if only because her `death' was so avoidable"".<br/><br/>There is a very special purpose in her act, but you only will see it in the third movie. The hint is: If a mutant can't control enormous powers, the only solution is isolation...<br/><br/>""However, even the most basically educated members of the audience, who realize that the iron in your blood is not exactly metal, will probably appreciate the way this was pulled off (that is, of course, if they were able to see the screen enough while repeatedly slapping their foreheads in disbelief)"".<br/><br/>What scientist or doctor told you this? yes, we have metal in our composition...and there are people that have large mount of iron in their bloods and still living at certain point. But this is fiction, not documentary. Superman can fly, and so Magneto can extract metal from a guard, and Neo can dodge bullets. Its only a movie!!!"
"psi_fla","Null","0","0","10 May 2003"," More ambitious, but better?
","The sequel to 2000's X-Men is certainly a more ambitious film than its predecessor, and, in many ways, a superior film as well. Director Bryan Singer has built on the strengths of the original and added more action, and the results are effective.<br/><br/>We pick up almost exactly from where we left off in the first film. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his band of X-Men face an even tougher challenge than last time round. after an attack on the US president by a mutant known as Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). Thus General William Stryker (Brian Cox) who has always been opposed to mutants, vows to begin a full scale war against them. So this means that Xavier must team up with Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his colleagues - thus explaining the film's subtitle, `X-Men United'. In an ensemble piece such as this, acting is generally irrelevant, but everyone does what you'd expect from them. The newcomers, which include Nightcrawler, Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu, from The Scorpion King), all fit into place seamlessly. Also, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) get more screen time than before, although the same can't be said for James Marsden's Cyclops.<br/><br/>At 2 hours and 10 minutes, you'd think Singer was aiming for a Superman-like epic with this film. You get the feeling that he wants to humanise most of the ensemble - however, their size, along with the time required for the action scenes, ensures that this task is doomed to failure. As a result, we never really identify strongly with anyone (with the possible exception of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine). This weakens the emotional impact of some important scenes. That said, some viewers may have been dissatisfied had too long been spent on character-building and less on action. But, truth be told, you cannot please everyone, and Singer has done probably the best he could have done with the material at his disposal.<br/><br/>The greater emphasis on action in this sequel has given us more chances to see the mutants' powers - and some powers they are too. And there's also the (now obligatory) smart in-jokes, though they're generally not as clever as the original's.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell, X2 is a bigger, brighter and louder version of X-Men that delivers just as much, if not more, than the original, while also standing up well on its own terms. For some, it can act as the perfect appetizer for The Matrix Reloaded."

"leyenda61","7","0","0","9 May 2003"," worth the price of admission, BUT...
","How was X2?  Ehh...fairly decent.  definitely worth the price of admission, but the movie is not without serious flaws.<br/><br/>X2 was thankfully not as boring or lethargic as X-Men, but it still needed a shot of adrenaline.  Even though there was a boatload of characters, i felt that not enough stuff actually happened in the movie.  I felt there needed to be at least two more one-on-one fight scenes and also a good group-vs-group maylay.  Nightcrawler's intro and the Wolverine/Deathstrike fight were great, but I felt they were bigger teaser to upcoming bigger events that just never happened. The X-Men were repesented as a minority sect fleeing their persecutors.  I think that perspective makes for great story-telling, but i think for an action movie, Singer spent too much time having the X-Men on the defensive.  I've read reviews about Marden's portrayal of Cyclops.  Yes, the role was reduced, but I think his brief presense and emotional breakdown of losing Jean were very well done.<br/><br/>Lastly, I wasn't crazy about the ending.  X-men versus lots of water. That was about as satisfying as the alternate ending of Blade 1 featured on the DVD.  In the alternate ending of Blade 1, he's up against this 5 story blood tornado.  But the makers reshot the ending because the scenario of protagonist versus liquid just doesn't produce a big enough pay-off to movie-goers.  People go to see a big-budget action movie to see the ultimate conflict resolved in a big action sequence.  Sorry, guys, spewing water just doesn't cut it.  The resolution has to be with the antagonist that faced the protagonist with overwhelming odds throughout the movie, not with a soulness, faceless force of nature that appears in the last reel.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other little things that needed tightening up, but enough people have written about them, so I don't feel i need to.  Granted, while there was a lot of room for improvement and the movie was too long to sit through (w/o jetting the the bathroom), i still walked away happy that I saw it.  I think non-comic books fans would be uber-bored, but I must confess, I will definitely pay to see X3 when it rolls around in a year or two. Hopefully, the movie makers will have learned from the mistakes in X-Men & X2"

","As a long time X-Men fan I must admit that this movie really delivers! Practically everything is done well, from magnificent cast and intriguing plot to special effects and minor (but yet important) details, all taken from the vast X-Men mythos.<br/><br/>It has been a long since I last felt shivers come down my spine in cinema, but this time the movie nailed so fantastically the essence of X-Men that I was totally entertained. The showing of Jean's rising Phoenix-powers made my skin tingle and hair rise at the back of my neck. Cool! There were so many occasions during the movie that I wondered: ""How can this be so good!""<br/><br/>Who says sequels are usually worse than original movies? Take Terminator 2, Aliens and The Empire Strikes Back for example. X2 goes right up there with those classics.<br/><br/>The SFX are great, and to all those dull-minded idiots who say this movie is all about showing off with new computer technology and nothing more: bite me! It's a fantasy movie about super-heroes with super-powers - you need SFX to make it work. The effects are so well blended to the movie that it really looked like Pyro shot fireballs, Wolverine had claws and Storm could create tornados. The FX did not look a bit fake.<br/><br/>Though I must admit that it takes a bit of earlier knowledge of X-universe to get the most of X2, there are so many nice details spread all over the movie. For average science-fiction and action fan X2 serves as a great ""summer blockbuster"", but for true enthusiast it is totally, absolutely magnificent masterpiece! Thank you Singer & co!<br/><br/>Rating 10/10<br/><br/>PS. While other kids spent their teenage years hanging in discos and downtown having fun, I stayed home and read comics (X-Men being the best). Finally it all pays off!"

","X-2 A very fun and exciting film for X-Men fans and newcomers alike. My mother has become a huge Wolverine fan thanks to Hugh Jackman. I had her draw Wolvie for me over ten tears ago, and I never thought I would see her actually interested in the character. =) I was amazed to see Ebert give this an overall good review though. In even a 2hr plus movie it is really hard to get much character development, but they do really well with the ever expanding cast. All the little cameos for fans to catch are also nice.<br/><br/>One minor complaint- Chris Claremont really deserved a screen credit since the story did draw so heavily from ""God Loves, Man Kills"". I think the change of Stryker to a military guy versus the fanatical evangelist in the original story was probably a wise move since it would have offended a lot of people (especially those who look for something to cause offense). A well thought out character showing how religion is sometimes used as a justification for prejudice is probably too much depth for some people to follow in a action format.<br/><br/>I was really worried when I first heard they would be doing a live action X-Men movie. Now I actually am looking forward to a third movie which is extremely rare. If Singer is on board for X-3, then it should again  be a fun ride that respects the old fans too. I also look forward to the DVD release of X-2 to see what extra stuff he had trimmed for time."
"Sukisuki","10","0","0","9 May 2003"," It is indeed the best one that I have ever seen.
","***MILD SPOILERS*** This is so nice...<br/><br/>I was in my seat during the first day the film was shown in Pohnpei for the first time. Its started when the students were on a field trip into the white house and everything seem to look strage every minute they were going in. The first shot of rising action that almost caused me to sit tight was when the security couldn't even pull their weapons out of the holsters and they were down on the floor and flying off to the walls. I was only concentrating on how they would try to protect the president who was in danger. When the later known Nightcrawler pulled out the knife to finish off the president, I could feel my self moving in my seat. With the tension building up in me, I was able to slowly calm down when one of the security on the floor shot nightcrawler and disappeared. That was my only relief and there it goes the action again.<br/><br/>Let me not mention about whom that I like in this movie cause I like the mutants and if I were one of the characters, I would prefer to be a mutant. The Stryger really make me mad when  he invades Xavier's school and took professor and some of the students with him. I kinda foreshadow what he was thinking when the president charged him to wipe out the mutant.<br/><br/>
The actions started again when Logan was going with the students  on a run where Logan was shot in the head and the action began. The good thing was that All of them together and once they were enemies, came together as one and fight back Stryger and his military. With all the powerful forces that each one has, they worked together by helping each other. Each one has his or her own part to play. This is a  very good movie and I suggest that you should all watch it. If it's not going to be your best one, then at least it's action. So it has all every part of each genres I have watched in my class.<br/><br/>I could not understand the ending of the movie because it didn't show me about the love triangle between that protagonists. looking out in the bay at the end meant that the mutant and the human will live peacefully. What about mystic who didn't make it back in the craft at the end? Maybe Logan would be taking a revenge in the part III.<br/><br/>You gotta watch this, it's nice...."

WARNING!! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET!!<br/><br/>
Still with me? Good.<br/><br/>
""X2"" is one of the best superhero movies ever, but it's not as good as the first film from three years earlier. Whereas ""X-Men"" had a better story, better music (I missed Michael Kamen's music in this, even if John Ottman had moments of great music in ""X2"") and a chance to get to know the characters, ""X2"" does not.<br/><br/>We're automatically thrown into the action with the sequel with an attack on President McKenna (Cotter Smith) by the later-revealed-to-be-brainwashed blue-skinned, teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (played by Alan Cumming). But the film has no recap of what happened in the last film, despite some mentions of previous events in the first film. Like when Cyclops (the under-used but cool-to-watch scene stealer character is played again by James Marsden) tells his fiancee, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, back again with a MUCH bigger role) she's been different ever since Liberty Island (an event from the first film), but if you never saw the first film, these kind of examples make you wonder what the characters are even talking about.<br/><br/>For those of you who've never seen the first ""X-Men"" film from 2000 or know the characters from the Marvel Comics series, you WON'T understand what ""X2"" is about at all. It's sad, but true. And the fact we have at LEAST 20 characters vying for screentime doesn't help.<br/><br/>We have the X-team team divided into different plots that connect together eventually: An attack on the Westchester X-Mansion by Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox, nicely playing an evil role) causes the students to flee and Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, again rightfully playing the lead role just as cool as before and with berserker rage to spare) helps the ""junior"" X-Men flee to the Boston home of Iceman (Shawn Ashmore, back again in a larger and cooler - excuse the pun - role) with Iceman's girlfriend Rogue (the underused but cool Anna Paquin, back for the sequel) and the Anakin Skywalker like member of the group, the hot-tempered Pyro (nicely played by Aaron Stanford, though his Australian character has no accent in this film).<br/><br/>Storm (Halle Berry, who has a bigger role as well) and Jean recruiting Nightcrawler to the team after an encounter with him at a Boston church.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we have Cyclops and the X-team's founder Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, sadly with a minimal role in this) visiting Xavier's ex-friend and X-Men enemy Magneto (the wonderfully enjoyable Sir Ian McKellen, back again in another memorable turn as Magneto) in his plastic prison, before Xavier and Cyclops are abducted by Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama/Deathstryke (Kelly Hu, with no character background whatsoever but has a knack for kicking the stuffing out of male X-Men members).<br/><br/>
Cyclops is brainwashed while Stryker uses the wheelchair-bound mutant Jason 143 (Michael Reid Mackay, better known as the Mummy in ""The Monster Squad"" and Antonio Diego, the man who becomes Bane in ""Batman and Robin"") to trick Xavier into using Stryker's own version of Cerebro (why I won't give away).<br/><br/>Even Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, slinking around in all her prosthetically covered, blue-skinned glory) gets a bigger -- and better -- role as she returns for this film, by helping supply something necessary into breaking Magneto out of his plastic cell.<br/><br/>But come on! The film has too much forced humor, whether it's regarding mutant powers or Mystique extending her middle finger to Stryker after she exits by sliding away into another part of his hideout. The plot could've been a bit better, especially since so many characters get lost in the shuffle (especially Deathstryke, Xavier, Rogue, and, above all others, Cyclops). And while the cameos are a nice touch (like the perfectly-cast but Russian-accent less Daniel Cudmore as the metal-skinned Colossus in the X-Mansion, or Steve Bacic as Dr. Henry McCoy as he talks to a ""Dr. Sebastian Shaw"" on a TV set in a bar sequence), they're either not mentioned by name or are too brief, leaving some moviegoers easily confused.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment is that some characters still don't get the chance to strut their stuff or remain underdeveloped. Xavier has moments where he shows his powers, but he's not given much else to do. Cyclops has like, what, fifteen minutes or so on-screen in the two-hour plus film? But when he is on-screen, Cyclops steals the show, whether it's his fight scenes with his eyebeams or the moving mourning scene while in the X-Jet (I won't spoil what happens for those who haven't seen it yet).<br/><br/>And even poor Rogue STILL does NOT have her comic counterpart's powers (flight, super-strength and invulnerability), only her draining-the-thoughts-and-powers-of-others-by-skin-to-skin-contact power, which she only uses like three times in the whole film. You'd think they'd at least try to incorporate some of it into the second (especially since Fox promised in a 2000 interview she'd get her new powers in the second film), but doesn't.<br/><br/>However, it does have its good points. The costumes, make-up, visual effects and sound are better. The cast that DOES get explored give great performances (especially Janssen's turn as Jean Grey and Cumming's memorable turn as Nightcrawler, which are tied for the second best performances only to Jackman's Wolverine). And the ending practically screams ""sequel!"" (fingers crossed, especially since the likes of Daniel Cudmore, Famke Janssen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, Patrick Stewart and even Kelly Hu have signed on for a third film). Heck, even Bruce Davison returned in this film as Senator Robert Kelly (but how, you'll have to see).<br/><br/>This is the sequel that could have been. It's full of eye-candy and cool fight scenes (especially Deathstryke versus Wolverine). But an under-developed story, too many characters mixed with under-used characters, and a lack of a better musical score do not a film make. I even missed Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and Toad (Ray Park), who were Magneto's other two Brotherhood of Mutants henchmen from the first film, who are not in this. They were contracted to return, but since they had so many characters already, maybe it's best they weren't in this film.<br/><br/>But still, at least ""Spider-Man"" delivered action, story, character development AND great music.<br/><br/>
Where's ""X3"" when you need it?"
"cerbie","Null","0","0","9 May 2003"," Great movie, but requires background
","I was afraid it would be as bad as the first. It wasn't. Not by a long shot. It follows everyone well (assuming Rogue encounters Ms. Marvel soon and changes from it), save maybe Wolverine and Cyclops.<br/><br/>Logan probably would have sat there and taken the cop's bullet. However, he should have been able to gut Kelly Hu almost as easily as the soldiers in the Mansion.<br/><br/>Scott Summers is always uptight, and in this movie, it's hard to tell whether that's being used or wether it's just bad acting/directing.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler was under-used but portrayed very well. Something more should have happened from the failed assassination attempt, and he should be able to, in normal circumstances, fight as good or better than most of the X-men (save Logan and McCoy). I would have preferred the good old greasy gray smoke with his teleport, but at least it was a good effect, not under- or over-done.<br/><br/>Aside from Wolverine needing to kick a bit more ass, the only downside is that there is no way anyone without a sufficient background would understand much of it...as evidenced by some of the comments here. Oh, and the prelude to ******x, but that's just personal taste."

When I discovered they were making a sequel I thought, surely they were pushing their luck but I gave it a chance. I came out of the cinema turned to my X-men obsessed friend and said 'Its restored my faith in sequels' it was bigger and twice as good as the first one. All the actors are suberb especially Patrick Stewart who seems born to play Professor X. Ian Mckellan made an even bigger impact in this movie and Hugh Jackman WAS Wolverine. I loved the newcomers Alan Cummings was great as Nightcrawler and brought credibility to the role.

","People must not read comic books anymore.  Folks, I suggest at least getting acquainted with the X-Men story that was in comic form (and later animated form), even if it's through reading a synopsis on the net.  I promise you that once you do things will make a whole lot more sense, and a lot of the comments I've seen regarding how poor this movie was will disappear.<br/><br/>
All in all I feel this was an OUTSTANDING movie, done very well considering how much material the screenwriters must have had to sift through to come up with coherent storylines that remain true to the comic book series, yet allow those who have never read the comics before to get into the plots. I felt the acting was SUPERB from all actors as a whole--they stayed true to their characters, which means a great deal in something as important as this.<br/><br/>SFX were awesome, the cinematography was very well done, and I saw no problems with any aspect of the movie. This is actually one of the better movies when it comes down to remaining true to what it's based off of, unlike other movies out there today. 10/10.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/><br/><br/>For those of you who really want to know, this movie is leading up to the Phoenix saga.  I won't reveal what that is, but there are several hints in the movie, and yes, the ""death"" (she's not really dead) of Jean Grey is one of them.  Please think back to what book Magneto was reading at the beginning of the movie and what book Xavier was discussing with the children at the end of the movie.  ""The Once and Future King"", which talks about the legend of King Arthur, the once and future king of England.  That's an important hint right there.<br/><br/>Then think about how Jean Grey reacts on occasion... the flaming eyes during a couple of sequences... the sudden resurgance of her powers as the wall of water approaches the group's converted SR-71... and then look at the IMAGE of the phoenix under the waters during the last scene.  The writers of this movie are throwing hints out there, much like in James Bond when they say at the end ""James Bond will return..."", to show that Jean Grey will, indeed, return, and there will be another movie.  I'd be surprised if there wasn't..."

","As a huge X-men fan, I am perhaps one of the toughest critics this film has to please. And I am happy to say that this film did not let me down in the least bit.<br/><br/>(contains spoilers)<br/><br/>The character development was great (especially Nightcrawler) and it felt like I was actually watching a comic book come to life.  Everything was true to its origins (with the exception of Storm losing her accent because Halle Berry couldn't cut it). I was thrilled to see that they made Mystique a bigger character and gave Anna Paquin more of a back seat role (but still highly involved). My favorite ""surprise"" had to be the introduction of the Phoenix.  Although not completely obvious to the non-X-men crowd, she pretty much revealed herself from the get go at the museum.  Phoenix is one of my favorite characters, thus making the last shot of the film even more exciting!<br/><br/>As for the action in this movie, it doesn't disapoint you at all.  It starts off with an amazing opening that litterally had me jumping out of my seat! And then of course the scene with Pyro at Bobby's house.  That moment was equal to the scene from the first movie with Magneto outside of the train station.  And lets not forget perhaps the best action sequence in the whole film: the raid at the school!  You got to see some minor characters in action (i.e. Siryn, Shadowcat and Colossus). You also got to see Wolverine just cutting it loose.<br/><br/>Plus, the story line, cinematography, makeup, special effects and set where freakin' amazing!<br/><br/>Overall this movie was well worth the $16 I have spent so far. If you've seen it once, I'd say give it a second look... you'll notice things you didn't see before! 10/10<br/><br/>To X-men Fans: Pay attention to the TV in the bar scene with Mystique.  Note the name of the Doctor being interviewed!"

","The special effects were great, especially the opening scene with Nightcrawler teleporting through the White House while kicking the Secret Service.<br/><br/>Favorite scenes include that one as well as Magneto's break out of prison. For X-Men fans, this is a good movie.<br/><br/>From the ending, it looks like the next flick will jump into the Phoenix Saga, but what about the Sentinels, Bishop and the future, Juggernaut and Apocalypse?<br/><br/>The only criticism that I have has to do with discrepancies and the powers of the mutants.<br/><br/>For instance, Wolverine is supposed to have the ability to smell people. But he kisses Mystique in the tent scene as if she were really Jean Grey.<br/><br/>Rogue, in the comic books and the TV series, has the ability to fly and is very strong, but she has yet to display those powers in the films.<br/><br/>Also, the Iceman should appear like a human block of ice."

","I had the opportunity to see X2 at the theater in which I work prior to its national release on May 2, 2003. When I enter a theater to see a film such as X2, I suspend my beliefs, not expecting to see a film that will be artsy and/or Oscar-worthy. X2 is, in fact, a very well-produced and entertaining motion picture. The characters appear as if they have been plucked straight from the pages of any of the hottest X-Men comic books in the series. The fighting and action scenes are very energetic, lively, and fast-paced, helping to boost the stamina of the film. I did, however, see some problems with the film. For one, I would have loved to have seen more battles between the villainous X-men and those fighting for the betterment of mankind. No such battles exist, however. The central villain in the film is Colonel William Stryker, a man who does not possess extraordinary mutant powers. He is, essentially, a human who desires a planet rid of the troubles that mutants produce. All in all, the film was very entertaining although I was a little bit disappointed. It is definitely worth a viewing on the big screen. X2 is one of those films that requires a viewing in the theater; otherwise, one will surely feel that he or she is missing out on something if he or she views it at home on video or DVD for the first time. My Rating: ***/**** B"

","Watching this movie was a blast!  And, dare I say, was better then its prequel, X-Men, which is a very rare thing in sequels.  It has more action, more of a story, and more twists and turns that you don't see coming! In this movie you see how powerful these mutant's powers are, since the movie does much more with the character's gifts in this one then in the first one. We see a whole lot more of Mystique in this movie, and she gets more of the screen time she deserves.  Wolverine says ""bub"" more, and we get to see some of his famed ""berserker rage.""  Nightcrawler is a fantastic character in this movie, wonderfully portrayed by Alan Cumming.Pyro and Iceman have bigger roles in this film, and Rogue's role is a bit smaller then in the first movie.  We get to see cameos from other favorite X-Men such as Colossus, Siryn, and Shadowcat. The heat between Jean Grey and Logan has been turned up some also, Logan gets much closer to his past, and there is one bad chick with some mean nails that is ready to kick some butt!  This film was worth every penny I spent to see it, and I plan to buy the DVD when it becomes available.  My advice to you : If you loved the first one, the second one is a MUST SEE A+"

","I found X2 to be tremendously entertaining and a great action packed sequel to the first X-Men movie.<br/><br/>All of the original cast is back as well as many new faces. The effects for ""Nightcrawler"" were just beautiful and ""Magneto's"" escape from his prison is quite a dramatic sequence (if a bit violent). ""Mystique"" gives viewers yet another eyeful and shows off just how complex and effective this character really is. Of course the rest of the mutant clan gets plenty of opportunities to show off their powers in the extreme as well.<br/><br/>The third X-Men movie is sure to be a ""must see!""<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT!)<br/><br/>There is one thing however, that I found I couldn't quite ignore. I was troubled by a logical quandary near the end of film whereby Dr. Xavier is compelled (by another mutant) to ""concentrate on"" and kill ALL the mutants. It seems to me that the mutant controlling Dr. Xavier must logically be included among ""ALL the mutants"" and therefore susceptible to Dr. Xavier's killing concentrations. Since this mutant (Jason) was controlling Dr. Xavier, it seems that Jason's ""spell"" over the Doctor would be broken as soon as the mutants began to be killed. Yet I suppose I should just ignore such oversights, as X-Men is merely nothing more than a very enjoyable comic book story. :-)"

","As a fan of the comic from way back, I more or less enjoyed the first X-Men flick, but I definitely had issues with it. I thought overall it was too short, with not enough action, a thin story and not much emotional depth.<br/><br/>It was as if Bryan Singer read my mind, because all of those things have been improved upon. X2 runs thirty minutes longer, has more(and better) action scenes, a good story and a kind of Empire Strikes Back tone, involving us more in the future of these characters.<br/><br/>It's still not perfect - I still could have used another big set-piece battle towards the end and it does have its slow spots - but overall this may be the best comic book film to come out since ""Blade"" kickstarted the new wave in '98. It definitely tops the first one, and I'd go so far as to say it was better than ""Spider-Man"".<br/><br/>My only suggestion for X3 would be more Colossus. His one brief scene was one of the most exciting."

","So I've just finished watching this movie and all i have to say is that managed to cram an entirely large amount of information that took 25 years to develop into one film. The only major interesting part of the film was seeing Magento rip the iron out of the body guards blood stream and seeing if Professor Xavier would have the courage to kill all of us little people on earth. Glad i didn't feel any pain. Personally, I didn't really like the fight scene between Lady DeathStrike and Wolverine. In the comics and cartoon series, they were once lovers. But of course being this is the movie they just decided to kill her without her saying a word. The liquid Admantium thing was so lame, you knew from the screen shots that that somehow it was going to play a role in her demise. Filling her with admantium and just dying was lame. Rebecca Romijn (lettuce) Stamos makes yet another great cameo appearence as Mystique. This time she actually says and does stuff instead of becoming eye candy for the viewers. Good work. I didn't like the ending though, the fact that Jean Grey died because she was trying to save the X-men. The most hiliarious part was seeing her whisper good bye through Charles Xavier in a sexy tone to Cyclops before being wiped out. Will she return?. Is she dead?.Duuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........  She'll be back for X-3 as Dark Pheonix, hopefully this time they'll do something interesting. As for Halle Berry, I hope she does come back to play Storm. It may not be fun having a lame character who doesn't get much screen time but I just can't think of anyone to replace her.<br/><br/>I personally wonder what its like for all those grown adults to be playing guns and robbers in this whole mutant fanfare. Can you imagine how silly it must have looked in rehearsal without the special effects and makeup. It's a kindergarden for ageless."

The best parts were the beginning with Nightcrawler teleporting everywhere and the part where Magneto escapes because it is just so unique.  The fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike was really cool also as they slash each other time and time again. And I really liked how Mystique had a bigger role this time. She does some amazing stuff.  And Hugh Jackman looks really hot in his wife beater as he took on the army guys at the school.  Plus the music is better this time around.<br/><br/>My one complaint is I wish it had some funny one liners. Plus, that dead Senator is back, of course as Mystique. But, how could that be possible because wouldn't he have to make a lot of public appearances, so that would mean Mystique would have to be him all the time.  Just something that made me say mmm...<br/><br/>Now, I want to know more about how Wolverine came to be. I hope they make a movie based on Wolverine's past.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  A must see.

","I looked forward to seeing X2 as i loved the first film and it is an understatement to say I was blown away.  This film is the finest example of how to make a sequel, take all the things that made the first film great, and add a whole new element in the form of bigger battles, new characters and new dimensions to the old ones. The film is a little over two hours long and it needs to be to give all the chracters their own moments, although I think cyclops and rogue were very underused. But that is just to give more screen time to the real star of the show, Wolverine, who is given more freedom by the PG-13 rating of this film to do what he does best, kick serious ass. X2 is easily the best comic to film adaptation out there, besting even the original Batman in my eyes, a 9 out of 10."

","*Contains some Spoilers*<br/><br/>Is less really more? Thats the question you're left with after watching this so so sequel to the 2000's X-Men. Its bigger, longer, its got more characters and a bigger budget, but is it any damn good?<br/><br/>The hype aside, the problem with X2 is that it just isn't particularly interesting or inspiring. There are so many characters on show here that none enjoy any real depth or 3-dimensonality. Despite pretentions of a serious plot surrounding an attempted presidential assassination by mutants, precipitating a witchunt by a hawk within the US military, General Stryker (Brain Cox), the story is never more than a hook upon which to hang a series of solid but never groundbreaking setpieces. Between the action sequences is paracuted the odd halfhearted chracter moment which for the most part underlines the allegory of intolerence (in case you hadn't got it yet) such as Bobby Drake (Iceman) visiting his parents and having to tell them hes a mutant (the shame!). Under the circumstances perhaps it would have been easier to tell them he was gay. Somehow turning a cup of coffee into a frozen block doesn't have the same emotional impact. While the chracters are either looking lost or standing polietly in the background waiting for the story to involve them in any significant fashion, the auidence is left with the feeling that something good from the original film is missing here. This is undoubtedly the interplay between Ian Mackellen as Magneto and Patrick Stewart as Xaiver. Fair play to the filmmakers for not simply repeating the plot of the first film but without that central conflict to anchor the action we are left with Cox as villian who frankly is a bit of damp squib.<br/><br/>Despite the running time, X2 never feels like it got its teeth into a story with any emotional or character depth before it arrives at its inevitable effects laden conclusion which, I can reveal in common with all other reviews of this picture, contains the death of a major character. Were she not a bit of a cypher in the first place it may have been more moving. As it was I found myself distracted by some ropey CGI work toward the end and the somewhat 'is that it?' finale. John Ottman's score is a lot better than Kamen's was for the orginal in that Ottman bothers to include a melody, but its still virtually anonymous and you'll be hard pushed to recall single theme 10 minutes after the end credits have rolled. Singer directs with some style and energy but all in all its all a bit superficial and overlong to really be construed as great. Better then, than many of the blockbusters of recent years but still wanting when held up to similar fare made in the late 70's and early 80's (Superman II it ain't). Call me intolerent but they don't make 'em like they used to.<br/><br/>Oh, as a footnote to this review may I be the first to petition Fox for the inclusion of Richard Pryor in X3. Thanks."

I understand that the story line can be a little bit complicated, but I think by drawing it out so much it makes it a bit more complicated.

","As others have said, an all-round excellent movie. From the available film evidence accumulated over the past century or so, it seems to be extremely hard to make a sci-fi movie that doesn't come across as shallow and unbelievable, perhaps because we have trouble relating to fantastic situations portrayed on screen. However, X-2 succeeds admirably in these respects, delivering a deep, compelling and all-too-familiar story of mistrust and fear between two alienated groups of humans. The result is a considerable improvement over the (already good) first movie.<br/><br/>The one caveat is that if you haven't seen the first movie then much of what happens here will not make sense. This dependency allows the film makers more freedom to develop story and spend less time introducing characters, but if you haven't seen X-1, go see it before you go see this one. You've been warned!<br/><br/>Fans of the comics will find much to like here as well, including an obvious (perhaps over-obvious) setup for a third installment involving what is probably the most famous story arc from the paper version. I won't say which to avoid spoiling your experience, but if you're a fan you can probably guess what I'm talking about anyway..<br/><br/>I'd give this a 9/10. In it's category it's pretty much right at the top, but you won't find anything here the redefines a genre, or that you will find yourself still puzzling over days after.

Supposed you are given 10 dollars you are not supposed to spend it all to make a better movie.<br/><br/>Planning is a good idea. When we observed between the first X-men and the second X-men they are simply too close to each other and even in 1 year you can't really make a better movie unless you do a brainstorming. I don't know whether to salute Mr. Singer or not but it is amazing of how what he can do in such a short period of time.<br/><br/>Anyway, all the X-men 2 team did a great job and the movie is really entertaining."

Then they try and tell us that Picard is the head X man (pardon the pun since he is balding). How on earth could Picard travel back in time to the set of the X men. So in conclusion, if you like movies that DONT make sense. Go see X Men. ON the other hand, if you like more intellectual movies (like I do) then go see something like ""Pay it Forward"" or ""The Importance of Being Ernest"" or even its prequel ""Ernest Goes to Camp"".

"Dougie B","Null","0","0","10 May 2003"," A review of the DIGITAL projection
","I was lucky enough to see this film digitally projected (I've read that there were only 35-45 theaters in the US that are doing this.)  Living in Los Angeles, you have to deal with smog, freeways, and attitudes, but at least you get digitally projected movies!<br/><br/>Having watched the movie projected on film the week before, I already knew what to expect from the story, so I probably wasn't as blown away as I should have been by certain sequences, especially the opening with Nightcrawler.  But what I got was a perfectly crisp picture - no film scratches, no annoying reel changes with ""cigarette burns"" followed by an audio pop.  If you don't know what a ""cigarette burn"" is, see ""Fight Club,"" but I warn you - you'll always be conscious of it every you see a movie in the theater.<br/><br/>There were however at times, when the picture was a little too perfect. Some shots looked blurry, like they had blown up the film a little to get a closer shot.  I don't know if they actually did this, but that's what it looked like.  A few times when there was A LOT of action and camera movement, there was some SLIGHT blur and picture jumping.  And by this I do mean SLIGHT.  Unless you were looking for it, you probably wouldn't have noticed it.  Also, some of the edges on objects on the screen seemed a little jagged at times, but then again, this wasn't that noticable.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, these are only minor criticisms.  Do I prefer the digital projection?  Definitely.  This is the third digitally projection film I've seen, the other two being Episode II and Toy Story 2.  The biggest differences here is that these two movies were created digitally while X2 was shot on film and transferred.  The picture was still superior, but not mind-blowing (and it made Mystique and Nightcrawler's make-up jobs look a lot more like make-up)<br/><br/>While I preferred the digital projection, I wouldn't tell you to plan a road trip to seek out a theater that has it like I would have for Episode II and Toy Story 2.  If you're going to see it, and there is a theater around that does have it, then go for it!"

","**SOME SPOILERS***<br/><br/>*and forgive my horrible English, thanks :-)*<br/><br/>It all depends on the point of view I choose.<br/><br/>-------- If I choose to consider X2 as an action movie, then I may say it's indeed one of the very best action movies ever made. Maybe it's the best one I've seen so far (before you wonder, I'll mention that I'm 42, that I go to the movies at least 10-15 times a year since I'm 19, and that my collection counts about 950 films on VHS or DVD).  I was really impressed. The pace is perfect, the tension very high, the action scenes are stunning, and this is such a more intelligent movie than most of the commercial action crappy flicks Hollywood feeds us with! The script is rich, with 2 main plots and no less than 4 sub-plots (!)- (maybe more, I'll have to see the movie again to make it out..)... This has never been done yet (that I know). Congratulations to Bryan Singer as a director/writer, and to John Ottman as an editor. GREAT work.<br/><br/>-------- If I choose to look at it as an X-men story (I used to read the comics when I was a teenager..), then I start to have second thoughts. Some characters are perfect (Magneto, Xavier, Wolverine), some are only adequate (Jean Grey, Rogue), and some are plain weak (Storm, Cyclops). I hoped that this problem, which was already present in the first movie, would be worked on. Well the Wolverine character has been improved, great job. For Mystique also, in the first movie she was presented just as a jaw-dropping fighter with some intelligence, in X2 she is a real person, thanks for that. But Storm and Cyclops are still second-hand characters, with no past, no inner feelings, just sympathetic people with (impressive) mutant powers. Too bad. The Storm character deserves much more than that! (Oh, but maybe it's the best that even such a good director as Bryan Singer may expect from Hale Berry... the most over-rated actress of all times. To me, she's plain dumb in every film I've seen her in.) Don't get me wrong: I'm NOT comparing the original characters to the ones in the movie. This would be nuts. I'm comparing the *dramatic strength* of each character in the comics and in the movie. In this matter, I still prefer the stories written by Chris Claremont in the 70's. Well, I have to admit that the amount of work necessary to run such a movie with so many storylines and characters could probably not be achieved without some sacrifices...<br/><br/>-------- X2 is definitely an important movie, as was the original comic series, for its message of tolerance. In this, the best line of the film is probably the Mystique/Nightcrawler dialogue about ""normality"". Thanks for that.<br/><br/>-------- Now if I consider X2 with my cinephile eye... ouch! As I already mentioned, it's probably gonna be my favorite action movies. But there are too many things in this movie that I can't cope with.<br/><br/>About the plot, why on earth is Xavier still under Jason's control when the electronic device has been taken off his head. Why doesn't Bobby try to freeze the water to help Jean. And the list goes on... OK, this is a comic-book movie, but I don't like this ""deal with it"" feeling. Not in such an ambitious movie.<br/><br/>But my main concern with X2 is somewhere else: Xavier, at one point, is about to kill the entire human race. Well all we see, to visually enhance this highly dramatic situation, are the struggling of Striker and then of the President of the USA. The rest... only small pictures on the big Cerebro ""mental screen"". Ouch! This is one of the most shocking demonstrations of ethnocentrism I've seen in Hollywood movies. Does any human being exist outside the USA? The struggling of the entire human race packed into the single picture of the President of the USA? Ouch, man. This is heavy. I thought we were not watching a Barbret Schroeder movie, but a Bryan Singer movie! What has happened?<br/><br/>Last thing I dislike in this movie, is the ""blockbuster"" LOTR/Starwars influence, mainly in the music. I'm tired of the trendy ""Carmina Burana"" syndrome for action sequences (Nightcrawler opening scene), and I'm tired of the useless ""off"" sound effects (I mean sounds that have nothing to do with what is actually happening), that prevents me to enjoy the ""in"" sound effects (Nightcrawler's ""bamf""..). Oh, well, I guess the insane budget of X2 couldn't be obtained without some sacrifices to the producers' views. Oh, and sorry for that, but to my sense John Ottman is a terrific editor, but he's a poor music writer. From an artistic point of view, of course, I'm not saying he's writing crap, but the dramatic effect of his melodic lines is shallow. Unlike many of you guys, I prefer the Michael Kamen score from the first movie. The musical piece you hear when Wolverine offers a passed-out Rogue his ability to heal brings an emotional climax that is nowhere to be found in X2.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm disappointed as a cinephile, because I'm expecting more, from an artistic point of view, from Bryan Singer. And X2 could have been a better movie with some different choices.<br/><br/>-------- Nevertheless, if one may forgive the ethnocentrism of the Cerebro/Xavier sequence, X2 is definitely one of the most brilliant and clever commercial movies ever made, and one of the most entertaining movies I've seen. To my sense, it's superior to all the recent blockbusters (LOTR, Gladiator, Starwars...) and to all of the comic-book movies (well ""Spiderman"" is not bad either, I agree) in terms of artistic approach, dramatic cohesion and above all in terms of mastering the pace, which is a difficult art that most of the ""commercial"" filmmakers can't cope with anymore. Or maybe they simply don't try...? Bryan Singer proves with X2 that he is a terrific director, and one of the very few artistic directors (another being Spike Jonze with the mindblowing ""Being John Malkovich) that may be able to have a positive influence on the blockbuster-targeted movie industry during the next years. But, deep inside, I'd really like him to make a more independent movie soon... please?<br/><br/>*Substance 6/10 (would have been higher without the ethnocentrism problem)<br/><br/>*Technical 9/10<br/><br/>*Artistic  7/10<br/><br/>*Entertainment 10/10<br/><br/>**Overall 8.5/10 (which is the highest note I ever gave to a commercial-targeted movie since ""Back to the Future"")"

","Just seen XMen 2 and i have to say i thought it was a very good film from several points of view. The special effects were superb throughout, espiecially the teleporting Nightcrawler and the fight scenes. The film is long, but it doesnt drag at all and the ending is just fine dispite some unjustified criticism from some quarters. I look forward to seeing Phoenix in the next one, that should be spectacular. My only criticisms are of omissions, in that Colossus should have been part of the main team and i would liked to have seen Iceman whiz around on his ice thing (you know what i mean!). I was a little worried that Stryker would not be a worthy opponent of the Xmen, being just a normal human and all, but he was convincing enough to have dispelled these worries. The only character i have a problem with is rogue, she just isnt strong enough and i wish she could fly! I have to say that the casting is superb, every actor fits there role very well, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine stands out from the distinguished crowd. I look forward to the next one."

"maxp0werx","Null","0","0","9 May 2003"," I was expecting less
","As a huge X-Men fan (read: dork) I was somewhat underwhelmed by the mediocre generica of the first X-Men movie (X1?). Not expecting much badassery from the fancy dude from Cabaret as Nightcrawler, I was glad to see a well developed, cool character with a great deal of substance. The acting, especially from the ""ringers"" (McKellen and Stewart) was really good and the story had plenty of ""nerd"" moments (Is that Hank McCoy?). Now, the one caveat of the film is Wolverine. Jackman did a good job of playing his character, he just isn't Wolverine. Wolverine is a badass by nature, and he should brawl and get torn up, but the guy in this movie is basically a monkey with knives glued to his hands. Wolverine is a damn samurai, he shouldn't lose ANY fight, let alone every single one (with a major character anyway). Wolverine is considered one of the most dangerous men in the world in the comic version, but in the films, he relies on his healing far, far too much. On powers alone, Wolverine is strictly B-grade, but its the intangibles, the ""Batman factor"" that makes him one of the elites. Maybe I'm just bitter, the movie was pretty awesome."
"loopydate","10","0","0","9 May 2003"," Best superhero movie ever?
","The main problem with any comic-book or superhero movie is that the portion of the audience that is unfamiliar with the characters and situations (usually a VAST majority) needs to be brought up to speed.  If the writers drop you into the middle of, for example, the ""X""-universe without explaining what mutants are, what they can do, and why ""normal"" humans are so afraid of them.<br/><br/>The first ""X-Men"" movie did an incredible job of giving the background of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his team of mutant superheros, the X-Men.  However, director Bryan Singer was a bit limited by the fact that he couldn't jump right in headfirst to his story.<br/><br/>He faced no such problem with ""X2:  X-Men United,"" and has in the process created the greatest superhero film ever made.  And, yes, I'm counting the original ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films, as well as the more contemporary ""Spider-Man"" and all of the mediocre (""Daredevil"") and just plain awful (""Masters of the Universe"") films to be made in the meantime.<br/><br/>I saw ""X2"" opening night, and now, one week later, I literally keep replaying the movie in my head.  From the opening sequence where crowd favorite Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) tears up the White House through to the heart-wrenching conclusion, Singer hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>I'll be honest.  I haven't read the comics in about seven or eight years.  I don't know any of the contemporary stories, but from what I can remember, ""X2"" portrayed every character as accurately as it could (keeping in mind the fact that audiences would not buy any of the trademark X-Men storylines that involve time travel or outer space).  Nightcrawler, the ""furry blue elf"" who looks like a demon, had the right mannerisms.  Colossus (Daniel Cudmore in an incredible cameo) was just the right mix of gentle giant and imposing freak.  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) was written perfectly for what happened to her character (no spoilers here, folks.  See it for yourself).<br/><br/>I can't stop thinking about this movie, and as someone who sees a lot of films, that's really something.  Lines of dialogue, memorable visuals, and even the bit of Mozart's ""Requiem"" that plays throughout the opening sequence chase each other around my head as I write this, and this would be a long review if I put every word of it down on paper.<br/><br/>In short, see...this...movie.  It is a truly mind-blowing experience, the likes of which I haven't seen in a theater since ""Adaptation"" (though that was mind-blowing in an entirely different way).<br/><br/>Before I leave, here are some of my favorite moments from the movie (I know I'll leave some out, forgive me):<br/><br/>~ Nightcrawler's romp in the White House. ~ Professor Xavier's first ""143""-induced hallucination. ~ Siryn! ~ Iceman and the Dr. Pepper bottle. ~ The kid playing with the sabretoothed tiger skeleton in the museum. ~ Pyro's outburst at the Drake house. ~ Wolverine vs. Deathstrike ~ Any scene with Bryan Cox ~ The way Mystique still doesn't quite have the ""Kelly walk"" right. ~ The dogfight ~ The Angel x-ray in Stryker's office ~ ""Shoot anyone that approaches.  Even if it's me."" ~ Magneto, his prison, and iron. ~ ""We love what you've done with your hair."" ~ Jean giving the Professor's monologue from the beginning of ""X-Men"""

Ian McKellen has some great lines as Magneto, and he & Mystique really steal the show this time. The jail break scene was visually superb, and bore an uncanny resemblance to the scene in Silence of the Lambs when Hannibal breaks out of prison after de-facing the security guard."

","**This review may contain MINOR SPOILERS. You have been forewarned!** This movie surpassed its prequel in every conceivable way. It had double the budget, which it showcased brilliantly through way more powers being used. From the flashy introduction that tosses us straight into the action up to the thrilling climax that leaves us breathless, this movie grabs on and does not let go until the credits start to roll. It's two hours and twenty minutes of near-perfection. The only complaint that I would make would be that character development for Cyclops was a little weak as it was for Professor X. Now I have some experience with the series, so I can fill in some of the holes myself, but not everyone has this luxury. But it's still a fairly minor complaint amid a sea of praise for this movie. Each and every actor, as far as I'm concerned, ARE the characters that they represent. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Barry, Alan Cumming, EVERYONE in the cast too lengthy to mention not only acts like their comic book counterpart, but physically resembles them. I think if this series continues for a long time, then this cast will surly be the ""Sean Connery"" of the X-men movies, all others will simply be trying to imitate them, but there will be only one true cast. The action scenes were, despite everything else, what held this movie up. With the huge budget, the mutants could display their powers far more graphically and more vividly and they certainly do. Everything from Wolverine's vicious defense of the School to Nightcrawler's teleporting to Storm's weather control, everything is now vibrantly showed with incredible special effects. And Magento's jailbreak, while scientifically implausible, is impressive nonetheless. Anyway, isn't that why it's called science-FICTION? All in all, this movie is a more than worthy successor to the first and in fact follows such incredible sequels as Terminator 2 as it, in my opinion, far surpasses it's predecessor. 9/10"
"gabbagod","9","0","0","6 May 2003"," Good, but could of been SO much more!
","Slight Spoilers within<br/><br/>After just seeing this movie i have to admit feeling a bit dissapointed by it sadly. The underlying factor here is that it suffers from the same problems as the first.<br/><br/>Here we have some mutants with amazing abilities yet they dont utilise them anywhere near enough. Iceman goes as far as to freeze a cup of tea and Collusus changes his skin to metal just once! Both of these scenes have also been revealed in the trailer!<br/><br/>The film's flaws dont stop there. Marsden's acting as Cyclops is laughable and makes me glad to see the character have a smaller role. Nightcrawler is supposed to be a religous, passive person but this is totally overdone. He is way too soft, comical and prays way too much. Also it was annoying to see that Rogue hasnt grown up in the slightest and is still a quivering little girl.<br/><br/>My one other query is since when can Prof. X freeze time?? Im no X-Men boff but surely this kind of skill can be used in any bad situation??<br/><br/>On the otherhand the film has some amazing scenes including the stunning Pyro sequence. Mystique is excellent and Jackman portays Wolverine perfectly. Magneto, Storm and Jean Grey are also played well. Some great lines round this up to make me give it a thumbs up but wonder what more could of been in it.<br/><br/>Good ending also, especially for those who know about the X-Men, lines up X3 very well!"

","I'm a little distressed at the minority opinion expressed here on the comments board so vehemently that personal complaints and continuity errors between film and comic book are trying to outshine the simple fact that this...is...a...MOVIE! I have met countless X-Men comic book fans who are thrilled and more than satisfied with this film REGARDLESS of the differences between it and the source material. Somewhere, somehow, sometime, it needs to be accepted that films based off of best selling novels, comic books and epics have to sacrifice characters and details for the sake of making a good MOVIE.<br/><br/>This MOVIE was excellent by every calculable measure. Character development, storyline, acting, special effects...anyone who has seen it cannot argue with the superiority displayed in every one of those categories. The picture managed to be allegorical without being preachy, romantic without being cheesy, action-packed without being Matrix-y and fun without being goofy.<br/><br/>
X2 was a better movie than it needed to be. From the success of the first movie, all they needed was a cheap plot and Hugh Jackman re-signed. But this movie was exceptional. One of the best sequels I have ever seen and one of the few sequels I've actually liked better than the movie. One reviewer compared it to the sequel quality of Empire Strikes Back. I only hope X3 is lightyears better than Return of the Jedi!!!!!"
"tora55","9","0","0","6 May 2003"," Better than the first
","I have to say that I have seen this movie twice already and I loved it both times as a fanboy and as a movie buff. There is a sense of character overload, but how is that any different from the loads of characters in war films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Dirty Dozen?"" In fact, I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see more of Shadowcat, Jubilee, Colossus, and Siryn although all of them make an appearance in the film. I am sure we'll see plenty of them in bonus hours on the DVD.<br/><br/>The first film was a bit muddled with so many new characters, to the non-fanboy populace, and in plot details. Although the film was a massive success, it was difficult for many moviegoers uninitiated in the X-Men saga. But in ""X2: X-Men United,"" there's a greater degree of cohesiveness. We have a clear and present evil, a solid storyline, and loads of characters to gawk at. There's also a better pace to this film. It's more organized and the action sequences are evenly placed in the movie. I kept waiting and waiting for Deathstrike to unsheathe her claws, and when she finally did, it was thoroughly satisfying. Her and Wolverine's fight scene was incredible!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is more complicated, feral, and downright vicious in this film and I like it. When he begins his berserker rage in the school, I couldn't help say, ""Wow."" Without his performance, the movie goes nowhere. He is such a hinge for the film. Alan Cumming was awesome as my favorite X-Man growing up, Nightcrawler. He has always been so complicated and enigmatic, and this movie gave us just enough to understand him, but not enough to discard him with boredom. The attack on the president scene was better than I could have ever imagined. Much like Spider-Man, I always had an idea about how Kurt would move, teleporting from here to there, the acrobatics, the ""bamf"" and the cloud of brimstone: one word- amazing!<br/><br/>This is definitely a multi-viewing film. There are so many things for the average movie fan and multitudes of stuff for the comic geeks. An excellent film with loads of metaphors, I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I."

The only possible bad thing about the movie is the totally kiddish and cliche-type ending when they confront the president.  Oh yeah, and when the Scott was crying to Wolverine, it seemed like over -acting. All in all, this was a good movie and a must have dvd for the action junkie."
"eddy_currents","10","0","0","8 May 2003"," So much here for everyone, with an ending for X fans
","There is so much happening in this movie, I can't believe it turned out to be as good as it is. The script and dialogue are clever, and perfect. The effects are eye-popping. The pacing is intense but not frenetic. It's easy to follow, and there many little side jokes and nice little touches that keep you chuckling.<br/><br/>Like in the first movie, this one starts with a premise that is far-fetched, but then the rest of it all ""makes sense"". Everything that happens falls out of the characters' motivations and their abilities. The characters are real people behind the masks, and fallible despite some fantastic abilities.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the same that was in the first movie: there are so many characters, and too little time to develop them. We see a bit more of Mystique (no, no, I mean her character), and Magneto is again played to perfection by McKellan. Nightcrawler has an incredible opening, but then sits in the background. Storm only gets a few good scenes, and we still know almost nothing about her. Cyclops again gets short shrift, becoming a background presence despite being probably the most powerful of the X-Men and technically their leader. Hopefully in the next installment they do more with him (Marsden keeps getting knocked for a wooden performance, but he did the best with what he had).<br/><br/>The next problem is more for those of us with young children: should we take them, or not? This movie is much darker and more violent than the first. Wolverine is ferocious at times, and actually kills some bad guys (what are claws for?).<br/><br/>And there is the third problem: a couple of times, Wolverine goes from gruff but likeable, to a berserk killing machine, and then back to likeable. Not likely. At least, not that fast.<br/><br/>The ending has a couple good twists. The new villain in the making isn't a great surprise, but it's still a twist and again it ""makes sense"" given what we have seen about him. The mysterious ending will make sense to fans who follow the X-Men stories (I do, a little), and sets up the entry of yet another character in the next movie."

My one problem with the film is this......<br/><br/> IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOIL THE ENDING DON'T READ ON<br/><br/> .....in the climactic scene why did Jean Gray sacrifice herself? Obviously they had to escape, but when she telepathically told Xavier that this was ""the only way"", she was clearly caught up in the drama of the moment and not thinking straight, as were the rest of the gang.  They all seemed to be blissfully unaware that sitting quietly at the back of the jet was a young man called Ice man. ICE man. Why, in the name of god, did he not just freeze the lake? He froze boiling coffee, I'm sure he could manage to freeze a cold lake!<br/><br/>While it's excusable for meathead Wolverine or young inexperienced Ice men himself to overlook this, I feel it's unacceptable for Xavier to have done.<br/><br/>I think 'X3' should be a quiet thoughtful human drama focusing on the relationship between an ex professor of mutant science and his therapist as he struggles to come to terms with the death of one of his young wards due to a glaring oversight on his part.<br/><br/>Perhaps directed by Mike Leigh?"

Don't know exactly who the kid changing channels on the tube was, though.  After two movies still no sign of him. Please write me if you know. All in all, can't wait for X3. With the obvious introduction of the Phoenix, it should be good. I think by mentioning all these characters, and not actually using them now, the writers are keeping the doors open for X3,4,5,6,7 and beyond. They do need however to lay off the Wolverine saga and develop Iceman and Rogue, since they have already made them a part of these movies. Rogue is learning to control her powers. I would like to see Bobby Drake all 'iced up'.  Hellfire Club anyone? Although I like Magneto, he needs to take a backseat now. The possibilities are endless.

"septemberists","9","0","0","6 May 2003"," ""X""cellent film-X2 exceeds the original film and instills hope in the x-men movie franchise
","The second installment in the X-men saga delivers everything a moviegoer could ask for. Nonstop action, character driven pathos, resolution of plot threads, new questions raised, and cameos and suprises all along the way.  X-Men and Comic book fans alike, will be proud that their favorite heroes have put their best face forward.  The film's action unfolds within minutes of the opening credits and takes you along for a ride you'll remember long after the last scene in the film. The nature of a sequel, and its expectations notwithstanding, the film could be seen as a standalone.  A moviegoer who has seen the original film will marvel at how the films tie so well together as plot threads in the first film get resolved, and new plotlines open up for future films.  The film has done a great job to solidify the franchise and continue a new genre of comic related films.  From a comic fan's standpoint the film does a very good job of keeping the feel of the comic translated to the big screen. Minor changes in origins and relationships get forgiven when the viewer gets to see their childhood (and maybe even adulthood) heroes brought to life on the siver screen. Marvel's decision to bring the feel of the new issues of the X-Men comics closer to the movie version, was probably a good one. The film itself has so many suprises for the fan of the comic, that the viewer's eye will dart from scene to scene trying to find all the film's character cameos and ""easter eggs"".  The film's translation to DVD will probably be a view's delight. Brian Singer's direction in the film should be lauded, because of the sheer amount of character development you see with the growing number of different x-people in the film.  His ability to juggle so many different characters, and actors has definitly grown since The Usual Suspects. Singer does a good job of showing respect to the material.  Even slight nuances of the actors' performances at different instances in the film is artfully juggled.  (See any character tied to the morphing of Mystique for proof).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance leads the star-studded cast.  His portrayal of Wolverine anchors the movie to the cheers of moviegoers-as they relish in the character's adamantium clawed rage. Jackman deftly displays his control of the character's complexity as his interaction with the different castmemembers is seen from scene to scene.  Also noteworthy is Ian Mckellan's reprisal of his role as Magneto.  It drips with a wonderful amount of sarcasm and dignity that even the most jaded of fans would have to admit that the casting choice was a good one.  Alan Cummings's Nightcrawler will probably make lots of children want alot of blue makeup for Halloween this year.  The character's addition was a good choice for the film.  As the group's makeup starts to get closer to the classic John Byrne/Chris Claremont era of the comic.  The X-Men movie franchise has been solidified well. X-Men 2 (X2) draws certain similarities to other sequels like Empire Strikes Back, Godfather 2, and The Two Towers-in its strength as a movie in a series.  Fans of the film, movie-goers, and comic books fans will probably argue that its much better than the first film, and its placement in the series. Arguably the film has outmatched its predecessor in many aspects. Much like Empire, the film presents a plot thread that doesn't get resolved at the end of the film.  Young fans and people not familiar with the X-Men's history will definitely have questions unanswered at the film's end.  For the requirements of a sequel, the film goes a long way of going above and beyond its prerequisites.  The movie viewer will be content at the film's end, but saddened that they cannot watch the next film-right away.  The anticipation for the next installment of the film will feel arduous.  But, at least X-Men 2 has done its job well.  The franchise is in the able and steady hands of Mr. Singer.  And as Professor Xavier says ""I think everything is going to be just fine."""

","X2 starts out fast and just gets more fun as it goes along.  The plot moves along quickly and rarely loses its place.  Some of the newer characters tend to be glossed over, only recognized by fans of the comic books, but almost all contribute to the action.  It is smart and fun, with humor and even a bit of soap-opera elements.  --Possible spoiler here--  One thing the movie promises is a sequel and the aforementioned fans will see it coming a mile away, especially the probable plot of the third movie.  Hint: Think X-Men #s 100 & 101.  In fact around the middle of the end credits a broad hint is given, also. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."

","I used to read the X-Men comics somewhat religiously when I was a kid, so I'd like to say I'm something of an expert on the subject.  This movie just blew me away.  There were tons of things I loved, but some of the biggest highlights were seeing Collossus (my personal favorite X-Man) in action and finally seeing Wolvie cut loose.  That was the one big surprise in this film.  Lots of violence.  Magneto was especially fun to watch in that sick way you slow down to watch a car crash.  He was vicious at times, yet I still pulled for him to do his thing.  It was crazy!!  And they set it up perfectly for a sequel.  Lots of room for even more interesting stories to be told!"

"Joe_90_123","Null","0","0","5 May 2003"," Amazing Special effects, but overall quite bad.
","Warning this review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Just been reading through the reviews looking for some people who might have felt the same way about the film as I did and I'm quite disappointed. The special effects were good, but the film really became an ordeal for me after the 1st 30 mins. Some of the acting was also quite bad, especially from that red glasses guy towards the end crying about his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Maybe it is that you have to read the comics to appreciate this film but I really couldn't understand the reasoning behind many of the x-mens actions.<br/><br/>
For a start what was the purpose of cerberous meant to be, to communicate with mutants why not just use a phone? Why would Picard build a machine that could destroy all the mutants just by putting on a hat and thinking hard about them? Is he some sort of Moron? And if he has the power to read minds (of mutants) and freeze time (for humans) how did he managed to get kidnapped by a combination of mutants and humans, couldn't he just freeze the humans and realise that the mutant was going to flip?<br/><br/>It also boggles me why the mutants care if a bunch of humans want to have a war with them if they are all seemingly invincible (wolverine gets shot in the head and then comes back to life, although admittedly psychic lady decides to end it all for some reason). If the x-men and humans had a war the x-men would win easily.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the first film so maybe this is why some of these things aren't clear, it also isn't clear how the mutants are being oppressed, the teleportaman at the start makes out he wants freedom. Er....freedom to do what....he just breaks into the white house and batters a load of special ops guys....it's not as if it's going to be a cake walk to oppress someone that hard.<br/><br/>Did iceman's girlfriend have powers? I couldn't tell everytime they started getting off together she would go ""oooh, I don't want to hurt you"", the only thing of interest she did was take her top off and fly the x men plane (badly).<br/><br/>Final plothole I'd like to get off my chest... If teleporta man can only teleport places he can see how did he manage to teleport back onto the plane? Surely being that foggy, and the plane travelling at what, mach1,2 there would be no way he could see where he was teleporting to?<br/><br/>My overall rating:<br/><br/>Action: 10/10 Plot: 1/10 Overall: 5/10"

","Unlike other previewers, I thought the action was plenty, the story dramatic and the characters weren't enough. I am still against how they have changed Rogue's character to that of Kitty Pryde's from the original story lines of the comics. They have also relegated many of the original X-Men to sub characters (like Iceman, Colossus, the cameo by the Beast). Iceman - Bobby Drake - was one of the original X-Men when the comic first started, Rogue was an evil mutant until totally draining Ms. Marvel, and Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler gave the comic a new face in the late 70's. As for the movie, though, it was NOT a summer block-buster type in that it had a long, event-filled storyline complete with plot. It had more character development than you will see in most ""blockbusters"" (Matrix aside). I was even rooting for Magneto and Mystique. As for Professor X being controlled into doing what he would know as ""wrong"", I could believe it had the neural inhibitor STAYED on his head. It disappeared just after they left the room to go to cerebro.<br/><br/>Other than the continuity error and despite what some people think is too cerebral a comic book adventure, I say if you want REAL entertainment and an emotional ride --- GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!"
"steelions","9","0","0","5 May 2003"," action, humor, sex, death, love & loss: Finally a real comic book movie
","Just a couple of observations:<br/><br/>1.  Like any good sequel this movie does not feel the need to remind us how good the original was by replaying all the great lines or action sequences. They allow the characters to grow, and as such when viewed together we can see a rich tapestry of complex characters.<br/><br/>2.  George Lucas needs to step back and watch how Bryan Singer creates a more meaningful connection to a character on the edge with Pyro.  The scene between Magneto and Pyro alone accomplishes more in :30 seconds than lucas has been able to craft in his two prequels to date.<br/><br/>3.  Cyclops?  There has to be more to do with this guy.  To me he is such a tragic character.  He is a senior member of this team, yet he is the only X-man who can't control his powers.  His only view of the world is thru amber colored lenses.  I hope that he get's a chance to shine in the future.<br/><br/>4.  Finally a real comic book movie:  This is one of the most realistic comic based movies I have ever seen.  It deals with all the classic elements of literature.  Comic Books are at their core morality tales not unlike those of ancient greek mythology.  Congratulations to all involved with ""X-Men United""."
"thoughtfox","7","0","0","5 May 2003"," Plot Problems
","WARNING: SPOILER!<br/><br/>
My review of X Men 2 is that it was OK. 7 stars out of 10. I was anxious to see the film, even waited in line for it, but as the credits began to roll, I was filled with more questions than with a satisfied feeling. There are lots of holes in the plot, too many questions left unanswered. If this were intentional because XMen fans would ""know"", it's unfair and sloppy to the rest of us who are not pros.<br/><br/>Though the film does pick up where it left off, and highlights from the first film, like Logan's sense of humor  (though it is not as apparent in X2 because he doesn't have Cyclops to play off of) are present,there are too many problems with the flow of the film in regardso logic.<br/><br/>Here are the findings I could list; I'm only allowed 1,000 words:<br/><br/>1) early on, we are introduced to a cool, silvery fellow whose body richoets bullets. We see him briefly, he offers to help Wolverine, then he disappea rs into a chamber in the school with the other students. And that's it. We never see him again. X3?<br/><br/>2)the secret serum Stiker uses is not explained at all. Where did it come from? How does it work? Why does it work? Singer may have given the rest of us who are not XMen pros too much credit to figure it out on our own.<br/><br/>3) Night Crawler opens the film. Great action sequence, but if he is such a noble and humble and spirtual creature, why would he antagonize the President? Was he given Striker's serum? We assume so. In the church scene, Storm finds the tell-tale sign Striker's serum leaves on the nape of his victim's neck: a mark like that of a burn. But this is never reaized on film.<br/><br/>4)It does not make sense for the XMen to trust Magneto and Mystique so quickly.<br/><br/>5) Jason 134's presence should be more clear; his relationship to Striker and to the movie's central plot to those of us who are not XMen2 pro's. This shadiness skews the film somewhat if you do not follow the film closely because it is the film's pivotal angle. You have to understand Jason's role clearly, otherwise, the film loses clarity.<br/><br/>6)Cyclops' being under the influence of Striker's serum should also be explained. We hardly see him at all in the film, then when we do in the middle, he attacks Jean. We don't see him being given the serum, but apparently he is.<br/><br/>7) Jean Gray dying in the flood is not necessary and avoidable. After she can't hold the water anymore, Night Crawler could have transported to her, retrieved her, then she could have been revived. But they leave her there! The explanation? ""She made a choice"".<br/><br/>8)Singer teases the audience with the truth about Logan's past. Logan has a few flashbacks in the tank chamber, but maybe there could be more to appease us?<br/><br/>9)I wanted to see more of the other XMen; Wolverine, Storm, Mystique, Magento, Jean Gray, and Striker were the majority of the film.<br/><br/>10) And for those of you who like flubs............When they are at Bobby's house (Iceman), Logan goes outside on the backyard patio, look for about 1/4 of a camera, and a wire, in the upper right hand side of the screen. It's reflected in the sliding glass door behind him.<br/><br/>11)Pyro's desire to team up with Magento is simplistically realized. His roguish nature and refusal to follow the rules are obligatory and obviously leading up to a departure from the ""those who follow the rules"" (ie the Xmen).<br/><br/>12) Why don't the Xmen show more emotion when they realize Magento turns on them after they foolishly trust him in the first place?<br/><br/>All in all, it is a okay movie, but problems with logic prevent it from being any better"
"Colorscheme","Null","0","0","5 May 2003"," X-traordinary Film
","This film is the reason I go to the cinema.<br/><br/>I've been reading the exploits of the renegade team of mutant heroes for 16 years, and it has at times felt like a lonely devotion.  Sure, I'd see fellow fans at the comic book store, but I never fit the fanboy mold.  On the outside, meanwhile, the public was comfortable with Superman, Batman, and Spider-man but never knew about the X-Men. So, I felt content with this little universe created by Stan Lee and brought to fruition by Chris Claremont for two decades.  I found high adventure, romance, cultural morality, tragedy, and joy, and I was content in a selfish way knowing that I was a part of a select few.<br/><br/>Three years ago, all of that changed.  Bryan Singer's first X-Men proved that big budget comic book-based film could take itself seriously and gain wide support. Hugh Jackman launched his international career, and comics fans and the general public were happy.  I was thrilled to see the slightest peek into the X world, knowing that the films would never be able to plumb the depths of 40 years of comic history.<br/><br/>Last night, I was proven wrong.  Seeing X2 was a fulfillment experience, reward for my years of fandom.  Every emotion I ever felt reading the series was brought back during this perfectly executed film.<br/><br/>The film picks up directly after the events of the first film.  There is political unrest as the world decides what to do with the growing emergence of mutants among humans. Anecdotic characters represent three sides to the debate.  Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his school haven for mutants including the X-Men strive for peaceful coexistence and acceptance of humans and mutants ala Martin Luther King Jr. Magneto (Ian McKellan) is his Malcolm X, believing that coexistence is not possible. A new human character, William Stryker, is Magneto's counter as a political military man bent on ridding the planet of mutants.<br/><br/>Thus, Bryan Singer moves with his Usual Suspect ease from character to character, giving everyone their due, their moments to shine.  Here is where the movie shines.  The script does not awkwardly bend to provide a Storm scene here and an unprecedented Wolverine fight there.  The actions of the characters, the use of their powers, and the combats all flow naturally from the narrative.  The villains in this film are drawn so completely that from certain points of view they cease to be evil.  Each side has valid reasons to believe in their convictions.<br/><br/>Take the human point of view, for instance.  The most moving scenes for me were those that let the mutant powers be completely unleashed.  Magneto delights in the power and control he exhibits.  Storm uses her powers in near Biblical proportions. Jean Grey traverses the film barely in control of her tremendous psychic and telekinetic powers. One impulse while witnessing their effects is to say, ""That is so cool!"" while the other, human side stands in awe and fear.  It becomes easy to imagine large factions of normal people demanding mutant registration or worse.<br/><br/>Finally, events in the film's last act left me mind blown.  I will give nothing away other than to say if I believed the first film was the slightest peek into the X world, then the bold path the film makers chose to take in X2 blew open the door and gave free reign to some of the most powerful stories the X-Men have to offer.  The first film was the primer, X2 took the ball and ran, and I believe the best is yet to come."
"Arch_Angel","Null","0","0","5 May 2003"," Bring on X3!
","**Mild Spoilers**<br/><br/>I must confess that I have never seen an X-Man comic, and only ever saw one episode of the cartoon series.  I guess this makes it easier for me to watch, as I don't find myself comparing the action to what the 'actual' characters are likely to do and so on.<br/><br/>Disclaimer aside, I thought this was a good film.  I really want to convince myself that it was great, but I cannot, and here's why...<br/><br/>Now I loved X-Men (even though I felt it played to the fans too much by not fleshing-out character's back stories, aside from Wolverine), so I had very high hopes for the sequel.<br/><br/>Set not too long after the escapades on Liberty Island, the gang are settling back into normal mutant life, aside from Wolvie, who has gone off to discover the secrets to his past.  After an attack on the President by Nightcrawler gives General Stryker authority to storm Xavier's school, we get to the films first major set-piece (not too many more afterwards, either), the fight in the school.  We see a glimpse of Iron Man (great effect), and the film signals it's intent to be darker, with Wolvie indescrimantley killing the soldiers.<br/><br/>An alliance with Magneto is forged (who escapes with quite some ingenuity - better not take those multi-vitamins any more!), and the gang reach their destination, Alkani (sp?) Lake.  Here we, the viewer, is taken in 3 different directions here, and so the last 30 minutes of the film is heavy on plot.  Still the gang save the day, and all go home happy.<br/><br/>Now, comparisons against the first film are natural, and I felt that the sequel suffered from too little action.  It was a longer film, taken up with a lot more dialogue.<br/><br/>Again, characters other than Wolverine suffer from little on screen action (a cause for Mrs Berry to not sign for a third film), with poor old Cyclops robbed of his woman, and still we know nothing of him.  Storm, incidentally, was given more screen-time, but like the others, under utilized.<br/><br/>Enough loose-ends are left for another outing (ignoring the end sequence), with Ice Man and Pyro surely meeting in combat, Nightcrawler and Storm possibly romantically involved, and (shown only with visual clues) with Bobby knowing that however close to Rogue he gets, he will always (rightly or wrongly) be judged against Wolvie, maybe building resentment?<br/><br/>In conclusion then, sure, there are some good sequences-Nightcrawler's intro, Pyro's fun and the jet-flight, but I guess I preferred the first film (with the whole last 25 minutes or so being pretty action packed, along with a tighter focus).<br/><br/>Still, this will be successful, spawn a third movie and will (hopefully) expand upon the core characters more.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

X2 gives Mystique a bigger better role, which is good considering the fact that her powers are the coolest!  Wolverine actually kills people!  I cant remember him doing so in the first movie. All the actors perform well.  The Nightcrawler is much cooler in the movie than he is in the comic book.  The plot is much better, even though the whole bad guys good guys alliance cliche is used.

"detroclay","Null","0","0","5 May 2003"," Fine by me if you replace Halle Berry
","Just saw X2 and as a huge collector and fan of the comics, I have to say I really enjoyed it overall.  There were some minor complaints, but just to see the Xmen on screen is such a treat, I let all those things slide.  I'm reading all these rumours on Halle Berry not signing on to do a third, and I say 'thank god.'  I think Halle is a good actress but she cannot do Storm. Storm is philosophical and dramatic, Halle is quiet and boring.  Storm is a natural leader and Halle simply is not.  I thought she did an awful job in the first one, she was a bit more tolerable in X2 but not much.  I think her replacement should definitely be Angela Basset!  She is such a strong leading female character in every movie she's in (watch ""Strange Days"" to see her kick ass!) She would be absolutely perfect for the role of Storm, since Storm is one of the most important team members of Xmen.  I agree to that Bryan Singer has done a fantastic job of giving the fans what they want, and creating a story that is interesting and feels ""real"".  My only criticism for him is that he needs to pit more Xmen against mutant villains, he needs to really show off everyone's powers in some really neat ways while demonstrating a team effort.  I want to see some innovative scenarios where the Xmen have to pull their resources together and come up with some original use of their powers to resolve the situation.  In X2 the Xmen didn't have any mutant foes to fight so we never get a chance to see that. Now that we've established everyone's powers,it's time for Bryan Singer to deliver us the really good stuff.  God knows we've waited long enough. 'Nuff said."

","What a nice surprise, it's good to see a sequel surpass it's predecessor on screen and that is exactly what X2 has done.  This is more of an Empire Strikes Back version of X Men which works very well and leaves us gagging for more.<br/><br/>The sequel actually had more financial backing than the original which helped Mr Singer achieve some more fancy effects that were missing from the first film.  Without these effects we would never have seen Nightcrawler realised in quite the same way that he has been in this movie.  From one of the opening scenes (attack in the White house) you are just hooked. Nightcrawler teleporting from room to room kicking some serious can was fantastic, a great energy filled start to a great film.<br/><br/>We see a lot more of Wolverine in this film too and add to his mysterious background.  We also see him a lot more aggressive (which lets face it is what he is meant to be).  A few cameos are thrown in for us fan boys in the form of Beast (well the human form at least), Gambit (although it was only his name that we got to see), Colossus, Shadowcat, Syren, Leech among others.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is the switch of roles performed by some of the characters, we actually have Magneto charging into battle leading the X-Men to stop Prof. X from killing everyone!<br/><br/>For all those who are not followers of the comics, there are bound to be a few key points that will confuse them, like the appearance of the Phoenix, but when they bring out X3 (lets hope) all will be revealed, they can't leave it like this, can they?"
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","0","7 May 2003"," Well, they're definitely united
","The original X-Men was a cool action movie with great special effects, excellent characters, awesome fight scenes, and, my personal favorite, some highly effective comic relief. Consider, for example, some of the stuff in the first film, such as the scene where Wolverine proves to Cyclops that he's really himself and not Mystique disguising herself as him, or when he tells Cyclops that someone else is in the room with them and to `keep his eye open.' Classic stuff, and as was the case in the original movie, the comic relief in the follow-up is great, and most of it comes from Wolverine.<br/><br/>It's interesting to consider the fact that the movie tends to try to satisfy both its evolutionist audience as well as its creationist audience (the latter of which obviously makes up a considerably smaller portion of the audience). Nightcrawler is a great character, although after the opening fight scene (arguably the best scene in the entire film) he changes into a completely different character almost immediately. I was looking forward to seeing him as a wonderfully effective villain (at this point I'd like to remind you that I am not familiar with the X-Men comics and so don't know a lot about the characters beyond what's in the movies). I even loved the sound effects that were made when he would disappear and reappear somewhere else. It was strange that he kicked so much ass in the opening scene and then turned out to be completely timid.<br/><br/>Besides being an interesting character, Nightcrawler is the one in which the majority of the faith-based content of the movie is concentrated. It is well known that evolution is based entirely on observable facts and is totally open to change when new revelations and discoveries are made, while creationism is based entirely on faith (and, it might as well be noted, on ignoring observable facts). It's interesting to watch as the movie tends to switch back and forth between the two, seeming at first to be almost a fight for screen time by screenwriters of different ideologies but turning out to be a revelation that faith and evolution are not opposites, but can work together. <br/><br/>Evolution is a fact, we KNOW that it is true, and X-Men takes the formula and uses it to make a great action movie. The dangerous line that it walks is that is provides creationists, people who are notorious for taking evolutionary theory and mutilating and distorting it completely beyond recognition in a desperate attempt to make it look ridiculous. It is not going to be any surprise to see hordes of creationists who will latch on to something like X-Men and accuse evolutionists of thinking that X-Men is some sort of documentary-style, non-fiction account of the generally accepted current state of human `evolution.' I would like to take this opportunity to laugh in advance. <br/><br/>It should be obvious that this is a movie made for entertainment purposes, even if only by the fact that not all of the `mutants' are, in fact, mutants. Wolverine, for example, was created by a human (not a God, by the way), as was his worthy adversary near the end of the film. But as far as taking enormous liberties with evolutionary theory, it should be noted that the movie also makes extensive efforts to clarify the way that evolution really works, although it leaves out the small detail that the X-Men are a massive exaggeration.<br/><br/>In comparison with the original movie, X2 was a hugely entertaining and well-made action film, just like X1, but it is the story that has evolved more than anything else. I loved the introduction of a new bad guy who forced the X-Men to come together, although the movie did tend to trip over itself at some points, such as with the paper-thin content of the meaning and need for the little boy with the freaky tongue. <br/><br/>(spoilers) I was disappointed with the fate of Jean Grey, even if only because her `death' was so avoidable. It was never explained very clearly why she didn't stay on the jet and use all of her energy to lift the jet itself out of the path of the oncoming water instead of getting off and trying to levitate the jet while stopping the water at the same time. Even if exiting the jet was absolutely necessary, there is really no fathomable reason why, given the fact that she held the water back that long and was ultimately able to stop her efforts at lifting the jet, she could not let the water gradually come to her and slowly engulf her so that she could swim and wait for the jet to come back and pick her up.<br/><br/>At any rate, if her death was necessary for furthering the story or for preparing for the next film (the creation of a third X-Men is an absolute certainty, after all), then I suppose I can understand it, but making Jean's death necessary and making it believable are two of the weakest parts of the film. On the positive side, however, Hugh Jackman was given the opportunity to prove his effectiveness in performing emotionally charged scenes while playing a comic book character (which is certainly a daunting task).<br/><br/>Speaking of weak parts of the film, by the way, there is also Magneto's escape. Not only does Mystique inject a massive amount of `iron' into the body of one of Magneto's prison guards without killing him (there are VERY few things that can be injected directly into the blood stream in that quantity without resulting in almost immediate death, and iron in ANY form is NOT one of them), but Magneto also manages to latch on to all of that iron and pull it out of the guard's body, using the nice little ball-bearings that he gets out of him to escape. However, even the most basically educated members of the audience, who realize that the iron in your blood is not exactly metal, will probably appreciate the way this was pulled off (that is, of course, if they were able to see the screen enough while repeatedly slapping their foreheads in disbelief).<br/><br/>
I have never been into comic books, I don't think I've ever even seen a copy of an X-Men comic, but even coming into the films completely new like that I enjoyed both of them and I think they were both remarkably well-made. It is a sign of deserving respect when a movie or series of movies based on comics books or cartoons or old TV shows or something can entertain an audience that is not familiar with the original material (this is not true for example, according to Roger Ebert, of the recent Scooby-Doo film, which I have yet to see or develop any interest in seeing). <br/><br/>With that in mind, I think it would be appropriate to end by emphasizing the sheer broadness of the target audience. Kids will love the characters and the fighting and special effects, high school and college age kids will appreciate the same things as well as the intricacy of the story (adults will more than likely appreciate this as well), and, as was the case with the first film, just about every male in the audience of any age and sexual orientation will appreciate the astronomical hotness of Mystique, which translated from the first film to this one quite well. I don't have much to say in defense of the little stunt that Magneto pulled in pulling the `iron' out of the guard's blood in order to escape, although even that was convincingly done. As with all movies, X2 has its faults, but it is definitely a worthy follow-up to the original, which was something of a tough act to follow."

","I thought that this was a grest sequel to the first X-Men film. I thought that it was perhaps better than the first. The plot was good and the villan of William Stryker was done well. I need some questions answered in the next movie:<br/><br/>What happened to Magneto and Mystique at the end of the movie? What is up with Senator Kelly?<br/><br/>Other than that it was a good film. 10/10"
"david.clarke","9","0","0","7 May 2003"," Better than anyone could hope for
","Despite some reservations, I think this is a superior super-hero movie. There is a strong story, it builds brilliantly on the first film, and has some terrific set pieces. Bryan Singer controls it all with a sure hand and the cast are great, especially McKellen Cox, and Stewart who add gravitas to the whole proceedings. I love the those little things for fans (Hank Mccoy, Collusus), though I am still waiting for a hint of Warren Worthington III.(Does he still exist in the comics?) As an original x-man fan, I was kept very happy. The ending was totally unexpected , and yes I think The Phoenix saga must be on its way. Bobby the Iceman was nicely expanded, but as he was an original x-man shouldn't his parents be very old or is the comic guy now really young? Does his brother exist in the comics? Shawn Ashmore is very cute. I reckon the Ice keeps Bobby young. Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler was just extraordinary, and the effects that go with him were just like the comic character come to life. I worry that non-comic readers will be lost, but I think Singer has balanced everything so well. I wish there was more Scott Summers, but there's always X3. The effects are superb, goes without saying these days, but they work well with the storyline which nowadays the biggest task is of combining both well, which Singer did excellently."
"shawny11_2001","9","0","0","7 May 2003"," Absolutely Amazing!!!
","The first X-Men film was a superb movie, yet it didn't strike me as a true-hearted comic movie. X2 did (especially since its based off of an actual graphic novel). I had more comic-geek moments than I've ever had in a comic movie. Yet there is more to this than the typical comic geek reaction...<br/><br/>The movie is character-driven, and that is the best strength any film can rely on. Some characters sadly are left behind, Rogue and Cyclops, while others are expanded on and introduced. I was disappointed that Rogue didn't get more screentime...but they did introduce Nightcrawler who is superbly acted by Alan Cumming. He starts the rollercoaster with the Whitehouse scene and that is by far one of the best fight scenes in cinematic history. (Neo eat your heart out).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman once again shows why he was the best and only choice for Wolverine...incredible. If Singer had focused on him a bit more this film, it would've been even better. (Though I'm sure not complaining).<br/><br/>Overall, this follow-up to the first is very much like they way Empire Strikes Back and The Wrath of Khan. It improves on the original by leaps and bounds, and opens the doors to new and higher ideas. Go watch it several times, in fact, see it at least 3 times to catch all the little Easter Eggs you missed before. (Remy LeBeau, the Sentinels project, etc etc etc)"

","X2:  X-Men United<br/><br/>It's that time of year that the movie industry and the public look forward to with equal amounts of trepidation and glee.  It's that time of year when the birds are singing, the sun is shining, grass is growing, and all things old are new again. Yes, you got it, it's the time for sequels to hit the theater.  X2 leads the pack with it's recent release. The only question is can it surpass the original or does it fall victim to the dreaded, sequelitis?  Let it be known...it is GOOD!<br/><br/>(possible spoilers)<br/><br/>Logan has returned from his journeys in search of his past.  Nothing is really any more clear than when he left Xavier's school at the end of the original movie.  Unfortunately the team is moving quickly in different directions.  Storm and Jean Grey have headed to Boston tracking a possible evil mutant and the Professor and Cyclops have headed to visit their old enemy Magneto, still residing in the plastic prison he was encased in when last we saw him.  Logan reluctantly agrees to stay and watch the students as the rest leave on their missions.<br/><br/>As Storm and Jean Grey discover the mutant in Boston known as Nightcrawler, the mansion comes under a military led attack.  Some of the students are captured however the majority are able to escape due to the efforts of Logan and some of the older students.  Fortunately Logan, Rogue, Bobby Drake (Iceman), and the student known as Pyro are able to meet back up with Storm and her compatriots.  Unfortunately the Professor and Cyclops seem to have totally disappeared.  Even more unfortunate for them, Magneto has been able to escape from his prison with the aid of Mystique and has now offered to align with the team.  It seems he knows where their mutual enemy is and why he has captured the Professor. If our heros and villains are not able to work together as one team, then all of mutant kind may soon be at risk.<br/><br/>As a longtime fan of Marvel Comics I admit that for years I was disappointed with the attempts at translating the characters to the big screen.  I approached the original X movie with some fear and was happily surprised.  I didn't think the story was that great since the majority of it was taken up explaining the characters but I was happy.  This movie doesn't have that problem.  It has a good, thought-out plot and it moves with a quick pace that doesn't cause one to wonder how long they have been in the theater.<br/><br/>The biggest success I can see for this movie comes from the totally reuniting of the original cast and director.  Bryan Singer returns as director and he understands the pacing which is needed.  He knows the amount of exposition to deliver and when the action needs to be kicked up a notch, and when he kicks the action up a notch it is spectacular. I don't believe we ever really got to see Logan cut loose in the first movie but here, oh my goodness!  I realize that their are other members of the team but this one focuses much on the arguably most popular character and it succeeds.  Saying that though, we do have the introduction of many characters and hints at even others further to come. The mansion sequence was a treat for knowledgeable fans as you spent the time remembering who the students were simply from the use of their powers.<br/><br/>All of the actors are superb in their roles.  Patrick Stewart has long been the dream of many as Professor X and he succeeds admirably. Brian Cox (the original Hannibal) plays the ""main"" villain, Commander Stryker, with complete self-rightous evil.  The standouts are of course Hugh Jackman, Logan/Wolverine, and Ian McKellen, Magneto.  The two of them have mega-charisma and the story always moves up to another level when they are on the screen.<br/><br/>As you can guess, I highly liked this and strongly recommend it for fans and non-fans alike.  I will give this a split rating because I believe non-fans will find it good but not understand as well the attention to detail that has been given.  Sure, a few things have been changed to fit the content of the screen but overall this adaptation was incredibly well done and it will most definitely be a part of the collection.  3/4 for non-fans and 4/4 for fans."

","I thought that the movie did an excellent job of being loyal to comic book readers while at the same time presenting an entertaining story to those new to the series.  The movie medium really allows for the characters to be expanded from their previous comic book form by added depth in their appearance and personality. The film revolves around Gen. William Stryker and his attempts to control and destroy all of the mutants on the planet, as well as Wolverine's quest to discover his origins.  As a part of the adventure, the X-Men encounter, and recruit Nightcrawler, who is excellently fleshed out by Alan Cumming, as the Bavarian Imp who can teleport and has exceptional acrobatic abilities.  I thought they did an excellent job expanding and showing his devout religious beliefs, while at the same time cinematography and special effects led to an accurate portrayal of his ability to teleport.  Loyal fans of the comic series will be delighted to see other characters pop-up in minor scenes (e.g. Colossus, Syren, Shadowcat, and the Beast) as well as hints at what's to come in the probable sequel(s).  Although the movie has to give a parsed version of the plot of the comic series, I felt that the movie did an excellent job of providing entertainment for hardcore fans and neophytes alike."

","I went into see X2 with very low expectations, I was not very impressed with the first movie so I expected more of the same.  After the first 90 minutes I was sure I was wrong and X2 was a good movie, however after the movie ended I was back to were I began.  X2 is not a bad movie, it just isn't brilliant or exceptional.<br/><br/>The Producers, writers and Director(s) did a very good job at making a sequel, the provided a few simple facts about the first movie (and the X-men story) rather than retelling it in a condensed version.  They put time between the movies, with younger actors they do grow up.  And so on and so forth.  And while not the most interesting storyline it provided a decent foundation for special effects.<br/><br/>But in my opinion the negatives really hurt the movie, I like to think that a few problems can be overlooked but in this movie they all just stuck out. It appeared that the movie was re-written during filming, while this happens all the time I believe that this movie need a complete re-write, not from the story stand point, but just to help the scenes flow better. In my opinion there are some really intersting scenes and dialog wrapped around some really bad scenes.  I wouldn't be suprised if they filmed in Canada first since the out door scenes were bad (almost like the actors were out of character.) I might be spoiled with my TV at home, but there were not any great scenes you had to see on the Big Screen, Including Jean Grey's scene.  It was like the directory/producers didn't want to take any chances.

","I am an X-Man, fan, and although the nitpicker in me wants to point out all of the inconsistencies that this movie has compared to the comics, I can't. The plot was carried well from the first movie, with more glimpses at some of our favorite heroes and villains.  The special effects were much improved, especially the teleportation effects of Nightcrawler, the woefully short metamorphosis of Colossus, Magneto's escape - well, suffice it to say that there's a ton of eye candy.  There are a number of subplots within the main plot, all of them well done and well performed, providing the true ""fanboy"" of the comic satisfaction that, although things are different, they are still laden with the respect for the Marvel series.  The first movie was nice, but had a very simplistic plot, perhaps necessarilly so.  With this film, a number of teasers are presented that scream ""SEQUEL!"" or ""SPINOFF!"" The plot was well presented and moved well enough, and with the exception of a few semi-clumsily done things (the prelude to Phoenix could've been done a bit better, and the insistence of including many of the ""old guard"" of the comic as children - enh), I couldn't have asked for anything more.

The creators could have ruined this film if they had put in one ounce of the Matrix/Crouching Tiger fighting styles, but they didn't and that's what puts X-men II high in ranking for me. The first ten minutes alone are worth the cost to see this again and again! The special effects they used for Nightcrawler are exquisite and the transporting and fighting in the White House absolutely took my breath away. I was excited to hear proper German being used by Kurt Wagner (for example: the way he introduces himself to Storm and Jean Gray is extremely German) and I swooned at the way he said ""your welcome"" to Rogue. (Bitte shon). I found the plot to be smooth with very little inconsistencies. The only ones seem to have stemmed from the way they discuss genetics, but I'll leave my micro-biology friend to discuss that. The only actor I did not enjoy was Halle Berry as Storm. She seems to have become whiter and her hair yellower and any follower of X-men will agree that although Halle Berry is pretty and all that, she's just not Storm. I can't wait for the rest of the movies, if in fact 20th Century Fox are going to continue this fantastic epic. Definitely has a better future than the Batman series, that's for sure."
"John Doe 316","8","0","0","4 May 2003"," The Superhero Movie Has Evolved
","Well, anyone who had doubts about this franchise after X-Men can thankfully be proved wrong, as Bryan Singer has gone and created the best comic book movie of all time!<br/><br/>X-Men was great, and holds a position of prestige in my DVD collection. However, some have said that it lacks in spectacle.  X-Men 2 has spectacle in the bucketload.  Right from the explosive opening, which has made Nightcrawler into arguably my favourite X-Man, to the whopper of a climax, action-packed and tragic in equal measures, this movie is certainly going for bigger and better.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is every bit as good as Wolverine as he was in part one.  I'm sure that by now, most people have forgotten all about the fact that Wolverine is a short, squat feral guy.  Hugh Jackman is the only way I can visualise Wolverine now.  He really gets to kick ass in this movie, particularly in the much-hyped raid on the mansion.  This is a character who keeps on evolving, so it will be interesting to see what is done with him next.<br/><br/>Halle Berry gets a beefed-up role as Storm.  This means that, unlike in part one, she has something meaningful to do other than say a bad line to Toad. However, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey impresses more with her touching performance as the telepathic Jean Grey, who is beginning to struggle with her powers, which are developing at a frightening rate.  Comic fans will know what this is building toward with X3.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler is a real delight to watch in this film, easily the best new character in the film.  The opening has to be seen to believed.  Going into the theatre, I was thinking, ""So he can teleport, so what?""  Man, right from the first BAMF, I was nearly out of my seat cheering, as Nightcrawler teleports all over the place, at a speed that's almost too fast for the audience to keep up with.  Alan Cumming is great in the role, going on to give the character a sense of humour as well as a certain degree of naive innocence, once you get over the really strong German accent (""my name ees Kurt Vaaagner"" - I wouldn't have it any other way) that is.  Also, its good to see that there is a Christian protaganist in a modern blockbuster - it shows that religion hasn't lost all meaning in today's society.  Thank God Cumming has signed on for X3!<br/><br/>While Cyclops and Professor X don't have much to do other than appear concerned - they are captured for the best part of the movie, the X-kids get a good portion of time to develop, both in quiet moments (Iceman trying to tell his family he is a mutant) and action scenes (Pyro wrecking havok on the local police force).  Sadly, Rogue's role is toned down a bit this time, but I can see that this was necessary.<br/><br/>Once again, Ian McKellan seems to be having a great time playing the nefarious Magneto, this time going all Hannibal Lecter in his little prison cell.  Its common knowledge that Magneto escapes from his prison, but how he does has to be seen to be believed - one of the movie's most kick-ass scenes.  I was glad to see that Mystique has a bigger role this time round: she also gets to have fun playing both the seductive femme-fatale and a big-time ass-kicker in the final battle.<br/><br/>And what about the real villains?  I mentioned Hannibal Lecter before, well Cox's portrayal of Lecter doesn't hold a torch to the sheer evil of William Stryker.  This is a truly despicable character, who is so prejudiced and downright nasty that you want him to die in a big way.  Learning about what happened to his wife and son makes you pity and despise him respectively. Yuriko Oyama, known as Lady Deathstryke in the comics, is the only new character that disappoints.  Sure, she is really cool in her climactic battle with Wolverine, sadly a bit too short, but doesn't really do much until she unveils those killer fingernails.  Before that, you'd be forgiven for thinking her power was cracking her knuckles really loudly.  However, she is a character you pity in some ways:  rather than being a mindless killer, she is just another pawn of Stryker.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer really appears to have picked up his stride with this movie, which follows on perfectly from X-Men.  I was glad to see that he avoided the trap fallen into by so many sequels, just repeating the best bits from the original, but making them more extravagant.  This movie is certainly more extravagant than part one, but the set-pieces are entirely original, inspired more from the comics than from the original movie.  That doesn't mean that the original film is ignored: far from it.  This movie links very closely to the events of part one, so you need to see that before seeing this.<br/><br/>It's interesting that this is a movie about evolution, as with its release, Singer has brought about the next evolution in the superhero flick, setting a standard that will be hard to top."
"headfulofghosts126","Null","0","0","4 May 2003"," Makes the typical ""bigger=better"" sequel rule work...
","X2 was a vast improvement over the extremely disapointing original. That one merely scratched the surface of the X-Men mythos, while this one finally digs into the meat of it. Marvel is really on a roll with its comic book movies and unlike some of their DC counterparts, celluloid has stayed very faithful to their pen and ink roots.<br/><br/>When basing something on source materal that's existed for years and years its next to impossible to cram all of its splendor into two hours. So I imagine everyone walks away wishing there was something the filmmakers had done better. For me, it's a somewhat trivial list. For starters, tons of editing mistakes and plot holes. Stuff that usually doesn't stick out until a second or third sitting was absolutely glaring. My biggest complaint is how some of the characters are treated. It's very easy to see which ones the writers/director are truly in love with. It's clear that Cyclops and Storm are not some of them. In both films they're completely over looked. While most of the others are allowed a degree of fleshing out, these two are as rigid and flat as when they first appeared on the screen in the early moments of X-Men 1. Even Jean Grey got her own personal demon to face down in this film. Poor Storm... all you do is fly the plane. And Cyclops? Well, I hope he's not your favorite character because he's literally in three scenes.<br/><br/>I also think the script is slighly disrespectufl towards the more established characters. Both Wolverine and Proffessor X have moments where I was groaning, ""They'd know better than that!"". Xavier is another character who doesn't have much to do this time around. Put Rouge in that category as well. No growth, no real drama. Just a tiny subplot that is quickly forgotten. She was much better in the original. Just too many characters competing for precious screen time.<br/><br/>Praise for making both Magneto and Mystique much more interesting this time. What great, great characters. Mystique and Nightcrawler give the film some of its best moments. There's also that fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike... ooooh-wee! That's all I can say about that.<br/><br/>Bottom line: better action, better special fx. Low on story, high on adrenaline. In the end, I feel it was worth the price of the ticket. You can't say that very much anymore."

","I am never one to write a review considering how picky I am about films.  However, I have chosen this time to look past that because I was literally blown away from the overall feel of X-Men 2.  I have been an X-Men fan for 7 years now long before the movie came out because I fell in love with the various X-Men comic books.  This film was smart, funny, and packed with action.  It did an excellent job continuing the X-Men story versus just recycling the same storyline and characters.<br/><br/>It picked up where the other film left off and introduced some great characters like Nightcrawler and Lady Deathstrike.  I have noticed some complaints by others who felt some characters didn't get the attention that they deserved like Cyclops and Colossus, but what people don't realize is that this is a COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION!  Many times in comic books some characters will get a lot of attention in one comic book and you won't even see them in the next.<br/><br/>So, to the critics out there who felt they should have spent more time on the new characters introduced and also on the old characters from the original film please keep in mind the film was already 135 minutes. Overall, I think they did an excellent job sticking to the characters development and looking more deeply into some of the characters lives. Also, the special effects were just awesome and at the same time didn't distract from the overall feel of the movie but added to it.  I sincerely hope that if you haven't seen this movie you go see it now!"
"mafiahitman","7","0","0","4 May 2003"," Not as great as it could/should be.
","Ok.  There's two ways to discuss this movie.  One is in reference to the comic book, and the other is to deal with the movie as if it were totally original.  I'll do both, and I'll try to be brief.<br/><br/>-With the Comic Book in Mind:<br/><br/>The movie is stretched out way too far, trying to keep up with the comic book as not to upset the millions of fans.  This is good, I suppose, but when the movie suffers to fit this bill, I say it's a bad thing.<br/><br/>The movie is simply too long.  There are many scenes that I saw that could've been totally cut out.  It makes me afraid of what really WAS cut out.  And then there's scenes where just when the action is getting good, it cuts away, and then too much happens off-camera to be justified.<br/><br/>The movie is simply too boring.  Total, there's got to be less than 15 minutes of fighting period.  Not good fighting, just fighting at all. This wouldn't be so bad in a 100 minute movie, but the movie is TWO AND A HALF HOURS LONG.  Not to mention that the comic book was indeed action packed, I just don't understand why they took the cheap route.  At the point that the movie's progressed to in the Wolverine saga, Logan is a very rough, very angry, very spontaneous guy.  In this movie, he's more like the leader of the group (which is supposed to be Cyclops, but oh well) making clear decisions, never really freaking out and killing anyone that he wouldn't have killed if he wasn't going nuts.  So sad.<br/><br/>-The Movie as an Original Work:<br/><br/>It's alright.  Not much action, viewers might be a little confused if they're not familiar with the Marvel Universe.  I doubt I can retain the count of unexplored characters on a fist.  Scenes seem to flow together nicely, aside from about five times.  Other than that, the movie was just way too long.  If they cut the crap out and just kept what we wanted to see in, perhaps taking this movie down to a little under two hours, and it'd be a great film.  I'm not sure if the series is that great for the theater, though.  Sure, it's great seeing these things on a big screen, but, there's way too much that they're trying to cram in.<br/><br/>
OVERALL: 7<br/><br/>I'd give this movie a 7.  It's not bad, not at all.  Was it as good as it could have been?  Of course not.  Just don't think it's as great as everyone else seems to think.  Don't worry; it won't make you look dumb."

One scene in the book involves the sword Excalibur, which is held out of the water by a character called the Lady of the Lake ( Jean Gray ? ). I seem to recall that the sword is thrown back into the lake at the end, and the Lady of the Lake catches it, implying that it will be available when the King is to return in the future. This may not be the director's intent, but it certainly suggests that Jean Gray will return, possibly with stronger powers."

As to be expected, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were outstanding.  Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, etc. were also great.

We're not talking War and Peace or Gone with the Wind here, people.  This is based on a comic book.  It is incredibly cool to see Wolverine, Professor X, Mystique, and all the others actually come to life.  Just keep in mind when you critique this that we're not talking great literature - we're talking BAM and POW, action, and adventure.  In this respect, X2 is fulfilling and a great movie.<br/><br/>One nice thing - they've taken note that the viewers are a little more adult than comic book readers - or that audiences in general are a little more mature nowadays.  Mystique flipping off Stryker as she slides through the door, Wolverine saying ""S**t"" - all nice little touches that make the movie characters more believable.<br/><br/>My only wish is that Beast had a bigger role - but I think in X3 (possible title - X3, the Dark Phoenix) we're going to see more action and mutant powers than you're going to be able to keep track of."

","It's a rarity for a sequel to be as good as the original.  It's even rarer for it to surpass its predecessor.  And that's exactly what X2 does and then some.  X2 is way better than X-Men (2000) in every regard.  The plot, the direction, the acting, the characters and their depth, the 'cool' factor (way HIGH), and the FX are all superb.<br/><br/>X2 is definitely the best and most ambitious comicbook based film ever. It also is one heck of a Sci-Fi/action/thriller.  Returning director Bryan Singer has taken several character and not only made them unique in their special attributes but also in their motivations, their depth, and their personalities.  Several new characters are introduced and the returning characters are given even more shining moments.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I haven't described even the most cursory plot details and that's because I want every first time viewer to enjoy this movie like I did without having anything spoiled for me.<br/><br/>All in all, X2 is now THE peak which future comicbook based films would have to reach.  Rating: 10/10"
"movieguy1021","6","0","0","4 May 2003"," X2: 6/10
","For a while, X2: X-Men United was called simply X2, until Fox decided to add X-Men United. Even in the opening credits (which seems to have been stoles from Spider-Man), it was simply X2. This shows for the rest of the movie, also: it's indecisive. Is it an action movie, romance, comic book, comedy?<br/><br/>This second installment of this popular comic book franchise has Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) coming back to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngesters, run by Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Wolverine has claws and can heal himself, while Xavier has extraordinary telepathy. Other X-Men (mutants) include Storm (Halle Berry), with weather controlling powers, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), with telekinesis, Cyclops (James Marsden, with a smaller role this time around), with laser vision, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can suck the life out of anything. New X-Men include Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), who can disappear and reappear, Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can manipulate fire, and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). On the other side of the law are Magento (Ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can change forms.<br/><br/>General William Stryker (Brian Cox) is going against mutants, and tries to kill them all. To go against Stryker, both good and bad mutants have to team up and defeat Stryker. That's how the X-Men United got in the name.<br/><br/>Put simply, X2 tries to be too many things. It has a psuedo-love story, but ultimately doesn't seem to have one central goal. There was a love triangle between Cyclops, Jean, and Wolverine, except it's only talked about a few times, and didn't add anything to the plot. Also, Rogue and Iceman have some sort of relationship that adds humor but little more. In fact, if some of the subplots would have been taken out, this 140 minute movie could have been under two hours, such as another mutant like Wolverine.<br/><br/>Special effects dominate this movie. Obviously, they looked fake, but there were very cool. However, there weren't that many fight scenes, and many of them were just Wolverine killing people. If some of the original X-Men were doing their schtick, such as Cyclops, then it would have been more interesting. Although it isn't boring, it's just not heart-pounding or exciting. The special effects were very cool, though.<br/><br/>Jackman does another job of covering up his strong accent, and he clearly had fun with his role, not taking it seriously. McKellen puts in another great acting job, as does Stewart. Berry and Janssen both looked hot in skintight outfits, as did Romijn-Stamos (although she was wearing nothing at all). Paquin didn't have much of a role this time, nor did Marsden. Cox, who is now almost as ubiquitous as Amanda Peet now, was good, although I think he was coaxed into this role.<br/><br/>X2: X-Men United is a special effects piece that isn't as fun or entertaining as other comic book movies, but overall you probably won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence, some sexuality and brief language."

","I have never read an X-Men comic nor did I know much of anything about the themes of the series until the first film debuted. I knew some of the characters from playing a Genesis game but beyond that - nothing. I had high hopes for the first film due to the direction by Singer, but after seeing it I felt that it was fairly well-constructed but nothing was incredibly notable about it to set it apart from most other action films.<br/><br/>This second film is a vast improvement in that it took the few things that did really resonate with me in the first film (interesting characters and interesting theme of humanity's fear of the different or unknown). In the first film the foundations of the characters and the 'what if' themes of X-Men (eg What if there were humans who evolved with these abilities alongside we the normal humans...) were present; in the second film they are deeply explored.<br/><br/>Basically not to give any drastic spoilers, the plot centers around the frightening power that the mutants posses over those that do not share their unique abilities and the question these mutants must invariably ask themselves...what responsibility do I have in wielding this power. That question is then complicated by the basic human nature to fear and despise the Other and the ordinary humans reaction to the Mutants power. We find that the 'ordinary' humans are perhaps more frightening then the mutants.<br/><br/>Despite a large dramatis personae the film focuses remarkably well on the key players...and each actor shines in their respective scenes. The performances by actors such as Patrick Stewart and by Sir Ian McKellen are probably expected to shine brightly - but notably all the other actors (and respective characters). Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos were given a good deal more of quality material to work with as compared to the first film and those were the most gratifying character improvement to me. The new characters were also well portrayed (especially my favorite Nightcrawler). Like the first film, a good deal of development was given to the popular Wolverine and again Jackman's performance was golden!<br/><br/>The only complaint I can make about this film given its target genre is that the characters of General Stryker and his 'assistant' were not as deep as I may have liked.<br/><br/>At the end of the film I was left wondering what exactly the consequences of the plot would be both for many of the characters, especially Prof X <<SLIGHT SPOILER>>(how will he deal with the frightening things he was made to do) and Cyclops (does he blame himself in any way for what happened?) These issues make the inevitable next installment of X-Men even more anticipated for me."

The mutant powers are exaggerated or portrayed wrong in general, such as wolverine's healing ability.  The ending to the movie was absolutely terrible!  Iceman has the ability to turn things into ice, and when the dam breaks he could easily turn all of the water into ice (or at least enough to protect the x-men jet), and even if he was somehow knocked out, rogue could steal his abilities for a while to freeze the water that is rushing at them.  But instead, Jean gets out of the jet and stops the water (so the jet doesn't get destroyed by the oncoming water) and soon as the jet takes off the water washes Jean down the river, leaving a reddish bird in the water.  Which means the next movie will be about the Phoenix Saga with Jean, because Jean did not die in this movie even though it looks that way.  In conclusion, the movie was over all good, but the writers must have been sleeping when the ending was written because it was terrible (meaning they should have found a different way to get rid of Jean, or at least use the same way and make sure Iceman and Rogue are not close enough to help).  With the ending it is still a great movie and everyone should see it.  I can't wait until the next X-Men movie comes out."

So I expected think that X2 would be OK. Well I got to see one of the best sequels ever!<br/><br/>The greatest thing about X2 is that it picks up right where it left off, rewarding everyone who saw the first film. Some may think that will confuse casual viewers, but too bad for them, they should have seen the first film.<br/><br/>The acting is suburb. All of the actors retain the personalities they gave to their characters in the first film so well that it feels like X-men and X2 were filmed back to back. Everyone from Hugh Jackman to Alan Cumming played their characters enough to make them all lovable.<br/><br/>The drama is played up more. We get to see the Jean Grey/Cyclops/Wolverine love triangle continue, and the beginnings of the relationship of Iceman and Rouge, which is an uphill struggle because Rouge can't touch other people without sucking the life out of them.<br/><br/>The action was pumped up massively. Every action scene was an adrenaline rush. Nightcrawler attacking the White House was amazing. The storming of the school was fantastic (the 5 seconds in which Colossus was on the screen made me wanna stand up and cheer) and the Deathstrike/Wolverine fight was brutal and insane. The violence has been upped, allowing Wolverine to do some hacking and slashing, without bloodshed mind you, it's still a PG-13 film. <br/><br/>Overall X2 is a film that picks up where the first left off and takes it to a whole new level and gives an ending which I didn't see coming. X2 will definately be on my list for one of the best films of 2003."

He shot a more than worthy sequel. The visual style is remarkable. Almost every scene shows an interesting entry. Furthermore the acting delivers (at least in relation to what you can expect from this genre) and the dramaturgy succeeds to make the experience very entertaining and gripping. You may expect a fine blockbuster screenplay. It's theme is about separation (every scene deals with it in a certain way). My sole-critic is the soundtrack. I believe it stays too much in the background and lacks an impressing theme.<br/><br/>In a short: ""X-2"" is a clever blockbuster and highly enjoyable - even for those who did not see the first one (but I guess it would be better to see it, in order to know the characters better)."

","X2 is a lot better than X-Men the story is better, it is longer and there are some new characters in it. Ice-Man is very good Pyro is just out of control, Deathstryke OUCH! but they could of done with some more bad guys. If they make a third one I think Jean Grey will come back from the dead even more powerful  it is a fantastic sequel but was is the name of one of the mutants who the Army guys shot at he looked like the Liquid Metal Terminator I thought he was cool."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'd like to thank Mr Singer for his gift (my birthday was a few days ago) !<br/><br/>X 2 is the kind of movie that make people realize that comics fans are not losers, geeks or retards.<br/><br/>The movie is almost perfect. Yes, ""almost"". I mean, Bryan Singer is a great director, but he still need some training with action sequence : the first sequence with Kurt Nightcrawler is a masterpiece of suspense and choreography, but, oddly, the fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike is shot like a Michael Bay-film (too many shots, the characters are dressed the same way so you can't figure who is who, you don't really understand what happens).<br/><br/>There's also a little moral problem : Deathstrike is considered evil and gets killed by Wolverine, even though she was under Stryker's control, just like Nightcrawler and Cyclops ! Even the poor Jason dies : Nightcrawler saves Storm, then Xavier, but leaves the handicaped mutant in Cerebro !<br/><br/>But I'm just being picky, here. X 2 is great entertainment ! Hey, it's even great cinema !<br/><br/>I can't wait for X 3 ! I can't believe they dared to introduce the Phoenix !"
"Tekdemon","10","0","0","4 May 2003"," Not 100% accurate to the comics, but manages to be a great movie while remaining true to the feel and meaning of the comics
","Although the story elements sometimes clash with the comic book story lines a little, the changes are OK... Instead of recapping the whole movie, I'll just say that it felt epic. The movie was a lot longer than the first one, running over 2 hours, but everything felt great as far as plot goes. Even with this size it is unfortunate that many characters get almost no lines. Kelly Hu for example, has none as Yuriko Oyama.  This I found strange as her character does appear in one of the more impressive scenes in the movie. Simultaneously, James Marsden's Cyclops gets relatively few lines, and at best you feel sorry for his character.<br/><br/>But the movie gives comic fans some inside jokes, and some comic geek hidden gems.  The humor factor for this movie seems quite a bit higher, and overall the entire movie was much more enjoyable than the first.<br/><br/>Even though the plot may seem utterly unbelievable if you're thinking of it as a regular movie, those familiar with the X-Men universe and those willing to just suspend disbelief get sucked right in to the story line.  Overall, this movie rocks =P"

","Caution*****Spoilers Present***<br/><br/>Well, I have to first clarify that I am in fact a massive X-Men fan.  I used to own a few hundred(of varying series') old X-Men comics, and I remain a loyal follower to this day.<br/><br/>However, these comic-movie crosses continue to disgust me. Both films now are littered with inconsistencies and dead-end plots.   argue with me and say that they're only SMALL indiscrepencies, but that is what irritates me the most....If they're such small freaking differences, WHY AREN'T THEY RIGHT!?!?!? One example from the first film is Wolverines' and Sabretooths' relationship....in that they had none.  The only reason why Sabretooth has ever fought the X-Men is because of his feud with Wolverine.  And the same goes for this second installment. First off, let me say that the performances in this film are all fantastic.  Hugh, Ian, Patrick and Famke are great as the mutants with the most, all capturing the essence of their characters very well.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie are great, every scene seemlessly flowing onscreen.  The scene at the beginning with Nightcrawler fighting all of the secret service agents was incredible.<br/><br/>Kudos to the design team and costume designers, I really liked the costumes in this one much better, although I still wish they would make Wolverines trademark mask.  The X-Mansion, Blackbird and military bases all looked superb and well though-out.<br/><br/>The story on the other hand was a tremendous let down, and the way most of the characters came together was insulting.  Out of all of the wonderful, lush and creative storylines that have ever been written, I don't know why they would hire some people (who obviously don't know the characters well) to write a new plot. The X-Men roster itself is a twisted preschoolers vision of what it should have been.  I can't stand the age difference of some of the most pivital characters and the twist put on their origins.  Rogue is an example from the first film.  She was originally supposed to be a part of the brotherhood of evil mutants and eventually join the X-Men with her stolen Ms. Marvels powers of flight and super-human strength.  This age difference between her and the other major characters is disgusting, as is her relationship with Iceman.  What ever happened to Gambit???<br/><br/>And the tiny cameos from other cool characters (the Beast in the newscast, Colossus and Gambits name present alongside Lensher) was too much of a tease.  They hint at the potential of some great characters and they're wasting my time with Iceman and shadowcat.<br/><br/>It sure was nice to see Wolverines dry sense of humor though (getting Iceman to chill and warm soda) and him slashing and stabbing and maiming all sorts of people.  I noticed a great deal more liberties they took in making X2 a little  more violent and profane then the first one.  But I sure was mad when they messed up Deathstrikes relationship with Wolverine.  It must be nice to be Wolverine....he has no enemies of his own.<br/><br/>So, I give the production of the film a big thumbs up and hand over a rating of 5 out of 5, but take 2.5 back for the actual finished film. My dreams of a really good mutant movie have been plucked out of the sky two times out of two.  And for the sake of Stan Lee, I hope the Pheonix hints all turn out for nought in the next film.  The pheonix  saga is far to lengthly and precise to be able to wrap up in ONE movie.  Don't rewrite it to make it fit, or I will hate you forever."

","Hearing good things about X2, I preped myself by viewing X-MEN on DVD the night before.<br/><br/>There would be few better sequels I've seen. Character continuity was X-cellent (no substitutes), the plot meshed perfectly then continued on to expand and explain threads from the first movie. This intimate linking of the two movies greatly reinforces the overall story.<br/><br/>X2 has, of course, its own interesting tale, not as seminal perhaps (the idea of the very existence of mutants) as the original, but perfect for the middle movie of the trilogy I'm hoping for.<br/><br/>As with many good sequels in an action genre, the pace and scope of action is faster and broader in X2. The expansion of the original group of X-MEN to include other mutants like Iceman, Nightcrawler and Pyro with different powers makes for renewed interest, though all the original key characters (especially Wolverine and Mystique) continue to hold that central role. As always, the X-MEN's powers act synergistically making them far more powerful collectively than as individuals.<br/><br/>Women continue to have powerful, dominant roles though Thank God no one in either movie makes an issue regarding X-PEOPLE...<br/><br/>SPOILER ahead: With Jean Grey gone, who will form the emotional focus for Cyclops and Wolverine? Will Wolverine get the hots for Mystique?(""She's good, she's very good""). Will it be Professor Xavier or Magneto who ultimately proves successful in reconciling mutants to the rest of humankind?<br/><br/>I hope I get to find out in X3."

","I just saw XÂ² and I must say it was quite good. It was much better than the first installment for a variety of reasons. First of all, it owns a much more deep and intelligent screenplay. Now, the X-Men face a real foe that actually has the power to destroy them. I thought the villains in the first movie were very weak and expectable, but this time there is a greater character development, and the figure of William Stryker assumes a very powerful role in the plot.<br/><br/>It also has better special effects and better acting (Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming and all the others were awesome). I still do not like Cyclops, however. I think he should be portrayed by someone older.<br/><br/>I thought Nightcrawler was AWESOME; not only he has bad-ass powers, he is also psychologically deep, being religious and all. The opening sequence was great; the tension between the SS agents in the white house while they hear their colleagues having their asses kicked in the room next to the oval room was pure cinematic glory. Magneto's escape was also tryumphant, my favorite sequence in the whole feature! Sir Ian rules!"

Certain characters were used too much and others not to their potential. The reasoning seems justified to those ""in the know"" once you realize that Singer and company are setting up a cliffhanger of sorts for the next installment, but certain events could have been avoided with proper execution of characters' abilities. That's a mild criticism compared to the rollicking good time I had at this one. Much better than the first movie and the effects were awfully cool. Overall, well worth the price of admission.

","This movie actually improves on its predecessor, whose only real faults were a short run time and a weak score.

And John Ottoman's score complements the film in a way Michael Kamen's did NOT do in the first film.  Ottoman really is to Singer what Danny Elfman is to Tim Burton or John Williams is to Spielberg.<br/><br/>With so many new and interesting characters introduced, it will be interesting to see if certain actors (*ahem* Halle Berry) will put aside their salary-fed egos for a third movie, or if the way will be paved for a ""new generation"" of young X-men who can keep the movie franchise going as the older characters are phased out."

","""X2"" is a great action movie sequel (with a brain) that easily surpasses Part One.<br/><br/>What makes the movie such a treat (for me) is all of the sociopolitical commentary it makes with regard to diversity issues.  The ""mutant experimentation"" in the film is eerily reminiscent of what you might see at the Holocaust Museum, and when Bobby Drake (Iceman) tells his unknowing parents of his mutation, it's a ""coming out"" scene that any gay or lesbian audience member can identify with.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie kicks ass -- but at its heart, it's a plea for tolerance in disguise as an action movie.

The fight sequences were great, the romances weren't cheesy, and the acting was very good. Hugh Jackman was once again perfect in his role as Wolverine. Bryan Singer did a good job of directing, throwing in a lot of the plot twists that he's famous for in the Usual Suspectes. Overall, I'd give this movie a ten out of ten.

"jeev7882","9","0","0","3 May 2003"," The Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever**SPOILERS**
","There's so much to talk about in this two-and-a-half hour movie that it's absolutely overwhelming. The movie starts with a highly original special effects sequence; something of a rarity in today's copycat special effects market. This sequence involves Nightcrawler's assassination attempt on the President where he singlehandedly takes out all of the Secret Service Agents in the White House. The ""poof"" special effect used for Nightcrawler's teleportation is one of the many wow-factors in this movie. Unlike most films, the opening sequence here is a good indicator of things to come. On a side note, director Bryan Singer's makes an excellent decision, or indecision perhaps, to not mimic any special effects from The Matrix like so many other sci-fi movies have. X2 succeeds in the one department it's predecessor fell short in: special effects. Not only does it succeed, it's one of the few movies each year that effectively utilizes special effects (Minority Report and Harry Potter 2 were the only two from last year's effects filled pics).<br/><br/>Beyond the first sequence, the movie flows effortlessly through it's plot points. The only real complaint I have is that the editing was not as good as it could have been. The scene-by-scene editing was fine, in fact I would have gladly stayed in the theatre to watch a 5-hour version of X2, but the in-scene editing could have used a little work at times. The storytelling is strong with a director like Singer aboard and with screenwriters that seem to know all the beloved characters inside and out. Fans of the series are given tastes of characters like Colossus, Jubilee (for about a second), Shadowcat, and most exciting is the preview of Jean's Phoenix character which I will mention later. This movie uses a perfect balance of characters from the first film while adding just enough to keep it interesting and nor convolute it. I'd love to see Apocalypse, more Sabretooth, Morph, Beast, Gambit, and a whole lot of other characters in the next few films, but I can wait for them as long as the movies are of this high quality.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much from this film because of the all the problems that were rumored during production (the most prominent was about some or all of the actors storming off a set when they, the director, and the producers all had some disagreement). But, most of the cast is absolutely flawless. Halle Berry and James Marsden (Cyclops) are the only weak links in the chain. Cyclops' crying scene towards the end drew quite a few chuckles from the crowd and besides Hallie's Oscar winning turn in Monster's Ball (which she did deserve in my opinion), Berry has been one of the worst actresses in Hollywood. This time around her character has about the same number of lines, but none of the lines are as ridiculous as her, ""do you know what happens to a Toad..."" line from the first movie. Besides, Storm kicks some major ass in this movie, especially in the tornado sequence where the Blackbird escapes two ensuing F-16's in breathtaking fashion.<br/><br/>What I liked most about his film was that even though it was PG-13, the characters even more closely resembled their sometimes violent comic book origins. Wolverine finally got to go absolutely berserk and actually use his claws to stab people. When the mansion is invaded by government agents, Wolverine is shown stabbing an entire hallway full of agents; needless to say, this was one of the best moments in the film for me. Wolverine's character in the first installment was portrayed as well as possible for the first film in a series, but in this movie his character will please harcore fans a lot more. The use of mutants powers was so creative that I smiled even when I knew what was coming. Even when I knew who the shape shifter Mystique morphed into, I was able to appreciate the way the camera crew was able to give us a shot or angle so we were never dissapointed by predictability. My favorite use of mutant power has to go largely unmentioned because it is somewhat of a surprise, but in short: Magneto detects the iron in someone's body and extracts that iron to form balls which he uses to propel as bullets. I hope you can ignore the run on sentences, because after a midnight showing of such an incredible film, I'm definitely on a energy high.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't even mentioned the names Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, or Patrick Stewart yet. Then again there's also Brian Cox, Famke Janssen, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Anna Paquin, and Alan Cumming. In a summary of cast praise, the newcomers are all great with Cumming being the standout, and you get what you expect out of the cast from the first movie. I've said this before and I'll say it again: no actor has ever nailed a comic book character as well as Hugh Jackman has nailed Wolverine. Jackman is probably the most fortunate last minute casting change in movie history. I would have liked to see a little more of the romance between Rogue and Iceman, but in all honesty it may have been detrimental to the overall pacing of the film.<br/><br/>The character development is as good as it can be in a movie with so many people. I'm somewhat unqualified to comment on how well the movie developed the characters because I knew everything about them coming in to the film. Still, my friends who were not X-Men comic veterans didn't seem to have a problem grasping anything at all (another plus on Singer's resume). That being said, they also weren't fully able to appreciate the meaning behind the glimpses of Jean's full power. Everything from her nightmares in the beginning to her decision in the end is indicative of things to come in the next movie. Now, I can't comment for sure, but my bet is that the next movie will be about great The Phoenix Saga. The last scene in the movie scans over the water where the damn burst with a running narration from Jean. Under the water we see a glowing firey object flying though the water just before the closing credits roll. What an absoutely incredible teasing ending! The movie concludes in itself, but like all other great sci-fi/fantasy movies, it gives a glimpse of things to come.<br/><br/>All in all I can't say enough about X-Men 2. The action and story are incredible; when they are interlaced with a highly capable cast and jaw-dropping effects, it all makes for one of the best summer movies I have ever seen. This movie is exactly what the box office needs right now: a good movie that will have people rushing out to the multiplexes in the weeks to come.  By the end of this movie if you don't find yourself debating which mutant's powers you most desire, I think it's safe to say your imagination is completely dead. I hope I don't have to wait another three years for X3 (a.k.a. The Phoenix Saga?). So, which mutant do you want to be?"

","Overall, X2 is a solid blockbuster entry.  It has characters that are well thought out and well inhibited by the actors portraying them. There are beautifully sequenced fights and action sequences. And the relationships between the mutant characters is remarkable for a movie this lightweight.  But I did have a few major qualms with this movie.<br/><br/>First off, it's WAY too long.  About thirty minutes too long.  It needed to be shorter and more focused.  I wasn't really expecting this problem from a Bryan Singer movie as his films tend to zip through start to finish and are usually expertly edited.  That's not to say some of the scenes that probably should have been edited weren't good scenes.  One scene that comes to mind is the scene at Iceman, Bobby Drake's house, which is completely inconsequential to the real action of the movie and tacks on a good five or ten minutes.  There are countless scenes like this that add up to create a large close to 2 1/2 hour movie that you stop caring about the last ten minutes.  The first X-Men movie was short and while unfufilling in some respects, didn't wear out it's welcome.  It was a great popcorn movie.  This one require a popcorn AND a hot dog AND a refill on the popcorn.<br/><br/>Secondly, it was preachy.  I think everyone got the idea that the only way conflict can be resolved between mutants and humans is that they learn to live together instead of trying to kill each other.  I think this is pretty obvious to the audience after the third time someone has a monologue about acceptance, but after the umpteenth time someone gives a speech about acceptance or the lack thereof you wish Wolverine would just claw the speaker to pieces.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe it is a veiled attempt at one or many political messages.  Christian persecution, gay persecution, mistreatment of minorities & our foreign policy are all ripe for picking but none of these really stick in our mind.  So we are left with getting lectured about accepting mutants.  And mutants DON'T EXIST!  So all this lecturing feels a bit pointless and empty for interpretation by whoever.<br/><br/>Finally, my last qualm with this movie is actually an element missing from one of my favorite part of the movie, the wolverine fight scenes.  I'm not going to go into any detail about his fight scenes, but let's just say they are much cooler  and more intense than in the first one and are easily the edgiest part of the movie. But there was one thing missing...blood.  Now I know this is a PG13 movie, but when a human being gets clawed through the chest, there tends to be blood.  To not include blood is to lessen our conflicted feelings as Wolverine kills the guys who attack him rather than just disabling them like the other X Men.  He's dangerous and hot-headed and not the guy to mess with, and I want to see the blood splatter on his face when he stabs the dude. It doesn't even have to be explicitly violent.  Just enough to know that this guy has an edge and a dark side about him that the others don't.  As I said, he's dangerous.<br/><br/>Anyway, other than that the movie was a very impressive sequel with great acting.  And I know it was better than the first, I just didn't connect with it like the first one.  I think fans of the first movie should definitely see this one along with non-fans who will like this one better.  A nice if overblown blockbuster to start the summer season."
"nefarious888","9","0","0","3 May 2003"," Darker, funnier, more violent and mature than the original.
","When I first saw X-Men back in 2000, I thought it was pretty cool and I really enjoyed it.  Over time, I felt that there was really nothing special about the first movie.  It introduced the characters but hardly gave them anything to do.  I really loathe the movies that now spend so much time (basically the entire movie) introducing the characters, because the filmmakers know there will be a sequel which enables them to let loose and really start up the action.  If you look at older movies that have sequels, you can argue that the first movie in a series can stand up on its own. Examples of those movies are the original Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Superman, Toy Story, The Godfather, Batman, Back to the Future, and The Terminator just to name a few.  Lord of the Rings doesn't count because it was part of a trilogy no matter what and The Matrix seemed like it needed a sequel.  However, The Matrix is different than the movies that I loathe simply because it was groundbreaking and it was thought provoking.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to X-Men 2: it was extremely awesome!  I think because my expectations were a little lower because of the first movie, I didn't go in expecting great things, but I got great things!  Hell, I'd pay six bucks just to watch the opening attack again.  I have heard people saying that this is the Empire Strikes Back of the series and for the most part, I agree.  (Nothing will ever be the complete equivalent to Empire.)  This is a darker, funnier, more violent, more mature and more entertaining film than X-Men ever was.<br/><br/>I was glad to see Wolverine killing Stryker's men.  There have been few movies since Batman and Batman Returns in which the superhero kills people. Blade of course wipes out tons of people, but I am refering to more mainstream superheros.  In Wolverine's situation, do you just punch the guys with the guns out?  No, you put them down, so they are no longer a threat. Ultimately, this darker X-Men movie gives the series a new and better edge towards a more adult crowd.  The crowd which grew up reading the comics. The violence in this movie was, in my humble opinion, completely justified.<br/><br/>I have already seen this film twice within two days and I bet I'll see it again soon.  I can't recommend this film enough.  Even if you're not a fan of X-Men, this is good action cinema."

The basis of the movie is that a third player enters the mix....or should I say ""re-enters"" the mix. Someone who's known Prof. Xavier and Magneto for years. Someone who has a grudge against mutants and wants to see them all wiped out. A someone by the name of Gen. William Stryker. So the X-Men must reluctantly work together with Magneto's gang to defeat Stryker's plan to eradicate all mutants.

In fact, it appears this story takes place just a few months (maybe even just weeks) after the Liberty Island incident.  This allows more time to be devoted to the execution of the storyline with fantastic results. The new characters are interesting, humorous, and symbiotic with the abilities/weaknesses of the others. And the dependably vapid Cyclops, the biggest dud of X1, is happily shelved for most of the movie.<br/><br/>My only disappointment is the overly simplistic allegory of the main storyline. Obviously this is a tale of racism and discrimination. Those who fear mutants are regarded as unreasonable, rash, and foolish and no legitimacy is given to their position.  Meanwhile, we are made to somewhat sympathize with the homicidal mutants because they are being persecuted. It's too much to hope for in today's PC world, but the sophistication of the story would greatly benefit from a more neutral perspective.  I mean, in X2 (***************Possible Spoiler Coming****************) all of humanity is just seconds away from obliteration because a single mutant is duped into murdering everyone.  Maybe we can afford just a little sympathy for the impotent humans!  When actual extinction hangs in the balance, how irrational is their discrimination (see Roger Ebert's self-righteous quip in his review)?<br/><br/>All in all an intelligent and fun action flick. Who would have thought that a standoff between two guys in wheelchairs who don't even face each other could be so engrossing."

","Going into X2 I had some doubts that it would be a good sequel.  Now dont get me wrong I have faith in Bryan Singer but with most sequels not being up to par I didnt know what to expect.    I came away though with an even greater respect for both the director and the cast members.  The storyline was well thought out with little things happening to keep it going, and the special effects are of course phenomenal.  Wolverine played by hugh jackman is of course the most popular of all the characters.  The reason is because he is deeply flawed in character which makes him the most human out of everyone in the movie.  Nightcrawler is also an exceptionally interesting character as well.  The movie did exceed my expectations well.  Although I doubt this will ever happen I guess the only thing I really want to see in the sequel is finally seeing wolverine get the girl. .. . cause he deserves it"

The movie has a fine plot that would stand above many of the original comic books stories, the characters are believable, the action scenes are incredible and the special effects are second to none(except maybe the matrix sequel that is coming out soon).   I gave this movie a 9, if only because the movie was perfectly in-line with the original comic books.  The opening scene with nightcrawler has already made it to the top five action scenes I've ever seen in American movies.  I can't possibly praise this movie enough... Go out and see it for yourself.

","Yes, it is a great movie, I have seen X-Men twice by the time I write this. I have also for decades followed lots of sc-fi stuff. Including X-Men and yes, Star Trek in all its incarnations. Let me tell you the what I didn't like of the movie:<br/><br/>***********SPOLIER ALERT***************************<br/><br/>General Stryker has for many years has studied the mutant factor going on. And when he invades Xavier's School, he does it with pop guns that shoot stupid darts. Wouldn't masive gas dosages helped? Like what they did at Magnetos plastic cage to knock him and the profesor too?. Stryker knows his mutants but has NO defense against them even though he knows them so well that he has enhanced Wolverine (and others). He has the technology to build a second Cerebro, but not the man power, the inteligence, the know-how to stop one simple mutant. Ok.. thats one. I don't like what they have done to Rouge. They have destroyed the character compleatly. Burried her on the background. It won't matter a bit if they introduce Gambit on the third movie, they would concentrate on the Gambit-Wolverine dule of wits. And the best part: A lot of similarities with Star Trek 2 and Star Trek: Nemesis. Fans will recognize the final scene, same words on the death of Data, even here spoken by Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Captain Picard. Worse, his final words are like Captain Kirk's hope for the best on the death of Spock and the final images of the lake are on the same order of the Nemesis planet and the torpedo that carried Spocks body to the planet. This is Hollywood repeating it's self again and again. Star Trek 2 leading to a Star Trek 3. Back to the Future 2 cliffhanging for part 3. Empire Strikes back leaving you in suspense for 3 years waiting for Return of the Jedi and last but not least, that is what is going to happen with Matrix 2 which we know by now that it will end in a cliffhanger that will conclude on part 3.<br/><br/>*********END SPOILERS***********************************<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked the movie cause it is a showcase for mutant power and they kick butt. I do believe as some that Hollywood will give us water downed version of the Phoenix Saga plus maybe Apocalipse. But my best bet is that they will go for the full monty and show us the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants fully ensambled (Pyro, Blob, Avalanche), plus Gambit and Beast."

","""X-Men"" sucked, with the exception of Hugh Jackman's performance. Hokeyness abounded with the mutant machine and how Rogue got her white streak.<br/><br/>""X2,"" however, is a different story - it was brilliant! Loaded with fanboy nods galore (see Wizard Magazine #140 for a list), this film must have been inspired by the awesome effects brought on by ""Spider-Man."" Colossus's cameo served very well, his armor and role adapted excellently. Siryn and Shadowcat were funny, but other cameos were more surprising. I noticed Beast's brief TV appearance because I was looking for it, but I only wish I had known to look for Sebastian Shaw and Gambit (played by James Bamford - BAMFord as in Nightcrawler's ""BAMF?"" lol).<br/><br/>Nightcrawler was depicted very well also. He was both pious and humorous, and even exhibited an Oedipus complex when talking to Mystique (his mother in comics). Odd, though, that no one made mention of the smell of brimstone his teleportation creates, nor any jokes about the sound ""BAMF.""<br/><br/>Lady Deathstrike was a bit disappointing. The codename was never used and she only bared her claws once. Kelly Hu would have made a much better Psylocke, though - an English-Chinese-Hawaiian actress portraying an English-turned-Chinese character.<br/><br/>Somehow, Ian McKellan, Anna Paquin, and Shawn Ashmore came across as their respective characters much more convincingly than in the first film.<br/><br/>The two biggest surprises of the film were those of Jean Grey and ol' Wolvie. Jean goes Phoenix, and Wolvie cries!!!<br/><br/>Highly recommended, even to those who hated the first movie.<br/><br/>PS - Could one of Stryker's soldiers have been Maverick? Hmmm.<br/><br/>PPS - Who was that mutant kid changing the TV channels by blinking?! I cannot for the life of me figure it out. My father, not an X-pert, said that maybe he had a connection to Jean Grey because of his telekinetic powers. My brother then said that maybe it was Cable, who is connected to Jean. I said it couldn't be him because he's from the future. My brother then said he was kidding - the kid was changing TV CHANNELS so he was CABLE. Ha, ha."

","Maybe it was the fact that there was no need to introduce the major characters, maybe it was because the plot had more to it, or maybe because it just built so much on an already good storyline, but I thought that this X2 was better than the first. The effects were as seamless (if not better) than they were in the X Men. The action was well done, not overly planned or choreographed. I really liked how the characters were not over done or reintroduced blatantly, as with so many sequels. Walking out of the theatre, there was only one thought on my mind.<br/><br/>This is no ordinary sequel. This is better.<br/><br/>I was skeptical at first, because so many sequels are so horribly done that one really wonders why anyone would want to do one. This is not one of those sequels. The way that they just picked up the plot from where X Men ended was pretty seamless, not to mention the fact that there was little need to reintroduce the characters in that obnoxious overstated way that so many sequels do. Also, instead of the first few minutes consisting of a sequence that I have affectionately dubbed the ""what you forgot from the last movie"" sequence, it builds the plot slowly enough to remind the audience of what happened at the end of the first movie, and accomplishes a little plot building at the same time. Brilliant!"

","A serviceable episode in a series. Honestly, though, if it weren't for my long standing for the X-Men mythos (started collecting the comics in 1975), I doubt if I would have liked it very much.<br/><br/>Yes, at the heart of it, there is the Main Message of X-Men about prejudice, tolerance and the like. As much as part of the mythos, however, has always been the idea of sacrifice, that the X-Men do what they do because they can, great power brings with it great responsibility, yadda, yadda, yadda. The movie tries very hard to include that as well, and boy, I sure wish it would have succeeded better.<br/><br/>Of course, most of the semi-literate, attention deficit crowd are there to see the 'splosions and Wolverine skewer bad guys with his claws, so I guess I should be grateful that there anything more than that at all.<br/><br/>Too bad this isn't a TV series.

"sheikybuti","Null","0","0","2 May 2003"," Unimpressed
","I had trumped-up expectations for this film, much like Spiderman last year. X2, however, is not even as good as the original in the series, and it can't begin to match Spidey.<br/><br/>Some have found fault with the simplistic plot, and I won't defend it here; the sheer volume of story lines sacrifices any meaningful depth, but it's neither the best nor the worst.  The real problem with the film is that it largely wastes the vast abilities of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in favor of far too much screen time for Halle Berry.  There is no disputing Ms. Berry's acting chops (at least not since Monster's Ball), but not even she can make Storm, her character, remotely interesting.  Storm's presence is merely an excuse to show off Ms. Berry's other considerable talents, or to introduce yet another special effect (some are more special than others).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen deliver solid performances as Wolverine and Jean Grey, respectively, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is surprisingly good reprising the role of Mystique.  McKellen is wonderful in the few scenes he has, but the best acting job may have been turned in by Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler.  Cumming brings pathos, humor, and depth to his character that is sorely lacking elsewhere in the film.  Michael Reid MacKay also deserves a mention as one of the bad guys, a former protege of Professor Xavier. MacKay never speaks, yet he communicates volumes with his intensity of expression.<br/><br/>The film's misuse of Stewart, however, is a crime for which the writers and director should be sent to a plastic prison. Imagine Jean-Luc Picard being captured by the Borg and re-assimilated in the first reel of the next Star Trek picture, and then never doing anything of substance (like appearing onscreen, for instance) most of the rest of the movie, only to show up in sick bay at the end, in control of his senses but with a slight migraine. Granted, Stewart has a stronger supporting cast here than in the Trek films, but this would have been a far superior presentation had 15 minutes of Ms. Berry's screen time been shifted to him.<br/><br/>I rate the film 6/10, or 3 stars out of 4.  I expected much more, however."

"jho-3","6","0","0","3 May 2003"," Not bad, but doesn't live up to the hype
","I don't have time to write a full-blown review, but here are a few points I'd like to make:<br/><br/>1) Visual effects are adequate for a movie of this genre, but are not at the same level of LOTR or to the level I suspect the Matrix Reloaded will be. Nothing groundbreaking here.<br/><br/>2) The movie notably lacked a consistent, smooth rhythm and seemed ""choppy"" throughout.  Ideally, an action movie like this should pace itself and build up to a climactic ending.  The problem with X2 is that each action scene during the movie is treated as if it were the climax itself, so that when the actual climax comes, it isn't that big of a deal.  Ultimately there were several action scenes during the movie that were more exciting than the supposedly ""big"" ending.<br/><br/>3) Some of the ways that our heroes get out of trouble happen too coincidentally.  It's always exciting to see a hero find an ingenius way to get out of a virtually certain-death situation.  The problem with X2 is that the X-Men too often get out of trouble not by creative teamwork, but by sheer coincidence.  Wow...a magical escape door appears out of nowhere just when there seems like not exit exists.  That's not superpower, that's dumb luck.  I'm not impressed.<br/><br/>4) Problem: at the end of the movie, not everyone in the audience is rooting for the X-men to prevail.  Do you hate it when the good guy in a movie has a chance to finish off the bad guy, but decides not to because that would be the wrong thing to do?  Or because the good guy doesn't want to stoop to that level?  Then you'll know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>5) Instead of a movie about all the X-Men together, it felt as if the movie was filmed one character at a time and then edited together.  The movie works best when we see the X-men working together as a team, but too much of the movie occurs with each of the characters in their own little storyline, which is much less effective.<br/><br/>6) Famke Janssen is gorgeous and is the best part of the movie. Even more so than Halle and Rebecca.<br/><br/>Bottomline:  I'd give this movie a reluctant ""thumbs up,"" despite its flaws simply because it is the ""X-Men"" and that even a mediocre sequel will attract millions of people based on the strength of the first movie.  Just don't expect to be blown away.  Personally, I was expecting much more based on all the hype surrounding the release of this movie."

","As a very long-time fan of super-heroes, I had always dreamed of this moving experiments. I enjoyed TV-series like Wonder-woman, Hulk or even the terrible batman. Then came Tim Burton's Batman : the first one was not bad, but I don't like it a lot. The second one (staring Michelle Pfeiffer as catwoman) was a great movie, it is the one I considere as the best super-heroes movie. Some years later came Xmen, the first one, and a not-too-bad movie : the chronology of the uncanny Xmen comics was not right at all (Iceberg, one of the 60's Xmen is a kid besides Tornado, who is one of the 80's stories, for instance), the dressing was black leather instead of the bright costumes of the originals (remember wolverine, blue and yellow), but it was okay, it was not ignorants choices but clever ones : all of the comic book can not stay same in the movie. The script was bad, because of its purpose : explaining quickly what are the mutants, showing a few characters and exploiting some of Chris Claremont most famous comics stories (like ""god creates, man destroy""). Lots of the Xmen 1 scenes were very dark : night costs less to shoot. Then came Spiderman : great actors, good and respectuous script, a not very good green goblin (but with a good actor), a great costume... A very good movie, my second favourite adaptation. We can forget Spawn, Daredevil, The Shadow... All that is enjoyable to watch on a rainy day, but they aren't masterpieces. Xmen 2 is my 3rd favourite of the superheroes kind. It has all the qualities of the first Xmen, but it has other things. It is more desperate and more cynical (the president sends the army on the mutants but warns ""don't show kids killed on primetime""), the line between the good ones and the bad ones is thinner than ever (the reaction of bobby drake's family is a good example : you are supposed to love your family, but what happens when your family refuses what you are ?).

","Having grown up with the X-Men comics and Fox's animated TV show in the 90s, it's extremely difficult to stay objective when judging such an accurate adaptation to the big screen. However, I can certainly provide a perspective that is shared by a great number of people, considering X-Men is the best-selling comic books of all time.<br/><br/>While the first movie was mostly an introduction to the two opposing ideologies of 'Professor X' Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik 'Magneto' Lehnsherr (Sir Ian McKellen), X2 shifts into a full force 3-way conflict: Magneto leads those who believe that mutants (who represent all minority groups) are inherently superior and should replace 'normal' humans. Xavier believes in the peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants. If Magneto were equated to Malcolm X, Xavier would be the Martin Luther King of the 'mutant crisis' in Marvel's X-Men universe. He runs a school for the protection of young mutants, which fronts as an institute for the gifted. General William Stryker (Brian Cox) holds a radical anti-mutant ideology, and believes they should all be wiped off the earth. To achieve his goals, he manipulates the US president into authorizing a raid on Xavier's school.<br/><br/>While the X-Men lore in the comics was created by Marvel's Stan Lee as an analogy of the 1960's civil rights movement, Bryan Singer's adaptations to the silver screen modernizes it in a way that both remains extremely faithful to the source material, as well as relating the stories to more recent conflicts in the real world.<br/><br/>Those who are unfamiliar with the X-Men comics are often surprised to find the kind of substance that are in the storylines, which stand in sharp contrast to the simple black-and-white 'hero vs villain' stories of other comic books. There's something in them for everyone: romance, tragedy, action, and conflicting political ideologies. Thankfully, the same can be said about this movie, as Bryan Singer set out to bring all of the above to life. Most importantly, Singer has always taken it seriously, to the relief of every long-time fan of Marvel's X universe.<br/><br/>For X fans, the film is packed full of small references and inside jokes, but Singer manages to do this in a way that never detracts from the flow of the main story, and he keeps it very accessible even to those who have never read the comics or seen the old 1990's animated TV series.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the acting is top-notch. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as everyone's favorite Canadian mutant, 'Wolverine', now seemingly far more comfortable in the character. Oscar winners Halle Berry and Anna Paquin return as Storm and Rogue respectively. In my opinion, Halle Berry does a far better job depicting Storm's character in this sequel than she did in the first film, partly due to having a little more screen-time. Newcomer Alan Cumming does an amazing job portraying the much-beloved Nightcrawler, who becomes surprisingly centered in this story. Shawn Ashmore also does a great job as Iceman, who was one of the original X-Men in the '60s, and essentially takes the place of Remy 'Gambit' LeBeau, at least for the time being, as Rogue's love interest.<br/><br/>While the first X-Men movie was a decent introduction into the X universe, X2 feels like the main event: a story that can both be enjoyed as a stand-alone film as well as a part of the much larger plotlines of the comic books in the era when it was written by Chris Claremont (who, by the way, is the writer of this film's official novelization.)<br/><br/>The action is in the calibre of such classics as the Indiana Jones and Star Wars films. Effects feel more polished than those of the first film, now that the production budget has almost doubled. It also stays true to the comics' style of fights, including the often violent battles involving Wolverine -- an element surprisingly kept in the film.<br/><br/>The dramatic and often complex relationships between the characters is included so faithfully that it should even satisfy the segment of X-Men fans who followed the Rogue and Gambit romance storylines in the comics, despite the absence of Gambit in these films (with the exception of his name, Remy LeBeau, which does appear briefly on a computer screen in the film as an inside reference for X fans.)<br/><br/>The ending, while still still holding dramatic significance to those who are unfamiliar with the comics, will serve as a hint to X fans, making it fairly obvious which of the classic X-Men comicbook storylines will be brought to life in X3.<br/><br/>There's no greater challenge than the one film-makers face when adapting stories with such large established fan bases to film. Often times, a balance must be struck between accessibility as a stand-alone movie and satisfaction of the fans. In my opinion, Singer has very successfully done that with X2 even more so than in the first film.<br/><br/>X2 definitely deserves to be the center of a trilogy, or hopefully even a longer series of movies, considering the amount of source material that could still potentially be adapted to screen in the future.<br/><br/>X fans will not be disappointed."

","As a child we were all into comic books and movies.  But, for a long time most comic to movie translations were flawed at best, finally we got movies like X-Men and Spiderman.  This is a very fitting sequel to the first installment of the X-men series.  Not much time has passed between the two movies but alot has changed in that time.  We've got new characters I.E. nightcrawler, pyro, and more, we also see expanded roles for some of the movies original mutants.  This sequel raps up the events of the first movie but leaves it open enough for a third installment probably revolving around the phoenix.

","Being a diehard XMEN fan since a child, a big worry I had when I heard that there were plans to make ""The movie"" was that they would try to shove an entire story line into one or two movies and basically make the movie too busy, and ruin the background and ""living"" quality associated with each character. I am happy to say that my worry was wrong! I was extremely pleased with the first film and have since been waiting for the second. Last night the film had it's grand opening at our local theater in which I attended and once again I was extremely pleased. They have taken time to touch the background of each character and give them more substance than just their mutant abilities. I feel they've picked a great cast to play the various characters and in general the whole project was extremely well thought out. After seeing the second film now I am just anxious to see where they plan to go with Jean Grey and the Phoenix Saga. Two thumbs up to a successful recreation in the making!"

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," Solid comic book adaption
","The first X- Men being mostly character driven and plot- based instead of being filled with action sequences, it'd be natural for the second one to have more action then storyline. Fortunately, most of the film adds up to what is an enjoyable experince, and a worthy box office opening film. The cast is all solid here, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman leading the cast, with Famke Jansen, Alan Cumming, Halle Berry, and Ann Paquin in support. They all do their jobs, Hugh Jackman stands out the most as the tough Logan a.k.a Wolverine who's past is mysterious. Halle Berry still has a minor part in this film surprisingly, since she won an Academy Award it would seem like they'd give a lot more screen time and dialogue. The script by David Hayter is solid, but it could use a bit more polish. Some of the characters need to be intertwined more and sometimes the plot jumps around too much to uneeded relationships (e.g. Iceman and Rouge). There was also more dialogue needed for Nightcrawler who mostly just prayed in German and teleported around. Brian Cox portrays the villianous William Styrker who shares a connection with Logan, but the villian ends up being cliche in the end. Unfortunately, it would seem this film would be focused more on Logan's mysterious past but instead it takes the shortcut route and skimmes over the information. Brian Synger offers his talented direction here, which gives this film enough push to make it a good film. Instead of taken the approach he used in X- Men, in X2 he focuses more on getting the viewer excited about the next scene or following the characters closely. He fails a bit in the second aspect simply because they aren't developed enough. The visual effects are what stands out most in the film, creating excellent images that never look too fake. The scene that comes to mind is the introduction at the White House. The ending of this movie is actually surprising, and people who don't know the storyline of the comics or who haven't watched the origianl Television show will have trouble understanding it. X2 stands out as one of the better comic book adaptions to come onto the big screen, it's on- par with the first one, and definitely is better then last year's blockbuster ""Spider- Man"" or this year's earlier release ""Daredevil."" 8/10"
"Midnight","10","0","0","3 May 2003"," The Hype Delivered
","I think it really says something when a person can get into all the hype about a movie, obsess over it way before it comes out, download all the trailers, clips, browse through all the galleries... and STILL love the film when it comes out. I was so excited about this movie way before May 2 rolled around. I bought X-Men 1.5 (even though I already had the VHS) just for the X2 footage. But when the movie came out, and I sat in the darkened theater, I couldn't help but have a silly grin on my face the whole time out of sheer joy and pleasure of having seen this incredible film! The action is amazing, intense, and intelligently choreographed. I love the fact that the action is, for the most part, done in real life and not overrun with CG (as was, in my opinion, overly done in such films as Star Wars Ep 2 and even a bit in LOTR: Fellowship). Many complained of the ""slower"" interludes/scenes but I thought they were great. Not only did it allow for some teases, humor, and some character development, but it creates a contrast between the more intense scenes of the film- you get the impression that you are riding some kind of filmic roller coaster. About the only BAD thing about this film is the music! Oh where or where did Michael Kamen go? All in all, great film, surpasses the first by far, great acting, awesome characters, awesome action, definitely one of my favorite films of all time. Now there is just the agony of waiting for it to come out on DVD!"
"JuleBugg81","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," **spoilers**
","I'm only going to restate of few of the things that others have said and elaborate a little.  I thought the story line of X2 was good, but it did prove weak at some points.  There was a lot more plot, little less fighting, which I'm guessing some people were upset about.  Night Crawler and Pyro were good additions to the already crowded cast of mutants and added different dynamics all around. Night crawler added a religious aspect that I thought added to the story.  He's almost an innocent in this whole war. We see the conflict with Storm right from the beginning.  He also add the new dimension of a teleporter. Pyro is the conflicted teen that can't control the need to exert himself over humans, much like Magneto.<br/><br/>
In the end of X2, we lose most of the whole Wolverine story.  He comes to grips with who he is and changes completely for the better.  That was the only issue I really had with this one, but it's partly because I love Hugh Jackman.  I find it hard to believe that he figured out that maybe he was a bad person and helped Stryker, and that he just let it go.  Maybe in X3...<br/><br/>Mystique is by far one of my favorite characters.  Rebecca Romijin-Stamos gets a little more development and a lot more screen time.  She has the hots for Wolverine, she isn't afraid to be herself, and she genuinely cares for Eric Lensher.<br/><br/>I do give a round of applause to Hugh Jackman, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen for their superb acting skills.<br/><br/>
Now, I really want to comment on Jean Grey.  She is gone right now, but do not count her out.  For loyal comic book readers and/or fans of the old cartoon, we all recognized what Jean Grey had become - the Phoenix.  Could you see it in her flaming eyes in the scene where she tries to save the jet? Or did you not catch it until she became a ball of flame?  The Pheonix will rise again, or did you not notice the golden bird spread her wings across the water at the end...X3 will be really good...<br/><br/>For those of you who called it a weak ending, I disagree.  X2 leads into it's sequel better than the first one did.  The possibilities for the next movie are endless.  We keep seeing more of Jubilee, and even Gambit made and appearance, but some might have missed it.  I, for one can't wait for X3.<br/><br/>I give X2 9/10"

"ShannonAmidala","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," Mindblowing, utterly fantastic- Enjoy! **spoilers**
","It seems like this year has been the year for sequels. First Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets burst forth in November, funnier, wittier, and more delightful than its predecessor. Then Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, in perhaps the least popular book, proved it could live up to its expectations- and even exceed them. And now, with all the candor, excitement, and intensity (and MORE!!) of the first X-Men movie, X2 adds a new level to the saga of the X-Men.<br/><br/>The main thing I noticed about the second movie was that everything moved a lot faster than in the first one, and this was to be expected, whereas the first movie is mainly introduction and exposition, the second movie actually grabs a hold of a plot that its characters embark upon. The opening scene with Nightcrawler at the White House was perfectly done, with tight, intense editing and extraordinary choreography and special effects. The sound in this movie was incredible! I recommend that everyone see this at the theatre, for seeing it home on a small screen doesn't do its mastery justice.<br/><br/>As with many sequels, this one was funnier than the original! Everyone had great lines, especially the new character Pyro and our homeboy Wolverine. :) It was cool seeing the characters with their new looks- Rogue's maturity in dress and style, Jean's nifty hair cut, etc.<br/><br/>Acting was all-around fantastic, too. I felt the actors understood their roles better. Jean Grey, my favorite mutant, got a bigger part, and I was so happy! In the first movie she got a bit of the shaft. Speaking of getting shafted, Cyclops/Scott Summers got really shafted! He only had a few scenes central to the action of the plot, and though one of these was outstandingly done e.g. Jean's death scene, I think we needed more of him. More of Rogue/Bobby/Pyro camaraderie, too. I loved that scene in the food court, hehe, it was great! :)<br/><br/>I can't go on enough about the action and the special effects. They didn't look cheesy AT ALL. They were brilliant and perfectly done. The sound was amazing, editing was fabulous, everything came together so nicely. The only nitpicks I have are with the plot, and that is that I wish we could've learned more about Wolverine's background, since the first movie set all that up.<br/><br/>Brian Cox played Stryker, who was so awful and scary, I really loathed him in the movie. Cox did a great job. I liked his scenes with Hugh Jackman. :) Kelly Hu did really well, too. There's that one scene with her and Hugh that is sooooo intense! I heard it took three weeks to film, and it was really well-done.<br/><br/>Word of warning, though, I wouldn't recommend taking your kids to see this, at least if they're under eight or nine. The movie is definitely PG-13, PG-15, and it skates under the R belt. I heard it was R before Bryan Singer toned down the violence. There were several small children in our showing, and a lot of them were getting tittery and a little sniffly during some of the violence, and very restless during the romantic, tender scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, what a great movie! 8/10"

"StuHolmwood","8","0","0","6 May 2003"," Feminism Alive and Kicking
","Women loved this film. I am not a woman, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. As I watched the film, however, I did remark a large step foreward in the role of the female super hero, and I think this is perhaps why women liked this film (besides that I'm told Wolverine is hot).<br/><br/>Traditionally, as with the Sorceress in ""Heman"", female superheros have power not because of physical strength, but because of some abstract or arcane power. This, symbolically, says that men are stronger than women, and women need to use some intangible power (be it intellect or sex appeal) to garner power.<br/><br/>The fight scene with Wolverine and the evil assistant in the adimantium laboratory changes all this. Wolverine, the macho man of the X-men, is severely beaten by a woman in a purely physical contest. There are no spin kicks, no spells, no potions, and no cleavage distractions. This is a fair contest with equal weapons, and it was well done to boot. Granted, he wins in the end, but he bleeds buckets.<br/><br/>Marvel comics, thus, has attracted women to a genre which is stigmatized as being male dominated. The boys with their kung fu grip Skeletor no longer reign in the comic book movie industry - way to go girls."

I'm not surprised the writers had to leave out certain characters (Beast, Jubilee, Gambit), in just over two hours they chose extremely carefully who and what to cram into the viewing time.

"Ace_of_Sevens","9","0","0","2 May 2003"," Hard to imagine what it could have done better
","Perhaps the most amazing thing about X-Men 2, or X2, as the kids are calling it, is how it successfully juggles 12 major characters and a host of minor ones.  Almost everyone's favorite X-Men make at least a brief appearance. (Sadly, still no Gambit, but if you pay attention, you'll see him mentioned.)<br/><br/>Before I get into it, a couple brief warnings.  This movie assumes that you have seen X-Men.  If you haven't, there are a lot of things you won't understand.  It's widely available on DVD and VHS, so there's no excuse to not watch it first.  Also, X2 is about as violent as a PG-13 can be. While there is no explicit gore, the body count is scores above X-Men's and there are some bloody scenes.<br/><br/>X2 is given much more breathing room than the original.  It runs half an hour longer and doesn't have to spend time on exposition.  The result is a plot that doesn't have to sacrifice plot or character.  This is critical because, as I mentioned, there are a lot of characters to get to know.<br/><br/>All the performances are excellent.  There's not a single actor who doesn't make you believe in their character.  The cast from the first film keep up the high quality here.  Halle Berry is in fact better.  Shawn Ashmore does a great job with his expanded role.  Newcomers Brian Cox, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford and especially Alan Cumming are similarly impressive.  Mr. Cumming bears special mention here as Nightcrawler would appear to be a particularly difficult character to pull off in live action.  Thanks to his efforts along with those of the special and visual effects teams, he's perfect.<br/><br/>Speaking of the effects teams, this movie looks amazing.  They had an extra 33% budget to work with this time around and it shows.  Nightcrawler's ""bamph"" effect is particularly noteworthy, but other sequences such as Cerebro and the ending sequence are certainly not slouches.<br/><br/>In short, X2 does everything right.  The cinematography, directing, acting, script, sets, costumes and effects range from excellent to perfect. Unless you absolutely loathe action movies (in which case, why are you even reading this), I strongly recommend you see this movie."
"illeatyourdog","Null","0","0","2 May 2003"," a true sequal
","This has to be the best sequal in a long while (of course there are countless other sequals on the way, about 3 or 4 or so, but this could be an omen of things to come).  There are more characters, more story, and much more action. Whats even more amazing is how the director and writer managed to pay close attention to almost every character (many of which that were already glimsped at in the first one) without it being tiresome  or slowing the pace of the film.  Ironically, even with a longer running time then the first, it moves at a quicker pace, mainly due to the action scenes. Speaking of which, the action scenes are incredible with the high lites, I beleive, to be the beginning with Nightcrawler taking on the secret sservice agents, and then the end fight scene between Wolverine and Deathstrike (played by Kelly hu who has seemed to have mastered the hot chick silent killer role).  That is not to say that the action scenes in between are mediocre.  In fact, its quite the opposite.  They are expertly done in every sense as well as unique.  There is a raid on the school in which you get a glimpse at other mutant powers, a jet chase where tornadoes are used as a defense, and a brief but well choreograhped and shot fight scene with Mystique and military guards.  There is a whole lot that I am leaving out, special effectwise and storywise, but then I will give out too much of the movie's story and which could in turn ruin the experience."

Freed from that necessity in the sequel, they just got on with the action. Really enjoyed it, and the repetition of showing more mutants eg Colossus, who'll hopefully get a proper look-in in the next film as Iceman has, was a good touch. I don't know how they pick them exactly, given the number of X-Men there must have been in the comics in 30 years!<br/><br/>It felt transitional, more than one character was developed further and the best touch was, super powers didn't solve everything, and one way the ending *could* have happened, and therefore the world would have been saved in Superman style, didn't. (No spoilers means you'll just have to watch it to see what I mean). Again, good. When X3 arrives, hopefully there'll be a few more mutant villains as the human mutant haters have been done twice now.

What annoyies me even further is that I like Daredevil comics much more than X-Men. But this movie is different.<br/><br/>In X-Men back in 2000, it was a good movie. The only flaw of that movie was that they spent too much time on origins and explaining the whole X-Men universe. This is a flaw with all other superhero movies, and it cannot be avoided.

"geckorion","Null","0","0","2 May 2003"," So good, people forgot about the Matrix trailer
","One would think that when a trailer for a movie gets a minute-long ovation, the following movie is doomed to unmet expectation. However, in the case of X2, people forgot the impending Matrix sequel and found themselves engrossed in probably the best comic superhero movie ever made (yes that includes all the Batmans, Supermans, Spider-man, Punisher, etc.).<br/><br/>What made this movie so special was not the special effects nor the high popularity of the X-men in print.  Rather it was the fact that the writing and consequently the acting in this movie far exceeded the first movie and most other action-genre films. How this franchise landed both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, I shall never know but I thank my lucky stars everyday that Singer got these two amazing actors, for it is Magneto and Professor X that all the other mutants get their strength (emotionally as well as physically).<br/><br/>Anyway, I will not give away the plot as I sometimes do in my reviews, because I realize how disappointing it is to know the end without being surprised or figuring it out on your own. What surprised me most about this movie is how so many competing love storylines were going on and how well they were written.  In action movies, and all movies for that matter, love triangles become incredibly cliched and unoriginal.  However, this movie manages to pull off all the jealousies and lusts even before relying upon shape-shifting and illusion.<br/><br/>Also may I say that I am glad that Jean Grey and Storm did something in this movie.  Cyclops still didn't, but he'll be gone by the next movie anyway (not a spoiler, just an opinion).  Grey and Storm were just really hot women in leather in the first movie, while Wolverine and Rogue commanded the entire story.  This movie had about three times as many characters and still managed to have many more deep, complex, inter-woven story paths to follow.<br/><br/>Now on to the special effects.  The opening Nightcrawler sequence is one of the most thrilling action sequences in recent years, again probably due to the lifting of the bar by, you guessed it--The Matrix.  Nightcrawler's unique abilty of transporting, is visually and audibly (his popping in and out of thin air sounded really cool)incredible.<br/><br/>My favorite improvement in this movement though has got to be the character of Mystique.  In the first movie she was one of the goons- a hot, shape-shifting goon- but completely lineless and characterless.In this movie she had depth (and lines) as well as way more impressive fight sequences. She was probably as important if not more than Magneto in this movie- I am not kidding.<br/><br/>Anyway this is going on long enough so I will leave you with this:  If you like the X-men, or action movies, or Sci-fi/fantasy you will probably love this.  If not you can probably at least find a reason that it was worth your $8.50."

X2 is much more intense than the first- and they answer many of the lingering questions you may have had after the first movie.

","I loved it!  I saw it opening night and myself and a sold out theater cheered and applauded throughout.  I think the trick here is being a fan to begin with. I've read a lot of comments by people who might be completely competent movie<br/><br/>reviewers, but can't possibly understand what this movie means to a comics fan, and particularly an X-men fan.   This movie delivers!   We get to see our<br/><br/>childhood heroes brought brilliantly to life, we get incredible fantasy action sequences, and strangely enough the dialogue is not lame and the characters<br/><br/>are not flat.  Far too often in CGI loaded adventures, as in the last two Star Wars tragedies or Daredevil, the director gets to playing with his bluescreen toys and forgets about everything else.  Not here.  Reminding me of why the original Star Wars trilogy succeeded where it's prequals failed, this movie has people in it, not just characters with names that encounter events and occasionally say<br/><br/>words to advance the action, but people, flesh and blood characters who are not interchangeable, despite some of them being buried in seven hours of make-up. This was my favorite comic series as a kid and I offer many thanks to director Singer, who could not have pulled this off so brilliantly if he weren't a fan himself. I'll say this:  If you are one of those that takes themselves so seriously that you can't lower yourself to be truly interested in superhero movies, you don't belong in the theater watching this one.  Despite its poignant social commentary, you won't be able to see the forest for the trees.  This film is for funlovers, and dreamers, and the open-minded.  It is better than almost all previous attempts at fantasy-action films, and  on a fairly equal par with Lord of the Rings. You may feel a little ""left out"" if you go with a Marvel Comics reader or sit too near a pack of the same, as we have ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" and private guilty pleasures at any<br/><br/>minute reference to a world that was fullly sculpted for us long ago in color illustration.  We love these guys, Wolverine, Prof X, Nightcrawler, even Magneto, and we're mainly hoping that what has been around for years and years will, in this new forum, be done justice.  We're all holding our breaths and hoping the Hollywood desire to cater to the lowest common denominator  to sell more<br/><br/>tickets won't mess up the continuity of the Marvel world or fail the characters. We go in with fingers crossed and hope they don't ""mess it up.""  And THIS,... THIS is one of the very few times that we don't get let down.  THIS is justice. THIS is success.  THIS kind of movie is one that I'll  be proud to own and watch a dozen times a year. If you haven't seen the first X-MEN movie, do yourself a favor and do so before plopping down in front of X-2.  It will help you. If you read X-men while growing up and you're hoping with fingers crossed<br/><br/>that this 2nd movie will be at least as good as the first, I bring you news of joy. This one, in my unhumble opinion, is better than the first.  It is full of rewards, it lacks compromise, and it has stuff in it that will leave you drooling for X-3.  We made it through another test.  We have another excellent movie to bow down to. Matrix Reloaded opens next week.  I've got my fingers crossed."

"chvylvr80","8","0","0","5 May 2003"," Blows the first one away
","X2 has everything that X Men lacked. Most notably this is more screen time and fight scenes for Wolverine. Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine and I can't see anyone else in the role. Nightcrawler is the coolest mutant (except for Wolverine) introduced so far and his teleportation ability is visually dazzling and helps him do things no other mutant can. Colossus's cameo is cool but he should have been given more scenes. Hopefully in X3 he will be given more. My only complaint is that the film runs a bit long and drags in some spots. A few cuts would have kept this movie tighter and more concise. The effects in this movie are spectacular and are one of the movie's greatest strengths. I hope that the X Men films just keep getting better. Bottom Line: This is a must see in the theater. You have to see it on the big screen and then do your duty as an American and buy it on DVD."
"Counter-Strike","7","0","0","5 May 2003"," Good but X1 was better
","While a lot of people are giving the theatres a miss due to the SARS scare, X2 was a show that I just had to watch on a big screen.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed...well, not that much anyways. X2 is a good show - the cast seemed to have more chemistry with each other (no less because most of them were cast from X1 reunited) and there were more action sequences. I was entertained throughout the show, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>However, what I thought made X1 great was missing in X2 - the human aspect of the X-Men. While X1 was wonderful because of the relationship between Rogue and Wolverine, X2 suffered because of the lack of such a relationship. It came close though, through Storm and Nightcrawler, but unfortunately, this relationship did not get the amount of time that was given to the earlier relationship.<br/><br/>Cast performance was not too shabby. While Hugh Jackman was decent, I somehow found his performance as Wolverine in the first installment better. To me, Wolverine epitomizes the devil-may-care attitude, besides brutal animal rage. While the latter was abundant in X2, Jackman as Wolvie in X2 was not so I-don't-give-a-damn. Perhaps this was due to the script. The person who stood out for me in X2 was Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. Despite the tons of blue make-up on his entire body, not to mention the coloured lenses, he was able to portray the sensitive soul within a gargoyle-like body that is Nightcrawler. Ian McKellen continues to improve in his role as Magneto - somewhat more sinister (and more vulnerable) in X2 and less angry, compared to X1.<br/><br/>On the whole, an enjoyable film on its own. As a sequel, it's not too shabby but I didn't think it was better than X1 (I'm betting that the Matrix sequels would be better than the original film though). Nonetheless, I look forward to further X-Men sequels, hopefully with better exploration of the human aspect of the mutants. I was thrilled on seeing Colossus...perhaps he'd become the focus of the next installment of the movie."

","Okay. . .the first X-Men was a little slow. But it was necessary. For those unitiated in the X-Men universe, there was the necessary character development and slow-moving storyline. X2 picks up where X-Men left off -- there's little, if any, deep character development but it gives X-Fans what they want -- action, action and more action. It reminded me of the first Star Trek movie. If you remember, it was kind of slow -- bringing everyone back up to speed on Star Trek and where are they now. Now, that was settled -- they unleashed ""Wrath of Kahn"" which absolutely kicked butt and took names.

The climax (in an underground dam) stretched on forever, and the film has at least six different endings. X2 showed the mark of too many writers trying to juggle too many characters.

"Ziman","Null","0","0","5 May 2003"," Good 2nd chapter in the X-men saga
","When we left the last story of X-men back in 2000, Wolverine had very little clue into the origins of his adamantium skeleton but was on a quest to find more Rogue had decided to make her home at Xavier's school of the gifted, and we had the benefit of meeting the further characters of Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Storm, Professor Xavier himself, and of course his arch nemesis Magneto.<br/><br/>After being introduced the characters of X-men from the 2000 movie, the story continues in this year's X2 with the addition and cameos of a few new characters.  <br/><br/>One such character is in the opening sequence.  We get introduced to Nightcrawler.  Born Kurt Wagner, this mutant turned to a life of a circus-freak side-show exhibit, but a bizarre twist turns him into a vigilante who has infiltrated the White House.<br/><br/>Logan's (aka Wolverine) story picks up where it left off in the previous chapter looking for some more clues at Alkali Base in Alberta where his fateful procedure' seemingly had taken place.<br/><br/>We further find Charles Xavier visiting his now captured enemy, Erik Lehnshherr (aka Magneto) in his custom built non-metal prison, and Rouge has found her place at Xavier's school in the arms of love interest, Bobby Drake (who goes by the alias Iceman).<br/><br/>These serve as a reminder of what was left for us to contemplate at the end of 2000's X-men while eagerly waiting this sequel, X2.  And now, with Magneto behind bars, there is new enemy to fear this man is William Stryker.  His motives parallels Magneto's from the first chapter... however instead of uniting the planet into a mutant population, Stryker sees fit to eliminate mutants entirely, and goes through the Washington as his first steps to do so.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action in X2 and the story is full of surprises that one might not necessarily expect.  There are also some very clever events that take place without revealing them here, suffice it to say, I found them to be pleasantly and interestingly thought out.<br/><br/>We got most of the character development in the first film, and this leans on our knowledge of that, with only a few subtle reminders.  I might have wished for more character development, but the realm of X-men is huge and the list of characters is too long to involve EVERYONE and still have a substantial story line, so I forgive it for that.   plus we DO get some good insight into Nightcrawler, who seems to be the largest new character this time around.<br/><br/>Logan (Wolverine) doesn't seem to be as sarcastic as he was the first time maybe he's learning to adjust to the ways of mutant life.  But I also had wished for more banter between him and Scott Summers (Cyclops) but that is also justified near the end.<br/><br/>X2 is definitely worth the price of admission, but I would say that a review of the first film on DVD is worth a watch before going to X2 for nothing more than the affect of continuing the story."
"Silverzero","Null","0","0","5 May 2003"," Fabulously stylised, superior sequel to a terrific predecessor.
","`X2' is the fourth in line in this new series of movies, revitalising the old comic strip superhero genre. It began with big hits like `Superman' and `Batman' along with smaller ones such as `The Punisher' and `The Flash'. After `X-Men', `Spider-Man' and `Daredevil' comes this, which is the best of them so far. This means that the ones still to come such as `The Hulk' and `Spider-Man 2' have big shoes to fill. `X2' beats out all of the mentioned films in nearly every way. <br/><br/>With so many characters, the film is continuously compelling and they are all equally likeable. The performances are standard, as expected. There are some clashes of acting styles that sometimes tend to get in the way. There's the royalty of Sirs Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, the teenage kitsch of Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore, and the mainstream styles such as Halle Berry and James Marsden. This mixed bag works surprisingly well as an ensemble cast rather than a group of individuals. <br/><br/>Stewart and McKellen are right on the mark, bringing the film some class. Hugh Jackman was the best choice for the part of Wolverine and does his part just as well as he did the first time. Famke Janssen looks the part and does a pretty good job as the sultry seductive Jean Grey. Likewise for hubby Cyclops played by James Marsden. He doesn't get a lot of time on the screen but ironically develops more. Anna Paquin doesn't get much of a chance to do much else other than stand in the background. That's a shame because she was brilliant in the first one as the vulnerable action chick. The rest of the performances from the likes of Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Kelly Hu, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming and Halle Berry are good aswell. It's a shame that Tyler Mane and Ray Park couldn't return because they were great in the first one. But the word on the street is that they've signed on for X3 so all is forgiven.<br/><br/>
In the high tech world of today, it's expected that the visual effects in movies should be top class. X2 goes as far as to push the limits of computer generated possibilities. The effects are a consistent treat for the eyes and there are even some really cool camera angles. The final third is made up of the climactic fight scenes. It all boils down to a shockingly tragic conclusion. However, if you've read the comic, you'd know that there is a shimmering light at the end of the tunnel. <br/><br/>X3 will have to be absolutely outstanding in order to surpass this. With cool characters, superb visuals, a great cast and good subplots, is quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made. It doesn't fall flat under the weight of its some 15 characters or large numbers of subplots. My IMDb rating: 8.3/10."
"johnnysugar","10","0","0","5 May 2003"," Another fantastic comic-book adaptation
","""X-Men"", one of Marvel Comic's most popular titles, contains 40 years of plot lines and a dizzying array of characters.  For a director to take on a legacy so vast was a challenge, and Bryan Singer delivered a solid adaptation in 2000's ""X-Men.""  Much like the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher ""Batman"" franchise, Singer's ""X-Men"" universe divorced itself from the comics' plot and structure while remaining true to the essence of the material.  Characters' relationships and origins were changed or adapted, but in the end, their personalities and interactions remained intact.  I'm glad to say that more of the same love Singer has shown in the past, without giving in to fanboy adherence, has yielded another fine comic book film in ""X2: X-Men United.""<br/><br/>The film begins with a blue-skinned, devilish-looking mutant named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) teleporting into the Oval Office, attempting to assassinate the President of the United States.  He fails and vanishes, leaving behind a knife with the message ""Mutant Freedom Now.""  Xenophobic and opportunistic military general William Stryker (Brian Cox) uses the attack to propel his mission forward: the eradication of all mutants.  Aided by his enigmatic assistant Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), Stryker raids the Xavier School for the Gifted, rounding up as many mutants as he can.  The attack forces the X-Men -- including Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) -- to team up with their enemy Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) and his shape-shifting partner Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) to fight Stryker's plot.<br/><br/>The action and special effects of ""X2"" are above it's predecessor in every way.  They are more seamlessly integrated into the film while maintaining their visual flare.  That's a good thing, since virtually all of the characters in the film possess some mutant power that facilitates a special effect.  This reliance on effects sometimes comes at a cost to script and story, but even this is still very well-done, true to the film's origins, and superior to the vast majority of recent comic book films (""Bulletproof Monk"", ""Batman & Robin"", ""Daredevil"").<br/><br/>The film has a fantastic ensemble of actors, many of whom have seen their roles from the first film increased significantly.  While this is a great chance for Janssen to become more than a pretty doctor and allows Romijn-Stamos to slink and slide as the sexiest femme fatale in recent memory, Halle Berry wastes her role as Storm with too many weak line readings.  Although it is to her credit that she wisely decided not to try an accent this time around, she lacks the gravity and authority that comes with the character.  Among the other new faces, Cumming is wonderful, and Hu is a marvel to behold when Deathstrike is given reign to let loose.  Cox proves again why he was the original Hannibal Lecter (in ""Manhunter"") in a fantastic performance that does not easily slip into melodrama or caricature.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking part of the film is the ending, which I will not give away here.  ""X2"" ends with a moment that will have fans familiar with the comics' history nervous with anticipation for the next film...and gives them the job of explaining it to those who are not.  <br/><br/>All in all, I can't think of a better way to begin the 2003 summer season of films.  ""X2"" is a thrilling, dark, action-filled spectacle with moments of genuine emotion and depth.  A must for any comic fan or fan of fantastic cinema.  9 out of 10."

","I own the ""X1"" DVD almost entirely because I'm a big ""Marvelist"", I never thought of it as a very good movie like Spider-Man in my opinion was. X2 is an entirely different story. I went in expecting another simple-plotted and mediocrely directed (yet more or less faithful to the comics) movie, but I got much more than that. First of all I think the Director Bryan Singer did a far better job on this sequel. The script was much more in depth and the new characters were all excellently performed, excluding Pyro whose actor I found annoying. The action was great and inventive, and I think that anyone saying that this movie wasn't faithful enough to the comics needs to wake up, what's the point of telling the exact same stories in the exact same way again? All the characters were more or less as they were in the comics, and that's really all that matters to me.<br/><br/>I generally dislike the concept of sequels, as they often tend to, well, suck, partially ruining the potentially good name of the original movie. This time I can't help making an exception and I'm actually looking forward to X3 and knowing Hollywood, I'm sure I will get it. The world of Xmen basically has an infinite amount of stories waiting to be told on the big screen.<br/><br/>Great movie, with only a couple of boring bits. 4.5/5 stars, and that's like a full fiver for a film of this type. :)"

","X-2 is one of the better sequels in town, and considering the strength of the first, that's saying something.  It borrows the strengths of the first -- amazing visual effects, screenplay balanced between action and humor/character development -- and improves on them. Brian Cox (who I just saw on video in ""Nuremburg"") has to be one of the great villainous actors of today.  He so practical and singleminded in his villainy that he is fun to watch.  So many of his kind get boring to watch because they're always overacting. Alan Cumming was surprising as a superhero.  I knew he was a good actor, but well, he really stole the show at times!  I can't wait to see more of him. The rest of the gang, Brotherhood and X-men alike, were all outstanding, and better than the first movie.  Mystique's taking initiative was especially fun to watch since we so rarely get to see a secondary character making a plan equal to one the big boys would think up. Hugh Jackman is brilliant as Wolverine.  I agree with those who say he IS Wolverine.  I appreciate that bit of eye candy for the ladies, and can see why so many of the female characters have a bit of a thing for him.  He really is the consummate ""bad boy."" The guy we most need to thank for bring us these two hours + of pure entertainment is the one and only Bryan Singer.  He's done a wonderful job of bringing the X-men to the big screen.  (And though another comment mentioned that the trailer for Matrix made this film seem less in comparison, I also watched the trailer for Hulk...) **Thank you, Bryan Singer!

In this one they showed that all of the characters had the ablity to be as good as wolverine,especially Jean Grey, she was twenty times better than she was in the original, and they use her to set up another sequel which i think will be better than this one and the first one.  This film while larger in som aspects was less epic than the first, at least i feel it was smaller because of the ending mainly.  In the first we saw the big new york scene which was awesome, but in this one se were in a damn in the middle of nowhere.  But aside from that this movie was much better.  The script to me seemed a lot smarter than the previous films, note the escape by magneto, one of the best scenes in the movie, and all of the character development that went on, every character in the story changed or had some conflict in the film.<br/><br/>This was probly the most well thought out and well executed super hero movie to come out since the original Batman.  My only complaint was the previews before the film, they showed a 2.5 minute long clip from the Matrix:Reloaded which was cool and everything but it just made X-Men not look as good, but hey the Matrix would make anything but Thr Return of the King look bad.8.5/10"

","As a fan of the Xmen comics and cartoons, I enjoyed and was for the most part happy with the first installment to the Xmen movies, When I saw the first I felt satisfied and happy that the Xmen I had for so long wanted to see taken to live action on the big screen done right. Well, as with most sequels I was weary and wasn't expecting much I admit. Well, what I was given was something I wasn't expecting, a much better movie and depiction of the Xmen characters than the first. This is a FANTASTIC movie and much better than the first in so many ways that I didn't even think of from the first. Hugh IS Wolverine, enough said!! Even Halle does a much better job with Storm. Alan as Nighcrawler was the absolute best choice, he is fantastic, steals the show. This fan thanks you so much Bryan Singer, no one could have done it better. Thank You for making the second even better than the first. I still am so Xcited about the movie and can't wait to go see it again and I defiantly am going to see it again. It's ALL good!! Can not wait for the next installment in the Xmen movies. Please Mr. Singer stay with us , I have total faith in you!"

","This movie exceeded my expectations. Watching the cartoons as a kid I always loved the X-Men and when the first movie came out I was really excited. The first movie was great but this one is outstanding. The special effects are ausome ranging from Nightcrawlers teleportation, to the scenes with the X-Jet. This film was more humorous and gave better insight into the characters than the first one. The only reason why this is not going to be the best movie of 2003 is because this year is going to be the best in movie history. With T3 and the new Matrix movies X2 has some tough competition. This movie is highly recomended to anyone who likes good movies."

","This is one sequel that so far surpasses its original that the concept is mind blowing.  There are so many characters in this film that it's an absolute delight to watch.  I didn't grow up reading the X-Men comics but was familiar enough with the characters (mostly by name) that I was in awe of who all showed up.<br/><br/>The special effects are obviously crucial in a film of this sort & X2 does not disappoint.  This may be the finest comic book-to-film ever!  While I was hoping the film Iceman would have been (in appearance) more like the comic book/cartoon version, it was still really good.  The characters of Nightcrawler, Mystique & Colossus have the best special effects & Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is fantastic in this film.<br/><br/>All of the major characters, Hugh Jackman (of course), Alan Cummings, Famke Janssen (especially), Brian Cox, Kelly Hu, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Anna Paquin & even Halle Berry - who was god-awful in the first film - turned in fantastic performances in this film.  <br/><br/>If I could make one complaint about this movie ... it ended too soon.  I could have watched another hour of film and not been disappointed.  It has an ending I certainly did not expect, but it does remain true - I think - to what happens to specific characters in the comics.  <br/><br/>A great, great movie - worth seeing more than once!"

In the midst of it all, maverick mutant Wolverine begins to slowly piece together his mysterious past. Endless special effects and exciting action sequences make it fun to watch, but the story isn't strong enough to hold up to them and overstuffed with silly humor.

"MovieMusings","Null","0","0","4 May 2003"," the franchise is growing
","There used to be a time when the word ""sequel"" was anathema, but these days we've come to expect the sequel to be better. While a few sequels of late have been throwbacks to that previous era when they were poor, the recent trend has been that the sequels are better, and such is definitely the case here with X-men 2.<br/><br/>If you actually read Marvel comics and know ""the X-Men"" story/characters, you'd enjoy some of the nifty things that were tossed into this movie (may be considered SPOILERS by some, but check out LebowskiT1000 comments, especially his PS notes...)<br/><br/>This movie was pretty good. My personal incling is that Xavier is a tad naive and foolish, because his students seem far too docile when he could have quite the army at his disposal (for example, -- again,  possible spoiler -- Iceman really only made one contribution to their struggle throughout the entire movie, hardly a ""superhero"" but perhaps they were somewhat influenced by the fragile ""becoming"" concept they developed with Spider-man).<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is good, the action is good, and it has been released at a good time (before Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, which are far darker, less feel-good movies but will land with a more resounding thud in the action/tension category).<br/><br/>One interesting note - Derrick Dunn (IcebergGucci21@aol.com) mentioned that this movie has become his favourite sequel, replacing Blade 2 as his favourite comic book sequel. I find this interesting...and here's why...<br/><br/>For those who loved The Matrix, watch Blade 1 which was released before it, and you'll see very clearly that some of our most beloved and copied ""Matrix scenes"" (the fashion, the bend-backwards-to-avoid-bullets, etc) were in fact ripped from Blade 1, yet it gets no credit for it...??<br/><br/>So, as my wife and I walked out of the theatre after watching X-Men 2, I commented that the plot followed the Blade 2 concept of the good guys and bad guys having to mistrustingly join together to fight a more lethal common enemy that threatens them both. Again, Blade 2 continues to be a key influence/trendsetter on major action flicks, and chances are that, again, X-Men 2 may be remembered for it while Blade 2 is forgotten...why? I dunno, but I see a pattern here.<br/><br/>(for those who haven't seen them, trust me, Blade 1 and 2 are about the best most-underrated comic book action films ever made - in fact, I didn't read a lot of either series, but the screenplay in Blade is absolutely sumptuous, you can see clearly it is a comic-turned-live, it's so well-done).<br/><br/>In closing, yes, X-Men 2 was fun, some heavy characters had short scenes (Colossus was awesome, and is BEGGING for more screen time!), but overall it was a real blast.<br/><br/>X-Men 3 should be a real blast, can't wait!"
"vidog316","10","0","0","4 May 2003"," Just What a Sequel Should Be!! (Pay attention to the end)
","X2 is exactly what a sequel should be. It does not get caught up in the hype of audience anticipation or a huge budget to produce a special effect bonanza with no story. Instead, Bryan Singer remains with the excellent formula that made X-Men a great success. X2 remains a plot based movie that includes special effects and fight scenes only when needed. Everything that was established in X-Men is fed off of or improved upon in X2. Mystique plays a much more significant role in this movie compared to the originial. The story of William Stryker basically attemtping to detain and kill all mutants works much better than the original of Magneto attempting to turn humans into mutants. I cannot even begin to describe the amount of excitement I had coming into the movie, and the amount of joy and happiness I had coming out of it. Not only is it superior to the excellent original movie, but it is by far one of the best movies you will see all year. The sequences in between the fight scenes or action scenes are well developed and add a great deal of importance to the movie. Be sure to pay particular attention to the closing monologue, as well as the image emerging from the water. I have been told that that will have a significant impact on the events of X3. Great cast with Hugh Jackman and the absolutely gorgeous Famkee Janssen (more significant in this movie, although not much more screen time) leading the way. The new mutants are fabulous and Colossus and Wolverine's rampage through the Mutant Academy was one of the best scenes I have ever seen. High recommended<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","I just got back to my apartment after seeing this movie, and I'm still on a high from it.  I think this sequel gets that rare distinction of being better than the first.  Everything was right on target with this movie. Since there were fewer character introductions, the audience is treated with a much faster paced movie with more action and even more impressive special effects.  I don't want to go into detail so as not to ruin anything for those who haven't seen the movie.  On that note, I must say the trailers of this movie were excellent by virtue of the fact that there was plenty to see in the movie that was not in the trailers.  Anyway, back to the actual movie...  If you're a fan of the comics, you will really enjoy this movie. It has plenty of plot turns that remind you of why you love the comics so much.  I'd like to keep this vague since one of my favorite things about X2 is that I had (purposely) known very little about it prior to seeing it.  So go see it now.  I mean it...NOW!"

It almost gets boring, but luckily, just when I was about to give hope on this movie, it does a turnaround and gives us ONE HECK of a good ending.

Also, the fight between Lady Deathstrike and Wolverine was pretty cool.

Since the first movie focused on introducing the X-Men to us, this movie was able to concentrate on the story a little more. Not only is society up in arms, thanks to the government's negative spinning on the situation, but we didn't really think that the plastic jail would hold Magneto for long did we?!

The Deathstryke fight is a major highlight of this one.<br/><br/>With all the different characters, some suffer from lack of development. That being said, the fact that there is character development is a testament to Brian Singer's abilities as a writer and director. The film is an excellent balance between effects and drama, character and spectacle, and action and introspection. The scene at Iceman's home is a perfect example of this balance, with a little of everything.<br/><br/>Brian Cox' portrayal of the villian Stryker is the standout performance of X2.

"JAKastner","9","0","0","3 May 2003"," The Moose Hole - Review of X2: X-Men United
","The beginning of the summer season always seems to open with a bang. In years past, the first major blockbuster film of the summer didn't open until Memorial Day weekend but times have changed. The first weekend of May has become the starting point now and Spider-Man solidified that with its $114.5 million opening weekend last year. This year presents another comic-book adaptation, X2: X-Men United, a sequel to the 2000 hit, X-Men. Comic book adaptations seem to be the huge rage now with past films like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Daredevil being such box office successes. But X2 is presented with a slight problem. X-Men did have a big opening weekend but started to really slow down after that with some movie-goers being disappointed. Obviously the marketing of the film will prevent X2 from being a failure at the box office but will the sequel disappoint fans like its predecessor or will an evolution occur in the movie-going experience?<br/><br/>The story picks up where the last film left off with Magneto in jail and Professor Xavier and his X-Men fighting to protect both human and mutant kind. This time around, though, the war between mutants and the rest of humanity seems growing closer as moves made by certain people have created conflicts that will become bigger as time goes on. Due to recent events including the attempted assassination of the president by a mutant, William Stryker has sent a crew to invade Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted. But he isn't after the children. He has bigger plans involving all mutants on the planet. Now the X-Men must join up with Magneto and his group to fight for a more peaceful world. The story for X2: X-Men United was very well done but there are many elements that the normal movie-goer would not understand but a big fan of the comic-book series would. But those elements are to be expected with most comic-book adaptations like X2. This was also a problem with Daredevil, which was released in February.<br/><br/>The cast was fabulous once again and much of the returning cast seems to be more comfortable with their rules then they were in the first film. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Plain and simple. Jackman proves that the role was meant for him and does it magnificently. Patrick Stewart is great once again as Professor Charles Xavier, the head of the School for the Gifted. He isn't included in as many scenes as last time but still plays an essential part in the film. Ian McKellen sends chills up backs as Magneto. He plays him so well that you would actually believe he is that character much like he did with the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series. Out of the new members of the cast, Alan Cummings is the shining light playing the role of Nightcrawler. Cummings presents much emotion to a character that you would expect to be placed in a film for special effect purposes rather then character development.<br/><br/>Overall, X2: X-Men United is a huge leap from the somewhat disappointing original. Close to perfection, there are some things to pick at. There were some members of the cast that seemed to be pointlessly placed in the film. Among those would be Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike. Her character was almost pointless outside of the fight at the end with Logan. The role of Cyclops seemed to be pointless as well in this film as he was not scene almost at all except at the very beginning and at the end. There were a lot of action sequences but maybe a little too much. Eliminating one or two of the sequences would have been fine. They weren't bad, there just seemed to be too much thrown at the audience in two hours. And the ending, though magnificently done, will confuse many movie-goers not familiar with the comic-book or cartoon series. But maybe a better explanation will be shown in X-Men 3. The summer begins with a bang and if others films turn out like X2, we are in for one Hell of a summer.<br/><br/>My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5"

","X2 is very well done! I was an avid watcher of the cartoon way back when and my fiance an avid reader of the comic. They did a pretty good job of following the comic but in the spots where they didn't follow the comic is becomes evident later as to why they didn't. The special effects are great! Even though Mystique is a ""bad guy"" I liked the fact that she had more screen time in this one. The special effects for Nghtcrawlers teleportation were great. And by the way for the ones who said he is satanic, he is not satanic. IF you read any of the stuff on the web sit or the comics you will find that he is deeply religious. It was a church that Jean Grey and Storm found him in and I believe there were gargoyles in the church which are believed in many cultures to ward off evil. I believe also nightcrawler is Hungarian and it is common for people of the hungarian culture to be religious.<br/><br/>During the last few minutes for any one who read the comic you will be able to tell that they are setting up for the Dark Phoenix Saga. Especially when they show the large bird like shape in the water at the very end.<br/><br/>It is unique to see them having to be allies in order to defeat a greater threat!"
"grendelkhan","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," An excellent film, sequel or not.
","X2, or X-Men 2, if you like, would be an outstanding film, even if it weren't a sequel.  You do not need the first film to enjoy this one, but it does add flavor and detail.  The story is good, and the characters do get their moments to shine, although sheer weight of numbers undercuts some of the focus.<br/><br/>The original cast picks up where they left off, with Halle Berry getting a stronger role (Oscar influence, no doubt) and Hugh Jackman continues to dominate.  The Rogue/Iceman romance gets a little more development, but gets lost in the third act.<br/><br/>There are plenty of new additions to the cast, the most welcome are Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, Nightcrawler; and Brian Cox as William Stryker. Cumming continues his scene stealing streak in movies as the outcast Nightcrawler, a mutant who can't hide what he is.  He carries a devout faith that sees him through his troubles.  Stryker, in contrast, carries a deep hatred that drives his actions.  Where Senator Kelley feared mutants (in the first film), Stryker wants to see them destroyed.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer has again done justice to one of the most popular and complex comics of the more recent era.  He has distilled the finer points of the X-Men lore into the framework of the film, but has given it a unique cinematic showcase.  The film can be enjoyed by longtime fans and newcomers, who have no idea that Wolverine is missing his mask.<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>While Wolverine is in Canada, searching for clues to his past, the president is attacked in the Oval Office.  Stryker uses this emergency to set in motion an attack on Xavier's school.  The X-Men must regroup and stop Stryker.  Wolverine learns more about his past, and something is happening to Jean Grey.<br/><br/>The film nicely sows the seeds for the next film, one that if comes to fruition, may make X-Men fans very happy.  Even if it doesn't, we have a nice pair in these X films.<br/><br/>There are some nice nods to the comic fans, some very subtle, some quite overt.  Hopefully, some will be explored in the future, possibly by Bryan Singer. Either way, this is worth the price of admission."

Nightcrawler makes his first appearance has a new member of the xmen in superb fight scenes. he adds something to the xmen which it was lacking. and his relationship with storm makes her character more interesting unlike the first film.<br/><br/>also what i liked about this film is the unexpectedness me and my friend have come up with hundreds of ways this film could have gone and i never ever imagened that the writers would use ""the phenix"" storyline which leads to jean grays death (or is she) this is what i cant wait for in xmen 3.<br/><br/>patrick stuart is amazing has ever has prof x.<br/><br/>Brian Cox is evil (not has evil has magneto) has ever.<br/><br/>hugh jackman is brilliant has wolverine whos character i think has been milked a bit but everyone loves logen.<br/><br/>all round star cast could never have been better in a million years.<br/><br/>one critazise must be the lack of iceman he is amazing and is left out the end sequence but does have a god story line with rogue.<br/><br/>10 out of 10<br/><br/>couldnt have imagined it been better."

","I was lucky enough to see the movie the night before it opened in NYC thanks to K-Rock. This movie was incredible. It was more of an action flick than the first one, but sooooooooo worth it. It has one of the best opening sequences Ive ever seen in a movie....it concerns Nightcrawler and the President. Very cool stuff. Also you see more of the uses of the various powers in this one. Everyone uses it that much more than in the first one. And for those of you out there who heard it or the rumors: Gambit is NOT in this movie...though his name is. You see his real name, Remy LeBeau, on a computer screen in one of the sequences. This movie kind of reminded me of Empire Strikes Back in some ways. It left so many doors opened at the end of the movie for X3. The ending has a real surprise to it and paves the way for, in my opinion, was one of the best sagas in the X-Men history. Hugh Jackman absoluetly rocked as Wolverine. I was a little disappointed in the first on in that he always seemed to get his ass kicked. He tears people up in this one in true Wolverine fashion. Magneto was amazing in this movie too. He seems to become a real bad guy at the end of the movie. People have said oh the first one was better, this was crap blah blah blah. I thought it was great and was an incredible sequel. Definetly check this movie out if you're an X fan."
"Samuraipanda","10","0","0","2 May 2003"," Mostly for the fans
","I was one of the lucky few who got to see this movie on an early screening, and boy did it pay off. The estimates of this film, as a Marvel fan in general, were high. Spending the last couple of months browsing through various teasers and trailers, I finally got to see the full movie.<br/><br/>The story takes off roughly a couple of years after the incidents that occurred in the first movie. Wolverine has left his fellow mutants to dig up his past, and other mutants have joined Xavier and his X-Men to learn how to control their mutant powers. Some of these new mutants are Iceman, Pyro and you also get to see Colossus for a brief moment.<br/><br/>The main villain from the first movie, Magneto (Ian McKellen) is stuck in a plastic prison, with severe control checks for metals every so often. It seems as if nothing bad can happen... right?<br/><br/>The actors do their thing, and the acting is, safe to say, better than in the first movie. The only trouble the common man might have is that the movie is more aimed at the real fans of the comic books, and it features less action than the first movie. It still has, I'd think, some entertainment value for everyone, but only fans will appreciate 'every' scene of pure mutant goodness! Bryan Singer and his crew have done a great job, and I for one would like to see a third movie in the series."

"amontagu","8","0","0","2 May 2003"," The series has evolved...
","After the character establishment that was the first movie now comes the serious work of getting down to the nitty gritty.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the casting of Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler was spot on. He vies with Wolverine as who is going to steal each scene the most. I thought Wolverine was great in the first one and that nobody could capture their character so well (though most of the others do a bloody good job too) but along comes Cumming and knocks me for six!<br/><br/>Not a bad story, though Marvel purists will notice that they have taken liberties with certain characters (but then, don't we always? ;-) ). But even as somebody who can spot these admittedly geeky flaws (or maybe not flaws per se but shall we say, continuity lapses), I was blown away.<br/><br/>I can't imagine them not doing an X3 but with such a cast on-board it's going to be tough to get them all together again, especially when somebody like Rebecca Romjin-Stamos admitted she didn't want to do it because of the make-up but had to because she had signed a contract. In the end I think she admitted that she enjoyed it, if only because Cumming had to suffer too and misery loves company.<br/><br/>I doubt she would do another if she doesn't have to. Which would be a shame but not the end of the world.<br/><br/>All in all a great action film and still the undisputed champion of Comic-to-film conversions."

","Don't get me wrong from the summary, I thought the film was going to be really good, but it was better than really good. It was...erm...really, really good!<br/><br/>The new characters were really good, especially with Pyro being a bad guy good guy, which I think everyone could relate to. I mean if you could manipulate fire and someone had a gun pointed at you, you would burn them all wouldn't you? Iceman and Rogue were good (even if I did expect Rogue to be a bit more part of the action than she was). Nightcrawler was good, and the opening sequence with the assassination attempt was the best bit of the film, and one of the greatest uses of CG I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Wolverine was kick-ass! When the troopers were storming the Institute and Wolvie just went sick on them was brilliant. Magneto was...Magneto, which will always make me happy. His escape from his prison was absolutely brilliant. Manipulating the iron in the guards blood? Who woulda thunk?<br/><br/>The direction of Jean Grey's character pleased me, and the faintest outline of the phoenix at the end almost gave me goosebumps! I can't wait to see how they pursue that in the 3rd installment.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant movie, probably the best superhero one ever. 8.8/10"

"rohan_g","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," And the show goes on
","May contain a spoiler!!!<br/><br/>As someone who doesn't like cartoons and comic books, I tend to avoid movies such as X-men. Nevertheless, X1 was the only movie left on the DVD shelf, so I decided to watch it. Needless to say, I really enjoyed the movie therefore I had to catch X2. <br/><br/>X2 would have to be one of the most thought provoking science fiction movies to have ever been made. Most science fiction movies tend to concentrate on issues such as freedom and liberties years from now. To my knowledge I have never known a science fiction movie to tap into the current issues. For example the Mutant Registry Act is based on John Ashcroft's Terrorism Registry.  <br/><br/>Per se the acting and special effects were brilliant, nevertheless, they could have compressed the action into a shorter time frame. As it is no secret that X3 is on its way, they could have modified the ending. For example the movie should have concluded, at the White House, when professor Xavier said, ""We'll be watching you"". All aside, I really enjoyed the performance of Mystique, Magneto and Professor Xavier. I was kind of disappointed with Lady Deathstrike, as her part was kept to the bare minimum.  <br/><br/>If and when they decide to make X3 I hope they can combine some of elements of the previous two movies. I also hope that X3 is shorter and more action packed. If they manage to combine the right acting, plot, and the special effects, X3 should do extremely well. <br/><br/>I'll give the movie a 7 out 10. However the mysterious Mystique deserves a 10 out 10."
"budmassey","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," A typical mid-series sequel that accomplishes everything it should.
","I admit it. I was waiting at the theatre when it opened to see this one. The first episode was refreshing, powerful and deeply symbolic.  A bad guy who was a Holocaust survivor, a telepathic scientist denied the use of his body, and so on.  What I liked best about it was that instead of ""mutant"" you could substitute ""black"", ""gay"", ""jew"" or any number of traits, visible or not, which make unwilling superheroes of anyone who deals with the prejudice such traits engender.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed.  This episode accomplishes exactly what it must.  It deepens old characters, introduces new ones, and creates enough loose ends to get us excited about the finale.  Remember The Empire Strikes Back? Surely the weakest of the Star Wars trilogy, but entirely successful in its objectives.  <br/><br/>From the first scene, in which a tattooed, teleporting, devil-tailed, psalm-chanting, German-accented Nightcrawler (Allan Cumming, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion) make his stunning entrance, X2 works on every level. In the spirit of the Lord of the Ring mid-sequel, not a second is wasted explaining why Magneto (Ian McKellen, Gods and Monsters) is locked up in a plastic prison, or why mutants are split into two camps with equally brilliant and powerful leaders, one fighting for equal rights and the other for Mutant Power.<br/><br/>But before we get all enraptured by the flash, and you will, take time to consider the subtle brilliance of this film.  It cannot be mere coincidence that Magneto is imprisoned in a plastic prison that recalls the underground cell of another evil genius, Hannibal Lechtor?  Why not?  Check the cast. Brian Cox, here as the twisted human ex-Army commander Stryker, was the first to portray Dr. Lechtor back in Michael Mann's ham-handed Manhunter, long before Sir Anthony even read the script for Silence of the Lambs.  And if X2 lacks the grace and warmth of Sam Raimi's masterpiece, Spider-Man, it makes up for it in irony and insight. <br/><br/>The beauty of all superheroes, and the source of their authenticity, is their vulerability.  For all their superpowers, X-Men are most appealing when they are human and flawed.  Wolverine's ( Hugh Jackman, Kate and Leopold) tormented longing to know his past, and the dangerous passion he feels for Dr. Jean Grey strike a pleasing balance to his rough and gritty exterior.  Nightcrawler's invasion of the White House, scored by the powerful strains of Mozart's ""Requiem"", contrasts beautifully to his vulnerable self-mutilation and Psalm-chanting.<br/><br/>OK, so I really liked the face-off between Wolverine and Stryker's lacky Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), but it is the gentler moments, and I can't even tell you about them without ruining the movie for you, that make this movie work. But you need some teasers, so here goes.<br/><br/>One of the main characters dies, I think.  Maybe not.  We'll have to wait for the finale to be sure.  Magneto is more complex than you might have imagined, and together with Mystique, he is bad to the bone.  One character, looking uncannily like Brad Dourif from the Exorcist III, renders a great performance without ever saying a word.  Someone will leave the Xavier camp for Magneto's side.  You can never go home.  And, just to make sure you see it ASAP, The Cyclops/Wolverine/Dr. Grey triangle will be resolved once and for all.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the third episode."

","I've read some of the other user comments with people complaining there wasn't enough action in this movie. Setting aside the fact that there were some action packed scenes, this movie foremost about storytelling. Any true comic book fan knows the stories of the X-men and in order for this movie to advance the overall story, those stories must be told. I liked the fact that this movie provided more insight to certain characters than the first. Although I do agree some characters were underused (Cyclops, Rogue). The only other thing I would've liked to see is a few more opportunities for Wolverine to get in wisecracks (Hugh Jackman plays the role so well). If you are looking for non-stop action, you won't find it here. But if you want a solid, compelling story intermixed with some action, then look no further. X3 should be interesting."

","The long awaited X-men 2 was a little disappointing yet also brought other characters to life which was an asset to the movie and therefore worth watching.<br/><br/>Summary: **some spoilers**<br/><br/>An assassination attempt on the president by a mutant puts the security on high alert on the mutant ""problem"". Storm and Jean are sent by Professor X to find the culprit introducing Nightcrawler, who could teleport himself but it turns out that he had no knowledge of what he had done. Professor X and Cyclops visit their old enemy Magneto in jail only find out that Magneto had spilt all the secrets of the school and Cerebro to someone and they get captured. Meanwhile Wolverine returns from his search and at the same time a man named William Stryker sets out a full launch attack against the school with a personal vendetta. The only one who can help them is someone they cannot trust. Wolverine finally meets his match and Professor X meets his own.<br/><br/>The younger generation of the mutants were more in focus in this movie. Rogue and the Iceman Bobby try to make their relationship work while Bobby has to finally come clean with the truth and tell his family about himself. A new friend of theirs named Pyro has a habit of burning things, Jean is having emotional issues with not just her powers but her heart and the only characters I liked in this movie were Nightcrawler and Mystique. The ending was weak, very weak and since that would ruin the entire movie I'm not going to go into details and I don't know why Wolverine always gets to fight with women all the time. Personally I liked the storyline between Wolverine and Jean and hoped for the better, but... I rest my review with that.<br/><br/>I rate the movie as a 8/10."

","When I go watch film like ""X2"" I come to it with no expectations. Anything more than that and I usually end up disappointed. The film wasn't bad. The comic fans will surely appreciate the efforts to bring in more of the original characters (even if just for a cameo appearance). The special FX are great, as should be expected. I was slightly turned off by the pace of the film: it could have been much more dynamic. And I guess the biggest disappointment for me (personally) was the almost non-existent role of Kelly Hu as Deathstrike. While hyped up in the commercials and TV specials, on screen she barely said two words, and had maximum of couple minutes of on-screen action. A pity, as I was looking forward to seeing this gorgeous girl in some hard-core ass kicking action.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad 7/10"

"Rogue Leader","Null","0","0","2 May 2003"," Breathtaking Sequel to a Brilliant Story!!!
","The first X-Men movie, back in 2000, was an unqualified success. Bryan Singer truly captured the spirit and meaning of the X-Men and their story and setting. The movie was as faithful to the comics as they could be. The movie even brought back good memories of the 1990's animated series. If it weren't for X-Men, we wouldn't have neither Spider Man nor Daredevil nowadays.<br/><br/>However, I won't deny that the first movie, just like the early comics played the story from a safe angle. The first movie was reasonably straightforward, with a decent ending, leaving the possibility for a sequel, although it was woefully short on time.<br/><br/>As of May 1st, I was unprepared for what was coming. And once again, this movie reminded me of every time a sequel blew me away completely. In the great tradition of Aliens, Toy Story 2, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, The Empire Strikes Back and the Godfather 2, X2 surpassed every expectation I could ever have! I think the theory that a sequel can never be as good as the original is pretty much ripped to pieces.<br/><br/>Director and Executive Producer Bryan Singer really took some big chances this time around. The story took an ambitious turn by adding layers and layers of complexity, which all come together revolving around this incredible villain, Dr. William Stryker. As in many comic editions and episodes of the animated series, I was cheering for the mutants.<br/><br/>Every actor pulled brilliant performances. Special praises to both Hugh Jackman and Famke Jamssen.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects were simply astonishing, ranking alongside Spider Man, Star Wars Episode II and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Tornado Sequence was beyond anything I've ever seen before.<br/><br/>And, to compensate for the first movie's lack of time, this one lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes. Not bad for a sequel!!! If I were Bryan Singer I would have extended it even further. I hope X3 has a duration of three full hours. I hope the DVD brings many and many deleted scenes.<br/><br/>There is so much more I could say, but it would last forever. I was wildly impressed with the movie's ending, leaving every thread unfinished. X3 is inevitable. I also have an idea what ground may be explored in a future adventure. Did anyone else notice the shadow of the Phoenix beneath the water?<br/><br/>I have to praise Stan Lee, Avi Arad, Jack Kirby, Chris Claremont, Ralph Winter, Lauren Shuller Donner, David Hayter, Tom DeSanto, Bryan Singer as well as the entire cast and crew of X2!! Brilliant effort!! Worth every minute!!!"

","At Xavier's School for Gifted Children things are returning to normal. But after a mutant plot to seemingly kill the president is foiled the world once again appears on the brink of destruction. Wolverine returns to the School after a fruitless quest to find his origins only to find a new nemesis plotting the demise of mutant kind. Stryker wants revenge against Xavier and will go to any lengths in order to achieve it. All the team is tested to the limits of their abilities. Some will rise up to the challenge and some will fall victim to the darkness of others. One will make the ultimate sacrifice only to be reborn from the ashes. With a rip roaring beginning we start off this second chapter in the X-Men saga. The effects and action sequences receive an adrenalin injection with some killer set pieces and a surprisingly dynamic and dramatic plot. The overall tone is darker and more foreboding than the original and bares the classic `middle-film-in-a-trilogy' feel. The production design is awesome. The direction and script are rock solid. Some may complain that it takes too long in between action sequences but I thought that during these dramatic moments the actors rally shine. All the characters line up like ducks in a row to have their `big moment', and with that I have my only minor gripe. The X-Universe is chock full with awesome characters, so unfortunately some of the character arcs suffer due to not enough space to tell their stories. But in the end that is the only beef I have and that can always be fixed by a whole slew of prequels and sequels. So watch, watch and watch some more. 9/10"

","It's a universal fact that usually sequels are an absolute mess in comparison to the originals. However I was surprised at how good X-Men 2 was, as it continued on where the first one left off.The introduction of Pyro and Kurt Wagner complemented the development of the ""good"" and the ""bad"" side. With Wolverine understanding in some way what had happened to him, you know that in time (if they make another movie) that he will learn the other elements to his personality that he can't yet tap into. How Rogue and Iceman go about showing each other affection makes interesting viewing as it shows that they can only ever get 'emotionally' involved! It was good to see that despite Magneto and Mystique having an angry side to them, they will still stand by other mutants in need. I'm curious to know what Dr Jean Grey's newfound power will be (again that's if they make another movie)<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie was the casting of Jean Grey and Scott Summers.

","My expectations for summer blockbuster sequels have been virtually destroyed<br/><br/>by recent summers which gave us watered down mush like ""MIB II"" and the<br/><br/>feeble Star Wars sequels. Besides, the original X-Men was just a good, if not fully realized, superhero movie. I probably would have been happy if the sequel merely lived up to the original.<br/><br/>Within the first 20 minutes ""X2"" establishes itself as that rarest of beasts: the sequel that surpasses its predecessor on virtually every point of comparison. If anything it's even truer to the comic, as a cigar-chomping Wolverine comes into his own with the kind of brief responses and one-liners his animated counterpart has spat out for years.<br/><br/>The newcomers are engaging, especially Nightcrawler, who opens the film with<br/><br/>an action sequence that is made truly breathtaking with rocket-fast camera work, imaginative editing and cutting-edge special effects. Everything I've read so far makes reference to this sequence and with good reason. There is nothing like<br/><br/>an action movie that grabs you by the throat from frame one.<br/><br/>We learn more about the returning characters from the first film and we get to see them interact in new ways, some not by choice but by necessity. We<br/><br/>understand more about what makes them who they are in a way that is<br/><br/>universal to anyone who's ever felt excluded or outside looking in. This is due mainly to absolutely top-notch acting from almost everyone. It's like nobody has told Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellan that they're in a comic book<br/><br/>movie and their line readings run the gamut from earnest to grave to brutally funny. I was starting to think Magneto was going to be sidelined for the film but when his moment in the sun arrives, McKellan is so good I actually was<br/><br/>cheering for him.<br/><br/>On that point, I'll just say that my audience was cheering, laughing, and<br/><br/>applauding throughout the film. Seattle audiences are desperately snooty and<br/><br/>we're quick to show our displeasure for cheese or lazy filmmaking (a la Star<br/><br/>Wars 1999-present) and all I can tell you is this film is a true crowd pleaser.

"mt7176","10","0","0","2 May 2003"," X2 follows through. (spoilers)
","X2 is a success largely in part because it decides not to follow the path of traditional comic book movie sequels and just reinvent itself every three or four years like the Batman franchise.  XMen is not Batman or Superman.  XMen from my past observations of the cartoon  always seem to be a sci-fi soap opera.  The director, who is very wise, decided to take that premise and provide us with a much larger picture turning the comic book franchise into a sci-fi epic similar to the original Star Wars Trilogy.  In the first film we are introduced to the main characters and there is a hint of a larger story.  The second film we move into the larger story and we find our heroes up to there necks in trouble.  Not to mention a beloved character is presumably lost only to be presumably reborn later on, much like Han Solo in Empire Strikes Back and Spock in the Wrath of Kahn.  <br/><br/>Does this make the film run the risk of being formulaic?  Well yes but comic books are formulaic to begin with.  What makes this interesting is that this film throws off the shackles of the comics' limitations and sets out to create an epic series of films and yet it maintains the inspiration and the spirit of this unique creation from Marvel.  <br/><br/>The one casualty of this view of film making is that sometimes beloved characters of the comics are not that dominant in the movie or just completely excluded.  Cyclops is in this film is in the beginning and at the end but he was widely excluded from the middle portion of the film.  The director used common sense and reasoned that if there was no need for a character in the scene then he or she needed not to be on screen.  Unlike the Batman Franchise or the Superman Franchise the story takes precedence over a character's screen time. The only thing that seemed to be taken from the Batman films was to make all the costumes black."

","The first X-Men film was a good movie, no doubt, but it was a very safe movie too.  Essential characters were introduced, the general premise was dealt out, and a little battle ensued at the end.  Now that we know the basics, it's time to really start the story.<br/><br/>At least I hope that's what they plan to do.  For those new to it all: X-Men began in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  Back then comics were simpler, geared more towards kids.  Story lines took place over multiple comic books infrequently, and things generally set itself right by the end of the issue. In other words, for the most part, it was episodic.  But when Chris Claremont took over as writer in 1975, things really started to get interesting, and, I must admit, complicated.  I often wonder how much he had planned out in advance.  Suffice it to say, by the time the Pheonix Saga got underway in the late 70's, there was no turning back.  X-Men became a soap opera.  A very complex science fiction soap opera at that.  And it seemed to grow in complexity as it went on.  The stakes got higher, more and more characters came in replacing old ones, more X-issues were spun off eventually climaxing in what is possibly one of the best superhero comic arcs out there: The Age of Apocalypse (1995ish).  It probably should have ended after that, but it didn't.  But what a great 20 years of comic book writing that was.  I would have never thought it possible to capture its epicness on film.<br/><br/>But with X-Men 2, it is clear that they have indeed upped the stakes.  The story is much bigger, the movie's much longer, there are many more characters, many more mini-plots, <br/><br/>**spoiler **<br/><br/>
and it ends with a cliffhanger!  (If you don't know what I mean, let me just say I think I saw a Pheonix rising right before the credits ran).  Needless to say I was thrilled, but also nervous.  Are they actually attempting the Pheonix Saga?  How far will they take it?  Will they actually have the wisdom to stop when it ends?  And more importantly, where will it end?  Most of the loose ends weren't tied up until 20 years (240 issues) later.<br/><br/>
** end spoiler **<br/><br/>The X-Men movies could be the greatest long running movie series in history, a pretty good trilogy, or a terrible disappointment.  If they manage to write a good long term story arc loosely based on the comics, and have the wisdom to stop the series when the story finishes, I'm sure Singer and most of the cast will see it through to its end.  To Hollywood I say the audience is hooked, our attention spans will last, don't worry about that.  Just don't give up the enthusiasm, and don't give up on these movies to soon.  I don't want this series to fade into mediocrity like Batman and Superman did.<br/><br/>This movie had great action, great special effects, great characters, great character development, and an incredible plot.  But a plot that is only great in the context of its sequels and prequel.  This is a good thing. Many would consider this a bad thing, but those are probably people that didn't like ""The Two Towers"" because it didn't stand on its own.  The epicness of the story arc is what got me hooked on the comics in the first place.  We have longer attention spans than you think, hollywood.  I think 3 more movies should be enough.  And don't be afraid to surprise us comic fans either.<br/><br/>Looking forward to X-Men 3.  Go see this movie!"

The performances are great, and Alan Cumming is more than perfect as Nightcrawler and really stands out.  All the returning characters have a lot more to do than just chat.  My only complaint is that Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oryama is hardly used at all in what is clearly a supporting role but is reduced to an extended cameo.  There are lots of little bits of x-trivia peppered throughout and I was glad to see that so many of the children at the school were given characters to play from the comic series that fans like myself would appreciate.  It's great fun and a lot of action. Nightcrawler's combination of teleporting and martial arts has to be seen to be believed.  Lots of fun."

","This is America and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but please, if you don't like this movie stick with reviews of the Ya Ya Sisterhood stuff and leave the rest of us alone. This is a kick butt movie for all of us that have ever read a comic book.  I may be old enough to remember the first Spiderman story, but I never thought I would see a movie capture the real feeling of reading a great comic book, at the movies.  I loved Batman, I loved Spiderman, but the action and atmosphere of this movie is so far the best.  People talk about gender gaps, but if they keep on putting out movies like this, I believe, American pop culture can transcend the generations. If you don't believe all that, then just go see it for fun."

","X2 really did well in my mind. It surpassed the first movie by having a more focused approach. By no means was it perfect, but it certainly played out in a way that wasn't Vin Diesel-esque, and for that I'm happy. Plus it's nice to see the gang again.<br/><br/>Some things to fix are Magneto's cheesy wear - he looked like one of the death star's commanders except even worse because of that stupid helmet and the cape. Storm is just bad, I can't stand her and the character is obviously going nowhere. Another thing was that they didn't really reveal anything about Wolverine's past so that sucked. As well, Jean Grey turned into Phoenix WAY too fast. It shoulda happened in the next movie, but what's done is done.<br/><br/>The next film should start to dive into the phoenix saga, and then the introduction of the mutant disease and time travel with cable, perhaps bishop too...and yes, apocalypse! :-)<br/><br/>Van Damme for Gambit...YEAH!"

","How does Hollywood take the same idea, with largely the same cast, when everyone has seen largely the same effects, in a genre like that's the same as last year's big Spidey success and the same as this year's coming Hulk success after an amazingly same sequel run as Batman and Superman before it and -- do the same thing again and have it be even better?  Well they've done it with X2 (even the title is better with its gender neutrality).  A fun summer flick way before summer (do they realize it's not even Memorial Day for another 24 days?) is here.  Then it ends and we actually want more of the same thing again right after we see more of the same thing again. It's good for 2X more X films - but lets hope they keep getting 2X better unlike the DC movies heretofore mentioned."

It advances the characters established in the original and gives them a greater challenge.  It also has new characters such as Nightcrawler to advance the plot.

","By successfully giving more of what the first film so desperately required, Bryan Singer's sequel to X-men is a frightening success. X2 picks up where the first film left off with a stack of new characters to spice things up and a more intriguing story to sit down to. From edge of you seat action scenes, to light yet tragic romance. X2 is the freshest example to date that can erase all past mistakes from it's predecessor, with a clear statement speaking out true potential in film sequels actually fulfilling everything it needs, in allowing follow-ups to be exciting. The real gem to be discovered here, is the in the depth realism every character has the ability to reveal in this movie. We get to see real emotion and truth from most of the leading cast precisely when it is to be expected in order not make the films heart throbbing moments seem too corny or fake. The scenarios give a more comic book feel than the first film did and with the introduction of new characters such as the eye catching `Night Crawler', and `Ice-man', we can hardly wait to see what director Bryan Singer cooks up for the sequel that is screaming to be made. To conclude, X2 is your more than satisfying movie entertainment, that will give a kick to all those who are wanting a piece of the extreme thrills and a grin to all those just wanting some mindless fun."

"kgprophet","7","0","0","2 May 2003"," X Men Unleashed
","I would say that when you create a reality with so many people with special powers, you have to live in it.  In other words,  you have to deal with the real possibilities each mutant has.  If you were to make a movie depicting the consequences of said powers,  it would have to be epic, with mutants making trouble all over the place.  Or battling one power against anothers. In this case, Bryan Singer does exactly that.  It reminds me of Superman 2, where the 3 villians discover that they can control the world.   <br/><br/>
The special effects are flawless, the action is furious, the characters are explored and are mostly convincing.  The story feels like it benefited from some re-writes.  There are disturbing correlations with registering mutants with the latest homeland security measures dealing with terrorism.  Even the Special Ops forces storming the X Men's school grounds,  looks eerily like footage from the Iraq conflict.  This makes the film all the more resonant. <br/><br/>
Only a few complaints.  The movie tracks in at 2 hours and 15 minutes,  and feels about 15 minutes too long.  The third act gets a little discombobulated with the twisty turny endings that seem to be all the rage these days.  Why do filmmakers feel the need to pile more and more plot points in the third act?  Perhaps they are afraid that the 3rd act is weak, and they need to add more story elements to confuse you.  Please please please trim down the convoluted endings!   There have been many duds released lately (Basic, Identity, The Recruit),  that have been condemned by critics for deteriorating into utter nonsense.  <br/><br/>The other somewhat disturbing aspect of the movie is Wolverine's violent blade-wielding attacks on said Special Ops, and other normally good guys. Remember Terminator 2?  Great care was taken to keep the film on a comic book level by only slightly injuring the innocents (police and bystanders), and not worrying about the negative reaction to a high body count. Wolverine is not a nice guy here.  <br/><br/>I give this film a 7 out of 10.  I will probably go see it again."

","Liked the first movie ?You´ll love X2. In my opinion, it´s the best ""comic-book adaptation"" ever made (with X coming in second place).Almost everything about this movie is superb: thank God the US$ 120 million were well spent. The plot is very good (based upon the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"" bu Chris Claremont and Brent Anderson) and the subplots develop swiftly, joining with the main plot at the exact time. The visual effects are this movie´s ace feature. They´re just spectacular! The Nightcrawler and Mystique shots prove that. The actings are also good (especially Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine)as well as the diection by Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>Well.... whatever, you guys won´t care about what I´m writing anyway.... But really, if you like good action/adventure flicks, go ahead and watch X2. You won´t be disappointed.

"byght","8","0","0","2 May 2003"," Blows the first one out of the water
","The first X-MEN was, I felt, a very successful outing.  But it lacked the momentous feel and captivating energy of, for example, SPIDER-MAN--which captured perfectly everything that made the comics so wonderful.  X-MEN was a skillful adaptation from a difficult medium with some great performances from 2 great actors, but I wouldn't exactly term it ""great.""<br/><br/>X2 is great.  Better than the first, better, even, than SPIDER-MAN.  Not just by a little, but by a lot.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence (I'm not gonna ruin it), it's pretty apparent that we're in for something more.  Bryan Singer brings his stylistic influence to bear on this film a lot more than in the original--and the results are appreciated.  His little touches of cinematic deftness make one appreciate the value of having a great director even on a blockbuster action project like this.<br/><br/>Another improvement is the length--no joke.  X2 is able to tell a much deeper, and, well, BIGGER story than the first because it's got over 2 hours to do it in.  The extra time allows for more and better action sequences (MUCH better; am I the only one who was a little underwhelmed by the Wolverine/Mystique sequences from the first movie?), sure, but perhaps more importantly it allows for more character.  Not just character development, character INTERACTION--something the original needed more of.  Wolverine and Iceman in the kitchen, for instance, is a great example of the kind of hanging-out-at-the-X-Mansion scenes that helped give the comic book such depth and breadth.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN was great because it focused not as much on recreating exactly the classic STORY of the comics, but on recreating the things that made that story so great in the first place.  X-MEN did this to an extent, but not as well.  X2 does it better than both of them, and that's why it's a better film than both of them."

","The 2003 summer movie season is upon us with the release of X2 the highly anticipated follow up the 150 Million plus grossing `X-Men'. The film continues the story of a band of genetic mutants known as The X-Men who find themselves battling a fearful and mistrusting society as well as fellow mutants for better understanding of their kind as well as their very survival. Based on the hit Marvel comic series, the film directed by Bryan Singer, `X2' revolves around an attempt by Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox), to eliminate the mutant threat by invading the training school and home of the X-Men and their leader Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). This direct attack on the mutants adds fuel to the fire as Charles's old friend yet recent enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen), now has proof to his long standing theory that mutants must fight the humans for survival. Until now, Xavier has always believed that humans and mutants could co-exist in peace and has trained his students in this philosophy as well as the enhancement of their talents. Magneto has always believed that mutants must fight to survive, and that humans are inferior and has surrounded himself with followers who share this belief.  Naturally this conflict of interest has lead to skirmishes between the two sides as well as an increased fear of mutants from a human population caught in the crossfire.  As if the attack on the academy was not enough to complicate the lives of the X-Men, Magneto has escaped from his high security prison and a mutant assassin has made an attempt on the life of the President making a tense situation even more volatile as fear and paranoia regarding mutants is now at an all time high. Faced with a battle on several fronts, the X-Men join forces with Magneto's troops in a reluctant alliance that is necessary for the survival of their kind as well as for the very human race.<br/><br/>What follows is a dazzling mix of special effects and action as the two sides battle Stryker's legions and each other with the very real threat of genocide hanging in the balance. There are some fine performances in the film especially those of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the shape shifting Mystique and that of Alan Cumming as the Bible quoting teleporter Nightshade. The two characters add energy and humor to their roles that makes them stand out from the majority of the cast save Hugh Jackman's standout performance as Wolverine.<br/><br/>This is a much more serious X-Men than the last adventure as people are killed along the way upping the violence from the traditional comic book style yet none of it is overly explicit. My biggest gripe with the film was that there were several long gapes in the film where little was happening and that talents such as Hale Berry, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and Ian McKellen were not given much to do with the screen time they had. There were flashes of great moments such as Roque (Ana Paquin), confronting Magneto for the first time since he tried to kill her in the last film, and a bizarre love triangle involving Wolverine that has to be seen to be believed, yet as a whole, `X2' left me wanting more. I know with so many characters in the story it would be difficult to develop them all, and `X2' does a nice job expanding on the roles of some of the smaller characters from the comic and past film, yet it simply does not add up. I think that with a tighter script and more attention to the details this film would have been truly great. That being said, `X2' is an entertaining summer film that should delight fans of the past film and the comic. If you can get by a few plot holes, then you might find yourself having a good time.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 5<br/><br/>Gareth Von Kallenbach<br/><br/>

I do know these 'middle' movies of 3somes are tough, but this one really just didn't do anything. I thought Wolverine's past should have either been further explored or hardly mentioned. Why couldn't Iceman not just freeze the water & save Jean Gray? And where did Magneto & Mystique run off to @ the end? I know the purpose of this one was to leave a few questions, but I just thought that the majority of this movie was just some pretty good action thrown together a very loose plot.

"ZosoJade","9","0","0","1 May 2003"," Brilliant. Best comic-book movie ever...
","OK. here we go it's been a long time coming but I saw this movie and you know what? It doesn't disappoint. If you are an X-Men fan, then let me tell you, you have no business not RUNNING to go see this film. If you just like action movie, ditto. If you don't like the X-Men, comic-book movies, action films and haven't seen the first one, then you are probably one of the people that have given it bad reviews. While overall it has gotten very good reviews I've heard lots of complaining about this movie. I've heard that it's too complicated and stuff like that and you know what? That's just crap being spilled out by reviewers who haven't seen the first one/ didn't understand it and refuse to try to or admit so. I heard one particularly idiotic reviewer say it was stupid that this film again addressed the issue of mutants not being accepted by society. That's like saying the Spider Man sequel shouldn't be about a guy who climbs walls and spins webs. I think it unfair that comic book movies be judged by people who obviously have no idea what they are talking about and keep giving invalid reasons for their dislike of the film.  Take it from me: The only reviews of this film you want to read are by comic-book fans. OK now for my review:<br/><br/>
To put this simply this is a film that aims to please the X-Fan first and foremost. You don't have to be a diehard fan. You just have to have a little knowledge of what the X-Men are all about.<br/><br/>First of all, one of my few qualms with the first film was that it was pretty low on SFX. Not so with this film. I tell you I have never seen so much cheering and applause over Special Effects in a movie since I saw the Matrix in 1999. The opening scene is without a doubt one of the best sfx scenes in motion picture history. The film then goes on to have periodic bursts of amazing effects - I mean it - the characters powers are really let loose here. there are NO problems with the SFX in this film.<br/><br/>In terms of storyline: If you haven't seen the first film you can expect to be somewhat confused as to what's going on. you'll know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are but you probably won't understand them or their relationships. Also if you saw it a long time ago and are not familiar with what the X-Men are all about, you may want to try and watch it again. The story is really not that complicated as long as you watch the film properly and is quite interesting. It involves several thing happening at once but the average viewer should be able to keep track of things. The acting is also very good but what would you expect with a cast like that?<br/><br/>The characters are breathtaking. Like I've said before every fanboy will get their money's worth. All their powers are used to the max so in this paragraph I'll concentrate on how they are portrayed. Again Wolvie is the center of attention: not so much because it's written like that as because Hugh Jackman is such a charismatic actor. Jean Grey is a VERY interesting character in this movie but that's all I'll say. Special mention goes to Magneto and Nightcrawler. Fans will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film, superior to every comic book movie to date. Definitely better than Spider Man and certainly superior to the sequel. I hope this film goes far. The downside? I've got to wait MONTHS before its release on DVD and years before X3."

","X2 astounded me. I knew the film was going to be something worth seeing, but everything that was missed in the first, has been made up with the second. A strong storyline, with many threads, good performances from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen and impressive visuals created a memorable cinema experience. So, ok, it isn't incredibly cerebral, but it does have thoughts in the undertones; cultural racism and fear. Paquin, Jannssen and Halle Berry ooze with sex appeal, which will doubtless make this a favourite of men throughout the world, and are all involved in typically complex love relationships. The imdb rating for this film right now is hovering around 8; i think it deserves a little better. 9/10"

","Pun intended... X-Men II lost it's 'Mystique' the second time around. From the very start of the film, you can visually see somethings different. From the camera angles to the lighting, that bigger then life image is no where to be seen. Simply, the emotional texture that once existed was somewhere lost in the fray. <br/><br/>Like most films these days, the opening sequence bursts onto the screen with welcomed flare and life, only then to muddle through a wondering filler script for the next 30 to 40 minutes leaving you far too long in anticipation for another burst. Each burst to come... mostly road side flares instead of 4th of July sky explosions. <br/><br/>The concept they were going for was understood and well intended however with a weak script coupled with too many variations left the characters sadly to become part of the machine instead of the machine itself.<br/><br/>
Plainly, you dont feel the power of, and the connection too the characters as you did in the first one. The general idea was good yet they came up too many yards short of a touchdown though they did accomplish to squeeze a couple of first downs here and there. <br/><br/>Yea, if I were you and you are an X-Men fan, then go see it.

","WARNING, this review does include some small spoilers, although i have attempted to keep them vague, you may catch on some hints.<br/><br/>
After seeing the teasers and the trailers for this movie i was really looking forwards to it, which normally means that it won't be all that good and dissapoint. BOY was i wrong.<br/><br/>This film not only works as an incredible sequel, but i also think it would be enjoyed by most people who havent seen the first film or ever heard of the x-men from their comic origins, even i had only read a couple of the comics and saw a few of the animated cartoon episodes before seeing the first one, which did an excellent job of introducing us to the characters but left us all wanting. Well the first one was JUST the setup for this. If i hadnt known that the two were written seperately i could have quite easily believed that the two of them were written together as one long script that was decided to split into two.<br/><br/>The acting is increadibly good for such a large and varied age cast, and before you read anything more about James Marsden's atrocious acting, his acting is very good and i could not fault him. Considering that his eyes(the strongest part of any actor's emotional link with the viewers) are covered up for the entierety of the movie he comes through as showing so much of his characters emotions on screen. The young actors playing the children at the school along with Rogue(who i felt was mis-cast in the first one), Iceman and Pyro, were perfect for their parts.<br/><br/>The Characters of Magneto and Mystique are played excellently by Mckellen and Romjon respectively, and the interplay between them and the rest of the x-men cast works very well to show that they are not evil people, just misguided due to their pasts(see the first film). We find that in the interim of the two movies Mystique has been masquerading as Senator Kelly from the first film trying to protect Xavier's school, showing she is not an evil character, and mckellen shows remorse later at a moment of weakness, while staying true to his core character (the scene between him and Pyro in the x-get is some nice characterisation). The love triangle between Jean Grey, Wolvering and Cyclops is woven into the story well and remains faithful to the comic origins aswell adding some slight sexual tension into the mix that works well. With Wolverine it was just incredible to see him cutting loose(literally) and attracking the soldiers invading the school in a rage that definately is the Wolverine that we wanted to see, literally tearing the soldiers apart, such a dark act for a good character but fully engages the audience.<br/><br/>The real breakthrough performances in the film are the performances of Rogue and Iceman(as already mentioned), Storm(who has a LOT more to do here and comes accross as a lot stronger and confident character), Wolverine(Could not fault him in the last film, and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of his torture at wanting to know what William Stryker knows comes accross increadibly strong. But the REAL breakthrough of the movie is Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler, this goy really was not one of my favourite actors and quite possibly my biggest fear and misgiving about the film, but his performance is increadible, and brings Nightcrawler to life as such a realistic and tormented character, all misgivings were obliterated after the first half hour.<br/><br/>The special effects(with the exception of one single shot in the film to do with water later on towards the end of the film) are flawless, even the fire effects(which have ALWAYS been a problem for movie effect) when Pyro is controling it does not bring down the level of quality here, on the contrary it enhances it. The cyclone effects when the x-jet is engaged by two fighters is increadibly smooth and impressive, but probably most increadible effects would have to be the view of all the people whilst inside cerebro, and then Nightcrawler's teleportation themes(which they are not afraid to use to increadible lengths as the character most likely would not be - the scene where he rescues Rogue is just incredible).<br/><br/>The editing and direction are good aswell, and the entire film moves along fluidly without getting boring at any point, an incredible marvel(excuse the pun) considering the length of the film and the amount of characters that have to be worked in. The opening scene in the whitehouse shows you immediately from the get-go just how well the collaboration of direction, effects and editing work together, and unlike most effects laden films, do not detract from the story, they serve it, and the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is incredible, the level of realistic brawl/fight that i have only ever really seen equaled towards the end of Blade 2, with both characters giving it their all and really trying to rip each other to pieces.<br/><br/>But the one thing above all that stands out from the first film is the scope of it all, the first movie left us wantign more, not showing us too much and teasing us with what limited flexibility they had whilst making it(remember, x-men was the first film to show how all comic book adaptations should and can be done - spiderman could not have been done without it paving the way). This time around there is a stronger feeling of impending danger, and we really get to see how powerful they can be(Aside from Magneto in the first film, none of the mutants seemed particularly powerful, but this time around Xavier's level of power seems to equal his, even showing how frighteningly dangerous he could be had he decided not to use his powers for the betterment of mankind).<br/><br/>The only real gripe i have with the film is that there could be more characterisation and more for some characters to do, Patrick Stewart as Xavier doesnt have a great deal to do, and Lady Deathsrike could have been used more, she only had a couple of lines through the whole movie, possibly a wasted opportunity there. But these can be forgiven because they really are the only thing i could find at fault with the film, and considering the number of characters involved(13 in all) there is far more than you would think they could include. Perhaps when the film is out on DVD there will be an option for a longer cut as there must have been scenes that were left on the cutting room floor for nothing more than the length of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, if you even remotely liked, liked, loved or intently loved the first film, you will definately find this has improved and quite possibly, like me, find yourself ready to head back and watch it again."

And the direction and screenplay couldn't be better.<br/><br/> But, if you don't know anything about the mutants, it's better for you to see the first movie before seeing the second.

","I can't believe all the positive, and in some cases orgasmic, reviews appearing for X-Men 2 here on IMDb.com. Are people unable to see, hear and differentiate quality in movies. Are moviegoers so sated by dazzling special effects and fast-edited fight scenes that their movie appetite is fully satisfied. Do people not see the quality difference between say, in descending order, LOTRings, Harry Potter and X-Men - the directing, cinematography, acting, characterisation, effects and especially the quality of the script.<br/><br/>The original X-Men had the saving grace of two wonderful performances by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin as Wolverine and Rogue. Their developing relationship as they both discovered their powers was some of the best written screenplay of any comic book movie. This overshadowed and made up for everything else - the tiny $50m budget and disappointing finale especially. And so what happens in X-Men 2 ?<br/><br/>Characters and script are both thrown out of the window and the film descends into 2 and 1/4 hours of mediocrity. Too short scenes. Scenes that just fizzle out. Muddled editing. Badly chopped and changing story lines. Throw thirty new characters on the screen and hope no-one notices not one of them has anything worthwhile to say. Anodyne lines spew forth from character after character. In over 130 minutes of dialogue, there is not one memorable line in the entire movie ! And the scene where Pyro tells his parents of his powers was one of the worst written and acted scenes I have ever seen in a Hollywood production - was this improvisation ? I understand the parents were shocked and didn't know what to say, but there are way of doing this so we find it touching and feel for the family - this was amateur hour. Shocking. I was embarrassed for the actors.<br/><br/>Wolverine was reduced to unfunny one-liners, showing off his biceps and beating up the baddies. Halle Berry's Storm looked like she wanted to burst into tears at the dialogue she was surely forced at knifepoint to utter. These writers should be proscecuted to the full extent of the law so they can never again write, type or dictate their screenplay drivel for any other movie.<br/><br/>I love comic book and fantasy movies, but the only mutant power X-Men 2 seems to possess is the ability to create the illusion of apparent quality for the raving multitude of popcorn eating teenagers. Maybe the subtitled version has better jokes ?"

","The latest X-2 film really Rocks!! that's most in part because of the hot sexy blue lady, Mystique. She is witty, smart, and a lot of fun to watch. while all the other X-Team characters are overly serious with dangerous tasks at hand, Mystique easily goes about her dangerous business in a care free fun attitude, she picks the film up when it gets too involved with itself. After seeing the first X Men film I wrote to the film's producers and pleaded with them to turn Mystique into a heroic character, because of the before mentioned reasons. Well, I got my wish for through most of the film Mystique is a heroic character, when she and Magneto team up with the X Team heroes, to combat the evil Stryker, who is intent on doing away with all mutants.

","While the first X-Men film lacked pace and action, X-2 kicks it off with a stunning set piece as comic fan's favourite Nightcrawler attacks the white house. More set pieces follow as the story unwinds, and treats abound for sharp eyed comics fans as other X-men characters make cameo appearances, leading up to a climax that'll have the fanboys screaming for the third movie. In all, an excellent action movie, but sure to be sadly overlooked with the first Matrix sequel due soon. What doesn't work? Well, Wolverine's self-obsessed agenda (in the comics he's usually much more practical). Professor X's psychic interventions (in the comics he gave up large displays of his power as unethical - here they serve a plot point). In addition, the large number of characters and the storyline conspire to sell short one of comic book's most complex relationships - Cyclops and Jean Grey. Here James Marsden is cruelly underused, but maybe that'll be corrected in X-3 when his role should become pivotal. Summary - if you liked X-Men, you'll love X-Men 2. If you were disappointed by the first one, check out the second one anyway."

","With a starting sequence that fires up the action appetite of the audience, and a trailer that looks better than much of the entire original X-Men movie does, my expectations were high for this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps too high.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat complicated for a comic book eye candy action movie, and even though it is complicated (too many parties involved during most of the movie, with X-Men temporarily split into 3 groups and baddies into 2 groups, so the story tries to follow 5 groups of characters during some excruciating minutes!) it isn't particularly clever. It centres around a mad army colonel trying to wipe out all mutants, and the shakeup of the mutant groupings caused by his efforts.<br/><br/>So far so good, but with the aforementioned split-up, the movie feels like a patchwork that should generate tension, but does not succeed. As a result, the movie is slow, and I was convinced it was over 150 minutes long when it ended. <br/><br/>So, how is the action? And how are the dramatics? As an action movie, a lot of bang is delivered, but too far in between. As a dramatic movie about outcasts of society, only a few scenes are relevant and clearly planted too artificially in the midst of the story to feel anything but fake. As love triangle, only two or three dramatic scenes are delivered, as tutor-mentor relationship movie, hardly anything is delivered, ... In short, the movie tries to be too many things at the same time. Some scenes feel like Star Trek: Nemesis, others like Titanic, others again like the original X Men... But the whole feels disappointingly empty and hollow.<br/><br/>It's a sure blockbuster, but it's nothing more and nothing less than an inferior sequel to a decent comic book movie."

I really don't like about X2 is vague plot and insensitive love stories. And I think Wolverine's storyline - especially about his past - should be better, too. Alan Cumming does a excellent job and Famke Janssen and Kelly Hu are also good to see. But Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin and James Marsden are completely wasted here.

The special effects, the additional mutant schoolchildren, the story line and acting are all on a par high above the first X-Men movie. Not to say the first movie wasn't great but with the world of the movie already set up, X2 is able to launch itself into action more quickly.<br/><br/>The special effects and make-up are extremely well done and there are a lot more than the first X-Men movie most likely due to the fact that it is a ""sequel"" but they still don't overshadow the story-line and the actors.<br/><br/>Speaking of the actors, Sir Ian McKellen outshines the entire cast, obviously revelling in his role of Magneto.  His costume is improved as is the design of his helmet and he gets to show off more of his power than he did in the first X-Men movie.   Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Cyclops once again have a strained friendship due to both of their affections for Jean Grey but they manage to get over it at the end, as they are made to by circumstances beyond their control.<br/><br/>Halle Berry's Storm is improved from the first movie as well, given more of a role to play and Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler/Kurt Wagner is outstanding. The teleportation effect is extremly well done which adds to his character.<br/><br/>And of course there is Brian Cox's character William Striker.  Although a slightly sad character due to his past with his wife and son, Striker is an evil and very manipulative man and wants something to be done for him by Prof. Xavier but I won't say what.<br/><br/>X2 is a very worthy ""sequel"" to add to the X-Men mantle and is a must see for anyone who is a fan of the comics, the first movie or someone who is just is search of an entertaining, extreamly well done superhero movie."
"ShinKyo81","8","0","0","1 May 2003"," Joins the small group of sequels that surpass the original movie...
","I trusted the young genius called Bryan Singer when he started 4 years ago what was going to be the best comic book adaptation saga of all time. X-MEN had been dwelling through years as an ambitious project, very difficult to recreate on the big screen and lots of fans easy to be disappointed... It was in 1999 when Bryan Singer, the director of the acclaimed ""The Usual Suspects"" started the first chapter of the X-MEN. Everyone was quite skeptical about the success of the film, so FOX didn't risk into an astronomic budget production. Only $40 million were avaliable to create a movie which was supposed to be full of SFX, CGI and incredible action...<br/><br/>
The director wasn't very popular, nor the acting crew: probably, the most known actor in all the crew was Patrick Stewart, whose popularity in 1999 was because of his role as Cpt. Jean-Luc Picard in the STAR TREK Universe... But that changed after perfoming as Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men. James Mardsen (Cyclops), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique)... ""Who the hell are they?"", people said. Well now, 4 years after the film, all the ""X-crew"" is well known in the cinema industry, most of them performing in blockbuster movies such as ""The Lord of The Rings"" (Ian McKellen as Gandalf), ""Swordfish"" (Hugh Jackman) and ""Monster's Ball"" (Halle Berry).<br/><br/>""X-MEN 1"" astonished the audience, not because the SFX: it's the humanity which is present through the movie. When Stan Lee created the X-Men in the '50s, his main purpose was to reflect the ideals of the afroamerican revolution which was happening in those years... Malcom X, Martin Luther King, they fought for their people in order to defend its rights against the oppression and rejection from the white people, only because they were different. Singer took this idea and put it in front of the audience. Instead of making a popcorn comic flick such as Spider-Man or Blade, he made a complex plot, worked characters and incredible stylish action.<br/><br/>All the skeptics shut their mouths at once after watching the movie and the audience requested out loud a sequel. 3 years after the first movie, X2 is a reality. And what's the difference between the two movies?<br/><br/>
First, the budget. This time, FOX let Bryan Singer spend about $150 million to create a decent sequel. In consequence, you have more special effects, more action and more style. But before thinking X2 as a popcorn-SFX only film, made only to make money (which in fact, it is :P), the plot is much better than the first movie, the characters are much more evolved and worked. Nobody is a second rank character. Even the school mutant kids have their part in the main plot. The ""main"" character is still Wolverine, though.<br/><br/>New characters? Well, you'll see Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, great performance), whose first appearance is one of the best action sequences ever seen. Then there's Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), a threat for Wolverine... Colossus, Banshee, Jubilee, Prof. Hank McCoy (Beast), the Mastermind... They all make their short appearances.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BEWARE  SPOILER  BEWARE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>
Don't read the spoiler if you haven't seen the movie. If you do, it will ruin you the end sequence... ^_^<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Jean Grey gets more involved in the action and in her main comic book story. The X-MEN comic fans will know about the Dark Phoenix Jean Grey. Well I don't know how Singer will adapt this event of the comic book, but in the last take of the X2, when the camera pans down to the water where Jean Grey has died, you can see a blurry shape, a fire bird shape emerging from the water... Just before it's becoming clear and revealing, black screen with the letters ""Directed by Brian Singer"" appears...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     END OF SPOILER    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>
When the credits start to roll up, the X-MEN Fans will shout: ""F*CK!"" lol If you hate the ""opened endings"" or a ""Wait for the next movie"" end type, leave the film before it ends. I saw the movie yesterday at night and right now I'm wandering how X3 will be.<br/><br/>Great work, Bryan, great work, actors. If you keep on like this, the X-MEN saga will be remembered as the best comic adaptation films ever made.<br/><br/>

","I had only seen the original X-Men movie (2000) a couple of days before the opening of X-men 2 (2003) and found it very enjoyable, so i watched it two more times in as many days. However, compared to the sequel the original seemed quite dull and boring! I could not believe my eyes as i sat through the most exciting movie i have ever witnessed. And to my surprise it is a lot darker then the original.<br/><br/>Not only does Bryan Singer know how to create a movie as exciting as X-men 2, but he (with help) came up with the best assasination attempt and prison break ever (these aren't spoilers, they're also included in most plot summaries and trailers). As i watched, i totally disregarded the actors performances, not because they were bad (they were the opposite), but because it didnt seem like they were trying to act out their character, rather it seemed like they were the characters. Hugh Jackman (go the Aussies) is perfect as Wolverine, and its like Professor X was modelled from Patrick Stewart. Anna Paquin (Rogue) looked great, and every other actor took their parts seriously, which gave the movie an edge (rather making the X-men look silly and corny). Look out for a teenage Colossus, Remy Le Beau's (Gambit) name on a computer screen, and a scientist on TV, Henry McCoy (AKA the Beast). The movie may not be entirely faithful to the comics, but the changes give it much more realism.<br/><br/>Of course, X-men 2 isnt the last of the films, and i cant wait to find out more about the next movies. Not only will i see it again at the movies, but i'll be dying to get my hands on a proper DVD version.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie full of action, suspense, amazing fight sequences (i consider them better then any from the matrix), a great story, perfect performances, and surprises (a bit of romance as well), then i would heavily recommend seeing X-men 2, and not just the once."

","I thought X2 was very watchable. I don't know how closely it is related to the comic as I have never read it.<br/><br/>What made it more interesting for me was that a week before watching this movie I was at the Australian Museum in Sydney which happened to have a human evolution exhibit. It showed a BBC documentary video on evolution called ""Children of Eve"" and showed the relationship between early Neanderthal man and the Crone Magnons, which is mentioned in X2.<br/><br/>The film has further character development than the first. But with so many characters there had to be sacrifices in development of some characters. I think there was room to develop the Storm character, with the potential I saw in the interaction between her and night stalker about faith which could have lead into interesting internal conflicts. I think Cyclops missed out in this department as well getting surprisingly little screen time.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the film and will be eager to see a further installment."

It will probably live under the shadow of The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions this year but I think the best is yet to come from the X-Men. The casting for the film is excellent and provided they can continue to coordinate the schedules of all the actors it would be great to see them in action in further sequels. This film stands out among the Matrix-wannabes and I admire it for not resembling the Matrix in any sense other than the black suits.

","Being one of the first people around the world to see X2 in the theaters, I left the movie house this afternoon HIGHLY IMPRESSED.<br/><br/>X2, or ""X-Men 2"" as the way it is branded here in the Philippines, is truly a GREAT sequel especially for the comic-based movie genre. For movies in general, X2 is also an impressive sequel.<br/><br/>What makes X2 great? For the most part, the story is the main factor of the greatness. Being a comic collector years ago, my expectations and demand for quality story making in X-Men has always been high and the great thing is that this sequel's story is very well made.<br/><br/>Unlike the first X-Men, X2 is presented with a more matured toned and the story always makes sense concentrating on the conflict between humans and mutants. The characters are also very well presented in delivering the atmosphere of the X-Men universe and this time around the relationship between Professor X and Magneto has been explored even deeper thus blurring the boundary between good and evil. Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine has IMPROVED this time around and the same goes with Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique. But most notable among all is Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal of Magneto which is much better this time around (I guess playing the wise Gandalf really helped him). Patrick Stewart continues to bring quality performance as Prof X.<br/><br/>The biggest new addition to the cast, who also has a very impressive performance, is Brian Cox as the obsessed William Stryker who will stop at nothing to wipe out all mutants.<br/><br/>Any flaws? The cast, while generall very good, does have MISCASTS. James Marsden is STILL TERRIBLE and STILL IMMATURED as Cyclops/Scot Summers while Famkke Jansen is TOO OLD and UNAPPEALING as Jean Grey.<br/><br/>In my own opinion, Cyclops and Jean Grey should be played by actors who live up to each character's maturity and appeal. With the fact that Marsden is 9 years younger than Jansen in reality, their age gap is very present in the story.<br/><br/>Aside from having a great story and strong cast, X2 also has some of the best action scenes in film yet this 2003 not to mention some of the most impressive special effects works. <br/><br/>With the way the film ended, I was left impressed and satisfied plus I am already looking towards the next X-Men movie. If the film crew follows the way X2 ended as far as story telling goes, I am optimistic that they will explore the Jean Grey-Phoenix storyline that was legendary in the comic books (I just hope that Marsden and Jansen get REPLACED).<br/><br/>X2's rating for me: 9 out of 10. Definitely HIGHLY RECOMMENDED VIEWING!"

","I saw this movie on Sunday the 27th (Australian Time) at our local premiere, and I have to say that I was dazzled. This was one of the best films I have ever seen. It combined the right amount of action, thrills, spills, humour and romance to create a stunning package. The jokes were witty and never resorted to lowbrow humour, the stunts fantastic, and the actors charming. It also poises enough questions to warrant a third film. This is the kind of film that makes me want to become involved with the industry when I 'grow up'. All involved should give themselves a pat on the back: they deserve it."

","X-Men 2, the sequel to the highly successful and solid original comes to the screen with much greater hype, expectations and budget than the first and for the most part, lives up to them and raises the standard for Comic Book Films even higher.<br/><br/>As with the first, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine carries the film.  Jackman has the best lines, action scenes and screen presence - mainly due to limited screen time for the always excellent Ian McKellan.  The film starts off strongly with a great scene in the White House and carries this momentum to a terrific battle for the Mansion, with Wolverine really cutting loose. However, the finale and slightly hammy ending not being able to keep up with initial pace is somewhat of a letdown.  Character-wise, Iceman, Pyro are coming along nicely and Nightcrawler is a welcome addition to the family. But why does Mystique, a supporting villain at best, get far more screen time than Magneto?  With so many characters and so little screen time (135 minutes goes by VERY fast)someone has to miss out, with Cyclops once again drawing the short straw.<br/><br/>Still, there are plenty of treats for fans; with 'Dr. Hank McCoy' making a guest appearance and a great cameo by Colossus (steel skin), while 'Jamie Madrox' (Mulitple Man) and 'Remy LeBeau' (Gambit) on the computer screen showing intricate attention to detail.<br/><br/>Overall, a real treat for fans, a top-notch action/sci-fi film for everyone else and more enjoyable than the original.<br/><br/>Best Bit:  Wolverine's berserker rage in the mansion made my hair stand on end!<br/><br/>Worst bit:  The ending lacked the emotional impact that the filmmakers were aiming for.  And the prospect of having to wait another 3 years for part 3 - how can I survive?"

"double-2","Null","0","0","22 April 2003"," mr. president, are you all right?
","warning: possible spoilers, though none are related to the story<br/><br/>if it's true that mr. singer worked for months on the X2-script (one can barely call it that) with first-strike-offenders mr. harris and mr. dougherty, then i fear hollywood is in bigger-better-more creative trouble than ever. not one aspect of x2 betrays even the slightest dramatic intelligence, an acutely lethal disease which the first film, despite its lack of personality, at least managed to pretend it didn't have. xavier's opening words do seem to suggest otherwise, with its ominous comment on the failure of the human species to establish a level of interhuman peaceful coexistence. thus the story begins, announced by cast & director as of a somewhat political nature, with the humans-versus-mutants-war possibly reflecting all micro-forms of intolerance we all have witnessed. but where the first film crudely succeeded in conveying the fear of a human society for alien, freakish elements through the character of senator kelly, this supposed 'non-sequel' makes the clash of normal against abnormal a 'personal' one, thereby robbing the story of its inherent drive. the ridiculous character of stryker has a stupid, little score to settle with xavier and that's basically it. though it's being released quasi-simultaneously all over the globe, this 'american' film loses all narrative universality thanks to a stunningly short-sighted, ethnocentric bias: 'mr. president, are you all right?' was probably the only relevant question the three writers could come up with. all of this may have worked in the comic, intended for domestic use, but in these globalized times and on the big screen it could have gained impact by at least showing some other parts of the world. but no, let's not forget: america (well, north america) equals the world. all other humans-and mutants for that matter-on earth are invisble, reduced to tiny little lights on cerebro's screen. this nearly fatal crux of x2 results in absolute sudden death when the young generation-x is given ample screen time to make a complete fool of themselves. 'will anyone send these horrible freaks of evolution back to school?' is an understandably natural reaction of any normal human forced to sit out their scenes (which, admittedly, the little x-s screw up x-traordinarily well). possibly the strongest element of the first film, the 'compl-x' psyche of wolverine, his mystery and his attraction to dr. jean, is first left to freeze on a snowy road, then to thaw and rot in a stinking blaze of inaptly constructed cgi-kaboom. in addition, his relationship to rogue has been stabbed to death by a script that tries to shift focus towards the new generation. once it discovers (in a mutant ability to self-reflect)that there's nothing there but the big x of x-tremely idiotic characters (and bad actors, though this it could not have known!), it quickly and incoherently wanders off and wonders why it all went wrong. poor mr. jackman. knowing that x-men easily granted him the victory in a frightening hairdo contest, and gave him slight advantage in his rivalry with cyclops, x2 turns him into a helpless wretch, taking defeat after defeat (whilst saving the world?). indeed: mrs. berry sports a hairdo that should cross the limits of tolerance jon bon jovi considerably heightened in the late eighties. moreover, storm probably depleted all her rainy acting skills at last year's oscars, because here she's uncannily awful, spouting lines with the despair of a warm breeze lost in the ice age. but the most hair-raising pieces of silly acting are delivered by mr. alan cumming, whose german sounds as if he's just invented the language. his nightcrawler is a moronic creation, though the opening sequence-the only spectacular highlight in this disaster-left us somewhat optimistic. and what about magneto, who was supposed to grow closer to xavier, in a film that-or so mr. singer made us believe-would show that they aren't the black-and-white-characters the first film made us believe? well, to be honest, i forgot, having at that stage of the smaller-worse-less-adventure directed all my attention to the wonderful mystique, the sole enigma in this brainless horror of a film. mystique, myth, mystery is exactly what mr. singer's (hardly) cinematic knee-fall to stupidity has too little of. today, my fellow earthlings, the idea of another installment in the x-franchise seems a terrorist threat to western civilization and its god-fearing...(x-rated bit). suddenly, from all corners of america-equals-the-world, the deafening cry: 'mr. president, are you all right?'"

","Alright, still missing a few things, but just looking at the movie for what it is it was great! The characters seem a bit more comfortable in the yummy leather and the special effects were good. The story line was kind of the same as one, but it was made up for by the more in-depth view into the characters. Also note the perfect music.<br/><br/>First off: POSITIVES!: <br/><br/>What I loved most about this movie were the new characters. Even though some were only seen for a mere minute they were there! Pyro, Lady Deathstrike, Jublee (!), Colossus and of course Nightcrawler.<br/><br/>Having never read the comics and seeing just a few ep's of the TV-series I only knew Nightcrawler for the X-men teens series. He was young then and I don't remember him being German or religious either, but at least I recognized him right away. And I loved it. Nightcrawler is one of the best characters as far as I'm concerned, and as far as powers go, even as a child I wanted his. And of course the black clouds of smoke as he teleported were incredible! And of course applauding the make-up artists whom did his tattoo's. They are really beautiful. <br/><br/>Pyro I already knew, and I knew he would cross over. Still it was nicely done ('What is your real name John?') Same with Jean Grey. Can't WAIT to see her as Phoenix! Femke is a good actress, but she just doesn't really *get* Jean. Jean has always been a matriarch, a leader next to Charles Xavier. She seems to focus just a bit too much on her insecure side.<br/><br/>The story in itself builds on on Wolverine's past. From what I know about the comics, Wolverine has always been one of the characters (if not THE character) that kept the story going. People seem to love him and I can't blame them honestly. The part with the wolf was pretty, but I had a tomb raider flashback right away hum <br/><br/>As far as the story goes it's good, with the added bonus that the two parties have to work together to defeat the new bad guy. Oh and of course NO ONE saw the stab in the back coming :P. A bit overly done but the scene where Storm comes to save the day eventually is great . ('Daddy is gonna be so mad').<br/><br/>Another note I'd like to make is Iceman. His part was much larger in this movie and he is a great character. As a lesbian I recognized a LOT in the talk with his mom. Especially the 'Have you every tried not being a mutant?' part was memorable.<br/><br/>Now on to: NEGATIVE PARTS!:<br/><br/>Alright, my first one is this:<br/><br/>WHY DOES EVERYONE ALWAYS HAVE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE!!???<br/><br/>I mean seriously I get the bobby/Rogue thing and find it mighty cute. I was already used to the whole Logan/Jean/Cyclops thing and this time it was funny. <br/><br/>But STORM/NIGHTCRAWLER???!!! <br/><br/>WHY???!!!<br/><br/>WHY!!!<br/><br/>O_0'<br/><br/>-_-''<br/><br/>Okay, sorry. Calming down<br/><br/>But really, why does everyone always have to fall in love? I'm all for love, but gosh you just can't pass the girls from one to the other Okay, enough of this<br/><br/>Beside the whole love thing there were a few parts over the top. Just about every fighting scene by Wolverine was ridiculous! He is a powerful character, I agree, but this? Nah <br/><br/>Magneto and Xavier had the same trouble. Extracting the iron from someone's blood and then making not one but three balls out of it? Hum I don't think so but well, I can deal. Just as the knowledge that Xavier is so powerful that he can kill anyone on this planet. The movie just looses some points for it. <br/><br/>I don't remember how, but I remember Lady Deathstrike and I was Marjory disappointed. Beside her amazing looks and VERY yummy nails she had NOTHING going for her. She had ONE line, to the guy taking out the trash (To her knowledge) and beside that she could have just as easily been a zombie.<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Next time more Jublee, colossus, and maybe more Kitty. Also I would love some other characters like Psylocke or The Blob ^_^"

","This near-feminist weak sequel to the rather average first installment left me in tears... of boredom and laughter. The two don't normally go hand-in-hand, but the impossible CAN happen. The impossible (or shall I say absurd) as in Stewart having such enormous powers that he can kill all mankind with thought alone. Wow. How bombastic can you get. But the really silly bit is that this all-powerful Stewart - realistically speaking powerful enough to be mistaken for God - is so easily manipulated to do things against his will, such as kill all humans. So the merry band of X-Women had to prevent ALL of mankind getting annihilated. Even James Bond's missions don't get this silly.<br/><br/>It seems that nearly everyone's powers have quadrupled, at the very least, since the first movie. (I was even half-expecting the U.S. President to turn someone to stone or spew fire out of his ears.) Especially the female cast, which dominates here. But I guess in the laughable ""girl power"" (or ""fashion-model power"") age that we live in, what with all the Kill Bills, Death-Proofs, Ripleys, and other Lara Crofts, I should have by now gotten used to the fact that anorexic 6-foot super-models save entire galaxies in adventure films. (Just how do you get the energy to kill so many evil guys while boycotting food, i.e. starving?? I don't get it...) It is just sooooo convincing to watch an Uma Thurman chop-sokey 70 Japanese martial arts experts in one evening. It makes Bugs Bunny cartoons look like ""Les Miserables"".<br/><br/>I'm all for wild fantasy, but there are limits as to how dumb an action movie can get before it becomes a parody of itself.<br/><br/>Given the tremendous powers that Xavier and his goodie-two-shoes ""mutants"" have, how can the U.S. military, or for that matter, ALL of the world's military powers combined, do them any harm? Comic-book kiddy rubbish or not - that cannot be an all-purpose excuse here - even fantasy has to adhere to some form of logic and common-sense, especially the kind of fantasy that tries to make ""relevant"" political and social comments, thinly disguised in ""mutant"" (uni)form.<br/><br/>Apart from the ridiculous premise, we also have some Latin soap-opera romance going, in the form of a love-triangle (Wolverine, Cyclops & Jean Grey), and even puppy-love (Rogue and Iceman; I feel so silly even writing these names down...). Hence it's no wonder that the movie overstretches its welcome by at least 40 minutes, what with its whopping 130 minutes running time. There is very little going on in the first half-hour, which was particularly dull. The love-triangle implodes when Famke Janssen dies at the end. Was this supposed to be a touching/emotional moment? I yawned. Just check out Jackman's/Wolverine's unconvincing sobbing; but, hey, it's tough to act when you're in front of a damn blue screen all the time. And I guess in the third part we'll have Wolverine falling in love with Cyclops, right? Maybe as a little nod of approval to the gay community... And the less said about all those mutant kids being in the movie, the better... Dull props, nothing more.<br/><br/>One of the dumbest things in this lame sequel is Alan Cummings. He would have been bad enough in any human role here, but as a mutant? And a German mutant?? A German, Christian-fanatic mutant??? Cummings' accent reminded me of Sascha Cohen's gay Austrian Bruno character from his Ali G show. Almost as bad is Mystique (what a dumb dumb dumb name), who is given the ol' switcheroo shtick, so very much milked dry in about half of all ""Star Trek"" episodes. So she can transform into anyone? With that power she doesn't need either ""God"" or Magneto (another dumb name) to rule the world - all by herself! This kind of nonsense may look good to nerdy zit-faced pre-teens when offered in comic-book form, but on the screen it's just all far too silly. As most Marvel film adaptations are. Still, it isn't nearly as bad as Ang Lee's ""Hulk""...<br/><br/>I am really looking forward to seeing the sequel! In it, I expect to see our X-Women powerful enough to make the Sun circle the Earth, maybe Neptune and Jupiter will be smashed together as one, and maybe Famke Janssen will re-surface as a sort of quasi-goddess, who gets jealous of Wolverine and Cyclops for getting a gay marriage license. She will then join Magneto and destroy the whole universe. All of these powers are merely a result of ""human evolution"", of course I am really, really looking forward to the third part. I have a copy of it, I just need to place it in the DVD. But some magic power is preventing me from it... Could it be...? Could it be Magneto? Maybe he doesn't want me to trash his precious mutants in yet another, third, review..."

I felt that the movie was riddled with plot holes, unsubtle (and unfunny) moments, incongruous violence, and failure to pursue 90% of the characters far enough to make you give a crap about what happened to them.<br/><br/>Several of my favorites: - That, somehow, a ""neck liquid""-possessed Nightcrawler was able to beat the daylights out of 30 Secret Service men and then spend the rest of the film doing nothing of interest? - That Mystique impersonates the dead (?) Senator Kelly on a consistent enough basis to get anything worthwhile accomplished. - That Magneto could A) suck elemental iron straight from someone's body and B) put enough mass together to make anything worthwhile? - That Pyro seemed intent on playing an evil Slytherin malcontent instead of an X-person, as if he'd wandered onto the wrong set the day of the shoot.<br/><br/>Just dreadful."

It miss something from the original, sorry I don't know why.<br/><br/>X2: X-Men United (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>Sequel to the 2000 original movie,""X2"" is the highly anticipated installment from Bryan Singer who forges ahead with his work, this time creating more complexities on the franchise. Based on the popular Marvel comic book series this second exposure was from the minds of Zak Penn, David Hayter and Singer himself.<br/><br/>After Magneto was closed in the plastic prison Professor Charles Xavier was quiet busy in teaching his gifted students. The problems against mutant still existing, gets even worse when the President was attacked by a vaporizing mutant (Nightcrawler). The President now take firm look at the mutant issue, this time from the assistance of former U.S. military leader turned anti-mutant radical William Stryker. After seeing the aerial photograph of an unidentified aircraft (X-Jet) from Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, President gives permission to Stryker for trace down the whole area minus any blood shed. For that he meets Magneto, under some nostrum he was forced to give information about Xavier's mansion resulting a secret military operation at the mutant school for catching mutant students. Some are taken prisoner and others become fugitives, along with members of the school's elite team, the X-Men.<br/><br/>What will they do next, will that be the beginning of War against Mutants, What will Xavier do to save mutant race from human and in return? Scripted by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter tells the continuing story of favorite mutants in a large canvas. They tried to give their best in this 2nd chance by adding few favorite mutants to the plot like Nightcrawler, Deathstrike, Colossus and the very little unrecognized ""Beast"" aka Dr. Hank McCoy. But the major problem in the movie was its plot, it got no strength, no intention, no drift it's Only got a great STORYBOARD. Producers plan was : Filling Weak plot adding essential cast from the original chapter, also by mixing new ones with the cut down of some previous mutants, then summing them with the trendy special FX. Mission accomplished, X2 was born.<br/><br/>I don't know what the hell was respected Helly Barry thinking while reading this script. She was wasted completely, she got nothing to do with this movie, I can't remember a single scene of Storm from it, may be she liked to wear her new wig! Same thing happened to Scott Summers aka James Marsden, he was blown out of the map in this story, but hey he has some memorable scene which he performed nicely.<br/><br/>Also some of the previous characters were removed from this version making a great miss at Ray Park's Todd, not like the original comic book smart character but still my favorite Tyler Mane's Sabertooth. The great miss was the removal of the musical genius Michael Kamen, resulting a non-thematically score in X2 from the unskillful replacement John Ottman. The original X-men soul was created enormously by the hands of veteran Michael Kamen giving a defined signature depth to the X-Men universe, but Singer's buddy John Ottman did noting to go beyond that level. His score was pliable when it comes to romantic themes as well as in action scenes where he failed miserable on Jean Grey's romantic triangle and Logan's uncovered past.<br/><br/>An only thing stand along in the movie was Logan's storyline, plus the character developments in Jean Grey. Famke Janssen did a clear work in portraying the confused lover, where Jackman add few pounds to his acting styles. In the first movie I was unhappy to see Jackman's Logan minus muscles, X2 break that law, he is now so similar to Marvel comics Sean Chen's Wolverine. But his casual outfits sucked, he seemed scrawny like a chicken kid in the opening Canadian outdoors and hair looked dead. Kelly Hu as Logan's new killing enemy Yuriko Oyama was the only one so Accurate to the comic book character, besides Patrick's Xavier. Also Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler Rocked, decreasing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's Mystique screen value.<br/><br/>All in all it's a movie we can bear with if it is not seen twice or more. This lame chapter features the drastic debut of Nightcrawler and the farthest final of Jean Grey so, Just See it for once.<br/><br/>X2: X-Men United = Weak Plot: meant to United."
"aram81","7","1","2","23 April 2020"," X2 is more action-packed and is entertaining but it's not as good as the original
","Almost everything in X2 is done on a grander scale compared to its predecessor but that does not mean it's necessarily better. There is more action and more mutants but unfortunately some of the smaller character moments are drowned out by the heavy emphasis on action. This is not a negative review; on the contrary, I still enjoyed this slick and entertaining picture, just not as much as the original. Like the last film, the majority of the talented cast is in top form. Stewart, Jackman and McKellen are outstanding and the supporting cast is solid. My only complaint (like the last film) is Berry and Marsden, who are less than inspiring as Storm and Cyclops. If you are an X-Men fan and like action-packed superhero films, then X2 will not disappoint."

Sure, there are a lot of good things : Wolverine, Prof X, Magneto, Nightcrawler, the attack of the mansion, the escape of Magneto, the game to find other mutants (the new mutants, Colossus, the beast), the mixing of iconic Xmen comics story (the sacrifice of Jean, Count Nefaria). But there were also a lot of garbage : iceman, storm, phoenix effect, Pyro, cyclops If the production is splendid and the effects rather well done, the movie never really takes off. Maybe it's the editing, maybe Stryker is a poor choice of villain, maybe it's much too dark or the fact that their mutants powers are rather invisible but at the end, it was not really enjoyable."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","2","14 June 2014"," X2 Review
","The first X-Men film presented a grand cast of iconic heroes in a troubled world; their heroics would only become grander and more complex in the continuing conflict. Bryan Singer's second X-Men film carries over everything that made the first film great, and still manages to cram in a whole lot more.<br/><br/>The action in X2 is phenomenal. The film starts off with one of the most elegantly-staged fight scenes on film. Shortly thereafter, the film rolls ahead with a constant series of fights and flights; among the most inspiring of scenes, Storm takes out a pair of jets with tornadoes, and Pyro goes berserk against a police squad. The entire last half of the film takes everybody to Alkali Lake, for a massive cascade of impressive action, including a great fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike, Magneto wreaking havoc with the military, and Cyclops blowing things up. The whole time, all life on Earth remains at stake. It all reaches its apex with an awesome dam burst sequence, the likes of which could put the scenes in Superman: The Movie to shame.<br/><br/>Despite having so much, the film never feels overblown or convoluted; it all flows very sublimely, and gives just enough room for the story to unfold and breathe a little. Characters shine a little better than before, and more attention is given to the lesser players. Some of the strongest moments include revelations concerning Wolverine's character. The film also digs up enough background on the villain, Colonel Stryker, and his situation to give the evil plot more relevance and depth. It all ties into the grander scheme of showing a world struggling against mutant prejudice, and thanks to the characters and their interactions, it remains a compelling struggle.<br/><br/>This film is made with fantastic photography and editing. Acting is great from the whole cast: Hugh Jackman continues to excel as Wolverine, while Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Brian Cox, and everybody else remains solid. Writing is not bad. This production uses great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are generally good, but are aging a little. John Ottman's music score is great.<br/><br/>X2 is a perfectly-balanced sequel with fantastic action scenes, but still gives a good amount of attention to the story and characters. In spite of this, it is a massive step up from the first film, and remains one of the best sequels since T2.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"

","Fantastic sequel that is regarded by many as superior to the original. I don't particularly agree but rather than wade into that argument I'll just say that I love both movies. Where this movie is obviously stronger than the first is in its action scenes. It has some especially strong sequences, such as the opening Nightcrawler scene at the White House or the assault on the X-mansion. These scenes and others like them are much more cinematic and well-staged than the action scenes from the first movie.<br/><br/>Most of the first movie's stars shine here as well. Jackman and McKellen lead the pack again. Janssen, Romijn, Berry, and even Marsden improve upon their roles from the first film. Also returning from the first film with a significantly larger part is Shawn Ashmore's Iceman. He's really good. New to the cast are Alan Cumming's wonderful turn as Nightcrawler, Aaron Stanford's enjoyable Pyro, Kelly Hu's sexy and deadly Lady Deathstrike, and Brian Cox lending some weight as the villainous human Stryker. There are also a slew of fan-pleasing cameo appearances from comic book characters such as Kitty Pryde, Siryn, and Colossus.<br/><br/>Where the movie does suffer some is that, in adding the new characters and giving them a lot of focus, it takes away from some characters from the first movie that I liked a great deal. Patrick Stewart's Professor X is sidelined for a large part of this one. Anna Paquin's Rogue is stuck in a romantic subplot that gives her little to do for most of the film. Worse, her plot never goes anywhere. It's in the same place at the end of the movie as it was at the beginning. Sadly, things would get even worse for her character moving forward in the series. A crying shame considering how important she was to the first movie.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's direction is even more polished than the first movie. The script, while a little more involved than your average comic book film (at that time especially), is intelligent and full of memorable lines and scenes. The special effects are very good. The music is better than the first movie as well, although still lacking a definitive score like Batman or Superman had. Judged on its own merits or by comparison, it's a great movie. It's a shame that Singer didn't return for the third film. We all know how that turned out without him. At least when he did return with Days of Future Past, he brought back the old magic."

","Seemingly using the first film to practice big-budget movie-making, Bryan Singer followed the mediocre X-Men (2000) with X2 (one of many dodgy titles attributed to the film), a balls-out, mutant mash-up full of genuine characters focus, an intriguing storyline, and set-pieces worthy of the money it earned. In fact, the opening scene, which depicts newcomer Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a mutant with a forked tail and the ability to teleport, attack a small army of helpless government agents to get through to the President, blows anything the first film had to offer right out of the water.<br/><br/>With mutant antagonist Magneto (Ian McKellen) imprisoned in a plastic cell, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is focusing his time on helping the maturing students at his school for gifted youngsters. He has sent Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to Alkali Lake, in the hope of helping him discover more about his past, but he finds nothing but an abandoned military base. After the attack on the President, government operative William Stryker (Brian Cox) leads an attack on the unsuspecting Xavier's school, capturing Xavier and Cyclops (James Marsden) in order to strengthen his mysterious plans.<br/><br/>The plot summary is as compressed as can be, as, like the first film, X2 has a lot of big personalities with big, special powers with their own individual stories to tell to cram into a two-hour film. Although there are mutants with far more interesting powers and greater physical potential, the focus remains on the fan-favourite Wolverine. It's Jackman's enigmatic performance that makes him so easily likable, and he is finally allowed to roam free here. There are no soft fights where nobody dies as in X-Men; Wolverine massacres many of Stryker's men during the attack on the school. When he first drives his claws into an agent who makes the mistake of firing on him, it is the first of many air-punching moments throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's hard to fathom a threat that could actually make a dent in a race of people with such unbelievable powers, so Stryker, a man with no liking for mutants but a fascination with harnessing their powers, has found a way to subdue them. Seeing a mutant like Magneto so helpless is oddly affecting, so, after his spectacular prison break-out, he becomes a sort of anti-hero, doing the kind of dirty work Xavier would not lower himself to. But ultimately, it's the Xavier-Magneto good vs. evil fight that remains the most fascinating, and even with Stryker playing the main villain, Magneto is far from forgotten and has plans to bend Stryker's actions to his own personal gain.<br/><br/>It's a shame then that X2 marks the high-point of the series. There is now a remarkable 7 instalments set in the X-universe, and although X- Men: First Class (2011) injected some life back in the series, and hopes are high for the new X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), none have come close to the kind of energy and invention of this. Though you could complain about the lack of a coherent narrative, and that some of the minor characters are left out to dry, X2 is a near-perfect superhero movie, and is still Marvel's greatest achievement. And with almost 15 years of men in tights and capes, that is high praise indeed.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","The first X-Men movie was, in a way, a revolutionary movie. It was, more or less, considered a low budget movie and nevertheless it managed to earn a ton of money, making way for future movies. Not only did the movie turn out to be a huge financial success, but it was also quite a decent superhero movie which managed to perfectly combine action and drama. After the first movie's financial boom and positive critical reception, a sequel was bound to happen. 'X2′ was a much bigger movie then its predecessor – it had a bigger budget ($110 million), it earned more money (over $400 million) and was overall a better movie.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a mutant, later identified as the Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), attempting to assassinate the President of the USA. This failed assassination triggers a harsh human response against the mutants, and the Presidents goes with the plan of one William Stryker (Brian Cox), an army colonel who wants to storm Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for Gifted Youngsters. At the same time, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) wants to learn more about his past, and Magneto (Ian McKellen) is still in his plastic prison, but Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) has her own plans for busting him out.<br/><br/>'X2′ is the ideal example of a sequel done right. The movie contains everything which made the first one good (the social commentary, the acting, the memorable characters), and it upgrades some things that didn't really work in the first one (some of the dialogue, Halle Berry has a significantly smaller role), but still has a voice of its own. There are several newcomers to the franchise who are properly introduced and developed throughout the movie, but the one who stands out the most is Brian Cox as the movie's villain, William Stryker. Cox, aided by two other veteran actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen), makes for one impressive triumvirate of actors. This movie is worth seeing because of acting alone, but when you add to that the great fighting sequences, the amazing set pieces and strong writing – you get one really remarkable superhero movie.<br/><br/>'X2′ is not only better and bigger than its predecessor, but it's also 30 minutes longer, which may be its biggest problem. Not that the movie is boring, but there are so many subplots in the movie that 'X2′ sometimes feels like two movies crammed in one, thus being somewhat overcrowded (especially in its third act). Nonetheless, 'X2′ is still an impressive entry in the genre of superhero movie and the whole X-men franchise. Unfortunately, right after this movie, things went south for the X-men franchise.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"

","Brian Cox plays mutant-phobe William Stryker who plans on eliminating all of the world's genetic aberrations with the unwilling help of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his amazing Cerebro machine. In order to defeat Stryker, the X-Men must team up with the villainous Magneto (Ian McKellen)—but can they really trust him? (answer: of course not!).<br/><br/>I've got to hand it to director Bryan Singer: even though X-Men 2 was apparently intended as an allegory for the gay community's struggle for acceptance, there's nothing limp-wristed about its execution, the film more than delivering in the thrills department. Upping the ante in terms of jaw-dropping action set-pieces, but not at the expense of an intelligent, well-written script, this super sequel manages to be both bigger and better than the first, a hugely entertaining box-office belter from start to finish.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the sexy trio of Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn."
"callanvass","9","1","2","20 January 2014"," ""Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute"" One of the best superhero films ever made
","After Magneto has been imprisoned in an impregnable plastic chamber, the whitehouse is invaded by a mutant named ""The Nightcrawler"" His assassination attempt on the president goes awry. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to regain his memory to find out where he comes from. His former nemesis, William Stryker breaks into Prof. Xavier's school, while Magneto escapes with help from Mystique. It isn't very often that a sequel transcends it's predecessor, but X2 manages to not only surpass it, but in a huge way. Despite that the movie is over 130 minutes, it never feels overlong. As a matter of fact, it leaves you wanting more. It is completely exhilarating. The first X-Men was very exciting itself, but this one takes it up several notches. What I was most impressed about is how the story manages to be as strong as the astounding action (That plane sequence in the finale is incredible with Storm & Jean working their magic with their respective powers). I love action movies, but the action usually ends up making the film. The writers deserve all the credit in the world, along with Bryan Singer's amazing direction. It is a really multi-layered storyline. Despite that it was for selfish purposes, I got a kick out of seeing Magneto on the good guy side, and some characters that didn't get a chance to shine as much as I'd have liked in the first get to do so here, like Storm, Bobby, and a couple of others.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is as wonderful as ever as Wolverine. His anti-hero routine never gets old. The love triangle between Logan, Jean & Scott continued even further. Patrick Stewart doesn't have much to do but succumb to Stryker's son, Jason. Ian McKellen is a treat to watch as Magneto. Not only he is menacing with his performance, but creepy at times as well. Halle Berry had a little more to play with in this film. I would have liked to seen even more, but i'm happy with what I got. Famke Janssen is beautiful in more ways than one. Her character would be elevated even further in X3: The Last Stand with her alter ego, Phoenix. Kelly Hu is certainly cool looking, even if her character doesn't have a lot of depth. That being said, she didn't need any depth. Her battle with Wolverine was impressive. Brian Cox is excellent as the cunning Stryker. I'm not sure why they didn't bring him back for Wolverine, but they should have. William Stryker's character has just as, if not bigger part in Wolverine. Alan Cumming adds intrigue with his Nighcrawler character. Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, James Mardsen (Fantastic emotional scene at the end) Aaron Stanford, Shawn Asmore all do what they have to do extremely well. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This is one of the best superhero films you will ever see. It is up there with The Avengers, Spiderman II, Superman & Superman II. I consider X-Men to be a fantastic movie in its own right, but this one completely outdoes it. The action is completely exhilarating, the storyline is very engrossing, and it has plenty of great humor as well. I would have to call this film the complete package. It would take a big step back with the overblown X-Men III, sadly. <br/><br/>9.4/10"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","2","8 June 2013"," Certainly a Step Up From the First One
","X2 (2003)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>After a mutant attempts to assassinate the President, the X-Men must unite to try to defend themselves against a military attack. There's really no point going into great detail about the plot because does it really matter in the end? There's certainly an entertaining story being told here but at the same time there's no question that it's best to just turn your brain off as the movie starts and sit back and just have a blast. There's no question that this sequel is a major step up on the previous movie for a number of reasons. For one, this one here doesn't need a lot of character introduction and instead we're just given one great action scene after another. Whereas the first movie had some good stuff, all of the action scenes are made ten times bigger and ten times better. This includes a wonderful sequence where the mutant school comes under attack from the military. This is preceded by an excellent opening where one of the mutants sneaks into the White House and takes out a number of men trying to reach the President. I'm certainly not going to give away the ending but it too is pretty exciting and full of wonderful effects. Oh yeah, just check out the sequence with the police to see another perfectly directed scene by Bryan Singer. There's no question that the director is much better here as all of the scenes contain some real power and manage to be quite original as well. The actors are all at the top of their game as there's no doubt that the casting was perfect for these roles. This includes Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique. X2 is certainly an above average summer blockbuster that's only real flaw is that it runs on a tad bit too long. Still, this here is very much worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","28 July 2012"," ""Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.""
","Lots of good stuff here for Marvel Comic fans. The number of characters went beyond the first film, recognizing that viewers would be expecting to see even more mutants this time around. I thought the opening sequence was pretty exciting with Nightcrawler's (Alan Cumming) attack on the President. Not being a Marvel reader, I didn't know who he was, and it was interesting to learn his identity about the same time as Wolverine and some of the other X-Men.<br/><br/>The theme of humans versus mutants was taken to the next level here with the introduction of Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox). His mission to rid the world of all mutants emboldens the Xavier and Magneto forces to line up against him and makes for an uneasy alliance of traditional foes. At times the story is a little hard to follow, because with a shape-shifting character like Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), the significance of a scene can be changed on a dime, as in the time Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) comes on to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and the character transforms repeatedly to confuse him. Imagine having to deal with something like that in real life? <br/><br/>I think comic fans also appreciate how the film incorporates the back story of Wolverine obtaining his adamantium skeleton and his unique healing powers. The back drop of Xavier's School for the Gifted also serves the purpose of bringing comic book readers back to the origins of the X-Men as a way to reveal their more human side. I would have liked a little more humor here though; there were missed opportunities where a little more sarcasm or wit could have improved the dialog.<br/><br/>One question - after a rampage like the one at Xavier's school, who cleans up all those dead bodies?"
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","2","27 January 2012"," Substantially better than the first film
","This movie sort of begins where the previous one ended. Magneto has been defeated and is currently in a plastic prison, while Wolverine has returned to Northern Canada to check out an abandoned military facility that Xavier has discovered. Where the first film was merely an introduction to the X-men (and sort of focused on Rouge, as she was the first character we meet), this film has more of a focus on Wolverine, however we learn a little about his past, and also meet Colonel William Stryker, however at the end of the film his memories have not returned.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an attack upon the president by a mutant known as Nightcrawler (I reckon Nightcrawler is cool). His power is the power to teleport short distances, and while he can teleport through walls, he prefers not to as he could materialise inside the wall. He is can also climb walls and ceilings, as well as having a tail that acts as a third arm. While Nightcrawler attacked the president, it quickly becomes evident that he did so against his will.<br/><br/>William Stryker is a long time nemesis of Wolverine (not that Wolverine realises it) and has gained control of Magneto's prison. He uses Magneto not only to test his mind control drug, but also obtains detailed information on Carebro, Xavier's super computer. A quite mention of Carebro is that it is a computer that can only be operated by a telepath, and in the films enables the user to make a telephathic link with anybody in the world. It can also locate anybody in the world, but was made to enable Xavier to locate mutants. However, in the comics it is actually substantially more powerful in that it enables Xavier (and Jean Grey) the ability to astrally project, that is to travel anywhere in the world without actually leaving the room.<br/><br/>This film, to me, is much better than the first as there are more twists to the plot, and it is not simply a Magneto vs X-men, as was the case in the first and last films. In this film, Striker is the antagonist, and Magneto actually attempts to assist the X-men, though for his own special purposes. Xavier is kidnapped, and a powerful telepath is used to send him into a fantasy world so as to trick him into using Cerebro to pretty much kill all mutants. Adding a further twist is that the telepath (Jason 143) is Stryker's son whom he has attempted to lobotomise due to his power, though this eventually failed.<br/><br/>This is probably my favourite of the X-men films (excluding the prequel Wolverine), and it is not the last time we will see Stryker. I cannot say much about continuity in this film, particularly since it appears that the events relating to Jason and Stryker's dealings with Professor Xavier occur between the prequel Wolverine and this film. We do get glimpses of Wolverine's past, particularly when he enters in room where it is believed his skeleton was coated with Adamantium. However it is unclear in this film whether he lost his memory in the process or not (I believe that he did not, though this becomes much clearer in the prequel)."

"darren-cb","8","1","2","22 October 2011"," X-Men mutates into something better
","X-Men 2 was the original Dark Knight. A superhero sequel that steps up everything from the first and becomes one of the all time superhero greats instantly. It's a much better tale than the first one and becomes a more complete and satisfying story.<br/><br/>It works better than the first one mostly in that it's plot is a significant step up. The first one chose to spend as much time as possible on Rogue and Wolverine and whilst Wolverine is a genuinely interesting character, Rogue is not and the entire first movie felt like a slog through her life and her rather boring life-story. However in X-Men 2 they scrapped this and made every character get a similar amount of screen time and aside from a few (Cyclops) they all get time to expand and do something on the screen. The other significant benefit is the sophisticated villain and plot, whereas the first one had a villain, who was slightly under-developed, and a plan that for a movie of its magnitude kind of lacked much imagination or sophistication whereas here the clues are presented from the beginning, the plot takes a dark turn and the storyline is not as clichéd as the original.<br/><br/>Another benefit is that whilst the first one had to waste time developing and introducing characters this one just starts and runs with it and here is the best thing about this movie: character relations. Magneto develops more than his bad guy stance in the last movie. Wolverine becomes more like we've always him to be: violent and dark, but fundamentally good. Rogue has a role but is not as significant, Bobby has some great scenes. Jean Grey has a great transition throughout the movie. Storm doesn't do much but is constantly present. Pyro has a nice development and minor twist. Professor X becomes a far more deeper character. The villain is thoroughly evil. His son is a dark and depressing character and provides one of the biggest atmospheres a mute character can create. Cyclops goes missing half way through this movie but soon pops up again rather randomly. And the star of the show is ... Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler is an amazing character, well thought out, interesting, greatly used and really well developed.<br/><br/>But the best thing about this movie is that whereas the first one was ""sort-of-wow"", this is non-stop ""cool"". Magneto's escape is genius, other metallic deaths are worthy of a cinema ticket in itself and practically every other character has an awesome power used to awesome effect here.<br/><br/>So, is this movie perfect? Hell no. Sophisticated plot aside, the ending is far too simplistic. The twist is also a pity, ruining a hell of a lot of character development. Problems also arise around through a few plot holes, both early on and late in the movie - and the most frustrating things about these plot-holes, some of them are in the start of the movie and could be sorted with one line of dialogue later on! Overall, every way a superior movie to X-men, not without it's fault but it's got to be one of the top 5 superhero movies of all time."

","This one didn't age nearly as gracefully as I'd hoped. I remember adoring it in the theater and later at home on DVD, but by today's standards it's hokey and hard to take seriously. I'm not sure if that's a symptom of the better comic book movies being released as a direct result of this franchise or a simple case of the old rose-colored goggles, but either way it wasn't nearly the tour de force I had remembered. That being said, the sheer amount of acting star power in this film is still astonishing from top to bottom, and it remains a quality action flick. Xavier's first sequel remains a fine moment; it's just been surpassed."

","X2 X-Men United- 2003 Opening with one of the best introduction to X-Men universe of any movie, this movie starts out with a bang. The Nightcrawler invasion itself could be a short movie on its own, accompanied by Mozart's Requiem and the best interpretation of the character in all of his glory. The movie starts out by locating this mutant to isolate the human's retribution towards the attack, but it turns out to be a greater scheme regarding Wolverine's past and Magneto's true mirror in terms of intentions. This allows the movie to have 2 villains with different motives and not necessarily aligned with one another, making the film more interesting. Magneto and Xavier are not as prominent as the previous film, but just as powerful such as the scene where Xavier can notice that something is wrong with his friend just by looking at him. Nightcrawler has a romantic angle with Storm that is somewhat believable; Mystique has more action-spy scenes but missed opportunities with the relationships they could have played with Mystique and Nightcrawler. Lady Deathstrike serves as a good action scene where she fights Wolverine, but again she has zero character development, since she is under Jason's mind control and you truly feel sorry for her when she gets the Adamantium overdose. Pyro is a great character but severely underused and instead we have to endure the dull Rogue and Iceman who are even more boring and useless than the previous movie, especially Rogue since she no longer has that relationship with Wolverine that she had in the previous film. In the film's greatest defense; however, the overall story with Jason, Striker's mutant son who is an illusionist, to use Xavier to kill all of the mutants is downright genius, especially when Magneto uses it to his own advantage. Wolverine's berserker mode is also a treat in the movie during the mansion invasion. Looking back at these movies, X-Men and this sequel along with First Class, X2 has the bigger and more interesting scheme and more interesting villains but it also has too many missed opportunities regarding Mystique, Lady Deathstrike, Pyro, and Cyclops who are completely shafted in the film. In the case of Mystique, I refer to the opportunities the filmmakers could have included with Nightcrawler. The film also has one of the dumbest lines along with the toad electrocuted line from the first one and that is ""Have you tried not being a mutant?"" This is the equivalent of asking a dog ""Have you tried not being a dog?"" is the same logic and it comes off as silly in what is supposed to be a dramatic scene. Overall, the movie is better than its predecessor besides its missed opportunities since the villains are so enthralling and the plot is more dangerous and bigger in scope."

","X2 is directed by Bryan Singer who co-wrote the story with David Hayter & Zak Penn. The screenplay is jointly written by Hayter, Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, and the source material, Uncanny X-Men was by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby. Cinematography is by Newton Thomas Sigel and the music score is provided by John Ottman; who also edits the film. The ensemble cast features amongst others, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Famke Jansen, Halle Berry, Alan Cumming, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden and Kelly Hu. It is the sequel to the financial and critically successful X-Men released in 2000.<br/><br/>Plot, in short, sees Colonel William Stryker (Cox) declare war on all mutants: especially the X-Men superhero group. This forces Xavier's (Stewart) army to do the unthinkable; join forces with arch enemy Magneto (McKellen). But there is many perils in the way, and some murky pasts and future decisions are about to be unleashed into the maelstrom.<br/><br/>It has often been the source of much debate and musings, the old general feeling that sequels tend to be rubbish. While that is largely true as a whole, the niche that encompasses the superhero adaptation can rightly claim to have dispelled that argument in the last ten years or so. In fact many would argue that Superman II, Batman Returns & Blade II are better film's than the lead off picture that went before them, thus giving ""the superhero sequel is better"" debate more longevity of reference. Think Spiderman 2, The Dark Knight and, yes, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, and it's good grounds to believe that the mention of a superhero sequel no longer brings apprehension and dread: but hope and a belief that directors can now improve on that first touchy feely franchise starter. Which is where X2 comes in, a film that is not only one of the best superhero sequels ever, it's also one of the best sequels ever, period.<br/><br/>In the three year gap between the first film and this sequel, Singer has had time to broaden what was appealing in that first film, whilst also getting a longer running time and a bigger budget to do the job right. The end result is a film that in every department improves upon its predecessor. The returning characters, except for Marsden's Cyclops, get more depth and time on screen, and the new characters that come and join in the mêlée, also bring with them truly great rewards. None more so that Cumming's delightful teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler, who gets to open the film up with a jaw-dropping sequence, that not only introduces us to a great new character, but also lets us know that Singer has mastered the art of shooting action. Yes it's that good. On the enemy side of things; Cox as Stryker is wickedly nasty and Kelly Hu's deliciously named Lady Deathstrike is a worthy opponent for Wolverine. Ah yes, Wolverine. As with the first film, Wolverine, beautifully essayed by the charismatic Jackman, is the core character thread. We like that he gets to kick more ass this time, that he is doing it with more back story, and in a state of anger and confusion, only serves to entertain more. Into the pot also goes the Junior X-Men, with Pyro (Aaron Sandford) & Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) joining Rogue (Paquin) for some mutant angst.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on, but it's easy to follow and all the ingredients come together smartly. It's a credit to Singer and his writing team (and Ottman's editing) that even tho there's much in the pot it still feels lean and brisk, and, that continuity from the first film has been easily attained. The thematics have remained dark edged (hatred of minorities/alienation etc), but the film is not without humour either. While the effects are stylish and the set-pieces scintillating. Singer was saying during production that he felt The Empire Strikes Back was his marker for X2; that his film is worthy of being spoke of in the same sentence is the highest accolade we can give it. 9/10"

All the cast members return, such a welcoming prospect from the start. plus there many new and exciting characters, all acted excellently. Alan Cumming was just astonishing as NightCrawler, while the sexy Kelly Hu really wasn't given much dialogue in the film but this is expected due to the nature of the character and her focus in the story. Brian Cox was pretty damn good in it as well, coming off as very threatening and sinister. And Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin get a lot more development this time around. Ever character gets their adequate screen time and Singer just handled them so well, it amazes me to this day. Kudos to Zak Penn and the other writers.<br/><br/>In this movie we get the best interpretation of Wolverine's past life, which was so horrendously raped in the new spin off ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Plus the score was just plain great, John Ottoman is definitely among my favorite composers. This movie is the best of the trilogy plus the stupid as f*ck spin off.

The music is excellent (for example in the early scenes of the movie, when Nightcrawler attempts at killing the president) and varied all along the movie. Added to this, we are presented with a bunch of new characters (new or more present than in the first film) : I particularly liked the character of Iceman, for many reasons, and that of Pyro, we see how he eventually ceases to be ""a good guy"" and rejoins Magneto. Another very good point is that the line between good and evil is (slightly) tarnished by moments, for instance, when the X-men side with Magneto in order to fight against ... a new ""evil"" ! This is to be found when Magneto and Pyro discuss for the first time in the plot, when they are aboard the plane. <br/><br/>To get back to the characters, I would praise in another review that the character of Mystique, which I really appreciated to see one more time on screen, I think that she actually adds something to the screenplay and the general atmosphere of the movie. Like I said, the intervention of a dozen of new characters on screen(really!) is a big plus for the franchise even though it seems logical to include them as many already were in the comics. Another good point was that Kelly Hu was so astonishing for the part of Lady Deathstrike that I had the impression to watch something like Terminator III, which of course does not disturb me. The FXs are tolerable, like always, for example when Magneto manages to escape his plastic prison (I really liked the idea that Laurio had too much iron in his blood.) <br/><br/>As far as the plot is concerned, I would say that it is far more ''complex'' : it is easy to understand but the audience clearly sees that the screenplay has been worked upon very carefully and seriously. Some scenes I found long but far from boring. I don't believe in the death of ''who-you-know'' (let us avoid spoilers :D), this character is too important for it to die like this... we'll see. To put it in a nutshell, if you have not seen X2 and wish to see it, do it, but watch X-Men 1 first : the evolution (of the franchise, not of mankind !) is obvious and positive, let's hope that the suite to the franchise is better."

","What did fans of the original wanted in a sequel to make the ""perfect"" super hero movie? More characters. You got em. You get more good guys and for our pleasure, more evil enemies. Yes! Everyone now got a proper story and character development. I respect Wolverine being the main ""hero"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed sexy Rogue's love interest and how it develops as the movie's running time develops.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin is extremely sexy, hot. I had a thing for her in this movie.<br/><br/>The f/x were better this time. The whole President of the USA sub-plot was very interesting and the political point of view made me vibe! I watched this one in the theater with my buddies and we had what we wanted. A spectacular movie that entertained us big time with non-stop action, an interesting story, cool f/X, and dynamic.<br/><br/>This is a prime example of how a sequel can be better than the original."
"Ziya90","9","1","2","7 February 2010"," The comic book tone of the first film is missing here, but still a great, powerful movie
","I watched the movie for the first time at theater in 2003 and disappointed. It seemed me less entertaining and pretty slow paced. However, later, I took its DVD and watched it again, completely changed my mind. X-2 is as entertaining as the first one and again with great, amazing action scenes. Plus, the movie is deeper, more powerful than the first one owing to the brilliant script. The opening sequence of the movie is one of the best opening sequences so far. However, one of my favorite parts, may be favorite part is the assault sequence. It is spectacular, not showy. Especially editing and sound editing are great and to me it deserves to be included in cinema anthology, at least action cinema anthology. I like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, but whatever he does, he cannot be as tough as the original character, in other words, he does not look like a threat. Sorry, but Brian Cox's William Stryker is much more better than Danny Huston's William Stryker. The man with the wheel chair must be one of the most important characters of X-Men myth, but I did not know this character, still I don't know, I haven't searched, so I cold not understand that part exactly. The cell of Magneto recalls the cell of Hannibal Lecter obviously. The plan of him and Mystique was probably one of the most smart plans in cinema. As for the X-jet sequence, like the assault part, it deserves to be included in the bests. Except Behind Enemy Lines, the greatest 'jet' sequence is here. Spectacular and especially sound editing is great. Twister moments were unbelievable. Wolverine Deathstrike fight is very harsh (as I know, because of the complaints of the fans, Singer made fights more tough) but a bit exaggerating and showy. However, there are more amazing scenes, more action and sub stories in the movie."
"kylehodgdon","8","1","2","11 November 2009"," Much Better Than The First
","This X-Men movie is great from beginning to end. The story was great, the fights were perfect, the characters were interesting, everything had a purpose, and it left you wanting more. <br/><br/>This being a sequel definitely had an advantage over the first in the series due to the fact that the characters did not have to be introduced. Instead, the main arc of the story could take off right from the get go. <br/><br/>Nightcrawler looks great and they did a wonderful job with the CGI of his teleportation ability. <br/><br/>One of the only problems with this movie is that there are so many characters for a two hour film that all could not be included. Instead of having something going on, Cyclops had to spend most of the movie knocked out somewhere. I know I'm in the minority here, but personally I could have watched a four hour movie with a grandiose story which included all characters containing sub-stories for each to be occupied with. But I definitely know that most people have no desire to watch an extra long X-Men movie like that.<br/><br/>I did enjoy ""The Last Stand"" a bit more than ""X2"", but that is by a very small margin. Both movies are terrific and worth seeing."

","A year after the courageous mutant team known as The X-Men saved New York from destruction, it seems there has been a terrorist attack at the White House made a blue devil-like mutant named Nightcrawler a.k.a. Kurt Wagner (Alan Cumming). Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) seems to be having a wonderful relationship together and Logan a.k.a. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still struggling to remember his past including his origins on a man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) who was the man that gave him his adamantium skeleton. Now after the threat at the White House it seems that humans are being against mutants, Stryker terrorizes the school of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) as he kidnaps some of the mutant students so he can conduct experiments on them. Stryker also wants to learn the secret of Cerebro so he can use it to harm all mutants in the world as it's now up to Cyclops (James Marsen), Wolverine, Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and now teamed up with enemies Magneto (Ian Mckellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) to try to save both humanity and mutants alike from this new menace but can Magneto be trusted? <br/><br/>A sequel that surpasses the original in every single way! this one is from the original director/story writer/producer Bryan Singer who brilliantly brought the Marvel comic to life. This one features more mutants like Lady Deathstike (Kelly Hu), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart) and Alan Cumming whom i mentioned as Nightcrawler. The cast and crew are reunited including Stan Lee who serves as executive producer as the film saga continues on allegories on people of different races, sexualities, and disabilities. The film does offer a grand dose of action, humor and more great acting from the talented cast.<br/><br/>A must see!"
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","2","20 August 2009"," The best in the series.
","X2: X-Men united is without a doubt the best in the series. I thought the first film was rather short, but the sequel improved a lot. If you were curious about Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) in the last film then you learn a tad about him in this film. If you've seen X-Men origins: Wolverine, than you should think that that's a prequel to this. It's a prequel to the entire series. But that film relates mostly to this film. The sequel has everyone from the original film returning, including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Halle Berry, Famke Jansen, and others. Also, Bryan Singer, a decent director who has had some great films like The Usual Suspects, returns also. He has improved the sequel in many ways. Not that the original was bad, I really liked the original film. The sequel has something that the original didn't have. I can't think of what it is, but X2: X-Men united truly is the best in the series and is one of the best comic book films. Not quite a Dark Knight, but it is still a great movie.<br/><br/>The Plot: The X-Men are in a pickle when a general from Wolverine's past comes and kidnaps some of the students. They also try to hunt down an assassin who tried to kill the president."

","I loved this movie and Bryan Singer again brought some brilliant stuff to this movie!!I loved it so much!! I want to buy the DVD so badly!! The plot is excellent and I really enjoyed it!!! The budget was bigger, the cast got larger, the story got deeper and more fascinating, THE MOVIE WAS MORE EPIC!!!! I loved how the brotherhood teamed up with the X-Men and were fighting against Stryker, then after that problem was solved they fought...I think because I haven't watched it in a while. Anyways the movie was awesome.The ending, however was a little bit sad but it was good. And I knew from the first X-Movie(just like you) that Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) fell in love with Jean(Famke Janssen) because of the way he looked at her and she had a thing for him too even though she was with Scott(James Mardsen). 10/10, Highly recommend you watching if you haven't yet."
"KillerLord","9","1","2","9 June 2009"," Brian Singer's Corrections! Well Done!
","I was not at all happy with the slowness and dullness of the first installment of the X-Men. And I had compared it with Superman Returns and concluded that perhaps slow was how Singer did his work. At least, to me. I had argued that one does not need to make a story too strong if he can give some breathtaking sequences that leave us spell-bound which too were quite absent in the first installment. It is almost as if Brian Singer was aware of these and decided to correct them in the second installment.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, there is still no significant change. The story has not much of a higher dimension but I never felt the absence of this since the action was just too well done in the movie. There are some really amazing and breathtaking sequences throughout the movie. The action unfolds very smoothly and the places and action are so believable in the sense that there is no cartoon-like touch to it. A very strong job done by the CGI people.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with newer kinds of X-Men with better and unique abilities setting the stage for some fantastic battles. And the best part is that we have some shades in the characters now that make us identify with them. The character of Wolverine is better developed and makes us wonder about him. Xavier wins our respect with his silent and spiritual way of looking at the world. Surprise! The presence of mutual respect between Magneto and Xavier also wins us over! It is just too well exhibited. Overall, there are shades of emotions in the character that make them involving.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a much better package than its predecessor which was quite devoid of proper emotions, character stress and development and for that matter - stunning action. This movie takes the standards way ahead and is just a good package."
"tburke85","8","1","2","19 May 2009"," X-Men United A Much Better Sequel With Some Flaws
","I thought this one of those rare sequels that was actually much better improvement over the first one but there were some flaws. The film is no Dark Knight or Spider-man 2 but I'd say that it's just as good as either Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. Bryan Singer does an admirable job with this sequel giving the audiences some more interesting characters (but it can feel a bit much at times) and just enough exhilarating sci-fi action. Singer improves on some of the flaws in the first one but some are still in the sequel but the good outweighs the bad. The cast are great in their roles including Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, Ian McKellen as Eric Lesherr/Magento, Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe/Storm, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey (Phoenix), James Marsden as Scott Summers/Cyclops, Rebecca Romijin Stamos as Mystique, and Anna Paquin Marie D'Ancanto/Rogue. Joining the cast are Brian Cox as one of the villains Colonel William Striker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike, and Alan Cumming as Kurt Warner/Nightcrawler. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their roles but unfortunately they don't get a lot of screen time and aren't developed either. Magneto, Mystique, Striker, and Deathstrike prove to be effective villains. But how many villains can you have in one movie? Other than Deathstrike not being in it much and having almost no dialogue. The actors and actresses bring a lot to their roles no matter how big or small it may be. On the side of good Wolverine, Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler prove to be believable heroes in the imaginary world they inhabit where mutants and humans are trying to co-exist. Some of the flaws in the last film are in this one as well like the fact that they still seem to be juggling too many characters (Colossus, Jubilee, and Kitty Pride have nothing more than brief cameos). Patrick Stewarts Charles Xavier and James Marsden's Cyclops also seemed to have less screen time than they did in the first film as well. Cyclops disappears for a large parts of the movie (like Xavier) only to show up near the end. The other supporting characters including Iceman and Pyro have bigger roles that some of the others but they still lack screen time. Bruce Davison also returns for a brief blink and you missed it appearance as Senator Kelly from the first film (He's actually Mystique because his character died in the first X-Men). With it's flaws aside X-Men United is still definitely a much better improvement over it's predecessor and is an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. From it's incredible opening sequence involving a teleporting Nightcrawler to it's emotional climax involving the possible death of a major character X-Men United has plenty action, suspense, thrills, drama, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","1","2","4 May 2009"," The war has begun
","I base this on the 2-Disc release. It has started, and it simply rocks. This whole thing builds on almost all of what the first set up and did, in so many ways, and in fact goes places only a follow-up could. Now that the world and the universe have been established, they could afford to do interesting stuff with what they had, and this the romance is just part of it. The new is also impeccable... the villain, the addition of Nightcrawler, so much is brought to the table with this, food for thought, complexity, dense, more than meets the eye. This is bigger than its predecessor, and without becoming pure fluff in the process. The action is grander, without being the main focus. The themes are the same, with a couple of different explorations of them this time around. The attention to detail is still amazing. The plot is well-done, nice script, very intriguing, and the pacing is spot-on, never standing still and not overwhelming, either. The nods to the comics are marvelous. The humor is well-done and fitting. The dialog is mostly good and well-delivered. The effects are incredible, and better than before. There are utterly stunning visuals in this. The fights are memorable and awesome. The ending of X-Men pays off majorly in this. This is quite dramatic. The orchestral score is fantastic. The powers are used well, such as the morphing(in this as well as the entry before it), and they look excellent. Production design is spectacular. The costumes, the tone in general remains true to the realistic approach. Cummings is well-cast, as well as Cox and Hu. The acting is, with few exceptions, invariably magnificent. There are strong women role models in this one, too. The problem of X1 has not been solved in this, in fact, if anything, it's made worse. There is an even greater amount of characters, and far from everyone gets to be developed in this. It does tend to work and there are fairly solid arcs in this. The abilities yet again have to be written around or out of the way entirely. These don't cost it a lot of points overall, I would say. There is relatively mild and infrequent language in this, and the sensuality is somewhat present, not necessarily strong. The DVD holds extras, including featurettes, interviews, behind-the-scenes stuff, extended/deleted scenes, plenty of galleries and two commentary tracks, one of Bryan Singer, and one of various crew-members, both well worth listening to. I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels, just watch the movie series from the 2000 film, and know that these translations, interpretations, not direct adaptations with everything accurate to the books. Those into science fiction ought to enjoy it, as well. And proof that sequels can match, and, arguably, surpass, the original, is always something to take note of. 9/10"
"roses_are_red14","3","1","2","23 December 2008"," Damn, disappointing
","So disappointing! I loved X Men, but what the hell happened on X Men 2? In the name of ""development"" all the original X Men characters were merely stretched, then lost. All mystery in any of their characters was gone, spelled out on the screen in neon lights and boring stereotypes. X Men 1 was utterly engaging; number 2 was kind of disgusting. When a movie shows all the cards of all the characters it feels a bit like seeing all of your acquaintances in the nude. Where's mystery? What can we possibly talk about now that will top what I've just seen? Possibly a large part of these problems came from having to squish character ""development"" in amongst the over-worked plot and gratuitous action sequences. I love action, but I demand a certain level of motivation and tension which this film just didn't manage to provide. Singer has lost his way on this one, sorry :-("
"Tweekums","8","1","2","16 November 2008"," An Excellent Sequel
","I enjoyed the original X-Men film so looked forward to seeing the second in the series, I was not disappointed. All of the mutants who survived the first film are back in this one along with a few new ones, most notably Nightcrawler, played by Alan Cumming who we first see as he enters the White House and appears to make an attempt on the presidents life.<br/><br/>This attack is used as an excuse to raid Professor Xavier's school by General Stryker (Brian Cox). Simultaneously he captures the Professor and Cyclops while they are visiting Magneto in his plastic prison and Storm and Jean are attempting to find the mutant who attacked the president. Luckily Stryker's team don't manage to capture all of the people at the school, several including Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman and Pyro escape. These four head to Boston to meet up with Storm and Jean, before meeting them however they end up in a confrontation with the police that could make matters worse for the mutants. While all this has being going on Magneto has escaped from prison with the help of his shape-shifting sidekick Mystique.<br/><br/>Given the threat posed to mutant kind by Stryker the remaining X-Men form an unlikely alliance with Magneto so they can free the Professor before he is tricked into doing Stryker's dirty work for him.<br/><br/>As with the previous film the acting, direction and special effects are very good, if anything the characters are better, I found Nightcrawler to be more interesting than the two mutants that were killed off in the first film and Brian Cox was impressive as General Stryker. If you haven't seen the original film I'd advise you watch it first as it introduces most of the characters and explains what skills they each have."
"Electrified_Voltage","9","1","2","22 April 2008"," Another decent comic book movie, like the first ""X-Men"", but slightly superior
","When I went to see this in the theatre back in 2003, I had never seen the first ""X-Men"" movie, but could remember some of the main characters fairly well, thanks to certain childhood memories, mainly from watching the animated TV series. I'm not exactly sure how impressed I was when I saw this sequel to the 2000 blockbuster, so it obviously wasn't the greatest movie-going experience I've ever had, but it definitely was better than going to see ""Hulk"" about a month later. Since then, however, I have seen all three movies in the trilogy more than once, and would say this is the best one, the worst being the third.<br/><br/>During a White House tour, a mutant comes along and soon attacks, attempting to assassinate the President! The President is saved, but after this, the mutant population is once again in danger, as the fear and hatred of mutants from the rest of humanity increases! A scientist and military leader named William Stryker, a major threat to the mutant population, gathers information from the now imprisoned Magneto about the X-Mansion! He then comes to the mansion with his armed forces, where they attack the school! Some mutants manage to escape, including Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro, who go and meet up with Jean and Storm. Meanwhile, Stryker has managed to capture Professor Charles Xavier and intends to use him for his evil plans against mutants! Magneto soon escapes from his prison cell, and he and Mystique meet up with a group of X-Mansion residents. The mutants must put aside their differences for now and unite to stop Stryker! <br/><br/>Like its predecessor, and like most other comic book movies from recent years, ""X2"" has some fairly weak moments. The White House attack scene could have been better, and perhaps choral music wasn't the best choice for it. However, overall, this is another comic book movie that works. For those who want action and suspense, there's lots of that in this film, as well as some excellent sets and special effects (not unlike the first film), but that's not all. The movie adds another character who was not in the first movie named Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, a mutant who turns out to be good. He's a good addition to the story, and what he tells Storm and Jean when they find him is a very moving moment in the film, which reminds me, the story here is a bit deeper and more moving than that of the first live action ""X-Men"" feature. Like the original, there are also some good humorous moments, such as a cat purring and licking Wolverine's claws. Lastly, the dialogue in the film is sometimes weak (which can be expected in these comic book movies from the past ten years or so), but some of the dialogue is quite strong (including the Kurt Wagner speech I mentioned), which cannot be said about some of the other recent comic book movies, some of which are pretty lame.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the first movie in the ""X-Men"" trilogy, or you dislike recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, then you're probably not missing much if you haven't seen this sequel. As you probably know already, you might as well skip it. Some people generally don't care for films of this type, whether the films are well-received or not. However, I'm sure most people who have been impressed with the 2000 comic book movie have also been impressed with this sequel, many of them more so than they have been the original, and I think that includes me! Sequels are usually expected to be inferior to their predecessors, but occasionally, there are times when they turn out to be superior, and I guess this is one of those cases, even though the third installment, "" X-Men: The Last Stand"" turned out to be significantly inferior to both of the previous installments, unfortunately."

Magneto is locked up in a plastic cell, Rogue and Bobby Drake have finally got together, and Wolverine has set off to find the origins of where he came from. But it wont stay quiet for long. After a mutant attack on the President, everyone starts to fear any type of mutant. William Stryker who plans to stop all mutants, takes over the school, causing Wolverine and his team of mutants to go into hiding. Stryker has managed to capture Xavier and will use him to create another version of cerebro. Wolverine and the team must now team up with their enemy, Magneto to stop Stryker before it's too late.<br/><br/>When Bryan Singer brought us 'X-Men' back in 2000, it was a superhero comic book movie which the audience had not seen in a long time. For the sequel, 'X2', Singer has the opportunity to make it even better. He does this wonderfully. He has created another amazing story, which is much more interesting than the original film. Having humans as the enemies towards the mutants, give an interesting twist on the story. The special effects are amazing again, and so realistic. All the wonderful characters are back too, with more more action for characters such as Iceman and Pyro. Unfortunately, James Marsden gets a very small amount of screen time, which is a shame. Even if your not a comic book fan, you should try and give this ago. Even if you haven't seen the first film, this sequel is still easy to pick up.<br/><br/>""We love what you've done with your hair."" - Magneto (Ian McKellen)"
"brando647","9","1","2","24 September 2007"," What an X-Men film SHOULD be!
","Wow. Just...wow. This movie turned out to be everything I had hoped the first X-Men film would be. Plenty of action, plenty of story, and terrific performances from the cast. I had a couple of complaints about the introduction to one of my favorite Marvel franchises, but all of those complaints are gone with the newest installment. The movie begins with strength (a great scene of Nightcrawler attacking the White House) and doesn't slow down until the end credits roll.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the best things to look forward to when a new X-Men film is being released is ""What new characters are they bringing in this time?"" and once again, Singer brings nothing but the best. The sequel introduces Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming does an awesome job with one of my favorite X-Men), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu). As for Brian Cox, I enjoy watching him in just about any role, and he brings a perfect restrained hatred to the character of William Stryker, the military scientist whose plans bring the X-Men and Brotherhood to work together. I was also happy to see that Bobby Drake (Iceman) was given a larger role; seeing as how in the comics, Iceman was one of the first X-Men, I thought they severely underused him in the first film.<br/><br/>Since a majority of the characters were introduced already, Singer didn't have to slow things down this time around so the audience could get to know everyone. Where I thought the first film had a handful of moments that dragged, this one has none. Despite that this movie times at just over 2 hours, it feels like it flies by. Even better, the action in this movie is more brutal, showing more of what Wolverine is capable of (he IS the best at what he does, after all...). We even get a better glimpse at the mutants' powers in action with special effects that are even better than last time.<br/><br/>The one and only problem with the film was pretty much unavoidable. In a movie with a cast this large, some characters are bound to be underused. I thought Deathstrike was a great addition to the roster, but she is only given ONE line and ONE fight scene (granted, it's a freakin' awesome fight). The character of Colossus was brought in (FINALLY!) but only made a brief appearance. But, I do understand the limits when trying to include so many people in a single movie and I don't let it get to me.<br/><br/>This movie is yet another example that a sequel can surpass the original. I couldn't be happier with the latest in the franchise and this movie is going to rank high as my favorite movies for years to come."
"Lord_Crypto","10","1","2","28 July 2007"," Brilliant Storytelling and Brilliant Acting
","Brilliant Storytelling and Brilliant Acting is what make this the Best X-men Film. Bryan Singer has done an incredible job with the X-men series and after this sequel, it is no wonder why. This is a brilliant film with little flaws, terrific acting, and a wonderful storyline. This is one of the best comic book movies to date.<br/><br/>Not only do the excellent actors in Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, and Rebecca Romijn return as great characters but we see a whole new line of excellent characters and actors. One of which is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. His character is so amazing in this film and Cumming does a beautiful job of bringing it out. His character is so likable and the entire part of the story focusing around him: his back-story, his faith, and the effect he has on Storm is wonderful. Speaking of Storm, Halle Berry plays a strong role in this film as Storm. I disliked her in the first film but she does better in this one. We finally begin to see her emerge as a leader and as a dynamic force to this X-men unit. Brian Cox delivers an incredible performance in this film as William Stryker. He captures his characters mental instability perfectly on screen. And a big compliment goes out to Aaron Stanford. He is a perfect actor for the character Pyro. He has a certain anger and ""deadliness"" characteristic to his appearance that makes him well suited for the part.<br/><br/>I would also like to add that I think this film is Mystique at her best. Rebecca Romijn takes complete control of her character in this film and holds little to nothing back. Her character has evolved into an even more evil, dangerous, and wicked character from the first film. Her performance in this film is extremely notable.<br/><br/>There are some small problems I have with the characters. I do dislike Icemans character in this film. He seems to much like a wimp and do-what-your-told character. Cyclops seems like he is gone for way to long in the movie. He may appear in like the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes. This film was the first in his descent as a critical character.<br/><br/>I like this film because it is a teaser to the young mutants powers. We begin to see just some of the capabilities Iceman has. Another teaser, seeing Colossus for the first time transform. And of course, the ultimate power that Pyro possesses and not only how well he can handle it, but also how dangerous he truly is with it. I would have liked to see more with these characters powers but I understand they are developing and these ""glimpses"" are just a teaser to show what they are developing into and what they will be capable of in future films.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great is the story. There is little to no flaws with this movie and it is so easy to get sucked into the story. It is very easy to follow yet has a deep and powerful meaning to it. So many concepts are touched on in the movie (Wolverines past, Developing more powerful side of Jean Grey (Phoenix!)) with little to no inconsistencies affecting the major storyline. This is one of the best stories, I believe, ever written for a film and I give a tip of the hat to the list of writers and screenplay writers.<br/><br/>The movie is amazing in that so much happens but you do not feel like anything was wasted in the end. You feel like every pivotal character was touched on enough, no big character got left out of anything, and you are left with a feeling of satisfaction. This is a truly wonderful film."

","X2 (2003) We all wonder about that old saying, are sequels better than the first? Most of the time, no. However this time, yep. Better. Far better.<br/><br/>X2 has what X-Men did not, character development. despite being introduced to so many new mutants, we learn about them and their personality. We learn more about Wolverine who has a clue about his past that is more complicated than ever. Who is he? What happened? <br/><br/>We meet another mew one in Pyro. He seems a little cocky and explains his unique power. Another(and personal favorite)is Nightcrawler. He nearly assassinated the president and has no idea why he attempted something like that. The fights at the white house were spectacular to behold. The visuals alone will no doubt keep you entertained.<br/><br/>We still don't know much about Mystique but she does show a little character and is used much better here. The turn of events in the movie force the X-Men to unite with the Brotherhood to stop a problem that is calculating and cold.<br/><br/>Enter William Stryker. A mystery himself. Played by Brian Cox, expect a good performance no doubt. He is rather sadistic and has a purpose and will do anything to fulfill that agenda. Anything.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks here is that Cyclops is M.I.A. though a lot of the movie, and Lady Deathstrike. Well casted by Kelly Hu is naturally awesome, but has no dialog at all. No story. Monster disappointment.<br/><br/>X2 is certainly better than X-Men. The battles here are far superior than the first. the special FX are awesome, and character development is here! <br/><br/>The Last Word: X2 is awesome. What the first movie lacked, this one gave us that and then some. The only thing keeping this from a ten is the lack of development for Cyclops and Lady Deathstrike.(especially Deathstrike) Although not perfect(but damn close), X2 rocked! Recommended."
"crazyrabbits","6","1","2","11 June 2006"," This sequel doesn't soar...
","Due to my recent viewing of the film, ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"", I went back and watched ""X2: X-Men United"" again? Was it as good as everyone said it was? Well...<br/><br/>The film, if you already didn't know what it was about, revolves around Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman, who gives a very skillful performance) trying to stop Colonel William Stryker (played by Brian Cox), a military Colonel who (surprise, surprise) wants to kill all mutants. Oh, and there are some other characters, but they don't do much, which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>A lot of the characters in this film are criminally underused. Yes, we have Wolverine chopping and impaling and slicing enemies galore, but what about everyone else? This is not ""Wolverine and Friends"", this is the X-Men, for God's sake! Cyclops appears for all of a few minutes, then he gets beat and kidnapped for most of the film. Nightcrawler, admittedly, has an amazing opening sequence where he attempts to assassinate the President while brainwashed, but then he becomes virtually useless until the last part of the movie, where he (you guessed it) only uses his teleporting powers, and we never get to see him fight anyone else. I think the filmmakers were trying to go somewhere with Pyro, Rogue and Bobby Drake, but as it is, they only really have a part in the middle of the film, then become background noise. There are other cameos by Kitty Pryde, Colossus and Hank McCoy as a human, but it feels like they were only put there as lip service to the fans.<br/><br/>The acting in the film, however, is quite consistent and strong. Most notably, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan (as Charles Xavier and Magneto, respectively) both carry their parts incredibly well, and, as in the first film, make you feel like they've known each other for a long time, and have been through quite a few things together. The rest of the supporting cast is quite good as well, although they don't get many moments to shine.<br/><br/>I will say, for all the thought put into the film, there are a number of blatant plot issues. For instance, why would Jean Grey feel the need to step outside of the X-Jet and raise the ship up while controlling the tidal wave, when she could do the exact same thing while standing inside the craft? And what's with the abundance of exposition in the film? Things told to us in the beginning of the film(such as Kurt's ability to transport, Magneto's helmet, Pyro's desire to do more with his powers) are then blatantly set up as foreshadowing over and over again, and as a result, the rest of the film becomes predictable.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with the film is the lack of teamwork present between all the X-Men. Most of the fights in the film are set up so that a main character will go off on their own, get into a skirmish, and then rejoin the rest of the main party later on. Numerous examples of this style occur, including: Wolverine vs. Lady Deathstrike, Pyro vs. police officers, Wolverine vs. Colonel Stryker, Mystique vs. soldiers, Jean vs. Cyclops, and even Magneto vs. more soldiers.<br/><br/>However, the action scenes were very well-choreographed, and kept me interested in the action.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: In conclusion, I enjoyed it for what it was, a big silly Hollywood blockbuster, but I expected more out of it. I give this film a 6 out of 10. If they had focused more on the comic book aspects and teamwork, the film would have been much better."
"Quinoa1984","8","1","2","27 May 2006"," above average comic-book sequel
","X2 was a movie I revisited before seeing the 3rd X-Men movie, and I'm reminded how director Bryan Singer, in one of his best films here, can have control, style and even moving artistry for this kind of popcorn entertainment he's now done with these two films (and will do soon with Superman perhaps) while still making it witty and dramatically engaging. That's not too common in a time when studios will gladly shill out pieces that have the painstaking (well, maybe not so much in 06) special effects and technical side to it while not having jack-s*** with the story and dialog.<br/><br/>It helps with X2 that the actors are good professionals rising to the occasion and then some (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, even character-actor Brian Cox as Stryker brings real menace). And I liked how the relationships and/or trouble some of the characters are expanded upon with this story of a battle between the mutants and the darker forces at work. I could go on about the specific details of how certain action set-pieces are well done, or how the conflicts with the characters are proportioned well for their fates or personalities. But it comes down to something simpler- it's got that mix of a certain social attitude and relevance that isn't pushed too much into your face, just enough as the subtext for ""Hollywood"" appeal. Some scenes are more standout than others (Famke Janssen's plot line has the most relevance and depth, as her's is an unintentional 'to be continued'). <br/><br/>Overall it's an exciting time, especially as a kind of nothing-to-do movie on the weekend- as are the others in the franchise. X2 is the kind of sequel, at the least for fans, that does have the appeal of trying to top itself from the first and not going into complete wastes of logic and style. A-"
"i_am_a_blonde239","10","1","2","29 April 2006"," X-men films: The highs!!
","X-men was a revolutionary idea and I personally think the films do them complete justice. The effects have been astounding and with such a variety of powers to express it would undoubtedly be a difficult task to demonstrate all these realistically.<br/><br/>Although the absence of certain characters, like Gambit, Ms. Marvel (who Rogue gets her additional powers from), Jubilee etc, has been a great concern for X-men fans, I seriously doubt that 'X-men: the last stand' will be the last film dedicated to this band of amazing superheroes and even amazing villains! I know there's a spin off with Logan but as far as I know that is the only information they have released as of yet although there are rumours that one of the people on the set have released that the x-men trilogy is just a small section of the many x-men films to come.<br/><br/>This is understandable as many of the x-men comics were in different stages e.i. Apocalypse, Pheonix, the Future etc.<br/><br/>In all I am looking forward to these films greatly, above all anticipating (hopefully) Rogue's encounter with Ms. Marvel and also Gambit's appearance! Although I respect Everyone's opinion, I do think some of the comments left have been badly supported. X-men was always going to be a complicated film to explain and express to an audience but I doubt it could have done better!"
"newfiesailor","8","1","2","28 April 2006"," Great Entertainment!
","A polished comic book adaptation, darker and grittier than the first in the series. I think it lacks the fun factor the original had, mainly due to the content. Still, it is hard not to admire Singer's faithfulness to the comic.<br/><br/>This time around we have Nightcrawler, Iceman and Pyro joining the crew as well as cameos by Hank McCoy (aka Beast), Siryn, Jubilee, Colossus and Kitty Pryde (aka Shadowcat). Lady Deathstryke is deadly as the evil counterpart to Wolverine; their one on one battle, one of the highlights of the film. Still, Alan Cummings steals this movie as the shy and sensitive Nightcrawler whose make up gets the first star. The opening scene as he invades the White House is sheer popcorn fun.<br/><br/>The nemesis this time around is William Stryker, played gleefully sinister and corrupt by the always marvelous, Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lecter). Stryker has it in for the mutants and his presence lends some insight into the creation of Wolverine. Magneto is back, the fuel for the fire of his hatred against humans rekindled by Stryker's actions. His aide, Mystique, played by the delicious Rebecca Romijn, is given a larger role as the deceiver and spy which adds more fun factor to the film. Plus she is easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>I really didn't enjoy the subplot of Professor X and Stryker's son, Jason. I found it too dark to really get swept away in the film. The rest of the film is pure Saturday matinée enjoyment. I cannot wait to see the outcome of Jean Grey's metamorphosis into Dark Phoenix, insinuated at the end of this film. All in all, a good romp, well worth a rental or buy of the DVD and promises a great chapter to come in X3."
"MOscarbradley","6","1","2","23 April 2006"," Good incomprehensible nonsense
","The plot is incomprehensible, the special effects superb and the imagination unbridled, (though some may say it could do with some bridling). Bryan Singer's follow-up to the first ""X Men"" movie has the characters already established, (though newcomers may find it hard to figure out who's who), so he gets straight down to the plot. Thematically that could be written on the back of a postage stamp, so it's action all the way. The problem isn't so much that it doesn't make sense but rather that there is so little to make sense of. And we have the right to feel cheated that potentially serious themes like racism and ethnic cleansing are given such short shift, (am I reading too much into this nonsense?).<br/><br/>However, for most of it's length it's highly entertaining in a baffling sort of way. It moves at a cracking pace which unfortunately means that characters are never long enough on screen to develop. This is particularly true of Wolverine who this time round is reduced to a cypher. On the other hand, Alan Cumming's fallen angel is a blast and Cumming is the best thing in the movie. The fact that Ian McKellen's Magneto disappears before the end is an obvious indication that ""X Men 3"" was already in the offing."
"rezbong","7","1","2","15 September 2005"," Where was Iceman?
","I was craving mutations and I rented this flick. Aside from the fact that these characters are all just too immortal, and their powers just too much, what annoyed me is that at the end --<br/><br/>WARNING, HERE'S A SPOILER:<br/><br/>Where was Iceman during the dam break? He's sitting idly in the plane. All he needs to do is go out and freeze a protective barrier of water. He doesn't have to freeze the whole body of water, just a layer by the dam itself. Thick enough, to buy them time. Actually, he should stand around and supervise, over the next few days, letting the water slowly out of the reservoir by unfreezing the top portion of the ice dam. I kept waiting for him to do this, but then Jean Grey goes out and uses supernatural powers to help them instead, and the dam itself fails. Very silly. I guess when you mutate, you lose some common sense and keep reaching for the fancier powers. <br/><br/>I'm sure this dam thing and the ice solution has been covered in the 927 other posts, but I didn't find it from my scans, so I thought I'd repeat the complaint. Other than that, the movie shows an interesting world that I'd like to be a part of. Mutant powers. Metaphoric. Cool."

","I was there when the first X-men movie came out and was very pleased with most of the film. Having Patrick Stewart as Professor X was a stroke of genius(though I wouldn't think that anyone else could play the part better). However, I thought that Wolverine was a bit on the mellow side, especially after reading the comic and even the cartoon on Fox. Thankfully, Bryan Singer gave him his sack back and he is the wolvie we all came to love. The characters had more of a part in the story and Storm had a normal accent( no fake stuff). If you haven't seem X2, then you are definitely missing a cool movie. This is a movie that comic, scifi, and action film fans will come to love....very cool.<br/><br/>P.S....There is a hint to the next film here...can't tell you that though, you gotta see it."

"dunmore_ego","7","1","2","4 December 2004"," X-traordinary
","X-SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Unfortunate that X1 and X2 are now associated with these mutant movies, instead of their original references  Bell's X1 aircraft, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first documented to break the sound barrier in 1947  never forget that, young-uns! Successive X-numbers denoted successive prototypes.<br/><br/>Has there ever been a more perfectly-cast movie than X2? So many characters fitting our preconceptions so absolutely  er - except for Cyclops, whose role is disconcertingly minimal, as it was in X-Men. Comicbook Cyclops Scott Summers was always the undisputed Leader of the group, exuding a patriarchal air amongst the very first x-youngsters to the present. Movie Cyclops James Marsden exudes all the presence of a day-player, or some guy in a bar in Miami in an episode of Girls Gone Wild.<br/><br/>Jean Grey's character is also abused somewhat. Firstly  that hair  not working, honey! Gone are comicbook Jean's cascading, volcanic-red, lava-locks (too 80s for this modern film? - but no worse than the Anime cartoon hairstyle she now sports); will it have to come down to an episode of VH1's 50 Awesomely Badder Hairdos to acknowledge this soccer mom abomination? And before we know it, Jean is gone. In a dramatic high-point, sexily holding back a wall of water while simultaneously powering up the X-Jet, she is sacrificed; a device which had to occur for Jean Grey's overwhelming Phoenix force to achieve illimitable psionic freedom (Hep me! Hep me! I'm sliding into geekery!...) In essence, in just two movies her character traverses an arc which took decades of comics to develop. Movies, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of comicbook shelf-life; plots that were developed over thousands of inter-connected comics must necessarily be composited into a few films, before the franchise goes to pot with new directors, unfamiliar and unlikeable cast and widened demographic mundanity. i.e. it ALWAYS ends up G-rated, with scenes of soldiers crawling out of exploded military vehicles to prove that they are still alive.<br/><br/>The film unflinchingly supplies each major character with an interesting arc; an almost insurmountable undertaking, considering the plethora of varied roles and interlocking story lines. Director Singer and writers have done an incredible job, full tilt boogie  even the day-player Cyclops gets his moment to kick butt and take names - but is ultimately taken down by a chick  girly-man style!<br/><br/>Before I go on, I must clarify: this is an excellent movie, well-filmed, well-written, well-acted  and hey! Wolverine! 'nuff said! - but it is not without its illogicities.<br/><br/>An example: Rogue is sucked out of the disabled X-Jet and Nightcrawler bamfs out and retrieves her, bringing her back onboard safely  excellently illustrating his power's utility - BUT - well, he's back in the out-of-control X-Jet! - why not bamf to the GROUND INSTEAD, EINSTEIN? Matter of fact, why not individually bamf EVERYONE down to the ground? This is the quandary that writers of superhero films must face: all these beings put together make up a formidable force and if they logically reasoned through any predicament, NOTHING could ultimately harm them. When Wolverine barks, 'Don't we have any weapons in this heap?', the full portent of his question hits us when Storm's eyes go white  they're ALL Walking Weapons. Yet here is another mis-use of 'power' from that same scene: Couldn't Storm (who has just conjured more twisters than there were in the movie Twister) conjure a mighty updraft to float the X-Jet safely to earth?; couldn't Jean (who has just utilized her telekinesis to explode a missile) also float the jet down safely?; couldn't Iceman create a slide of ice?; the potential list of 'saves' goes on  yet, it's Airport '75 up in that converted Blackbird and Our Man Charlton ain't nowhere in sight. Instances like these really make you wonder whether you ARE on the Right Side, rooting for these insensate clowns, when the ostensible Bad Guy  Magneto  is the only one with any brains, balls or mutant clout to actually SAVE the jet.<br/><br/>Admittedly, even in the comics, utilization of super-powers are oft-times foregone in favor of plot development.<br/><br/>The DVD commentaries *infuriate* with their naivete: cast and crew misuse and completely misunderstand the word 'evolution', continually saying 'evolve' where they simply should say 'develop', illustrating an utter ignorance of this world-shaping concept. 'Evolution' is a process by which mutated genes, if they enable an organism to better adapt to its environment, are 'selected' and passed on. Less-adaptable organisms are leached out of the pathway of Life vis a vis 'natural selection'. Not being an essay on 'evolution' per se, this skeletal description will have to suffice to illustrate the ingenuousness of terms like 'character evolution'.<br/><br/>The DVD also bludgeons viewers with the unsubtle 'message' of tolerance. As if the raison d'etre of this movie IS to promote tolerance and NOT to make sinful amounts of exploitative cash. By exploiting a 'minority' existing in fantasy, they audaciously attach this analogy to world problems, and then pretend they CARE. The fact that this movie issues from one of the most insular, IN-tolerant places on earth  Hollywood  makes that 'message' all the more hypocritical and straight-up shameless prevarication.<br/><br/>The X-Men's 'message' has nothing to do with why this film was made - the current rash of superhero movies is not being voraciously consumed faster than they can be made because audiences wish to imbue themselves with spiritual elevation; no, superhero-mania is the latest fad in a long line of film fads  remember all those 'war' movies after WWII?; all the 'westerns' of the forties through sixties; the 'cop' films of the seventies; 'slasher' films of the eighties; the genres of 'baseball', 'family', 'romantic comedies', et al. 'Superhero' films now join the carousel of bankable corporate products  because the generation who grew up enamored with comics is now at an age where THEY are making the major business decisions in the world. So please  spare us the faux-philanthropy and get on with entertaining us for our cash."
"DeadlyHedley007","10","1","2","14 November 2004"," Hugh Jackman's talent should be taken up in first rate films
","I enjoyed X-Men very much but X-2 excelled in all parts but particularly Hugh Jackman. This multi talented actor can bring all the action, pathos, anxiety, happiness and sorrow to a character of fantasy just imagine what he can do in the real world.The film held my attention completely to the end. All the characters had moved on from the 1st film particularly Wolverine who is now the top character in the series.<br/><br/>The action scenes were outstanding - I bet there were quite a few cuts and bruises before the climax of the film and make up and wardrobe really made their mark, But the commitment and hard work of the cast, back stage and the fore sight of Brian Singer really made this a film far more worthy in the ratings that we gave it. Everyone worked together to make it work and the all got on very well - what more can I say<br/><br/>There is room for another X-men film particularly the many unanswered questions in respect of Logan/Wolverine. He convinced me that although he could not remember what had happened to him or why, that behind this lay a very profound and misused good guy - even though he was told 'he was a wolf and only had the claws added' but then the bad guys do try to destroy good men. Interesting concept as to where it would go and how. Needs far more imagination that I can produce -bet there is a hell of a story yet to come either in the X-Men 3 and/or plus a spin off of Wolverine. I could not imagine X-Men 3 without Wolverine it would not work. Although I would not like to Hugh Jackman stuck in a rut he is capable of so much more and I am sure he would want to do much. He has it to offer and deliver. So come on you top directors don't get in a rut get the multi talented Mr Jackman before you miss him. He has more than proved himself on the stage - there is no reason without a good director and particularly an excellent script an Oscar would be on the way to him and a very rewarding film for all with awards to all concerned. He has more than earned the chance - even his small roles always have good things to say about his performances.<br/><br/>Deadly Hedley"

Though, haven't I forgot someone, oh yes: Cyclops! Or? Did I really forget him? He's a whimp, so I don't care much. But the thing is; it's a great movie! Scenes as when the mutant school gets attacked by military soldiers and Wolverine starts cutting sick, or as when Pyro fires his blasts against the cops, or the superb opening scene when Nightcrawler tries assassinating the president of the United States, man, this movie has lots to offer you! This time we get to dig deeper into Wolverine's dark and unknown past, who's a very interesting part of the main story who is about a military general (Stryker) that has been searching on mutants for a long time, and was the one that made Wolverine, he returns, starting a small warfare between mutants and human! Cool plot.<br/><br/>Wolverine is...yeah, the new Clint in western, the new Rambo in the jungle, the new Terminator in machines...he's rough! As lines as he says: ""You picked the wrong house buddy!!"" or ""If you want to shoot me, shoot me!!!"" as he flash his claws threw his fists, great!!! Absolutely great! X2, is one of the bests sequels ever, together with Star Wars Episode V, Terminator 2, Aliens and The Godfather. And it is; the best superhero movie ever! Still the Batman movies from Burton and Spider-Man are challenegers, this -  is ass kicking mayhem!<br/><br/>The new mutants are all fabulous. Especially Alan Cumming's performance as the telepatic Nightcrawler who's originally a German guy named Kurt Wagner. And also Ice-Man who had a small role in the first movie, and the new angry Pyro, fantastic as he roles upon: ""You know about the dangerous mutants you hear about on the news...I'm the worst one!!""

"Chris_Gardner","Null","1","2","29 May 2003"," X-Men sequel X2 tells the story of a group of mutants who see it as their duty to act as the guardians of humanity.
","At the head of the X-Men, as they are called, is Professor Charles Xavier, played by none other than Patrick Stewart, who has played Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation since 1987. Going up against him, and his band of unusual superheroes, is supervillain Erik Lehnserr AKA Magneto, played Sir Ian McKellen, known to many New Zealanders as Gandalf from Lord of the Rings. For a science fiction flick the film relies little on science, although there are some referenced to evolution, and has plenty of morals - even Christian ones. The most obvious morals come from Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, the German mutant otherwise known as Nightcrawler who prays when he's in a scrape and is constantly talking about his faith in Jesus - refreshing for a film that could so easily have relied on technobabble. At times the film, now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre, was difficult to follow with the plot leaping all over the place - perhaps a result of not having seen the first film. The cast, including New Zealander Anna Paquin as Rogue, delivered a sterling performance and made me want to hire the original from the video store. I'm particularly intrigued by Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) back story. If you love comic book adaptations then you're bound to love X2."
"RogueAngel","Null","1","2","28 May 2003"," Best movie adaptation of a comic
","X-men 2 is by far the best movie adaptation of a comic. The director, Bryan Singer captured the real essence of the comics, though obviously trying to stay as true to them as possible. Though the dialogue was lacking, it was an excellent film.<br/><br/>The second movie sees many  of the prequel's mutants developing and changing in character and power. Some grow stronger, both mentally and physically while others.... well, they just go totally the other way.Take Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) for example: in the first movie Scott was protective, but very mature. In the second movie he turns into a total baby who always whines and lacks real substance. I have totally lost All respect for him. Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) has also changed alot: In the first film he was more of a withdrawn, lost puppy who only used his claws to defend himself; now he's more like ""Mr Kill and Stab everyone in sight!!""<br/><br/>The one person who has earned my respect and admiration is Jean Grey. (Famke Janssen). She has matured alot and her new found ""Phoenix"" powers are much more stronger. She is also [resented with the choice of Logan or Scott,which to me seems would be a hard decision, as it looks as though she has feelings for both of them. She creates the most defining moment of the film when she reveals her true power, and sacrifices her own life for those who she truly loves and admired. Even though you may be baffled by her sudden ""death"", we know that it is all for a bigger and greater purpose.<br/><br/>In this film there is more on the younger generation of mutants. Rogue (Anna Paquin) no more looks young, lost out of place and innocent and has matured into a fine young adult. Her relationship with Bobby Drake/ Iceman (hottie Shawn Asmore) has blossomed and bloomed into more thanjust a schoolgirl crush. Another key fact is that if he touches her, he'll get the life sucked out of him is aproblem and a real bummer on their part. There is also newcomer Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who is a bit of a trouble maker.<br/><br/>The new villain is human, William Stryker (Brian Cox) who is hell bent on destroying all mutants. Of course there is still Magneto (ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who seem to have good intentions. But we all are shown that they, in fact, have an alterior motive ;)<br/><br/>My favourite ""Bad guy"" is Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike. (the gorgeous Kelly Hu) Think of her as a slicker, deadlier, faster. more advanced version of Wolverine. I think the film should have shown more of her and her background. They also sold her out on her lines as the only thing she says is"" What are you doing in here?"" I also felt sorry for her when Wolverine pumped her full of Adamantium.<br/><br/>A few more newbies are Siryn (Shauna Kain) Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart) Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Nightcrawler,(Alan Cummming) a blue, religious teleporter. There is also Jubilee(Kea Wong),but in the deleted scenes of X-Men 1, she has a small part. Also those who read the comics an watch the cartoon would know that she was a main character.<br/><br/>Phew! now that I have got all of that out I would just like to say that this is a movie that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. I give it a ***** out of *****>"

The returning cast seemed really comfortable in their roles.  There was a chemistry between them, you felt they had a history together, they knew each other for years.  These characters are mutants, the next step in human evolution.  They have a special power, i.e. telekenisis, teleportation, telepathy, accelerated healing, shape-shifting; I'm sure you get the idea.<br/><br/>The cynics might be disappointed to know there is an actual plot.  This is a story that continues to deal with a struggle between mutant and human, mostly with one man's hatred for them and his unquenchable desire to destroy any and all mutants.  His name is Stryker, played by Brian Cox, who is a military scientist, apparently brilliant enough to develop a plastic prison that can hold the mutant Magneto, who is able to control magnetic fields (I know I would've never thought of that).  The movie also reveals part of Wolverine's forgotten past.  We see unlikely allies, old enemies, new alliances - all of which are neatly tied together throughout the movie. The story keeps moving.  There are a number of subtle references to things that might happen if there is a next movie.  I will admit - I was a little surprised by the ending.<br/><br/>The special effects are well done.  They were pretty flawless.  For example, the effects for Nightcrawler, a mutant who can teleport -without the help of Patrick Stewart's Enterprise- were stunning and, for lack of a better description, believable.  In line with the effects, the fights were well choreographed.  The big fight for this movie is between Wolverine and Yuriko - both are mutants who have some how had their skeletons infused with a rare, indestructible metal, adamantium.  And if you ever wanted a reason why you shouldn't get in a fight with a woman with nails, this is the best reason yet.<br/><br/>Again, to the disappointment of the skeptics, there is character development.  We particularly see this in three young mutant, Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and John ""Pyro"" Allerdyce (Aaron Stanford).  These are three teen-aged mutants attending Professor X's school for the gifted, a school dedicated to educating mutants in not just their abilities, but in the three R's as well.  We see them each dealing with their mutant ""condition,"" and how it affects them personally.  This brings substance to the film, bringing a more day-to-day dealing with their mutant powers and how it affects them and the ones they love, and to whom they ally themselves.<br/><br/>This movie does not religiously follow the comics books.  Some liberties have been taken.  Obviously the costumes aren't like the ones we see in the comic books.  No problem with that; Spandex is so 80's anyway.  Some of the history and origin of various mutants and non-mutants have been modified (i.g. Yuriko was not a mutant, but a cyborg, and she was known as Lady Deathsrike).  However, the overall concept of the story stays true enough to the comic book.  My only beef is Mystique's lack of clothing.  Granted, when she fights, the style is very serpentine, and she is seductive by nature. However, put some clothes on her!  She was able to morph into some sort of dress in the comic book, they could at least do that.  No, she's not really naked in the film, but the white dress with the skull belt in the comics added a certain flair to the character and some modesty.<br/><br/>It is hard for a sequel to top it's predecessor.  It's even harder for a film based on a popular character(s)/story to meet the expectations of it's original fan base.  This movie succeeds at both.  The story has more meat. The characters have more flesh to them.  The writing was well done (I'm still scarred by Storm's last words to Toad in the first movie); good whit, timely humor.  This movie is able to stand alone, though there is more to appreciate if you've seen the first movie.  Brian Singer did a good job directing.  The story flowed.  I didn't find myself squirming in my seat, looking at the time.  This is not Oscar material, but it is entertaining. The movie came to a conclusion but still left room for a third (now the ""true"" film critics are about to throw up).  Over all, it's worth seeing on the big screen and worthy to open the summer movie season."

",".....quite enjoyable, if anything it does over-stay it's welcome a little, while the first one wasn't long enough. But that's just me. I enjoyed the better characterizations here-Wolverine, Storm, Jean Gray, Magneto, etc. It was also kinda fun watching Rogue driving around the Big Jet there like some regular teenaged kid getting into an 18-wheeler and half-backing it thru the warehouse door to get it inside. You gotta root for her.<br/><br/>Lotsa nods to the fans-'Hank McCoy' on TV, files mentioning Sentinels, a Phoenix image in the water at the end, etc. All that. Plus Iceman too. The plot was the standard Superhero/Bond kinda thingie that you really should waste time trying to follow or guage for realism, that is besides the point if anything.  Nice to see Brian Cox at it again too.<br/><br/>Def. a good flick though one that will be dated kinda fast seems like.<br/><br/>*** outta ****, go and enjoy it."

","*SPOILERS FOR THOSE UNFORTUNATE TO NOT HAVE SEEN IT YET*<br/><br/>I was blown away...again.  I thought the first was good.  I saw X2 Friday and Saturday and honestly can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>The regulars are back...Wolverine (looks just as good this time, only we get to see a good amount more of him if you know what I mean), Professor X, Storm, Cyclopse, Magneto, Iceman, Rogue (a favourite), Jean (my other favourite), and Mystique.<br/><br/>Now we have more...Nightcrawler (again, a fav), Colossus, Pyro, Stryker (not a mutant), and Lady Deathstrike.<br/><br/>Can I just say the chemistry between Storm (Hale Berry) and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) is the most intense I've seen onscreen.  You'd expect them to just start kissing at a moment's notice.  Jackman outdid himself, as did Famke.<br/><br/>The end is a major cliffhanger for those who know what's next...Phoenix! One of the best X-Men arcs there is in my opinion.<br/><br/>For those out there who know the story and the characters, keep a close eye out for other characters!  I had to watch it twice to pick them out.  Of course, Shadowcat is obvious since she falls through floors and such, then there's Jubilee (a young asian girl who was among the 6? captured), Gambit (who was captured also), and it says Beast is in the credits but I still can't find him.<br/><br/>The effects have gotten better, not just because the technology has advanced, but because I think it looks believable, unlike films such as The Matrix (which I love also) which rely so heavily on effects for the surroundings and such.  It's hard to believe sometimes that the jet really isn't there flying over their heads.<br/><br/>Now, my question is can it get any better???  I'm guessing it can, and I'm more than willing to wait to find out!  The best comic book film ever. Much better than Superman, Batman, and the Hulk will ever be or have been.<br/><br/>*****"
"Shadow007","7","1","2","10 May 2003"," Better than the First
","X-Men was a good movie, but not a great one. It had a number of deficiencies. The most crucial of these IMO was the story itself. It never really engaged the viewer all that much. X2 OTOH has a much better story line. It is perhaps a little too obvious for the viewer but it is nonetheless more interesting.<br/><br/>X2 contains many action sequences laden with special effects. The movie hasn't been bogged down too much by all this and most of them are fairly original and well done.<br/><br/>The movie also continues the attempts at characterisation, especially of Wolverine, and for the most part seems to try too hard. The ""chemistry"" between Wolverine and Dr Jean Gray seems too forced. It would also be nice to see Rogue given more of a job than simply being an ornament, but a rather nice one at that :) Perhaps if there is an X-Men 3 she'll get to do more.<br/><br/>The comedic elements of the movie are once again well done with Jackman delivering some great dead-pan one-liners.<br/><br/>Overall, X2 is a fun and enjoyable movie but it must be remembered that it really isn't trying to be anything other than an action movie. It's perhaps a little long also.<br/><br/>7/10"
"doug_funnie","10","1","2","7 May 2003"," An Amazing Movie
","What an amazing movie that is a perfect adaptation to the X-Men comics and cartoon. First I have to say that if you see this movie before the first one, you'll be confused and won't really understand why things happen the way they do. X2 isn't really a movie on its own, you need to have seen the first one. But everything about this movie, is so much bigger and better than the first, all of which equals to an enjoyable movie to watch many times. One of the best things about it, is that Rogue and Iceman have a much, much stronger role. As well as Pyro, making things interesting for an X3 (not to mention the hint of Phoenix in Jean). The characters are all amazing to watch on screen, all the main mutants are great on screen as they work together, and the effect of their powers make it better. Even the filming locations (Canada) look amazing on screen. The one negative comment I have, is that a few of the stunts and effects seemed a little un-realistic such as the X-Wing, but it's a small price to pay for such a good movie. Definitely a movie to watch if you're a fan and even if you're not, you'll still like it."
"Para8Dice","10","1","2","7 May 2003"," THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!!! (Spoilers, minor)
","This movie was amazing.  When I saw the first one, I hadn't even HEARD of the X-Men.  I didn't know their story, their saga, their legacy, or even that the X-Men was a comic book.  The first movie entrapped me and this movie, the part two was nothing less.  The special effects were incredible, all of the characters were BEAUTIFULLY portrayed, the storyline was very intense, and it once again left an enormous opening for the next movie many of us are anxiously awaiting for.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, James Marsden, and all other cast members did an INCREDIBLE job. Anna Paquin and Halle Berry are the two Oscar winners in this group and play Rogue and Ororo Munroe, AKA Storm.  Hugh Jackman had again a very large part and Halle's part was far bigger in this movie than the first. <br/><br/>
For Anna Paquin fans, in this movie she takes off the coat that she covers herself with in the first movie, takes off her shyness and begins to live a little bit more.  She looks absolutely gorgeous in this movie and begins to evolve into the comic book Rogue who was very sexy and sassy.  By the next movie, Rogue will be hot.  For people who want Anna's character Rogue and Logan, AKA Wolverine together, this movie does not hold as many precious moments between them as the first film.  :(  They share an embrace but that's....pretty much it.  Rogue's character has a boyfriend in this movie, Iceman, AKA Bobby, and he wants to kiss her badly but she is resistant because she doesn't want to harm him since her mutation is that anyone who touches her skin is seriously injured.  But Bobby's pretty tenacious himself.  :)  <br/><br/>For Logan/Wolverine fans, the movie goes much deeper into what happened to him that caused him to lose his memory and who the people were who did massive experimenting on him, nearly killing him in the process.  He does find some answers but those answers of course lead to more questions.  For people who want Jean and Logan together, you guys do get something. <br/><br/>
For James Marsden fans, oh he is cute!  LOL.  For Scott/Jean fans, you guys get something too.  :)  <br/><br/>Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are FABULOUS as always, and the new characters, Night Crawler, Lady Deathstrike, Pyro, and many of the children are given a great part.  If you're a fan of any of these actors and or an X-Men fan, you'll be thrilled.  <br/><br/>I'm not even a science-fiction fan but this saga, the X-Men has got me so obsessed I think I need a 12-step program!  This is incredible, but see the first one before you see this one.  They are both luminous.  :)  Any questions, e-mail me at Para8Dice@aol.com."

","X2: X-Men United is Bryan Singer's franchise's The Empire Strikes Back. It actually and successfully builds upon and surpasses its 2000 predecessor, and that is a feat in of itself.<br/><br/>X2 picks up right where the previous X-Men film leaves off, and never stops for a second.  It contains all of the elements of a hard sci-fi film, action-adventure, and poignant drama, and somehow, pulls it all off.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman returns as the stalwart Logan, AKA Wolverine, still on the search for his past.  This collides with the appearance of Nazi-esque military scientist Colonel William Stryker, portrayed delectably by Brian Cox, who wants to infiltrate the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, and rend mutantkind asunder.  All of our previous players have returned, yet in beefed up, fleshed-out roles.  And somehow, Singer and Co. have been enable to inject further characters, such as Aaron Stamford's manic and morose Pyro and Shawn Ashmore's earnest Iceman.  The true stand-out is Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, alias Nightcrawler, a young man who is committed to his Christian faith but is cursed to live life looking like a blue demon. Kurt's pain, but upbeat attitude towards forgiveness, makes him an incredibly realistic character.  Cumming's scenes with Halle Berry's redeemed Storm are terrific and heartfelt.<br/><br/>And let us not forget our villains.  Along with the aforementioned Col. Stryker, Sir Ian McKellen's Magneto returns, as does Rebecca Stamos' Mystique.  McKellen chews up the scenery and naturally, delivers some of the best lines in the film, but Stamos' Mystique's part is extended and magnified, giving us a better picture at this deadly, although conflicited, femme fatale.<br/><br/>It was a shear pleasure to see the introduction of one of my favorite X-Men, the long lamented Colossus, played here with enormous physicality by newcomer Daniel Cudmore.  Colossus is not seen much, but when he is, the audience is transfixed by his awesome metallic form.  Here's hoping we hear and see more from the armored X-Man-in-training in the future.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart wears the Professor X role much like his immaculate suits: perfectly.  The role was his to take and he it has enveloped him nearly as well as his previous Capt. Picard role from Star Trek: The Next Generation and its subsequent feature films.  Professor X comes off as the loving instructor and mentor, but his mind-manipulation ability appears frightening in the context of X2.  We truly learn that Charles Xaxier is the Earth's most powerful mutant...and perhaps, man.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen shine, as always, as Wolverine and Jean Grey. Jackman owns the role of Logan, and we even get well-received glimpses of Wolverine's ""berzerker"" behavior.  Janssen, and this is SPOILER MATERIAL, is the biggest surprise of X2.  Her revelation of the emerging ability to manipulate the star-wide Phoenix Force, is a great surprise for the long-time comic book fans.  However, her self-sacrifice and apparent ""death"" were huge shocks.  Yet, as the film ends, we glimpse through Professor Xavier's mind's eye, and see that Jean will return, but most likely, will never be the same.<br/><br/>James Marsden's Cyclops is a delight, as always, but unfortunately, and this is my only gripe, is in the film very little.  However, his short scenes are so densely packed with drama and emotion, fans of Scott Summers will be forgiving.  And besides, if there is an X-Men 3, and God willing, there will be, with Jean Grey's likely return, Cyclops must take a central role in a possible ""Phoneix/Dark Phoneix"" storyline.<br/><br/>You cannot see X2 once.  There is too much on screen to be viewed, and potentially missed.  For comics fans, there are plenty of Easter Eggs and little hidden secrets, and unless you're a mutant, you cannot catch them all.  So, see it again if you can, and take along a loved one.  X2 is one film you must not miss.<br/><br/>Marvel Comics' cinematic triumphs continue to build and amaze.  If Warner Bros. had learned long ago that in order to make successful, well-received films featuring their trademark D.C. Comics superhero characters you must employ the best talent who treat the characters honestly and with reverence, we might not have had a glut of terrible Superman and Batman movies.  And while the Marvel train chugs along, Warner Bros. mires itself in self-doubt and second-guessing, leaving the fans out there with the question of whether we'll ever see another GOOD Superman or Batman film ever again.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation!"
"chukcha31","Null","1","2","4 May 2003"," Simply Incredible!
","Let me just begin with saying that I am going to see it again sometime this week. Folks, this is a definition of a sequal. If you see a bad review, just say what I usually say to myself when I see a bad review for a great movie: they are paid by the other studios to write this. Anyways about the movie. The CGI is top notch, and as you've probably already heard before, the Nightcrawler opening sequence says it all. The story is great and true to the comic/show. What I really liked is that this movie didn't let 'hollywood' take control of it, and the story took on its own flow; the real x-men flow. Now to the characters. Wolverine is without a shadow of a doubt the highlight of the film. Hugh Jackman gets a standing ovation from me for bringing a classic superhero to life. Although Wolverine is the complete package in the film, my opinion could be a bit bias since he is my favorite x-man. Nightcrawler could easily be considered as the highlight, and so can Jean Grey. My other personal favorite was Pyro. This kid is just sick! in the good way. I loved his attitude, look, style, and most of all his power to manipulate fire. Mystique was also awesome just as she was in X1. Finally Magneto was very very powerful and was involved in one of the smartest sequences in the prison. Characters I was pleased with were Iceman, Storm, Xavier, Cyclops(who you won't see much of), and Deathstrike. Now to the only 3 flaws in the movie. Rogue is supposed to be COOL!!! I didn't really see a difference between her and Julia Styles in 10 things i hate about you. Yeah I know shes just a teenager in the movie, but c'mon, where's the accent, the style, and most important, where are her powers??? In the cartoon, Rogue was one of the most feared of all x-men cause she takes your powers and uses them against you. Whatever I guess theyre just trying to focus on hers and Iceman's relationship rather than use her as a force which is also good for the human aspect of x-men, but its still a shame. Ah well maybe well see her powers when shes a little grown up in X3. Second flaw is about Colossus. Mr.Singer, you've done a terrific job with your film and The Usual Suspects is my fav, but you forgot one thing, Colossus is RUSSIAN!!! Where is the accent??? :) Whatever maybe you can correct this in X3. And for my final flaw...(drum roll)... WHERE ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH IS GAMBIT??? Gambit is one of the coolest, slickest, and fan fav of all the x-men! He is my fav next to Wolverine!!! I read in a magazine that Beast was not put in due to extra money that was going to be put in for CGI and make-up; ok i can live with that, but it is not so hard to make room for Gambit! All he does is throw things that will blow up, c'mon, it wouldn't be harder than Pyro, unless you don't know how to make cards fly on screen. My only hope is for X3 because (spoiler) watch for the name Remy Labreau pop up on a computer screen while Mystique is hacking into Striker's system. Whatever, I know that these aren't true flaws, but the flaws of a true x-men fan, so don't let this discourage you from seeing the movie, because this is simply a message from one x-men fan to another who saw the movie. So how do I end this? I'll repeat my title, simply incredible! 9.5/10 Go see it, NOW!"

","X2 is by far one of the best sequels ever put out.  It lived to the hype. Singer and company put together an absolutely brilliant movie bringing the comic book characters to life.  The best sequence in the movie is the first scene with Nightcrawler.  The Rogue-Iceman relationship is definitely a heartbreaker to watch and the Wolverine-Jean Grey-Cyclops love-fest was more developed in this movie.<br/><br/>Here are some things that points I would like to make about the film.  Get a new Cyclops.  James Marsden can?t act, especially the scene where Jean leaves the plane and he tries to stop her and starts getting upset when she closes the door.  Everyone in the theater laughed.  Also, there is no chemistry between Marsden and Famke Jennsen (Jean Grey).  That makes it hard for those not familiar with the comic book to understand why they were together.  Lady Deathstrike was underused.  I don?t think she even said a word.  It seemed as though she was more of a robot than a human.  I?m not staying that Kelly Hu?s acting was bad or anything.  She just wasn?t given a chance to act.<br/><br/>2 hours and 15 minutes of great movie watching.  Can?t wait for X3!!!<br/><br/>9/10"
"awatts30","Null","1","2","3 May 2003"," Duly impressed
","I thought that X2 far surpassed the original film.  I was expecting more of the same going in, and instead got everything better.<br/><br/>Obviously, the action was hard to miss.  The opening sequence with Nightcrawler lifted my heart.  He's always been one of my favorite mutants, and I'm glad that Bryan Singer and his team did him justice.  Thoroughly beautiful effects, and brilliant choreography.  While arguably the best (or at least the coolest), it was by no means the last action scene in the movie.  Wolverine, Yuriko, Mystique, and Nightcrawler all show us what they're made of with some flashy hand-to-hand (or claw) fight scenes. Magneto and Jean definitely flaunt their powers, again with some quality special effects to back them up.<br/><br/>The thing that most surprised and impressed me, however, was the character development.  That had been my chief complaint with the first movie: I thought that a lot of the characters went in the wrong direction.  Almost all of them were considerably more fleshed out in this movie.  Notable exceptions are Rogue and Magneto, but this is because of the considerable background that they got in the first movie.  I thought Mystique got some more of the treatment she deserved: she became a true character, instead of just one of Magneto's tools.   With that came a chance to show off her mutant abilities to a much higher degree than before.  Storm's character was played down, but I maintain that it had been overplayed in the first and that she had gotten much more attention that she merited.  Cyclops changed little, but he was noticeably absent for most of the movie.  I'm not complaining though, because he was always a whiny little snot.  It was good to see the new characters lurking in the mansion.  Let's hope that some of them (Colossus, Shadowcat) come out in the future.<br/><br/>So what about the next film anyway?  Word on the street is, there's going to be Sentinels (mwuah hah hah hah).  That should be a blast and a half.  I'm betting on Gambit and Beast showing up (did you catch their ""cameos"" in X2?) and on Jean making an appearance (*wink wink*).  Wolverine may be the most bad-assed X, but he's not the only one.  Besides, they may have played him out a little too much in these two.  I'm calling for a little less of the clawed Canuck in the next.  And here's to hoping that we get to see Rogue go from the mega-babe she is to the Rogue we all know and love: the butt-kicking, super-powered mega-babe from the comics.  I don't think that X3 needs to be the last, though.  For years, Marvel has  supplied some of the best comics on Earth, and since their inception, X-men has been the largest, most complex story line of any comic series.  The material is there, the movie talent has been shown, the special effects technology exists.  There's no reason why X-men couldn't be a running series.  I think Fox will find that audiences will go see as many X-movies as they make.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping..."
"erthnvesl","Null","1","2","5 May 2003"," A Worthy Sequel, Action Makes Up for Flaws in Story
","I loved this movie!  I give it 8 out of 10.  My thoughts (with spoilers but I think you all saw it): First the bad: the storyline was somewhat lacking in several areas.  Some things that bugged me: - Cyclops was practically useless again.  I might have wept with him if I could relate to his character at all.  If they don't develop him in X3 I will probably never care about him at all. - Lady Deathstrike only added one thing to the film.  She's never mentioned by name, so the non-comic-geeks will never know her, and she doesn't speak at all if I recall correctly.  Her one use in the film, the big fight with Wolvie.  A horrendous underuse of her character considering how formidable she is in the comics.  Great fight tho. - The scene with Mystique in the tent with Wolverine, in my opinion, added nothing to the film.  I am still trying to figure out what that scene has to do with anything, and it's just confusing me more. - The mystery with Jean's powers I felt was not handled well; it left the audience out entirely.  Imagine Wolverine thrashing around in bed without being able to see the horrifying images in his dreams, and you begin to see a). what I mean when I say that and b). how I felt we could relate better to her transformation and especially her precognitions.  Images of Xavier trapped in the plastic cell, the mutants suffering from the mind bolts, the giant wall of water closing on the ship... all kinds of fun things could be foreshadowed without giving away the whole movie and in the end culminate in the choice that she made.  Instead she looks confused and computers fizzle. Then her powers are strong, then they are non-existent.  As someone who had forgotten about the Phoenix storyline I had the benefit of seeing this part from an outsider's perspective, and I was confused up to and beyond the moment of her death.  Only when they showed the image of Phoenix beneath the water did it make sense to me, but only because I know the comic lore.  I just feel this should have been made more accessible. - Offhand, how was there no other way to escape when you have someone on board who can control the weather and another who can make ice? - I would have liked some explanation of the drug Stryker was using to control mutants. - Offhand, if he was controlling Nightcrawler, how did he get ahold of him in the first place, and why didn't he go looking to recover him after the failed assassination? - Apparently nobody cares about Jason Stryker.  Maybe if Xavier had said ""hey we need to rescue Jason"" and Kurt said ""I can't teleport him and his chair.  It's too big... slugheads!"" then at least he'd be given lip service instead of callously left to die.  His story is tragic enough as it is. - I got their method of moving Pyro into Magneto's camp, and I picked up on the hints and clues and such, the no-parent-figures thing compared to Bobby, and Magneto sort of turning him to the Dark Side a la Palpatine and such... but one more scene would have been great.  A dialogue with Rogue or Bobby, or even Magneto, outlining his inner struggle which eventually led him to look to Magneto for guidance, and especially why he didn't subscribe to Xavier's philosophies, would have lent a lot more to this thread, which otherwise was pretty good anyway. When you consider how many strong points the movie had though, these numerous flaws are minor by contrast.  Some good (and VERY GOOD) things: - Nightcrawler was awesome.  Dead-on perfect.  With Wolverine and ""Wheels"", Nightcrawler makes the 3rd good character who is almost an exact reproduction of his comic persona.  To be fair, the only ""flaw"" in a lot of the good mutants is their age, which is revised downward to enhance the image of the school, and that's perfectly fine with me.  ALL the evil mutants, on the other hand, seem to be spot-on, except for Deathstrike as mentioned above. - Great scenes in this film: Wolvie going nuts on those special ops guys, Nightcrawler's assassination attempt, Magneto escaping from prison with three ball bearings, the Wolvie-Deathstrike fight, Pyro kicking all those cops' butts... really too many to count. - In general the use of Magneto's and Mystique's powers are very clever.  If the good guys used their powers half as well as those two, they'd be unstoppable. - Cameos galore: Shadowcat (again), Colossus, Siryn, and so forth.  I was disappointed that Beast and Gambit did not appear as promised, but at least Hank McCoy and Remy LeBeau were obliquely referenced. - Good contrasting figures worked into the story.  Examples: Iceman with a loving but scared and confused family, paired up with Pyro who appears to have been abandoned by his.  Maybe if someone told me what happened to him I could elaborate.  Also: Storm and her anger at being discriminated, paired with Nightcrawler who still sees beauty in the world and in humanity. - The scene in Iceman's home lent a lot more weight to the conflict between humans and mutants.  Made it a lot more tangible.  Also highlighted why Xavier discourages open displays of some mutant powers. Can't wait for this one to hit the discount theater so I can see it again. Heard it made 85 million this weekend.  I will be completely un-original and say that this film isn't Citizen Kane but it's a good action film, a good comic-geek film, and will rule the cinemas for exactly 12 days, and then the Matrix will completely swallow it up."

","I wasn't thrilled with the first X-Men, mainly because of Halle Berry (Storm was useless: afraid of everything, gets her ass kicked, then goes berserk) and the fact that there was virtually no story.  I suppose it really served as a 2 hour trailer for X-Men 2...well, and to show off Mystique.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with X-Men 2.  This film was absolutely brilliant.  The characters all appeared as more of a team and as the ultimate superheros that I remember from the comics.  The action was much better than what I saw in the first film and there's some great humor.  Highlights are Wolverine's rampage through the mansion, Pyro's destruction of police cars, the foreshadowing of Phoenix, and OF COURSE every sequence involving Mystique! I also liked that this film was on the edge of not being a movie for kids...which is great considering the original fans of the comics are now adults.<br/><br/>I just hope the original cast stays on for more sequels!"
"gregsrants","Null","1","2","4 May 2003"," A Superhero film that delivers the goods!
","There may be a new trend in Superhero sequels, and I have to admit, I like it.  First seen in Blade II, where the bad and the good join forces to fight an even more menacing force, it is perfected in the new X-Men sequel X2.<br/><br/>The movie picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first and we are quickly re-introduced to the mutant gang of Professor Xavier's school for the gifted.  For those of you not up to date with the mutant cast of characters, Patrick Stewart (Star Trek) is back as Professor X, Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) is Storm, Anna Paquin (The Piano) is Rouge, Famke Janssen is Jean Grey, James Marsden as the laser eye shooting Cyclops, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and everyones favorite Canadian Superhero, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is back as the adamantium clawed Wolverine.  Some of our favorite villians are back for an encore, Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) plays the metal manipulator Magneto,  and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is back as shape-shifting Mystique.  And finally, what would a superhero sequel be without the marketing of new characters?  Aaron Stanford plays the fire manipulating Pyro, Kelly Hu plays the quiet but deadly Deathstrike and Alan Cummings steals the show as the blue faced teleporter Nightcrawler.<br/><br/>With a cast of characters as strong and dilluted as X-Men 2, you would think that no character would have time to establish themselves to the audience, however, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) manages to string each of the mutants out in comic book fashion ensuring that no matter who your favorite, you will not be disappointed.  <br/><br/>The story is thin, but lets face it, we throw down the $10 per ticket for a movie of this genre to be bedazzled by the special effects and blown away by the rumbling sounds.  For what script there is, the President of the United States is convinced by the evil General William Stryker (played by Brian Cox), that the mutants are a threat to mankind and must be rounded up to prevent the threat they impose.   Since all mutants are targets regardless of their good or bad nature, Magneto (once freed from his non-metallic cell) and Mystique join forces with the X-Men to rescue the Professor who is being forced to mentally link with all the mutants on earth, for the purpose of their destruction. <br/><br/>There are many subplots in X2.  IceMan and Rogue continue their teenage foreplay, Wolverine continues to try and understand his past, there is the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine that continues to sizzle and there is the wild card Pyro who seems to have problems with authority and anger management.  But when you get right down to it, the story doesn't matter much.  Brian Singer spends his $150 million dollar budget wisely, and the special effects are top rate, and the body count (missing from the first movie), piles up fast.<br/><br/>Wolverine commands the biggest presence on screen and his battle with the intruders to the school and later with DeathStrike, is better than anything filmed in the earlier released superhero film Daredevil.<br/><br/>Those comic book enthusiasts will not leave disappointed and will have an advantage over the average movie goer.  You will get glimpses of Colosses, Kitty Pryde, and there are enough scenes of the Blackbird that the plane should have been given an acting credit.<br/><br/>Mostly, Brian Singer does what Peter Jackson has done before him.  He made a film that is a lot of fun, but is a tease for a third.  Although no official announcement about X3 is evident, X-Men 2 ends with the death of major character (no worries, the Pheonix will rise) and with Pryo taking his place amongst Magneto and Mystique as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.<br/><br/>Especially in today's real world, it is promising and refreshing to see both good and bad characters join forces whenever evil threatens all.  Don't expect Bullseye and Daredevil or Batman and Joker to team up, but that just keeps movies like this even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>In short, a good film.  Better than the first and hopefully, just a launching board for the third.  B+."

","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>First off, I must say that I DID enjoy this movie.  It had some very good scenes (especially Nightcrawler's assassination attempt, and Magneto's prison-break, as others have mentioned), but it did have some major flaws.<br/><br/>1. Whoever cast Halle Berry in this film should be made to apologize to ever single person who purchased a ticket.  Her portrayal of Storm remains completely lifeless.  There's still time to get Iman for X-Men 3, folks.<br/><br/>2. Too much foreshadowing at the end of the film.  I felt like I was watching a none-too-subtle advertisement that gave away the entire plot. The silhouette in the water was especially silly.<br/><br/>3. There wasn't nearly enough development of the Pyro character to make it reasonable that he would have wound up taking off with Magneto.<br/><br/>4. Speaking of Magneto, he and Mystique have some interesting dialogue... are they getting it on?  Good for him if they are, but still, that's a bit creepy.<br/><br/>5. Still no Gambit.  Man... <br/><br/>6. Has Wolverine never heard of a razor?  I know that it's remaining true to the comic and all, but the filmmakers have already changed so much (the eyes that Nightcrawler and Storm were making at each other come to mind) that it would just be the tiniest thing to allow us to appreciate a fine natural resource such as Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>Okay... sorry for that.<br/><br/>In general, though, I found it to be an enjoyable movie, and definitely worth seeing."
"simpleton2632","10","1","2","2 May 2003"," Better than the first and Rouge is HOT!
","Tonight I saw Xmen2. It was fantastic. The story was a little shady compared to the comics and the cartoon but it was still a sight to see. Jean Grey is hot and lets not forget how hot Rouge has gotten. I think she lost a few pounds because she seemed lighter in this one. A few things that are way better this time around would definately be cyclops glasses, storms hair, and how cool it sounds when Wolverine says ""BUB"". Lets go one at a time.<br/><br/>Cyclops and his visor- First movie it was huge. I think what happened was, Bryan Singer watched the cartoon and thought it would be cool to emulate that. Bad idea Bryan. And at least he recognized it. The visor this time around was immensly smaller than the first. Big difference and much better look. Cyclops actually looked like a badass this time.<br/><br/>Storm and her crazy hair- Halle Berry would not be my first choice for Storm but she tried hard this time and lost that pathetic accent, or at least didn't show it. Her hair was under control this time meaning she looked as hot as she normally does. Too bad she's married, and at least Billy gave her a good rogering. Go Billy Bob!! There is another stupid line she gives but I wont give it away so you can experience the dorkyness as I had to. It's much better than what she said in the first movie...:<br/><br/>""Do you know what happens to Toads when they get struck by lightening? Same as everything else!""<br/><br/>cue shock sounds and lightning...God what a stupid line. It's one of those that sounds good on paper but when Halle says it, it sounds dumb. Kinda like the ENTIRE move Monsters Ball but that's another story.<br/><br/>Wolverine saying Bub- This time Wolverine says Bub a few times, and it's totally cool. The first movie they threw it in so the comic geeks like myself would be pleased...and I was...but anyway, they had a few more ""bubs"" this time and they were perfect timing, funny yet: Oh he just stabbed me and that really hurt...yea kinda like that...<br/><br/>By the way Jean is not old and unappealing...she is gorgeous...<br/><br/>For the record...I apologize for the portrayal of Scott Summers. Jason Marsden is not fitting. He's too short and he's not a leader at all. Both movies are lead by Jean and Storm. How about some Cyclops taking some charge here? Seriously, If Jason reads this, I'm sorry but I don't like you as Cyclops, your not able to fit the role. But his performance this time around was better that the first. And I wouldn't get rid of him for the third installment for the sake of sequels.<br/><br/>I HATE IT WHEN THEY REPLACE AN ACTOR WITH SOMEONE ELSE FOR SEQUELS. EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO BE BAD HAVE SOME DECENCY FOR LEGACY!!<br/><br/>Batman...need I say more?<br/><br/>OK Quick batman rant...Michael was the best at both<br/><br/>Val was a good Batman and a pretty good Bruce<br/><br/>George ruined it. He needs to stick to the doctor thing.<br/><br/>For the 4th one, lets get Joel Schumacher to direct and Benicio Del Toro as Batman...Come on you know that would be awsome...he couldn't ruin it more than George and Joel did!!!"

","* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant<br/><br/>WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>What is it this year.No sooner has one sequel(Shanghai Knights) been and gone that was better than it's predecessor than we get another one.This time the movie happens to be the long awaited X-men 2,or X-2 as the film makers apear to have dubbed it.Having not liked the first movie which I fealt was a huge let down I was most pleasently surprised after watching this.<br/><br/>Starting off where the first movie finished X-2 opens on an attack on the American president in the White house by an unknown assassin.The Presidents bodyguards attempt to defend the countries leader to the best of their ability but the assassin is no mere man.He is quite obviously a mutant and one who's appearance is more inhuman than most. The creature, a German named Kurt Wagner(Played by Scots actor Alan Comming)uses his incredible powers of speed, agility and teleportation to despatch the presidents guards and break in to the oval office where he pins the terrified world leader to a desk while brandishing a massive dagger.It seem a fore gone conclusion that Wagner is about to stab the President with the weapon when he is shot and wounded by one of the world leaders men who happend to still be conscious.<br/><br/>Wagner teleports away,leaving behind the dagger embedded within the President's desk and a label upon it with the words 'Mutant Freedom emblazened upon it.This is more than enough to put the chills up the President and more than needed for the worlds media to seize upon as mutant hating propoganda.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Logan(The amazing Hugh Jackman)or Wolverine as he is also known as,returns to the mutant training school owned by his friend Prof.Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart).Logan's search for the scientific millitary installation where he lost his memory has been less than fruitful.Reunited with Rogue(Anna Paquin)the teenage girl he helped in the first movie who has the power to sap the energy from any living being.Logan finds that she is now dating another mutant.A teenage boy called Bobby Drake who has the power to freeze virtually any object.<br/><br/>Another teenager at the school is John Allerdyce who has the power of combustion.He can start fires with his mind.This young lad though has a more rebellious nature than his two friends,Rogue and Bobby and through out the movie we see this nature at it's very worse which will lead to a scary move on the part of the young man.<br/><br/>Prof. Xavier meanwhile on learning of what transpired at the white house instructs two of his former pupils, Storm and Jean Grey(The beautiful actresses Halle Berry and Famke Janssen)to try and find the mutant who attacked the President and hope to discover and understand why he did what he did.<br/><br/>As Storm and Jean make their way to find Nightcrawler, former soldier and scientist for the US army, Col.William Stryker(Brian Cox) is attepting to set a diabolical plot he has in motion.A hater of mutants, Stryker uses the powers invested upon him by the President to find out where the mutant training school is.The source of this information is none other than the meniachal Erik Lehnsherr(Ian McKellen), better known as the master of magnetism, Magneto.Stryker gained the information from a device he planted on Magneto's neck.It was this device that made the human despising mutant spill his guts to the colonel.<br/><br/>With his mentally controlled mutant henchwoman Lady Deathstrike(Kelly Hu) in tow, Stryker begins to put his plans in to operation.The invasion of the mutant school and the erradication of every single mutant on the face of the planet.But unknown to Stryker.one of Magneto's lackey's, the cunning shapeshifter Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) is out there planning to free her master.It's this act that will lead the pair of human hating mutants in to an uneasy alliance with the X-men.<br/><br/>This is an Excellent movie.Better than than the first movie deserved.Almost every one of the cast gives grade-A performaces.Once again Hugh Jackman is magnificent as possibly the best character in the movie.Who can't help but love that rugged smart ass that Wolverine is.Who can also forget the likes of brits Patrick Stewart,Ian Mckellen,Brian Cox and Alan Comming who are all first rate(Even though Cox's southern accent is a bit on the dodgy side).Kudos must go to James Marsden who thus far has not recieved mentioned as the X-mens team leader Scott Summers aka.Cyclops.His performance as the more buttoned down mutant to Wolverines rugged charmer deseves equal praise.Famke Janssen is also amazing.Not only is she an incredibly attractive woman but a talented actress as well.She brings just the right of courage to Jean Grey while managing to be convincingly scared of a fate that she knows is coming.Halle Berry however isn't so great.Her performance isn't terrible.It's actually quite good but she will never be anything more to me than an attractive woman with just a glimmer of acting ability. Credit however must go to the kids who all give great performances.Paquin,Stanford and Ashmore could possibly be three of the worlds biggest up and coming movie stars.<br/><br/>As for Bryan Singers direction.It is as good as ever.He show's his versatility on this one once again.All you need do is compare this movie to the likes of his first major success, The Usual Suspects to see his flair as a maker of movies.The script too is brilliantly written.The characters are all richly textured.Being truely believable in a world of true fantasy.It's a testament to the writing talents of those involved.The pace is nicely kept and even holds your interest in the dialogue scenes which at times are quite funny.As for the special effects and the make up.They'll just blow you away.<br/><br/>There is the odd little quibble.The final showdown between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike,although beautifully choreographed could have been a bit longer.The end could also have came a bit sooner as well.<br/><br/>That said however, X-2 is first rate cinema entertainment at it's very best.When you get the chance I suggest you rush out and see it as soon as you can.Because blockbusters that are this good don't come around all that often and trust me, I know.I've seen enough of them to attest to it.<br/><br/>Robs Rating:* * * * *"
"jonasbw","10","1","2","30 April 2003"," A sequel in many ways better than the original, and close to the comic.
","Warning spoilers. X2 is all in all a delightful piece of sci-fi action.   If I should point out something about the movie that I find less agreeable, then it must be the fact that this is only number two in a longer series! When I left the theater I was X-static ( pardon the pun), but never the less I thought  ""Singer you can´t leave me with this, I must know what comes next"". ( I have been reading the comic books for 16 years so I can make an educated guess about what comes next, but still...). The special effects of  X2 are breathtakning. Nightcrawler's teleportation powers appears in live action in a way that one couldn´t possibly have dreamed of, and the scene where Magneto breaks out of his plastic prison is, I dare say, poetic. (Don´t worry, he is being as nasty as he can in this story, even making fun of Rouges hair, which I personally find a bit juvenile).  Unlike ""Spider man"" the look of the scenes doesn´t change  between ""super power scene "" and "" acting scene"".  Speaking of  scenes that rely more heavily on acting, Bobbys ""coming out "" to his parents is magnificent in too many ways for me to get into detail with in a short comment, the family cat alone is worth the price of admission. X-men the movie used at lot of  time on introducing the whole concept of mutants and the X-men, X2 can go on to tell an exciting story, which gives it  an advantage to the original. X2 also get closer to the level of pathos that one is familiar with from the comic books, which also makes more X-ish.  Congratulations Brian Singer."

Many great gimmicks such as Magneto pulling the pins from the Rangers grenades to extracting Iron from a guards body to use as bullets. The violence is hitched up a notch from the previous film which is probably a good thing considering the target audience.

"ovd74","Null","1","2","26 April 2003"," The Unbearable Coolness of Being a Mutant
","Coming out of the theatre after over two hours of one of the most thrilling cinematic joyrides of this young millenium, I can only think of two losers from this second installment of the X-Men franchise: Storm and Cyclops ... and we shall see why later.<br/><br/>The biggest winners, on the other hand, are the audience. Being one of the year's big event movies, X2: X-Men United surely delivered on the hype, treating us to one of the best superhero film adaptations in recent memory.<br/><br/>
The movie leaps and sprints off to a frenetic start, assaulting the senses with every cool thing Hollywood money can buy, and not letting up for the duration of the movie. The story begins with a mutant's assassination attempt on the President right in the White House, which sparks an anti-mutant hysteria among the populace. This emboldens the movie's main villain, retired military scientist William Stryker, who is bent on putting an end to the entire mutant race while using mutants themselves to realize his fiendish designs. Stryker, with the full might of the US military behind him, then launches a treacherous night-time raid on Professor Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters, leaving the beleaguered X-Men with no choice but to unite with their recently escaped arch-nemesis Magneto, hence the title.<br/><br/>There are noteworthy subplots as well, including Iceman's coming-out to his family about his mutant-ness, Wolverine's origin, and an uncanny twist that sees a major character in an act of self-sacrifice. Finally, even the last scene managed to append one last hint of what is to come, which certainly got those comicbook fans in the know, including this author, excited and drooling in anticipation for X3, which by the time it is released should probably be getting a better, more innovative title.<br/><br/>As with all sequels, this one is no different in being freed from the constraints of plot establishment and character introduction. And quite adeptly, director Bryan Singer, along with screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, made full use of their added screen time (this sequel, clocking in at 135 mins, is even longer than the first) to give us more action, special effects and lots of new interesting characters.<br/><br/>
And how delicious those new ones are, most notably the aforementioned Bible-quoting Nightcrawler, and the sweet, menacing Lady Deathstrike, who gets to fight Wolverine, adamantium-for-adamantium, in one of the film's numerous highlights. There is also Pyro, played strikingly by a brooding Aaron Stanford (of Tadpole fame), who gets his own moment to display his fearsome fire-manipulation powers.<br/><br/>Indeed, with this film, Singer comes out of the geek closet - with a bang! - and successfully tells a story much like a comic book: pulp fiction with flashy eye-candy illustrations. And that is not a bad thing in this case! Singer et al perfectly synergized, as clichéd as it sounds, the magic of movie-making with the storytelling simplicity and surrealistic inspiration that gets us all addicted to superhero comicbooks once in our lives. And the result is a sheer sense of wonderment and awe, the kind we feel whenever we see anything `cool', and we can only exclaim to ourselves, `this is what movies are all about: pure delightful entertainment, period.'<br/><br/>
This is not to say however, that the film is devoid of any real-life relevance. On the contrary, it actually echoes many of the events that we continue to witness presently: warmongers dictating policy, minorities being persecuted or marginalized and the McCarthyist witchhunts they are subjected to, and innocents being the ultimate victims. The main conflict of the film franchise, and indeed of the entire, hopelessly convoluted comicbook-based X-Men saga, is humankind's inability to comprehend and accept anything that is different from it. What could be more universal and familiar themes than intolerance and discrimination? And for balancing these delicate subject matters with something as frivolous as a blue-skinned teleporter, AND actually making it work well enough that we all happily suspend our disbelief, which was difficult to do for other failed superhero films like Batman and Robin, this film comes out as a winner in its genre.<br/><br/>
And as for the aforementioned losers? Well, the two biggest losers from the previous X-Men movie managed to make it two-in-a-row.<br/><br/>First is Storm, who again gets the award for the worst hair-do ever of a superhero. From the original's bangs faux pas, she now gets a Farrah Fawcette-meets-Bonnie Raitt do-over, which is just as bad as the previous one!  I couldn't help but wonder what the hell the production designers were thinking when they decided to give her this hideous hairstyle! Probably too high on Starbucks caffeine, all of them. I mean really, how hard is it to just do it the way fine illustrators like Romita and Lee do it in comic books? Long, thick and flowing, and without the bangs, dammit!  I still maintain that Halle Berry, her Oscar notwithstanding, as Storm is one of the most unfortunate miscasts of all time. Ororo as we know her, and as I have grown to love, in comicbooks is an African princess, regal, dignified and tall, none of which are attributes I can see in Berry's Storm.<br/><br/>
But Storm's cinematic travails do not compare to Cyclops', AGAIN the movie's worst loser. The poor guy gets shafted once more in this film, getting relegated to the sidelines even worse than the first time. Before, he was at least took part in important fights, whereas here, he is hardly seen. Pity for Cyclops, who is actually a major character in the comic books, and pity for James Marsden, the character who plays him. Mr. Marsden ought to give the writers, or his agent , or anyone responsible for this kind of shabby treatment, a good red-glared stare.<br/><br/>Will these two unlucky mutants make it three-times-a-charm in the next X-Men movie? This writer probably wouldn't mind, as long as we get treated again to the fantastic unfolding of the X-Men mythos that this sequel proved to be."

"jdesando","Null","1","2","24 April 2003"," About as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.
","`X-Men 2,' the sequel to `X-Men,' is about as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.  Granted it may not have the cultural impact of the first ( a challenge for sequels, especially those adapted from comic books), and it may be too long by about a half hour, but there are intriguing themes like acceptance of differences (mutants) and the equality, maybe superiority, of women (Some of the most powerful mutant activity comes from women).<br/><br/>Although the old `good versus evil' motif is a staple of most successful sci-fi, `X2' Director Bryan Singer (`X-Men,' `The Usual Suspects') has the good fortune of Brian Cox as the very evil William Stryker, dedicated to revenging himself on head mutant professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and destroying all mutants.  The government is determined to neutralize the mutants by putting forth the `Anti-Mutant Registration Act,' which would effectively eliminate any peaceful co-existence. The parallel with John Ashcroft's ambitious `rounding up all the usual Mid-Eastern suspects' comes immediately to mind.<br/><br/>The special effects in `X2' are as good as the best out there, the minor women as smart and versatile as any `Avenger' or `Charlie's Angel' (for example, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mistique, the shape-shifter with a brain and a strong shape), but the leads are even more astounding.  Besides the always-interesting Stewart, Ian McKellan is the wicked but loveable Magneto, and Alan Cumming is the satanic teleporter, Nightcrawler. Even Anna Paquin in a thankless role as Rogue is able to establish a presence. Hugh Jackman as the irresponsible but attractive Wolverine should remain the audience favorite and the most human of the mutants.<br/><br/>As our WCBE operations manager reminded me, casting plays a significant role in sci-fi flick success: Stewart and McKellan are the examples here. But more than their presence are the themes, the imagination, and the energy to make it all distinctively `X.' As always, the Bard says it best:<br/><br/>
`If this be magic, let it be an art. . . .'"
"lightsaber64","8","1","2","23 April 2003"," A triumph for Singer and Co.
","The second in the x-men series has a lot to give, continuing right from where we left off at the end of the first film (which seemed to end pretty prematurely, so the new beginning makes up for that). With a similar feel in themes and shooting technique, but noticeably larger budget and more production time, X2 rocks! In the action/adventure sequel tradition the action scenes are bigger and better, with great Wolverine claw waving moments and even big sequences for the younger members of the x gang. This is perhaps what makes the film, the students of Xavier's school both old and new feature heavily, with good character development on screen and dialogue. The well scripted dialogue of the film fills in x-men1 gaps and leaves you thinking about further development and adventures.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the film doesn't seem balanced enough, heavy on the Wolverine story lines, perhaps a more flashbacks for other characters like Magneto in X-men1 would have been a better use of sections of the film. Also, greater explanation not just implication of smaller characters and their motivations e.g. Pyro could be well placed despite resulting in a slowing of pace.<br/><br/>Generally X2 is head and shoulders above the average comic book film adaptation, despite the rumoured set disputes and constraints Bryan Singer and the cast have again produced an excellent, and intelligent big box office hit!"
"SSJAniFan","1","3","12","28 July 2003"," WHAT WENT WRONG?!
","X-2 is the biggest disappointment this summer.  No, Reloaded and Hulk didn't disapoint me:  I was right about both films sucking.  But X-2!  This was supposed to be the film that took the original hit to an extreme level!  It would revolutionize the comic book film genre again, just as the prequel did three years ago.  Sadly, this is not the case.  We have a horrible b-movie in place of what should have been a classic.<br/><br/>What really makes the movie fall apart is the characters.  Remember how they seemed to feel realistic, and how we felt like we could relate to them? Well, the writers decided to toss that feeling out the window for part 2. These characters are extremely superficial, playing to their old, 2-d, flat comic selves, making it impossible for us to feel that they're real-life representations of the characters we knew so well.  Granted, some characters have moments in the spotlight more than before:  Ie., Iceman and Mystique(who actually has more than one line this time!), but many of the characters, with the possible exception of Wolvie, have had their roles largely diminished, most notably Cyclops.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:  The best comic book movie currently out on DVD is X-Men 1. This is a much better choice than wasting your time on this black sheep."
"tedg","Null","3","13","14 May 2003"," Utterly Pedestrian
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I have enthusiastic hopes for big budget action pictures. That's because the market is so crowded, and the viewing public so visually sophisticated that we know that some thought must go into these things. This is especially so when you are building a franchise, because memories fade. In fact, this movie will probably be forgotten two weeks after the Matrix sequel appears.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, sometimes these projects are so costly, and have such a large distributed creative team that risk drives the thing to the ordinary. In contrast, `Daredevil' was pretty cinematic. The second Harry Potter was a landmark in architectural use of space. The Donners have a reputation for having a deep understanding of how film works and how to intelligently exploit it. So I expected at least a few things excellent.<br/><br/>We DO get movement. We DO have one fight sequence that is well crafted - aptly between the two combatants that are uniquely enhanced by technology. But the sets are amazingly, shockingly, scandalously unimaginative. The little soap opera is predictable and trivial enough - a Marvel legacy. The characters are generally flat. In the comic, they are - compared to other comics - human; here - compared to other film characters - cartoons. Huge Actman overacts hugely in a parody of Russell Crowe. Stewart does his continuing impression of what Shakespeare might do for TeeVee. For some reason the kids here are turned into, well, kids. The only mildly interesting characters are:<br/><br/>-Famke Janssen. She is a very limited actress, but all such professional lives find that one role that is perfect for them. Everything about her fits, especially compared to the other women who are somewhat less limited as actresses. That hair color is something. I wish there were a film hair technician website.<br/><br/>-Ian McKellan, who truly IS a Shakespearean of the British cast, which is to say he is a language rather than a facial/body technician. He molds words, fabricates them into weapons and throws them like the metal globules he steals from the guard's blood. Watch this.<br/><br/>-Alan Cumming who makes a career out of comically annotating evil.<br/><br/>But these three just do their own thing without any relation to anyone else in the film or creating the film. In contrast, the Jason/girl combo is a pretty thrilling idea especially in the context of being the son of the mad scientist (whose science incidentally seems beyond what the Shakespereans could do). That girl is the creation of Stryker dad after the tradition of `Forbidden Planet.` Now think about that - and how she is dressed - a minute and the perversion becomes pretty rich and astonishing.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."

","This highly-promoted sequel was one of the summer blockbusters of 2003, but its hard to see what all the fuss was about. Sure, it's a fast-paced and interesting film, packed with absolutely brilliant special effects work, but really its much of the same and a storyline that doesn't add much to the X-Men mythos. Whilst I enjoyed the characterisation of leads Hugh Jackman (as particularly charismatic as ever) and Famke Janssen (the first film I haven't hated her in), the introduction of teenage leads such as Pyro is a definite pandering to younger teenage audiences. The storyline is all over the place, with lots of action and not much really happening; the set-piece finale takes place inside a huge dam which is about to break apart, and sometimes you feel like you've seen it all before.<br/><br/>The action ranges from the ordinary to the very good. Pyro's display of his skills outside a suburban house is exceptional and the battle between Hugh Jackman and Kelly Hu is superb, and really nasty and violent despite the 12 certificate. One of the pluses is that this is a much more violent film than the first. The effects are decently done but the main characters don't go anywhere apart from through the old scenarios. It feels good to see Shakespearian stars Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen teamed up again, but you really wonder what they are doing here other than picking up a pay cheque. Brian Cox turns in a decent villain but he's somewhat wasted in an otherwise predictable movie which doesn't really have a storyline. Watchable but definitely not worth it a second time around."

","I remember the times when I was so into X-men and I basically followed everyone else's opinion on the movies. People said (because of the comic books) X2 is one of the best movies because it built the Phoenix Saga and all that, and X-Men: The Last Stand was horrible and so on. But I have to admit, I'd rather watch The Last Stand. Mostly because that movie simply looks better, and also because I want to watch a movie and not just judge it based on the comics I haven't even read.<br/><br/>The dialogue in X2 is annoyingly clumsy, and the writing isn't too special in other ways neither. I get that superhero movies aren't usually very original, but the plot structure of X2 is so basic it's annoying. <br/><br/>The most intriguing thing about this film is the metaphor of mutants and the moral dilemmas, but compared to the first X-men movie or The Last Stand there's really no way to choose a side in this film. Superhero movies are usually extremely black-and-white: you know who the good guys are, you know who the bad guys are. Magneto sometimes brings the moral grey areas into the mix, but because he isn't the main antagonist of X2, the movie doesn't offer that anymore. Everyone watching X2 knows Stryker is horrible, it's not even up to debate. <br/><br/>X2 is an alright superhero action movie, but doesn't offer anything interesting to the viewer, but were you expecting anything other than the usual stuff superhero movies throw our ways?"

","Maybe if the makers of this film didn't have all the special effects to rely on, it would have been better.  Perhaps greater attention would have been paid to the story thereby shortening the movie by 15 or 20 minutes.  There is a spoiler in the 3rd paragraph.<br/><br/>First, the good:  I liked the way the film was lit resisting the urge of many current filmmakers to clothe everything in darkness ala Tim Burton. Also, I liked the editing (at least in part) that allowed us to see the movie without requiring a graphics accelerator inside our head to process speed cuts.<br/><br/>The bad:  The focus of the movie deteriorated by the end making the final climax anti-climactic.  Part of the blame goes to the editing which had us watching several very tedious scenes which had nothing to add to the plot (i.e, watching the good mutants decide who would break into the Alkali Lake project), and part to the screenwriting which had the characters doing nothing else but greeting each other (i.e., Around the 1 hour 40 minute mark, I think it was Storm and Jean Gray who greeted each other like they were getting ready to go to a picnic:  Jean see Storm approaching and says ""Storm"" to which Storm looks at Jean and says ""Jean"".).  This kind of useless dialogue happened way too much throughout the movie. (5/10)<br/><br/>In the spirit of the film, I leave you with this dialogue: WOLVERINE - ""Hey."" ME - ""Hey.""

"dima-12","2","1","3","2 May 2003"," Half Bad
","X-MEN<br/><br/>When the initial X-MEN feature was released, I`ve cut it some slack because of Bryan Singer`s previous work. I`ve realized that the movie is part of this cunning Avi Arad strategy of reviving Marvel franchises that began with BLADE. But then, when time went by, when SPIDER-MAN managed to suck so much, when DAREDEVIL appeared to be among the worst major-release directorial efforts ever, on par with ECKS VS. SEVER, I realized that it is not Avi Arad taking care of the franchises. It was New Line taking care of BLADE.<br/><br/>X-2 is considered to be a step forward. And somehow it is better than the first one. But it isn`t the step forward. It is just a healthy step, nothing else. It is the first step. Because the first film should have been X-2.<br/><br/>X-2 has a serious plot. It has enough character development to work with audience that has no knowledge of the comic book or the first film. It really does. X-MEN did develop characters and it sketched the origins but basically it was just a plotless movie that cannot work on its` own. X-2 is a well-shaped film.<br/><br/>The script, written by a comitee, actually offers some smart cues and fine ideas but never really reaches beyond boundaries of halfhearted hacking.<br/><br/>The basic trouble is Singer`s direction. It`s not just that his directorial position means responsibility. It really feels that most of the flaws are directly his own personal fault.<br/><br/>First off, Singer is not an action director. His action scenes are lame. Some of these action scenes are nicely set but they still appear lame. It`s not just the question of his knowledge and talent which is nonexistetnt when it comes to action scenes. It is also his choice to avoid the old school method of fluent action filmmaking. He obviously never goes for the visceral. It`s his concept. A bad one.<br/><br/>He insists on these slow, compiled, action sequences where many details and close-ups obscure his inability to direct big spacious set pieces.<br/><br/>It is a tough thing to sit through a comic book actioner made by a man who can`t and won`t direct energetic action.<br/><br/>Besides, most of the coolest moments happen out of the frame. Check the SWAT raid at Xavier`s School.<br/><br/>There`s also the question of cinematography. Newton Thomas Siegel uses this shady light that is supposed to bring us some sense of realism. Instead it makes al the sets and costumes feel fake.<br/><br/>Bad staging and bad light work reveal other wesknesses. First off, there are some big mistakes in the script. Some howler lines that were supposed to b serious. The whole Nightcrawled affair which is downright terrible.<br/><br/>Also the acting isn`t top notch. Rebecca Romijn Stamos rules not only the toilet scene that was lifted from De Palma`s FEMME FATALE. In the end, it is tough to act in such a superficial enviroment with poorly shot sets and costumes.<br/><br/>The script isn`t brave enough to pull the Grant Morrison twist on the franchise. It sticks to the original Stan Lee vibe with some seventies revisions thrown in. But the Stan Lee vibe makes me compare this one with BATMAN FOEREVER, and it feels like the DC contender had better direction and more consistency even though X-2 feel innovative.<br/><br/>As it was mentioned some of the best scenes in X-2 were lifted form T-2 and FEMME FATALE.<br/><br/>The whole serious minded ideology about mutants being this metaphore for different people doesn`t work because Singer betrayed X-MEN trashy origins but failed to provide us with solid groundwork for this serious, and politically correct, agenda.<br/><br/>X-2 isn`t a complete failure. It isn`t disgrsceful and unbearable. But it isn`t as good as superhero flicks ought to be in 2003."
"Aaron1375","10","1","3","3 May 2003"," Better than I expected.
","I thought this movie would be pretty good, but from the trailers I thought there would be way to many characters.  For the most part though they mainly focused on those who returned from the first movie, with only Nightcrawler and Pyro being the only new characters that showcased their powers.  I was a bit disappointed not to see much of Colossus, and Iceman didn't really do much, but aside from that this one was really good.  I also wished Cyclops was in it more, but that made for an interesting sidepiece as this movie takes place on three fronts.  McKellan is great as Magneto and all the other cast is rather good as well.  Though I loved watching Magneto escape from the prison.  Lady Deathstrike really didn't have too much screen time and she had only one line, but she had one heck of a fight with Wolverine in this one.  Though I wish their fight was a bit longer.  The highlights of this one include of course the fight with Wolvie and Deathstrike, the cool opening scene with Nightcrawler, the scene where Pyro goes berserk, and the scene where the troops raid Xavier's school.  There are other cool scenes in there, but these were my favorites.  I don't think the movie ended as weak as some movie critics have said it did, but it wasn't the best feature of the film.  I also didn't care for the introduction of the Phoenix character they gave flashes of throughout.  I don't know if it will go with the movie formula all that well.  All in all a good film, could have ended better, but I am just being picky."
"mentalcritic","10","1","3","30 April 2003"," If only all sequels could be like this...
","Considering what happened with the Batman series, particularly after Tim Burton left, and considering what has happened in plenty other comic book adaptations such as Spider-Man or Daredevil, nobody would be blamed for having bet that an X-Men sequel would be a disaster. But X2: X-Men United, as it is billed here, is a sequel that can be mentioned in the same breath as Aliens or The Godfather Part II.<br/><br/>Like the original, this new sequel has something to say about how our society deals with people who don't look the same, act the same, think the same, or feel the same as all the drones out there. The spirit of the comic books it is based on is very much alive in this film, and that's a big part of what makes it such compelling viewing. In today's society, people with a serious mental illness will be rooting for characters like Wolverine, or Magneto if they have a sadistic side, all the way. In tomorrow's society it could be people who undergo genetic engineering to rid themselves of cancer or other horrible diseases. Who knows? That's the truly sad part of these stories - they only seem to either stay relevant or get more relevant as time goes on.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen is in fine, fine form as Magneto, the angry mutant whose justification for waging war on ""normal"" society is all but handed to him on a platter in this episode. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos actually gets to do something other than sit there and look pretty this time, and Halle Berry proves once again that she cannot act her way out of a wet paper bag. But once again, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin steal the show, in spite of the latter having a significantly reduced role compared to the first film. Shawn Ashmore also squeezes his head in and manages to prove he is there for a reason, too.<br/><br/>Unlike the original X-Men, in which the true bad guys are mostly undefined except for a rather nasty Senator, one will not be able to walk out of X2 without pathologically hating the bad guys here. Brian Cox plays the mad general so well that anyone with a truly compassionate bone in their body will want to leap into the picture and tear the head off the kind of man who could do THAT to his own son. And the film is all the stronger for it, because it brings the message that the normalists who would give us all gene tests when deciding who should live or die are the real bad guys, not the mutants who have been made bitter and angry by their behaviour. I know a whole family of utter creeps who would do well to be nailed into a chair and forced to watch this film with their eyes pried open, Ludivico-style.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the ending except for two small points. One is that it makes Ray Park's line in the first film (""Don't you people ever die?"") seem all the funnier, except it really isn't the sort of point where one should laugh. I did, but that is just the kind of person I am. The other is that it proves anyone in this film can out-act Halle Berry, even another former Bond girl, in this case Famke Janssen. She gives the film an end-sequence of the kind that I've only seen in other films like Gladiator and Rollerball (the real Rollerball, I mean).<br/><br/>To summarise, out of 125 minutes of near perfection, I have only three minor complaints. The editing of the final battle sequence, particularly when Patrick Stewart is in the new Cerebro, is a little too loose for my liking. Parts seem to have been repeated just to stretch out the running time. I also found Nightcrawler's constant prayer recitals annoying. If this was supposed to enforce the idea of Christian good guys, it doesn't work because we've seen before how their kind are little different from the William Stryker caste. Lastly, they really should have got someone other than Halle Berry to play Storm. I don't care who, just anyone. She is the biggest personality vortex I have ever seen on the big screen, and I kept expecting Anna Paquin to turn to her and say ""I *earned* my Oscar"".<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, I wish all sequels could be as good as this effort. Ten out of ten from me. It did lose a point because of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but it gains it back (and then some) whenever Hugh Jackman or Anna Paquin say something. Those two should work together more often."

Plainly, a different production team was in charge of delivering a knock out first punch. <br/><br/>The rest of this is just a flat morality play, the sort of thing that aims for a target containing ""Spartacus"" and ""La Cage.../The Birdcage"", while using big, colorful characters.<br/><br/>Shamefully, Singer approaches this from the angle of Bush-bashing (forgetting or ignoring that VP Cheney's daughter is openly and unapologetically gay - a fact that cost Bush some support from the Movement Right) and blaming the evil Republicans for all the woes of those ""who are different""...a mother asks her son if he'd tried 'not being a mutant'...a father reprograms his 'deviant' son -- by the way, he's named Stryker after Julius Streicher, the infamous Jew-baiter and Nazi war criminal -- to suggest the US government supports this is deeply offensive.<br/><br/>Singer is a person who is granted the extraordinary power of directing a series about people who are granted extraordinary powers...and sadly, all he can offer us here is cheap, hackneyed moralizing.<br/><br/>Let's see Singer use some real power to take on the 'People's Republic' of China, where gays are routinely incarcerated in mental asylums. <br/><br/>Or follow the example of John Maynard Keynes, a gay man who changed the way the world thinks about economics (whether you agree with Keynes or not), and direct his powers at things other than preening and profiteering."

An aggressively boring movie not only wrecked by ugly sets and a horrendous pace, but also by how it fails to live up to the central conflicts in the movie.

The scene where Iceman meets his parents in shock - which then follows Pyro killing armed cops with explosions - is easily the most emotionally riveting and coolest scene out of all of these movies.

","I've re-watched X2. I have examined it, I have pondered it and, to be honest, my opinions on it really haven't changed very much. It's one thing to aim for the lowest bar possible and just not really try in terms of thematic material and subtext. X2 doesn't do that. Instead, X2 seeks to adapt the God Loves, Man Kills storyline of the X-Men comics and use a superhero movie as an allegory for the Civil Rights movement. The issue is that Bryan Singer lacks the effort to handle this subject with any level of moral responsibility or care, resulting in one of the worst Civil Rights allegories I've ever seen in a fantasy or Sci-Fi work.<br/><br/>The depiction of William Stryker is an absolute joke in this film. Singer wanted to have things both ways; he wanted the ""fire & brimstone"" extremist of the comics, but he didn't want Conservative audience members to be offended at the depiction of a religious extremist gone off the deep end. Instead, we get a super powerful U.S Army colonel so cartoonishly bigoted that real bigots can watch him and go ""Thank God, I'm not that guy."" The fact that nobody in the U.S Government could see this person for the frothing-at-the-mouth, xenophobic mad man he is shows a massive lack of care from Singer at making this an allegory for any real world issues.<br/><br/>I suppose I should almost be grateful for the Saturday morning cartoon character bigotry present in William Stryker, because when the film tries to be subtle, it's a million times worse. The dialogue for Iceman's parents couldn't be more on the nose if it tried (""Have you ever tried...Not being a mutant?""), showing a massive lack of respect for the audience's intelligence in terms of how it delivers its social commentary. Don't even get me started on how they eventually try to have Bobby turned in to the authorities, presumably to be killed. That's how human/mutant relations are pretty much framed the whole movie; a battle between others. Good and evil, black and white. In real life, almost every Civil Rights movement has had allies from the opposing side. I'm not saying the film should have swung hard the other way and portrayed allies to the X-Men as ""human saviors"" (This would have been just as problematic), but to portray oppressed minorities as completely and utterly alone in their suffrage like this movie tries to do is just wrong.<br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin, however, has to be Xavier's scene with the President. Instead of appealing to the President's empathy, reminding him of the untold suffering that those working under him (Particularly Stryker) have wrought upon their fellow man for surface level differences, Xavier's reasoning on why the President shouldn't condone the actions of a former underling who literally tried to commit genocide completely boils down to fear. By Xavier's logic, slaughtering millions of oppressed minorities isn't wrong because it's unethical to hurt innocent men, women and children, it's not wrong because we're all sentient people with thoughts and hopes and dreams and loved ones. It's wrong because if we do allow it, the radical members of those oppressed minorities will rise up and hurt us in return. This line of thinking does have precedent; it's how terrorists rationalize their viewpoints to their targets and victims. While it's definitely accidental, X2 kinda-sorta ends up saying that Civil Rights activists and violent terrorists share the same rhetoric and that peaceful relations between privileged majorities and oppressed minorities is ultimately impossible. The best we can hope for is an uneasy truce. This message isn't just terrifying to contemplate, it's straight up dangerous. It may, in fact, be the worst possible take for a film about Civil Rights.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to make this review political. I am judging it from the perspective of social commentary because that is what Singer so clearly wants me to do. And from that stance, I think this movie is stupid, I think this movie is insensitive and I think its main message, if taken seriously, would ultimately do much more harm than good. If you have such little faith in a Civil Rights issue that you think the only way to convince people of the righteousness of your cause is to frame the argument on how the issue would directly affect them, you shouldn't be making a film about that issue."

Granted, the action scenes are fun and exciting, but those are the only moments when the film tries.<br/><br/>In conclusion, X2 is nothing but a poor man's rehash of the first film, trying too hard to get people on the edge of their seats rather than sparking any sort of interest."

","The first half of the film is particularly gripping and dark, and holds the attention of the audience all the time. It is intense, fast and gut-wrenching, and belongs to the best thrillers. The villain seems invincible, and is about to kill all the mutants. <br/><br/>The second half of the film is slower and more predictable.

","With the huge amount of praise and good reception at the box office of the film which introduced Marvel's mutant heroes in theaters, it is only natural that a sequel was provided by 20th Century Fox. Again, Bryan Singer was invited to take the director's chair. Scripted by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter, based on the story of Zak Penn, David Hayter and Bryan Singer, this second adventure of the X-Men is based on the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", which introduces the X- Men and their enemies, the Brotherhood of Mutants, against genocidal Colonel William Stryker. This leads an assault on Professor Xavier school to build their own mutant screening version, the brain, in order to destroy all of Earth's mutants.<br/><br/>Without the need for an introductory film to the universe of characters, Bryan Singer was able to give more grandeur and gravity will all plot, can better develop the characters, but this time, knowing give a final finish much higher in the action scenes, which, moreover, they are present in a greater amount. The director also keeps the debate on the acceptance of differences open in the first film. Interestingly the sequence in which Bobby Drake, the Iceman, tells his parents that is a mutant is, for example, is a parallel to a teenager interesting that reveals a homosexual family. Racism, religious beliefs, prejudice, changes of puberty and intolerance are mirrored in the problems faced by younger pupils Xavier.<br/><br/>Seeking to correct errors of the first film, Singer managed to make a film superior to the first in several respects. First, he knew very well deal with a huge amount of characters in the scene. As for the new characters, the biggest news is on account of Kurt Wagner, or as it is known in the comics, Nightcrawler, played by Allan Cumming. The character is revealed the most realistic aspect of the film, with its religious devotion being well studied and turning it into the most human facet of the film. Lady Deathstrike and William Stryker also sound other highlights. huge success in the previous film, the main mutant, Wolverine continues highlighting. The love triangle between Jean, Wolverine and Cyclops also deepens. Mystique and Magneto are still more mingled and yield good scenes of comedy and sarcasm. Some characters that had appeared, more gain some prominence. Pyro (Aaron Stanford - the mutant who controls the fire), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), though still as students, already in the first team and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart ) and Syrin (Shauna Kain) also appear using his powers.<br/><br/>The script is deeper and turns, thus maintaining the inserts of humor and the darker mood of well-balanced narrative in its various sub- plots (Stryker and his mutant son, the past of Wolverine, the love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey, the revelation of the Iceman to be a mutant to his family and how she deals with it; the escape of Magneto's prison, the Stryker plan to eliminate mutants etc). Proof that there is more story to tell with almost a half-hour in length than its predecessor and present a more ominous story than the last. Unlike the first film, where the focus was greater in the development of the characters, especially Wolverine and Rogue, besides the obvious concern in presenting the world of X-Men to the public, this sequel surpasses the previous film in all aspects. Singer may be more to the point without worrying so much in this presentation of the universe of human and how mutants are inserted in it.<br/><br/>In action scenes, Singer stands for performing one of the best opening sequences in movies based on comic books. Night can invade the White House, fight and win easily at least a dozen highly trained security staff to get the President of the United States. Another scene worth mentioning is the invasion of Charles Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. A well-orchestrated invasion carried out in the dead of night, in which it sought surprise mutants that there studied and lived. And of course, all the conclusion of the story where the heroes seek to prevent the use of the brain to annihilation initially the X-Men. Overall, Bryan Singer increased violence, but made the most compelling fights (which happens between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is sensational from start to finish).<br/><br/>Singer can make a film that delivers what it promises discuss. It goes deep to the issue of intolerance ""mutant phenomenon"" and the impact it would have on government and society. In addition, it raised the level of the action scenes and showed us how intense it could be a superhero movie. To close the pack, we still had a great hook to the ""Saga of the Dark Phoenix"" for future productions in an unexpected and poignant end. Action, emotion, humor, grand effects and an elaborate plot are present to the public and fans of the X- Men universe."

"bowmanblue","9","0","1","3 February 2015"," X-tremely good sequel
","I was never that much of a fan of the original X-men movie, not that I'm a die-hard comic book fan of the source material; I just thought it could have been better. Luckily, X-men 2 (or 'X2' as it's sometimes known) is that rarest of breeds – a sequel that actually surpasses its predecessor.<br/><br/>For the few of you that don't know, the X-men are a bunch of superheroes (or 'mutants' as is the term here), naturally each having his or her own superpower. And, whereas the nice of our mutated friends hang out at 'Professor X's' 'school for the gifted,' those less keen on helping mankind are part of Magneto's 'Brotherhood.' Naturally, the two groups have a tendency to square off from time to time and anyone like me, i.e. not a superpower to my name, does tend to get caught in the middle.<br/><br/>Therefore the President of America isn't too keen on his voters being fried to a crisp with some sort of mutant 'mind-ray' and enlists the help of one slightly psychotic general (Stryker) to come up with a plan to get rid of all mutants – good or bad. This, in turn, means that the X-men have to team up with the Brotherhood in order to save their collective skins. So, you have a nicely uneasy alliance formed (which you basically know won't last, but it's still fun to watch).<br/><br/>And it's generally a great adventure to watch. If you're generally into superhero movies then you've probably seen the 'Marvel' films. It's worth noting that X-men does have a flavour of its own and, despite being taken from the same comic universe, feels different enough to make it stand out in its own right. Its tone is overall darker than the films of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but, unlike Marvel's heroes, the X-men has to concentrate on more characters at once.<br/><br/>It's an 'ensemble' cast, with many famous faces playing the leads. Therefore not all the X-men really get as much screen time as the probably deserve. Yes, there are a few 'lesser' mutants who don't really matter, but equally most of the cast would probably be able to carry an entire film of their own (not just Wolverine, the fans' favourite who spawned an entire franchise of his own). Yes, (the many) fans of Wolverine will be happiest, as he's clearly the star, but Sir Ian McKellen gets a decent crack of the whip as the leader of the Brotherhood.<br/><br/>One misfire was 'Nightcrawler.' I do actually remember him from the comics as a creepy-looking good guy who basically looked like a monster/vampire. I always pictured him a dark and hulking presence, brooding silently and basically playing the part of the anti-hero. However, he's sort of more the 'comic relief' of the film, always jabbering on like a blue-faced Jar Jar Binks. Luckily, like many of the lesser mutants, he's not in it that much, but he could have been so much cooler than he is (my opinion!).<br/><br/>So, all in all, if you like your superhero movies and enjoy them with a darker flavour than your average Marvel epic, give this one a go. If you're well into your X-men comics, it might be worth checking the cast list to see how much your favourite character is in it – even a big film like X2 can't cater for every mutant!"

","A better movie all be it marginally of the first. More characters add up to make it very good and for films like X-Men all there is to it is action. Without the presence of two Shakespearean actors we would only see action and blowing things up scenes. X- Men can deliver great stories that are not confusing and a convoluted story arc which is what happened in X- Men 3.<br/><br/>X- Men, X2, Wolverine & First Class are all fairly good movies hyped by certain quarters. All these X-Men movies were fairly good to begin with but the problem was they had so much more potential. You lose interest because the story was not good enough.

","""X-Men 2"" improves on everything the first movie failed to do. The characters have been established, and now we can just be absorbed into the story. This time around we are more lucky when Magneto (Ian McKellen) has a much more sinister plot put together, which will surprisingly unite all the mutants together to take down an even larger threat.<br/><br/>Here in this scenario everyone gets a lot more screen time, and an even deeper look into the past of fan-favourite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who really gets to let loose in this movie (Due to the restricted stabbing notions of the first movie). A lot more fan favourite mutants make appearances as well, such as Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who was executed perfectly. The relationship between Ice-Man (Shawn Ashmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) gets more screen time, and is developed ""well enough"". Colonel. Stryker (Brian Cox) is a fantastic villain choice, and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) actually has something to do that is pivotal to the story and is really well executed.<br/><br/>As said earlier, the film is an improvement over everything the first movie validated. The action sequences are somewhat more lengthier and stronger than the last outing, and every scene has a sense of depth and weight that gets more pivotal towards the finale. Dialogue seems more heavy and meaningful between characters, and when you can pull off something as big as ""X-Men"", and add those kind of strengths into almost every aspect you have great capable blockbuster success in your hands.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: This is a great super-hero movie, and the best of what the original trilogy had to offer. 8/10."

","THIS is why it's so important for producers to pick the right director. In the hands of a less competent filmmaker, this one could've been laughable. (Not that a filmmaker suited to ONE franchise will be suited to all- SUPERMAN RETURNS being a prime example, in this case.) ""Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute,"" Professor X tells us in the opening voice-over. We're soon introduced to the sleazebag William Stryker (Brian Cox), who manipulates the weak-willed Nightcrawler into a one-man assault on The White House. This sets in motion a ""reprisal"" raid, in which Stryker is able to capture a sampling of teenage mutants to experiment on (his son, it turns out, is a mutant and Stryker has been experimenting on him): he wants to turn the world's mutants into ""normals."" Magneto, meanwhile, plans to reverse the effects of Stryker's machine (Cerebro II, patterned after Professor X's Cerbro, which allows him to telepathically contact every mutant on the planet at the same time). My one gripe about X-MEN II is the almost incidental part played by Cyclops- my favorite mutant from the early days of the comics (patterned after The Comet, no doubt, an early comic book hero who could fire bursts of energy from his eyes; the only real difference between the two being that The Comet could fly). None of the subsequent films in the series equaled the first two."

In this sequel to the first film, Wolverine attempts to learn more about his identity and a new villain emerges in William Stryker (who in a way is the human counterpart to Magneto) who, like Magneto in the last film, plots to annihilate the entire mutant race by controlling Professor X. <br/><br/>The opening scene with Nightcrawler was spectacular. One thing the first movie lacked was good special effects, which was greatly improved upon in the second movie. Action scenes were on par and the plot was certainly interesting.<br/><br/>However, X2 was a little too much at times. Besides the main plot, there were so many other sub-plots. A lot of new characters got introduced and the movie ended up being dragged out, in my opinion, to explore these small nuances in these characters. It took away from the main storyline and left the film with a confused sense of direction. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was okay. Better special effects and showmanship but too cluttered with new characters and sub-plots."

","So Toad and Sabretooth are dead and buried then it seems, guess they weren't that popular huh. Not surprising seeing as they were the worse characters from the last film. So after the unexpected smash of the original film we got this sequel adding more characters, more effects and a bit more much needed action.<br/><br/>Moving on from the first film we discover now that Magneto has been tortured into giving up vital information about Xavier's school for mutants by the nasty new bad guy William Stryker. Stryker and his team capture Xavier and plan to create another Cerebro so they can brainwash Xavier into wiping out all the mutants of the world with his mental powers. Now is the time...the X-Men and Magneto's naughty mutants must join forces to save all mutant kind.<br/><br/>Everything kicks off nicely with the cool introduction of new character Nightcrawler, who is performed with a likable heartfelt sincere persona by Alan Cumming. Its a good start to the film because not only do we get a slick sexy 'Matrix' style ass-kicking sequence courtesy of the Crawler, but this guy looks good, he's accurate to the source material and simply feels very fresh and original especially with that German accent. The one thing I don't get about this guy is the fact he can only teleport when he can see where's he's teleporting too. Surely when you teleport to anywhere you can't see where your going right? so what difference does it make?<br/><br/>This film clearly tries for the 'Empire' tone by making everything quite dark with lots of pending doom and gloom. As we all know the film also ends on a downer with major character Jean Grey kicking the bucket, new boy Pyro switching to the dark side and Wolverine discovering some of his bleak past plus having to fight another similar mutant. In general the whole team are feeling like crap come the end of the day plus they no longer appear to be safe in their 'Wayne Manor-esque' home.<br/><br/>But not only this we also get a much more violent film than the safe fast cut first flick. When Styker's men storm Xavier's mutant school armed to the teeth with automatic weapons we see Wolverine tear into some real hack n slash action as he rampages through the building slicing n dicing soldiers left right and centre (finally!). We also see a hint of mutant power from some younger students at the same time. Of course there is no blood or guts anywhere in the film but we do see Wolverine piling into bad guys impaling them pretty good with no cuts. This sequence to me shows another possible Nazi angle again as a community of 'different' people are invaded, rounded up and taken away from their home by armed soldiers, not even women and children are left.<br/><br/>I liked how the story develops Pyro Iceman and Rogue together as they come to terms with their powers plus adolescence. The scene where Iceman outs himself to his parents is a cute scene with very real message which some folk will relate to. Some nice little touches of humour admittedly but its all very tame and easy going. The fact Iceman is obviously the good guy and Pyro is obviously the quick tempered bad guy feels a bit too simple, amazed one isn't wearing blue and the other red whilst fighting over Rogue. I didn't really like the inclusion of Lady Deathstrike though, she felt unnecessary and merely there just for a showdown with Wolverine at the end...which she ultimately was as she did nothing else the entire time. She's in and out quick, a sidekick that's killed off neatly, only there for the visuals and adding to the character roster. The fight was also completely lacking in any excitement because we know neither of these characters can be hurt, this being a problem with these films at times, invincible people fighting each other.<br/><br/>Although I must admit I liked the concept of Stryker using his mutant son to control other mutants with a serum from his brain and the fact he induces Xavier into almost killing off everyone. OK sure the fact they managed to built another Cerebro seemed far fetched as I thought that was a special contraption that only Xavier and Magneto could devise but none the less it worked.<br/><br/>I don't deny the film is dark but maybe it tries a little too hard? I'm not trying to nit pick but it does feel a bit forced especially when Grey didn't really have to die as far as I can tell. The jet wouldn't start due to a malfunction, so Grey goes outside and protects the jet from the tidal wave of water whilst using her powers to start up the jet. Why didn't she just start the jet up from inside or am I missing something here? I think I am missing something aren't I...??? Anyway it kinda felt odd that she dies in this way as if to try and create this iconic emotional death which I didn't really feel, it just seemed like a daft waste (and to kick start the Phoenix plot).<br/><br/>Everything does feel a bit clockwork to be honest, there aren't any major surprises really (you can see things a mile off) but none the less it does hold your attention to the end. The visuals are on the whole much smoother and glossier than the first film, the actors are really getting into their respective roles, multiple characters are handled well by Singer and the film is also a highly positive encouraging shout out for gay people, teens, underachievers, outcasts, bullied people and any minorities on the whole. Although I still don't get how that highly advanced metal detector that scanned everything on and in the human body didn't pick up all that iron in the guards bloodstream, oh well.<br/><br/>7/10"

","As you might expect, the first X-Men movie was a huge success, both financially and critically. A sequel was inevitable. But what would it be about? <br/><br/>You can tell this is a bigger production, both in the special effects and in the fact that he expanded the cast. All of the X-Men from the first film return; there is also an increased role for a lot of the smaller characters, like Iceman and Pyro. Plus, we get Nightcrawler as played by Alan Cumming. This movie also teams the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the X-Men to take on a brand new set of bad guys, including Brian Cox's William Stryker and Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike.<br/><br/>It combined the themes and characters of that story with a bunch of elements from Wolverine's back-story. As much as it juggles a larger cast, this movie really is focused on Wolverine, which is an interesting change from the first movie's fake-out of being all about Rogue. <br/><br/>But the trade-off is what they did with Nightcrawler: a mutant who has a faith in Catholicism, which is unheard of because all of the mutants here believe in themselves. However, Nightcrawler puts his faith in God, something that has not been established in the X-Men Universe. He looks like a demon, someone that is vile in Christianity and Catholicism, but he's actually a super-nice guy. Not only does this movie deal with mutants vs. humans, but also the belief of faith, and what it means.<br/><br/>The action here is really great. Again, it's exactly what you want to see from an X-Men movie, and with a few exceptions, it looks good. The teleportation effect is particularly solid, and when it's combined with Nightcrawler taking out Secret Service guys by doing teleporting moves, it's like comic pages brought to life.<br/><br/>However, it feels a bit convoluted. There's just so much going on, that when you stop and think about it, it doesn't add up. Whereas, in the first movie, it was a simpler story that flowed easily. This one is a bigger movie, with lots going on. There's Wolverine trying to figure out his past, Stryker and his plans, rescuing Xavier, the romance between Rogue and Ice-Man, there's just too much going on.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it is better than the first one, though not by much. Whilst it is a bigger project, it just somewhat loses focus. I don't know what I would rather have: a simpler story that flowed but was somewhat edited, or a bigger story that has some narrative flow but is edited well. But I still highly recommend it, especially if you're an X-Men fan."

","The financial success of the first film spurred Fox to commission the sequel. Thought they probably knew before the release of the first part that the x-men comic couldn't be adapted to film in only one movie as it would be incomplete, 2003 saw the release of the second part. Thank the stars the original cast didn't change, Bryan Singer retained the director's chair, and they increased the budget exponentially making the action scenes finally on par with the story and the layered meaning. Of course there is always the curse of the sequel when the second part isn't up to par of its predecessor and ends up being a disappointment, but every once in a while a part two is better, more, bigger than its lead in, and that's the case with x-men 2. The larger budget didn't mess with the quality and they didn't forget to write a story and fill it with meaning either. On almost every level it offers more than the first part, Singer did something with the story that was akin to what James Cameron did with Aliens. Though x-men 2 doesn't change genres, it isn't redone with a new spin, instead all that happens is that we get more characters, the action scenes become more developed and they come up with a storyline that hits hard. Several months have passed since The X-Men defeated Magneto and imprisoned him in a seemingly impregnable plastic chamber. There are government anti-mutant measures being implemented. A scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro and attacks them a few are lucky to escape, they then meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X. Singer consciously kept building up the mutant world. He used the raised budget to make the film better not to make it different. All he did was patch up the holes that he left gaping open in the first film, with what was left over he gave us new characters, making the whole more than the sum of the first part. Without changing the basic concept it was better than the first. Magneto and Professor X are still fighting hard for their own ideology and humans are still afraid of the mutants. It is possibly a little darker and more serious than the first, but that just made it even better. Maybe the only bad thing was that not all the characters got enough screen time to develop, though it was almost ½ hour longer than the first one. Cyclops and Nightcrawler seem to be background noise and even sometime Xavier but that maybe due to the storyline. Other characters get more than their fair share like Wolverine and Jean Grey, but it is hard to deal with so many characters. The script was great, funny at times, and there is even a little blood The film is long but it seems shorter. Bryan singer did a good job just like with the first part.

Riddled with sublime special effects, some characters we can further invest in, and drama and subtext that is further elaborated to provide for a viewing that requires us to keep our brains on, if you catch my drift.<br/><br/>The story reacquaints us to Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his team of loyal X-Men, who fight for the idea that humans and mutants, those with extraordinary, life-altering powers, can live harmoniously together. However, there has been a great deal of anti-mutant ideology being peddled by Congress and the general public, specifically lead by Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox). Stryker pushes for a mutant genocide, believing that humans shouldn't have to share their planet with mutants in any way.<br/><br/>Of course this calls for some form of combat, which is where our uncanny X-Men come in. The clawed-Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the easily-underestimated Storm (Halle Berry), the telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and the shy but imitable Rogue (Anna Paquin) attempt to lay to rest these ideas, and also, once again, stop Magneto (Iran McKellen) from yet another bout of attempting to have mutants control the universe Much of X2's success is attributable to the talent of director Bryan Singer, who pulls most of the same punches he used to get the first film off the ground. The only difference is with X2 is that he does things a little bit bigger in size and scope, with larger action setpieces, new characters to meet, and the characters we already met being further expanded for stronger character depth.<br/><br/>The special effects, for me, are what stood out more in this second installment. Singer never missed a beat when it came to filming large, grandscale action in the original X-Men and never does he misstep here. Singer's action, combined with the strong editing work of John Ottman and Elliot Graham, possesses a rare fluency to it, where action exists as something to look forward to and utilize in addition to character development, plot, and thematic resonance. Too often is it utilized and exploited in place of those things rather than working harmoniously with the additional devices - like humans and mutants should.<br/><br/>It also helps that the look of the film is crisp and clean thanks to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel. Sigel captures everything Singer wants to include in X2 with a beautiful look and style, effectively mirroring the camaraderie on screen with the aesthetic, appeal, and kinetic movement of a comic book. The film doesn't go for the similar, more blatant style of comic book mimicking as seen in Ang Lee's Hulk, which would release theatrically about a month later than X2, which attempted to create the feel by using the picture-in-picture method. Yet, both films find ways to succeed using their own style, with Singer and Sigel's route to a comic book providing for consistent fun and enjoyment.<br/><br/>On a film note, one cannot neglect the performances at hand here. Jackman, once again, works well at playing a character we find it difficult to have sympathy for at times, while at others, being effortlessly fun and likable. Paquin still nails the subtle facial and body communications of Rogue, while Berry and Janssen continue to fit well in their assigned roles. Throw in Ian McKellen for good measure and you have a complete package for X2 After watching the first two installments of the X-Men franchise, the sole word I can conjure up is ""impressive."" Who would've thought that two films concerning mutants, bearing a heavy emphasis on special effects but not neglecting the human element of the story nor the thematic ideas of discrimination, would live up even after a decade? The fact that the first two X-Men films possess more elements than incredible, bombastic special effects ensures a longer lifespan than your average blockbuster, many of which have a hard time bringing much else besides their looks to the table.<br/><br/>Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Alan Cumming, Brian Cox, and Bruce Davison. Directed by: Bryan Singer."

","After their long separation, Professor X and Magneto join forces against a common enemy. Though the 1st part gave a good start to the franchise, this one trumps the first one in every aspect - plot, character development, twists, action, and emotional depth (especially). The opening scene with the White House attack by the new character 'Nightcrawler' is spectacular, and sets the movie forward in the right direction.<br/><br/>The franchise as an allegory on the homosexual community is much more conspicuous in this part, with the exploration of many more aspects relating to it. The most brilliant and intelligently comic scene among all is the one in which Bobby Drake (Iceman) comes out to his family as a Mutant and they're weirded out by it, and his mom casually asks, ""Have you ever tried Not being a Mutant?""; it's priceless.<br/><br/>Mystique's transformation scenes were carried out amazingly in this part, and the actors playing their characters, as disguised by Mystique, did a convincing job. Nightcrawler and Mystique stand side-by-side and share a conversation, but there's no mention of her being his mother. And throughout the three parts, they don't mention her being the adoptive mother of Rogue even once. I don't know whether these were just omitted, or re-written for convenience; either way, it's a disappointment.<br/><br/>Overall, it's quite entertaining and intriguing throughout. Before Nolan's Batman franchise rolled out in 2005, this part might have been the most well-written comic book adaptation till then."
"alindsay-al","9","0","1","2 April 2014"," One of the greatest comic book films of all time
","X men 2 is simply put one of the greatest comic book films and just films of all time. This film takes the X men trilogy to a whole new level of awesomeness adding levels for every character. This story picks up right after the original X men and really picks up the pace in this trilogy. This story introduces William Stryker a man tied to Wolverine's past who wants to eradicate all mutants, which really sets up my favourite part of the film which is the alliance between the X Men and Magneto and Mystique which sets up all types of great dialogue and comic book fan's dreams coming true. Hugh Jackman is once again fantastic as Wolverine as is Ian McKellen as Magneto with everybody else being great including a very attractive Halle Berry as Storm and the new character Nightcrawler. Professor X and Cyclops are not in the film as much as the original which is a bit of a downside but just everything about this film including the ending which is absolutely awesome and sets up more X men films. In the top 5 comic book films of all time at this moment and a fantastic film must see."
"TheSeaLion","10","0","1","15 January 2014"," Saying this movie is good is an understatement
","In the year 2000, after being postponed several times, the film ""X-Men"" was released, gaining generally positive reception and kicking off not only the ""X-Men"" franchise as a film franchise, but also a new line of 'Marvel Comics' films after the failure of other Marvel films like ""Howard the Duck"". Three years later, the sequel, ""X2: X-Men Unite"" was released and was once again greeted by general approval. While the original ""X-Men"" is still a superb film, ""X2"" expands on the story and characters of the first film to deliver not only a sequel that surpasses its original, but one of the best superhero films ever made.<br/><br/>After a mutant by the name of Kurt ""Nightcrawler"" Wagner (Alan Cumming) infiltrates the White House, the fear that more of the humans feel towards the mutants becomes evident. Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) uses this attack as an excuse for his plan to wipe out the mutant population once and for all. At the same time, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) searches for the truth about his past, which is also connected to Colonel Stryker.<br/><br/>The film has numerous subplots and set-ups that in most movies would cause it to drag or lose focus, but with this film it succeeds. The subplots are interesting and give the audience a better look at some of the characters, and everything that the movie sets up is paid off to a satisfactory level.<br/><br/>The best subplots of the movie that were done the best and were the most interesting, to me, were the two romances. The relationship between Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Bobby (Shawn Ashmore) is believable, not just because of the chemistry between the two, but because of the problems that they have. Both want to be closer, but Rogue's powers make it hard for them to have a normal relationship. The love triangle between Wolverine, Jean (Famkee Janssen), and Cyclops (James Marsden) is also believable, and the kind of love triangle I would like to see in other movies. Jean obviously likes both Wolverine and Cyclops and they both like her, but Jean can only choose one of them, which is something I would like to see done more.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the best part of the whole movie was Wolverine and the discovery of his back story. For most of the movie, all we get are sudden flashbacks which provides us with enough details to get us interested, but not enough to give it away. Along with the flashbacks, we have Stryker telling Wolverine he was in charge of the project that turned Wolverine into the mutant he is. While the film does not dwell too much into Wolverine's back story, we learn that while Wolverine saw it as a curse, it might be what betters him as Stryker says Wolverine was just an animal that he provided claws.<br/><br/>""X2"" recaptures what made ""X-Men"" so good and improves upon it. While the film contains many subplots and set-ups that would usually bog a movie like this down, it succeeds and provides one of the best superhero films ever made. The story is interesting, the characters are well written and earn your investment, and even with all of the characters time is given to each one. ""X2"" succeeds on multiple levels of film making and story telling that does not disappoint."

","Bryan Singer returned to direct this sequel that sees the same cast returning to battle new threats from Magneto (Ian McKellen) & William Stryker(played by Brian Cox) a human military leader who is determined to defeat the mutants, and who has a personal reason for doing so. After one mutant called Night Crawler nearly kills the President, Stryker is emboldened to invade Professor Xavier's(Patrick Stewart) school, forcing Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) to lead some students to freedom, though the threat from Stryker forces an uneasy alliance with Magneto(who has escaped from his plastic prison) and his mutants(like Mystique) in order to defeat Stryker, though this mission will have devastating consequences for both Cyclops(James Marsden) & Jean Grey(Famke Janssen)... Fine sequel is just as good as the first, with an expanded story that explores the mystery of Wolverine while looking forward to the future, even in the face of personal loss."

","It just could be the greatest sequel ever made. With an amazing story & plot, X2 takes the superhero series into a whole new level.<br/><br/>Wolverine, Cyclops & Storm are back with Prof. Xavier. The past is dug up & minds played with. Everything is deep, the screenplay induces pure entertainment, X-Men style.<br/><br/>The CGI is brilliant but I felt it is sidelined by the plot. Most superhero films have clichéd elements, where X2 stands out. The villain is so vindictive, he gets personal. The music is good, as well.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Not much can I talk about this, but X2 is definitely better than its prequel. Highly Recommended!"

","""It is a historical fact: sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute"" – Charles Xavier<br/><br/>The follow up to Bryan Singer's X-men is a true sequel in every sense of the word. Where other comic book films seek to introduce a clean slate for a new plot and major reshuffling of characters (mainly villains), X2 seamlessly snuggles into place from where its predecessor left off. My review for X-men dealt with the issues of a lack of character development and on screen chemistry. This was mainly an issue due to the heavy focus on the background for Singer's X-men world, detailing the mutant/human divide and the morals and intentions of the three factions of the series. X2 provided the emotional depth which the original film lacked, wrapped up within a multi-level, thicker plot leaving you wondering who ""the real bad guy"" was.<br/><br/>After an assassination attempt on the US president by an unknown mutant, the country is in a state of panic over the ""mutant problem"". William Stryker, a war veteran turned experimental scientist who holds a deep disdain for anything mutant, is intent on starting a war in retaliation, and has extracted information on the Cerebro device by torturing an imprisoned Magneto. Xavier is imprisoned in Stryker's secret base, and his school is assaulted by Stryker's soldiers, so it's up to the X-men , including new addition Nightcrawler, three novice students (Pyro, Iceman and Rogue), and Magneto to save the professor and stop Stryker from manipulating Xavier's psychic powers to destroy mutant-kind. Throughout the main storyline, Wolverine is also trying to find clues to unlock his past, and finds out that Stryker is the key to doing so. Rogue and Iceman experience their own troubles of a mutant relationship, showing that superpowers aren't always a good thing to possess.<br/><br/>X2 is long. It clocks in at over two hours, half an hour longer than the original. The level of character development is such that it really needs to be (initially), everything up until the final showdown at the secret Alkali Lake base deals with building upon the foundations of personas created three years previously.<br/><br/>Wolverine, again the central figure of the film, has become the animalistic loose cannon he is known for thanks to good script writing and choreography in action scenes. The scene where he disposes of a squad of soldiers sent to attack Xavier's mansion is an incredible action scene with some fantastic stunts and brutal claw-work. Jackman brings much more angst to the role, perhaps because of Wolverine's frustration over his forgotten past, yet also becomes a rock for vulnerable, younger characters. Whether it's physically protecting the students or being a confidant to Bobby or Marie, Jackman excels and stamps his authority on this film as the lead actor.<br/><br/>A disappointing factor for Wolverine is that his story is diluted with the main storyline to this film, however, his relationship with Jean Grey blossoms beyond just flirtation from X-men; unfortunately Cyclops largely isn't a part of this story, which is disappointing due to proved on-screen chemistry between Marsden and Jackman. We do see some well acted scenes between the pair at the films conclusion, however. Marsden's performance at this stage poses the question as to why he didn't play as big a role in the film's lengthier mid-section, alas the story did not require his presence.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen also steps up greatly, and isn't just a damsel in emotional distress caught between two big strong men. Storm's character develops to an extent. Berry plays well off of new member to the team, Nightcrawler, who brings a sense of freshness to the X-men line-up. Although Storm has a bit more to say and do in this film, she really isn't one of the stronger characters, ironic that she and Cyclops are generally considered to be Xavier's second and third in line.<br/><br/>As for the two old adversaries, Stewart and McKellen can't be scrutinised at all for their roles as Professor X and Magneto. Magneto slightly deviates from the role of a crazed dictator bent on world domination, breaking character to add some catty dialogue when he reluctantly aligns with the X-men to tackle the common enemy that is Stryker. However, this enhances the idea behind this film and its predecessor that the ""bad guy"" always has a redeeming portion to their persona; no one is completely unlikable or has no reason for their character flaws.<br/><br/>Storywise, X2 has the right amount of complexity for it to be considered a great improvement on X-men. Devious tactics, double-crossing and a touch of politics gives the right amount of depth to colour the basic plot of mutants teaming up to stop the evil human. Thankfully, the score also got a much needed revamp this time around. John Ottoman brings a larger than life, dramatic feel to the film with his music; where it may be a bit over the top in some places, in comparison to the dark, emotion-tugging Batman trilogy's score, it certainly was a big step in the right direction from what was musical non-existence in X-men.<br/><br/>My one major criticism is over length; even though it's all action for the film's final thirty minutes or so, time seems to drag on. There are some needless scenes involving Rogue, Pyro and Iceman (why couldn't they have been part of the action?) in the X-Jet, and Wolverine's story intertwining with that of the rest of the cast gets a little confusing on top of all the action taking place. That said, the entertainment value of the film makes it quite enthralling, easily the most engrossing of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>X2 (2003)<br/><br/>Allan's Score: 7/10"
"SnoopyStyle","7","0","1","21 September 2013"," Good follow up
","The group is back. Magneto is still imprisoned. This time a mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) tries to kill the president. In response, the government under the help of William Stryker (Brian Cox) institute more draconian measures to control the mutant population including attacking Professor X's school.<br/><br/>Alan Cumming is doing a fun character. The plot gets complicated with double dealing and cross currents but still easily followed. It's a good sophomore follow up in the franchise.<br/><br/>It's almost a prerequisite to have all hell break loose after the happy ending to the first movie. So the first half of the movie is to bring everything down. Once the whole lot is destroy, then they can come back to save the day. This time the bad guy is Stryker and even Magneto is there to join the fight. It's a perfectly fine follow-up."

"zurnd","9","0","1","4 March 2013"," Singer Knows How To Tackle X-Men
","A few weeks ago, I reviewed the very first X-Men film as well as First Class. Now, I figure it's only fitting to review the remaining films of the series as well as the Wolverine spin off. One thing I can say right off the bat is that Bryan Singer knows how to tackle X-Men, and his sequel to the 2000 film that boosted the superhero film genre really shows his taste and understanding of mutants. X2, also called X2: X-Men United is one of those many sequels that parallels that of the first and in many ways is superior to it's predecessor. I lot of the things I wanted to see in the first film and didn't see, I saw in this film and the action and special effects in this film were far more contemporary than the often cartoony and dated effects of the first film. X2 really pushed the X-Men franchise to the edge and really brought something to the dinner table that had never been seen beforehand. Until First Class came along in 2011 to steal the trophy, this was my favorite X-flick, but even if it's no longer my favorite, it's still a fantastic film and ranks high on my favorite superhero film list. <br/><br/>Kudos to Singer for making the ""X-sequel"" reminiscent of the beloved 90s cartoon series, yet still adding a realistic and recognizable environment into the mix. Like the 90s series, this film brought in a lot of serious and over the top scenarios and dealt with a lot of the same elements present in the first X-Men film, such as mutant protesting and disarray, governmental corruption, and the X-Men trying to maintain peace while the Brotherhood wants to start a war. It also deals with the topic of assassination and mind controlling, for the villainous William Stryker, played by Bryan Cox, uses a serum to manipulate certain characters like Nightcrawler and Magneto and makes them either reveal top secret information or launch a full scale attack. It took X-Men films to a whole new height and it makes the film not only a good action thriller but a brilliant political thriller as well. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty good for what it is, but like in the first film, it can be a bit wooden and bland at times. I have to praise Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen for their takes on Professor X and Magneto respectively, but the real player in this show is Bryan Cox as the scheming and conniving William Stryker, a mad scientist/string puller who really has you grinding your teeth in angst. Hugh Jackman is also top notch as Wolverine, and to see elements of his past was among some of the best highlights of the film, something that would be seen firsthand and expanded upon when X-Men Origins: Wolverine rolled around. I also must bow down to Alan Cumming for his excellent portrayal of Nightcrawler, the teleporting smurf....I mean mutant who really makes the comic book character come to life. It's too bad that they couldn't expand upon his relationship with Mystique, for in the comics and many of the animated series, Mystique was his mother and Rogue was his stepsister. But since they didn't make Professor X and Juggernaut stepbrothers in X-Men: The Last Stand, it's no biggy. <br/><br/>But the best element of this film is the action. This film has the best action out of any other X- Men film, even better than the action in First Class. Although First Class had the best character development and best story, this film has the best action and the best nail biting sequences that send the suspense meter through the roof. I love the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike. I love the fight between Wolverine and Stryker's henchmen at the Xavier Mansion. I love the opening scene where Nightcrawler takes on the President's security guards. I love them all, for they compliment the story and add that perfect blend of alacrity, dilemma, and expanse to the film's overall scope. Another thing I must point out is that the heroes and the villains, despite their perspectives, join forces and work together for once. That's something that isn't seen too often. <br/><br/>X2 is something special to me, for like the first film, it made my love of X-Men rise to sky highness. I was really looking forward to the next chapter in this constantly unfolding saga, but X-Men: The Last Stand......okay, well talk about that one next."

","X2 is a great action/adventure filled with interesting characters, good writing, a good story, and awesome visuals. The special effects and the action scenes are striking, and they can take you by storm, and they're kind of beast. The story in support is X-cellent. It has great pace, good dialogue. X-Men 2 is one of the very best comic book films, topping the first of the series making it one of cinema's great sequels.<br/><br/>The cast is very good top to bottom, lead by the performances of Ian McKellan and Brian Cox. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Alan Cumming, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, very solid. The characters shine and are the focal point throughout. The story isn't exactly complete but it is very good and it does a terrific job of holding the film together. The writing as well as the directing by Bryan Singer is very good. It's too bad for X-Men fans that Singer chose to abandon the franchise and go do Superman. X-Men 3 suffers for it. The action sequences of X2 unfold nicely and are very fun for the viewer to see with some great mutant battles. Though the film lacks great scope and can be somewhat one dimensional, it should be appreciated for its gorgeous visuals and awesome action. This is a movie that I really love, upping it from an 8, giving it a 9 out of 10. I'm a big fan of the X-Men and I look forward to hopefully many X-Men movies in future years."

","Rating: 7.5<br/><br/>An assassination attempt has been made on the president's life. The X- men get together once again to find out who did it and for what reason. While, the Mutant Academy is attacked by military forces and Magneto is locked up in a plastic prison. Is Magneto behind this or is it someone else?<br/><br/>I had high expectations before watching X-Men 2 after the critical success of X-Men. I expected good action sequences, good character development, and good story. And I was not let down. After the success of the first intro movie, X-Men, the writers had the opportunity to add more storyline to the plot; hence why this movie is 2 hours and 13 minutes long. <br/><br/>As of performances in this film, everyone is good as usual. Everyone is on their A game. However, I found the outburst scene at the end of the movie of Cyclops, played by James Marsden, a little funny. And this is due to James Marsden's performance. I'm not going to spoil what happened. But if you've seen the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I had the same trouble watching X-Men 2 as when I watched the first film, the soundtrack and sound effects in general. I don't know why but the first two X-Men series seem like movies from the 90's not the 00's. The music during the action sequences is incredibly lame. Maybe this is just Bryan Singer's style of directing, I don't know. But it really annoyed me throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The other problem I had while watching X-men 2 is I can't seem to root for the characters in the movie. I couldn't careless about what happens to the characters in the film. There's a point in the film where I realized that I'm supposed to root for them to rescue Professor X and Cyclops. But that didn't happen. I was just kinda going along with movie, thinking everything is going to turn out okay in the end. I even felt bored at times.<br/><br/>Enough with the bad stuff, we get to see really cool sequences in this movie. There's a scene involving Magneto which I find to be very well made. The action sequences are perfect. The character development is perfect. We get to see a lot of stuff happen in this movie. The bad guy becomes the good guy. The bad guy helps the good guys and etc. And it was good, the story was well told.<br/><br/>X-Men 2 is a step better than X-Men 1. We get better action sequences and character development. It's always good to see a sequel out-performance the original film these days. Although, X-Men 3 and Origins are apparently not very well made and I won't even bother watching them. Overall, X-Men 2 is a good action movie but I hope it would involve the audience with the story a little bit more.<br/><br/>Just like the first film, X-Men is the kind of movie that you would forget in about 2 days. It's nothing more than a good time with your friends. If all you want is a good time with your friends, however, check out X-Men 2. And if you liked the first film, you will love this film. It has a much better plot, character development and a very emotional climax at the end."

","X2 is Part 4 of the trilogy, and being the middle section it is often the best. After Mr Magoonta was killed and captured in the first film he has been incarcerated into the superb American Prison System (he is locked in a cardboard box guarded by a dwarf wielding a bag of nutmeg). This means that all is well is the world of the X-Men (Xearth) and they are happy to pursue their other interests- Wolveryan paints, Rogue strips (clothes, not paint), Bumbit embezzles unfortunate street urchins with 3 card plop, Baldy fashions wigs from his oxter hair, Gargantuthon helps to build homes for the homeless in Romania, Goldberg tars the driveways of the rich and/or famous, Storm writes articles on good home living in small town newspapers, Magneter sits in boxes watched by dwarfs, and last but not least Terry babysits, whilst Chickpea organises seminars on maximizing the business potential of your software solutions. After a while they get bored and decide to form a league of superheroes for football (for you Americans, that's real football, not the embarrassment you play). The goodies become X-United and recruit such famous players as Donald Goalposts, Peely, Madonna, Robertini Bagginio, Boris Beckham, Stevie G, Figaro, and Zninadiniadine Zidanisizidane. The baddies are based in Manchester and are known as The Scum. When this first came out I enjoyed collecting all the various and varied various acting figures to play with. I would bring my tea-lights into my roof-space and have my own X-Men wars. I had all the figurines including my favourite- Stalin. I got the X-Men edition of Subbuteo with astro turf and would play for minutes at a time in my fake candlelight, flicking my balls in the gloom with a tender smile etched across my face. You could even play as some of the new teams that were introduced in the second film- The Policemen with their law enforcing magic powers, the Fireman who held the innocuous power of putting our cleansing flames, and the Doctormen whose power was editing competition application forms so that only their friends were successful. Some guy punches a hole in the wall and Annie Packscwhinn bounces around lovelyly.<br/><br/>Best Scene: When Monstror has a free kick from 45 yards and sticks into the top corner like a bullet.

","To sum up, the movie improves on everything in the first, but did have some flaws keeping it from a perfect 10. 1, the focus being on Wolverine again is a bit repetitive- not terrible, but slightly tired. 2, Cyclops and Prof X have quite small roles due to the storyline- they are 2 of the best characters and their screen time is quite short- the 2 leaders of the X-men and they have limited screen time? 3, they re-used the 2 evil mutants (Magneto and Mystique). Their roles are great and I enjoyed their return, but the bad mutants needed a new one somewhere, even if the role was small or irrelevant. 4 and last, the death of Jean Grey (Marvel Girl) seemed a bit unconvincing- it did not seem like she had to sacrifice herself. Couldn't she have done what she did INSIDE the plane? I know they tried to make it like her demise in the comic book from the cosmic rays in space, but this was not as believable or needed- it seemed a bit 'convenient'. All in all, these are tiny flaws in a superb sequel- a rare better-than-the-first film. DO NOT SEE X-Men 3 though- horrible amateur action film that I equate to Superman 3 and 4. UPDATE: X-Men Origins and X-Men First Class are good additions to the series and worth seeing; both have their flaws which put them under X1 and X2, but nonetheless quality films."

","A lifelong X fan (until the '90s, when glossy soap opera took over the books), I give enormous credit to Singer, and for one reason: he treats his mutants with respect. He also knows how to pace action sequences beautifully, and not exploit crashes and burns. Finally, he did something stunning, in that he presents a mutant sacrifice in a way that is truly heart-wrenching, as Jean makes her choice. Are there problems? You bet. Chiefly, 'stormy' ones. I understand that a character need not absolutely reflect the book version. Play with some personalities. But - make Berry read one damn book, please. Ororo is not a hip young woman. She is an aristocrat, and this portrayal would have given needed style to the film. Along those lines, and with no disrespect to Gandalf, Magneto is supposed to be a HOT older man; a great part of his power to draw an army to him lies in his physical attractiveness. Then: why, if Jean could manifest Phoenix-like abilities one minute outside of the downed jet, was she unable to do so one minute earlier, inside the jet? And the shock/tears fest with Scott and Wolvie afterward was overkill, and embarrassing. But - heck with it. It's a fine X movie, all told."

","Everything that the first movie did well, the second did better. More action, more characters, more story lines, more superpowers, more humor, more of everything. But never at any time does it feel over-bloated like The Last Stand and Wolverine would. It all works and flows together well.<br/><br/>The story is an expertly crafted continuation of the first's. I don't know how much of this they had in mind when they made the first, but the two compliment each other very well. Singer really pushes his craft harder this time. The mansion attack is suspenseful, the Iceman confession is hilarious, the battles are exciting, and the deaths tragic. I would have loved to see what Singer could have done with the third had Fox not gotten overly controlling and he left to do Superman.<br/><br/>The movie shows off what makes the X-Men comics so beloved, it's not about fighting villains but fighting the ills of society. The X-Men have always fought more against prejudice and that has never been better demonstrated than this movie. The best X-Men stories have always been showing them fight normal humans and their hatred, such as Graydon Creed and the Friends of Humanity. Additionally, showing the X-Men teaming with the Brotherhood is terrific since Magneto has always worked better as an anti-heroic antagonist rather than plain old villain.<br/><br/>The returning actors are even better, and the new cast are equally good. It's nice to see Mystique, Rogue, and Storm all get more to do. I know many people complain that Wolverine has so much focus, but it's still handled well and won't get too much until The Last Stand. Alan Cumming is terrific even through all the make up. Kelly Hu is creepy and terrifying. Aaron Stanford has fun with his near-psychotic nature. But it's Brian Cox that really steals the movies. His gleefully dangerous Stryker is one of the best villains ever. The end escape scene really demonstrates many of the actor's better moments.<br/><br/>My only disappointment is that Cyclops is given less to do this film. The Logan-Jean-Scott love triangle is still there, but he's not even a part of it. He has one short fight scene and one dramatic scene and that's about it. Of course, it's even worse in The Last Stand where he basically has a cameo.<br/><br/>It's tragic that a worthy follow-up was not meant to be given how wonderful this movie is. This one set up so much that the third should have paid off so well. The movie was one of the first to really demonstrate the complex and complicated nature of superheroes. It's still one of the best in the genre."

","I saw the first X-Men film shortly after release. It didn't strike me particularly, and I found it easy to skip X2's theatrical release. By the time 3 had arrived on DVD, I was completely unmoved when a friend told me what a disaster it (3) was.<br/><br/>BUT. Having seen the positive reviews for X2, I sought out the first two movies on Blu-Ray. I found the original to be a very pleasant surprise, the situation and characters intriguing, the direction hit all the right notes. It had mood, panache and hinted at real substance. I found myself thinking 'Forget the special effects, there is real cinema here, maybe this sort of Hollywood picture has more to offer than some would have you believe'.<br/><br/>So I ventured into X2 in a positive frame of mind. Oh, how wrong I was.<br/><br/>The script is a monstrosity. The first half an hour sets up new developments for the characters, building on the good work of the first film. The other ninety minutes ruins them beyond repair. Each and every character starts off down an interesting path, then is hurriedly shunted off-screen so we can get down to some silly, unsatisfying action. Rogue falls in love, then err... nothing. Her boyfriend is subjected to a terrible rejection by his family, then err... nothing. In the end it's his friend (otherwise a complete waste of screen space) who reacts badly to nothing at all and runs off with the bad guys. Cyclops is just arbitrarily removed from the story only to arrive back on screen as a bad guy who, apropos of nothing, remembers he is a good guy in seconds flat. <br/><br/>McKellan and Stewart are a formidable double act, but McKellan's motives and methods seemed to be a series of straightforward contradictions that only served to expedite the narrative, and Stewart was emasculated and muted. Wolverine's situation is not intriguing, it's just the product of a terribly confused script.<br/><br/>The Evil Genius's son is yet another complete non-character that failed to evoke sympathy, pity, disgust, fear, intrigue, mystery, ANYTHING.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that his death was another 'no cause, no consequences, no significance to the characters or the movie-world, no audience feeling, in fact, lets not even show it, LETS GET BACK TO THE ACTION' moment. <br/><br/>The clichés and incongruences pile up on each other. It was almost ruined from the moment Xavier and Jean Gray turn up for a friendly visit to a jail off limits even to high-ranking government officials... this happens shortly after it has been established that Xavier is no friend of the government, even less a friend of the megalomaniac who runs said jail. <br/><br/>Countless other moments seem designed to disrupt any continued suspension of disbelief. Towards the end the abducted children suddenly appear back on-screen just in time to escape.<br/><br/>It saves the worst for last. Many have noted that the signposting of the ending is laughable and yet another extreme example of how to undermine any tension. Yet my personal favourite moment came with the deus-ex-teenager of Rogue arriving with the jet. It's a triumphant moment, right, you cared about this character once, she's not done anything for ages, ( and lets show you once again how little we care for her development by immediately showing her once again as a little girl who has lost the power of speech)... but wait, we're not quite there yet... just in case you don't get that it's A TRIUMPHANT ESCAPE... lets make it clear how triumphant and brilliant a moment this triumphant, brilliant escape is... let's make this particular jet engine emit the sound of a crowd cheering. <br/><br/>WOW."

The characters are once again great and really bring the story to life. Bryan Singer did a great job with this film and for all people who love superhero films then this is the film for you.

","Bryan Singer follows up the somewhat exploratory X-Men with a sequel which goes forwards with further developments in the 3-way conflict between humans, mutants, and militant mutants. He also goes backwards in tracing part of Wolverine's back story. Plus he introduces more characters to the ensemble and raises the stakes (both narrative and cinematically) by an appreciable percentage.<br/><br/>Once more he orchestrates his ensemble masterfully. Everything which made the original film successful is here again, only there is more of it - but Singer never goes into overkill.<br/><br/>The main unexpected joy of this film - to this ageing fanboy, at any rate - was how exactly right they got Nightcrawler. Alan Cumming was perfect casting, the makeup works perfectly, the opening sequence shows perfectly how Nightcrawler's action in the comics translates into ""real life"", and they found the perfect sound for ""Bamf!"" More huge fun."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","1","7 October 2010"," The upping of the stakes and the going overboard of the sub-plots has the X-Men sequel just about pull through with an array of frequently imbalanced material.
","Was the title ""X-Men 2"" really so long that we needed it abbreviated to form ""X2""? As it happens, Bryan Singer's 2003 follow up to the reasonably pleasing a film from 2000 entitled X-Men is a little longer and a little baggier in its biting off more for us to chew on. Wheter it pulls off everything it decides to take on is one matter, whether it does it at all well another; the fact remaining right the way through to its closing credits that some of the more ordinary stuff on show is explored and granted much more time than some of the other content which may have been interesting. Sure, it has its shocks and its twists but it has its tendencies to conform and that's the most frustrating thing. Regardless, from its dramatic opening sequence of a mutant and his attempted 'hit' on the life of a fictitious American president, to the closing allegorical monologue from said man about mutants with clear allusions to the item of terrorism as we're told to 'acknowledge' this new phenomenon, X2 is an enjoyable if draggy experience which hits enough notes.<br/><br/>The bigger picture and generally wider spectrum of both character and narrative Singer was quite clearly setting up in the first film is here granted the room to flex its muscles. X2 sees an expansion in stakes and general atmosphere, a spreading out of its wings so as to encompass an all out war between human-beings and mutants when tempers fray between the species, corrupt government officials manipulate the circumstances around them and hardened relations between those within the fractions become greater. The film hops about all over the place in attempting to cover and develop each of the little sub-stories it's got going on, and it does a decent job of it overall. The strand running central, to all of Wolverine's (Jackman) journey of discovery as he tries to uncover how he became what he is; the love he has for Jean Grey (Janssen) but the love she has for Cyclops (Marsden) as well as Rouge's (Paquin) romance with Iceman (Ashmore) which interestingly runs on an idea revolving around how great harm will come to both of them if they kiss or attempt to express their love for one-another at such an age, is the captivity of chief Mutant villain Magneto (McKellen).<br/><br/>Regardless of what people think, the film channels The Silence of the Lambs and the imprisonment of Hannibal Lecter in Magneto's clothing; cell and demeanour. It's nice of the asylum staff to play him classical music seemingly on cue, and while it isn't The Goldberg Variations by Bach, it might as well be. The consistent presence of Brian Cox, whom actually portrayed Lecter in an earlier novel incarnation, adds further mirth to proceedings when there really ought not be any. Magneto's being held by a top American military official named William Stryker (Cox), whom wants nothing more than to stoke the fire between the two species. For Stryker, it's less-so business in his feuding with the mutants and more-so personal; his son, Jason, once a subject of Xavier's mutant school only to come home thoroughly less than well off and grossly affect the family situation as a result. We're told to conclude that Stryker is more evil than at first when it transpires he keeps a bunch of kidnapped infant mutants in a grim little cell within a secluded Arctic-like base much later on.<br/><br/>Like X-Men; the mutant's apparent superiority over the human's is presented, not by way of the imperious lead of the first in Wolverine as he wins bare knuckle boxing match after bare knuckle boxing match in an unruly part of town, but by way of new German mutant Nightcrawler (Cumming) and the aforementioned attempt on the American President's life. We sense trouble is unavoidably afoot after digesting such a sequence following on from an opening voice-over from the anchor character of the films so far in Professor Xavier (Stewart) while skirmishes out in the public eye do nothing to help. The sole surviving aide to Magneto from the first film arrives in the many forms of Mystique (Romijn), the earlier film going some way to paint freakish and disfigured portraits of Magneto's other aides with Xavier's then-and-now subjects much more handsome and more beautiful in their appearance. Here, all mutants are briefly aligned and the film has fun in its retaining of the one bodily 'scarred' character from the first, whom just happens to be able to change form as temporary new identities and allies themselves are forged. Singer has additional fun in constructing suspenseful sequences in which Mystique must infiltrate government zones and we have to remind ourselves that we want her to get away with it.<br/><br/>Alas, each and every one of the strands X2 takes on seems to overwhelm the next; the film hints at some bigger, brasher and more interesting things when one younger mutant is discussing the correlation between his mutant persona and human-being persona with the all powerful Magneto. The inference being that it's probably better to be 'Pyro' than 'John Allerdyce'. The film is a flabby actioner, its meshing of content for all ages ranging from the adolescent with the more adult to the fact veteran actors Patrick Stewart; Ian McKellen and Brian Cox all feature prominently making for an odd experience of action orientated frills and more mature issues. Its formulaic finale and gradually more and more conformist to spectacle attitude is one of its more chief faults, but there is edible entertainment to be had out of X2; a digestible comic book adaptation from a director we feel relaxed to be in the hands of."

","What made X-Men great was its intense action, fantastic characters, and wonderfully intelligent screenplay. What makes X2: X-Men United great is some intense action, fantastic characters, and wonderfully intelligent screenplay.<br/><br/>X2 gives audiences a lot of new ideas that the first movie offered, with some added bonuses as well. The characters are even deeper here, and the film isn't quite as Wolverine heavy (even though I didn't think he was overly done in the first film either). But this film also takes its time with its characters a little bit more, which is what is so endearing about both of these movies.<br/><br/>There is a surprising amount of tension in this film, especially concerning Xavier's cerebro, which I didn't expect. The tension builds beautifully during the action sequences (and these sequences did not disappoint).<br/><br/>I also loved what they did with the villains here. Magneto, the main villain of the previous film, switches sides in X2 a couple of times, since he cares more for the rise of mutants than he does the well-being of average humans. But X2 introduces a new villain in a Lex Luthor type role. He's an average human with no special powers, but who pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants. In fact, I felt like this film played out more like Luthor than Luthor did in the Superman films.<br/><br/>Every one of the X-Men has a big role in this film. Every one of them was played out very well and written in with a firm hold onto the story. Each one of them has his or her own story that is told fully and completely and that the audience can follow exceedingly well.<br/><br/>In short, I liked X2. I'm not sure if I liked it more than the first film, but both of these movies do a lot with characters that I think a lot of superhero films (and action films in general) can learn from.

Wolverine tries to find answers to his past through this mysterious man who wants to kidnap mutants. <br/><br/>X2 opens with a bang and is one of the best scenes in the entire trilogy. We are introduced to a popular x-men character, who is visualized perfectly and is one of the best character adaptations the films have ever done and the sequence itself is entertaining. So much that it immediately grabs you and tells you that this film is a sequel that outshines the original and it does. Bryan Singer took the flaws of the original and fixed them here, he makes a sequel that is not only bigger, but better. Many times sequels fall under it's own need to do things on a grander scale, but here it works. <br/><br/>We are introduced to some new characters, such as Nightcrawler, Pyro and Lady Deathstrike. All three of these characters shine in this film and elevate it to making this sequel the best in the series. Deathstrike has a brutal and violent fight scene with Wolverine, it seems he has finally me his match this time around. Styker is played by Brian Cox, he is deliciously evil and a nice face to see against the x-men then just having it be Magneto again. <br/><br/>The action sequences are better here, more rough and tough. They are choreographed to make it not only more real, but more entertaining. They fit the comic book form a little more here than in the previous installment. The risk in this film seems a bit greater as well, the stakes are risen in the sequel and it makes us care more about the characters and the outcome then what one would initially think.<br/><br/>Halle Berry and her role as Storm is still one of the weakest parts of the series. Her lines fall flat and her sincerity doesn't seem genuine. Her bits with Nightcrawler seem forced and she somehow manages to take one of the coolest characters from the comics and make her quite lame here. James Marsden improves here as Cyclops, he has more emotional baggage to carry here than last time. It's always hard to act when your eyes are covered, I give him credit despite having less screen time.<br/><br/>This film is darker, not everyone makes it out alive. It sets up one of the best story lines the comics have ever introduced, the Dark Phoenix Saga. The script is tighter as is the acting. Rogue is still an annoying teen, but she has matured a bit since last time. The special effects are improved and the direction is more polished.

","X2 (Bryan Singer, 2003) is a stunning sequel to X-Men that ups the ante in terms of action, mystery and character drama. The premise is perfectly formed, as the heroes from the first film are forced to enter an uneasy alliance with former adversary Ian McKellen and his amorphous henchwoman (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). The danger this time is despotic military man Brian Cox, who's harbouring at least two dark secrets as he plots the demise of the mutant race. All the key cast members return, while Alan Cumming is an excellent addition to the cast as Kurt Wagner, improbably channelling Nosferatu to create a lovely, sympathetic character. Utilising biblical reference and the actor's effective underplaying, the film cleverly flips our initial impression of Wagner, introduced as a knife-wielding, teleporting psychopath in a bravura opening sequence.<br/><br/>This is an extremely well-plotted, satisfying action film that (presumably inadvertently) ends up borrowing the clever double-ending of Confessions of Boston Blackie (see #89), which also saw its heroes defeat the bad guys, only to face near-certain suffocation. Singer seamlessly balances the disparate story elements, which again mix story threads about friendship, love and loyalty with broad satire and disarmingly funny, well-integrated comic asides. Racism gets another battering here, while mutancy is also equated with homosexuality in a spoof of 'coming out' clichés that's played solely for laughs. ""Have you tried not being a mutant?"" asks Ice Man's mother, before adding: ""This is all my fault."" Happily, Pyro is on hand to reassure her: ""Actually, they discovered that males are the ones who carry the mutant gene and pass it on, so-"" he points at Ice Man's dad, ""it's his fault."" The film's heart is illustrated by the genuinely touching chat between Wolverine and Ice Man, which sees the latter use his powers to cool his friend's drink. X2 is littered with such likable, knowing touches.<br/><br/>There are shortcomings, with a slight nastiness permeating several scenes and coming to a head in a sequence invoking a gruesome lobotomy. It's also unnecessary for Singer to hit us over the head with flashbacks concerning Wolverine's past, when that shot of the three scratch marks etched into a column in a grim cellar lab made the point so subtly and so well, while a lack of clarity about the dam site in the final set piece makes the ending a touch confusing. But this is a mightily impressive, immensely enjoyable blockbuster, with strong action sequences, a firm grasp of its source novels' mythology and strong performances across the board."

","As great the original X-Men was, X2 topped it, much like Spider-Man 2 over Spider-Man. They certainly up'd the ante on action, story and character development. And none of that was easy with the increased character/mutant list. Director Singer should be incredibly proud on pulling off what 98% of Comic Book sequels fail at: adding more and yet keeping the perfect balance all the while improving on the original. (Perfect examples are the recent Iron Man 2 and the original sequels to the original Batman.) There are multiple story lines here, but the majority wrap around the increasing war between Humans (and Politicians) and the Mutants. Profession Xavier (Stewart) is juggling a lot on his wheelchair-bound lap: Wolverine's (Jackman) background, Grey's (Janssen) future, Magneto's (McKellen) present, all while running a school, bartering for equality and helping even the guilty/used mutants.<br/><br/>Most times, I have problems with multistory lines in movies, especially comic book and definitely comic book sequels (SEE: Iron Man 2 and Spider-Man 3) but here, everything was used to both further the story along and to enhance it by once again using everyone's different personalities and powers efficiently. Every scene was extremely well crafted, there was enough plot and character development for you to root for both the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The battles were well crafted, the characters flushed out perfectly and the action intense, even when nothing was happening. In a lot of movies, the actors simply rely on the director to command everything with full trust. Here, it paid off, in dividends, and they seemed to be having a good time while portraying a good story. As a sequel, it was a great pay-off. On its own, it's a great movie. No one should miss this great adventure.<br/><br/>I haven't given too much away – one of my Kryptonite weaknesses, so just sit back, enjoy.

","I enjoyed the first in this trilogy of the X Men comic book movies. However, I was a little let down by this installment. Even though I understood the title itself was X-men United, I didn't think it would be the good guys and the bad guys working together. That, to me, just contradicted the epitome of what a superhero movie should be about. It's good vs. evil, that's what drives a superhero movie. But the superheroes and villains weren't fighting each other. They were instead fighting the bad guy(s) who was trying to get rid of all mutants altogether.<br/><br/>That being said, the acting was still top notch and all the regulars returned for their respective roles. There is a surprise death towards the end which threw a curve ball for the plot which I admire and the special effects were up to the already high standards of the X Men movies. But all in all, it was a good movie that could've been much better. I have yet to see the third, but I'm hoping X3 gets back to what made the first movie so great."

Next, we want a good teenager, a rebel teenager and a nice young girl, a stupid younger brother that doesn't seem to be reasoning at all and an older brother that is heart broke. Of course, his family doesn't accept him as he is. That works very well. We do not want to leave the ones not fit in society out, so we use Storm, the teleporter guy and the shape shifter. Storm will be angry and will survive through that, the second will have faith and they will have a short (not to boring, about 30 sec) discussion in which they will appear (in some obvious way, because we do not want the people to watch the movie and not understand a thing) as the two opposing pillars of philosophy. Now for the bomb. We will make someone good die. Ha.

","If you have seen the first film, or you like to read the comics about the bunch of mutant super heroes, then this sequel is better than the first film. It has more interest, more action and obviously more interesting mutants. Basically William Stryker (Brian Cox) wants to eliminate all the mutants, even though they are already a threat to society, also he wants to see his creation again, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is sending the X-Men team to try and stop this. Eric Lensherr/Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) with the gorgeous Mystique/Grace (Rebecca Romijn) do join the good side for a while, but mainly he wanted to escape and almost gets what he wants in the next film. The film reunites Storm/Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, the character should have stayed dead), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) and Rogue/Marie D'Ancanto (The Piano's Anna Paquin). It also introduces Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). Very good!"
"Victor Field","Null","0","1","17 October 2004"," More proof that sequels and stinking don't have to go together.
","Warning: This has a slight spoiler.<br/><br/>If the ""Justice League of America"" pilot had been treated with the TLC that ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" got, the pilot would have not only sold but the series that would have resulted would still be running. One good movie from the concept would have been a blessing, but for ""X2"" to continue the tradition is... all sequels should be this good. Not good enough to top the first one, but good enough to be an equal.<br/><br/>Like all good sequels, this expands on the previous movie rather than rehashes it (the basic story has good and bad mutants alike teaming up to combat a common threat, but there's obviously more to it than that); there's more emphasis on story than setting up the characters (though kudos to writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter for giving space to both), although with so many characters a few slip through the cracks - minor ones, like the girl who can walk through walls, are one thing (although I wanted to see a bit more of her), but it's a bit hard to keep track of all of them. Not that it ever degenerates into confusion, though; it often plays like a live action take on those superb WB cartoons. Yes, that's a compliment. <br/><br/>As well as keeping up the interesting aspects of its story while not overdoing the bigotry angle of its premise (some have called the relationship between Storm and Nightcrawler a romance, but they seem to bond more on a friendly level than a lovey-dovey one), the movie also has plenty for the more shallow viewers  the non-stop action and the special effects aside, the ladies are, I understand, best catered for with Hugh Jackman (far better here than as Van Helsing) and James Marsden, while the gentlemen get Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (whose Mystique gets more to do (and say) this time around, and even appears without the blue skin at one point) and Kelly Hu. (In one movie? YES!)<br/><br/>SLIGHT SPOILER TIME.<br/><br/>Although three of them won't be back for 'X-Men 3' - Kelly's Deathstryke and Famke's Jean Grey both die (and this not being 'Star Trek' it's unlikely they'll come back to life), and while Storm is still around Halle Berry's turned down the opportunity to play her again. (Since Berry's performance is an improvement on last time, this is to be regretted. Then again, since Storm is more of a waste of space than Jean, maybe not)<br/><br/>END OF SLIGHT SPOILER TIME.<br/><br/>The movie leaves some bits open, but doesn't feel like a cheat and certainly not like a setup for the third movie  just like part of an ongoing story. If the next round of 'Superman' and 'Batman' movies work as well as these, there WILL be a war. Just not between humans and mutants - between Marvel and DC fans.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and John Ottman's end credit music has one of the best endings of its type..."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","14 March 2004"," Highly entertaining comic-book movie.
","Even though I was not a reader of X-Men comics, I grew up reading action comics in the 1950s, and I enjoy most any comic-book inspired movie. Like the first X-Men movie, or Batman, Superman, Spiderman, and Shadow movies. This one, 'X2', is no exception. From the opening sequence, threatening the President of the USA, to the final scenes, the action, sound, and special effects are highly entertaining. Just simple escapism entertainment. I own the DVD, and will view it more than once.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, don't read any further, OK!?  The premise here is that an evil scientist is out to destroy all mutants, and to do that he gains mind control of some which allows him to have plans stolen for the chamber where Dr X can use his mind to track down people. Since this threatens both the good and the bad mutants, they band together to defeat this plot. All the mutants get to show off their unique powers."
"TiminPhoenix","Null","0","1","22 January 2004"," The mean old military
","I would have liked this movie more if Wolverine wasn't shown killing a bunch of US Special Forces Soldiers sent into the school.  Yeah, let's have those mean old soldiers try and go in and hurt those poor little kids.<br/><br/>The Hollywood cliche of showing every US General as either a fool or a villain continues.  Of course it follows the comic on this, but comic book producers are as left wing these days as the folks in Tinsel Town.<br/><br/>
The fact that it doesn't even raise an eyebrow with people is proof of just how well the public has been conditioned to think poorly in some ways of what its government does.  When was the last time the CIA was show in a positive light?  It hardly ever is.  Well I got news for you, they put stars up in the lobby for CIA officers who die in the line of duty.  The crew that puts those stars up stays pretty busy.  Those are men and women who have died and continue to die defending this country.  Some can never, even after death, have their names revealed.<br/><br/>As to the soldiers, the ""snake eater types"" that Wolverine kills, there is something else to be remembered.  There are real heroes in this world and they are United States soldiers.  They along with their allies (Brits and others) are the ones that keep us safe from evils far worse and real than you are going to find in a comic book or movie."

","""X2"" tells another tale about our favorite mutants and a few new ones too but it's not likely anyone is really going to care about the story. What the film has to offer is solid effects, heavy on the CGI, with babes, kids who kick butt, lots of cool special powers, and action and stunts up the wazoo. In other words, it's a good flick for younger audiences, comic book freaks, and the like. Personally, I grew utterly bored with it and gave up about 10 minutes before the end. Nonetheless, it's a respectable effort and probably better than ""X1"" (X-Men) in most respects. (B-)"

I am both inspired and delighted by this movie.<br/><br/>It was twice as good as the first, and I can only look forward to the Special Edition of this chapter, and the third installment (the Phoenix line and a better interpretation of Rogue's coming into womanhood and her full powers) with a great anticipation.

","The problem is Singer is still not intrested in the fight scenes. As effective and spectacular as the Nightcrawler opening attack is, it's the only genuinely dramatic one in X2. Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike should be part of the climax. Instead it is pushed out of the way as soon as possible (atleast twenty minutes before the end). And to be honest, it's not better than Wolverine's battles with Sabretooth and Mystique in X1. It's just longer. <br/><br/>Singer needs to watch the Star Wars movies, Superman II, The Matrix movies and Blade to get a real feel for the spectacular and intense fight scenes these films require.<br/><br/>Why have I spent two paragraphs complaining about the fight scenes? Because that's almost the only major fault of X2. It's the best superhero movie since Batman Returns."
"mnemosyne23","10","0","1","1 July 2003"," Brilliant in all respects
","When I saw the original ""X-Men"" film, I thought it was a great action movie. I still say it's better than ""Spider-Man,"" and a heck of a lot better than ""Daredevil"" or ""The Hulk.""  It had everything necessary to make the world of Marvel's mutant heroes come to life.  It was a perfect comic book movie.<br/><br/>""X2"" isn't like that at all.  ""X2"" isn't a great comic book movie.  It's a great movie, PERIOD.<br/><br/>""X2"" is one of those sequel films that comes along every blue moon and surpasses its predecessor.  ""Empire Strikes Back"" did it; so did ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.""  And like those two, not only does it outdo the original, it sends the first film shuffling home in a potato sack with a stern lecture that it had better not come back until it's gotten its shoes shined and a haircut.  What, you think ""X-Men 1.5"" was released just because the first film was POPULAR?<br/><br/>""X2"" reteams the original core cast, and Hugh Jackman leads the pack with a stellar performance as the gruff, tortured Logan (Wolverine).  Patrick Stewart proves once again that no one else in the universe could ever have played Professor Xavier, and Famke Janssen takes her much underused character, Jean Gray, from the first film to (quite literally) a whole new level.  Sir Ian McKellan traded in his ""LotR"" wizard robes to reprise the role of Magneto, and infused it once again with all the nuance necessary to make the character a sympathetic villain .  Anna Paquin returns as Rogue, and there are even some moments in the movie when she *gasp* HAS A SOUTHERN ACCENT.  Much of her screentime is shared with the adorable Shawn Ashmore as Bobby (Iceman) Drake, whose blue eyes are enough to rivet even the most hardcore bad-boy lover to the screen.  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as the spookily sexy Mystique is even more prevalent in this film than the first, which will give the men in the audience a thrill, and James Marsden pops his head in to blow a few things up with his laser vision as well.  I'm telling you, I've always hated Cyclops in the comics and cartoons, but Marsden makes me like him.  Power to you, James.  Power to you.<br/><br/>Of the new mutants making their debut in the second movie, the most riveting is Kurt Wagner, aka Nightcrawler, played flawlessly by Alan Cumming.  He looks like a blue demon covered in ritualistic scars with hooves and vampire teeth, but after two minutes of hearing him talk, I DARE you not to fall madly in love with him.  DOUBLE dare you.  And I know I'll win the bet.<br/><br/>Aaron Stanford does an admirable job as John Allerdyce (Pyro), but he never quite fulfills his potential; though the scene where he blows up close to a dozen police cars with his manipulated fire is just awesome.  Anyone out there expecting him to be Australian, get ready for disappointment - Johnny boy is 100% American in this one.  Kelly Hu is underused as the venomous Lady Deathstrike, but her climactic battle with Wolverine left me wincing hours after leaving the theater.  Other honorable mentions go out to Kitty Pryde, Siryn, and Colussus, all of whom make guest appearances in the film. And Colussus?  Yep, he's American, too.  No Russian accent here.<br/><br/>Brian Cox - who officially had himself cloned so he could make this movie, as well as the six hundred million other films he's contracted to star in over the next week - plays a great villain (Stryker), but there's something cliched about the character.  He's evil, but his reasons for turning evil - while clearly explained - don't seem to justify what he's planning to do. But hey - perhaps I'm just not evil enough to understand the way his sick mind works.  I guess I should count myself lucky.<br/><br/>The only character I DIDN'T enjoy in this movie was Halle Berry as Ororo (Storm) Munro, for the simple fact that you can just TELL she isn't happy in the role.  Her spats with director Bryan Singer are well-documented, and hard to hide onscreen.  If there's a third movie (and oh yes, there will be a third movie - they can't NOT make one, unless they want to be crucified by legions of fans) I don't see Ms. Berry returning.  Not by a long shot. Not if you pushed her with a ten foot pole.<br/><br/>The story is, like the first movie, one of social stigma and bigotry, taken to Hitlerian scale by Stryker and his squad of anti-mutant militia.  What I find most interesting about this movie, though, is that you really don't know what side to agree with: Magneto or Xavier.  One is struck by the similarities of the two to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, respectively. Who do you listen to?  Who has the strongest case?  Who is right?  It's the age old question, and ""X2"" doesn't try to make you choose.  It trusts you to draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Really, I can't praise this movie enough.  If we danced around it wearing gauzy garments and sipping wine from gilded goblets, a la ancient Greek Bacchanals, I might say that'd be going too far.  But I went to see it five times, and each time I loved it more than the last.  That has to say something, right?  Only one thing was missing that would have made the whole thing a total gem.  One simple thing - a man, actually.  A tall, slender man with an extendable bo staff and red-on-black demon eyes, who's absolutely KILLER at cards.  But hey, that's what sequels are for, right?  I'll bide my time till the next movie, and pray that Gambit makes more than a cameo appearance.  Hell, I'll even hope he gets to be a main character.  I just have one ultimatum to issue first:<br/><br/>Please, for the love of all that is good and holy,<br/><br/>Make.<br/><br/>Him.<br/><br/>CAJUN."

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>I actually watched this on Wednesday,but,on leaving the cinema,I was a little unsure on what I thought of it,to be honest.Over the past two days,I've had some time to give it some consideration.And I've managed to get over a few of the misgivings I might have had about it.Coming from Bryan Singer,who helmed the original,it stood a chance in my mind anyway of matching that film's dark,gothic feel and sense of creativity.<br/><br/>Then again,the sequel to Men in Black was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld,who directed that film's original,and that was easily the worst film of last year.<br/><br/>Then again,this film was made a lot sooner than the other one,and is ,at the very least,more relevant.One of the driving forces behind it's existence was obviously to make lots of money by capitalizing on the success of the original,but then aren't these films always?But,compared to a lot of the other no brainer drudge fests that have occupied our screens of late,X2 certainly respects your intelligence at least.<br/><br/>Speaking of the direction,Singer guides a stern,thoughtful script along evenly,and wisely adds touches of flair and humour in at appropriate interludes,meaning the affair never becomes too heavy handed.<br/><br/>On the performances front,as the two older members of the central cast,Ian McKellen and good ol' Patrick Stewart craft some marvellous,engaging chemistry between themselves as the intermittent good friends/deadliest adversaries and can pretty much play each other off like chess players.Sure,a fair bit of the dialogue they are given to work with is pretty tired and cliched,but it's that undeniably infectuous sense of commaradere that engages the audience's emotions so well.It's also a good examination of how,indeed,the best of friends can be the most powerful of enemies.Brian Cox is convincingly twisted as the main villain here,whilst Hugh Jackman remains fun in the leading role and male testosterone levels can reach mammoth heights at the sight of Halle Berry in a long leather coat.And Alan Cumming makes an above average but below fantastic debut as 'the Nightcrawler'.<br/><br/>Some may argue it's overlong.Others may argue it's providing a greater level of character development and enforcing it's social message more.Some may argue it's just an inevitable but fun and slick Summer blockbuster,that isn't in T2 leagues of greatness,but certainly not a bad night out at the pics and easily one of the best sequels in a long time.***"

Halle Berry lookin good as usual. The script is very good. What was hard to understand was when Jason was controlling his mind. It had twists and turns at that scene. I honestly didn't understand what was up with Nightcrawler. He kicks ass at the beginning but then he turns out as this sensitive creature who is a religious dude.

"The Spectacular Spider-Man","8","0","1","21 May 2003"," It seems great at first....
","In retrospect, X2 was rather disapointing. It started with a bang (actually a bamf) in a sequence that was almost worthy of the first Matrix, but it went downhill from there. There was no electricity between the characters, it was all flat. Logan and Jean wasn't even the same dynamic. Hugh Jackman was far too relaxed and was more himself than Logan much of the time (in the same way James Bond actors don't really act, they just coast on their charisma). And Logan only got two chances to kick ass, the second of which, good though it was, was once again Wolverine getting his ass kicked by a woman. <br/><br/>Nightcrawler was awesome but obviously crammed into a plot which couldn't really support him, Bobby and Rogue could have been left out, Magneto was just Ian McKellen having a fun time, not the obsessed, would-be Malcolm X of the mutant world. ""i love what you've done with your hair,"" is something Magneto of the first film would never say. Stryker was yet another British thesp playing a Hollywood villain, nothing more. All the characters were real 3D people in the first movie, but they are closer to 2D action movie characters here. The action and effects in general were twice as good as in the original, but there was still not enough action. <br/><br/>X2 was more satisfying as an action adventure blockbuster, but the first movie was better written and directed, was tighter and more exciting, and had far better acting. X2 is a big movie, but the original is a special movie. And a better one."
"lwjoslin","Null","0","2","11 May 2003"," Let me X you a question...
","When I think of the word ""mutant"" or ""mutation,"" I think of a 2-headed calf, or of all those frogs that were being hatched a few years ago with too many legs, or too few.  A kid who can freeze a cup of steaming coffee solid with a touch; a girl who can walk through walls; a woman who can control the weather... these aren't mutants.  They're miracle workers.<br/><br/>Some of their powers are alarming: the chameleonic Mystique is a shapeshifter, the same category of being as a werewolf.  Some of their appearances are disturbing: for all his mainstream religious faith and recitation of prayers, Nightcrawler looks like nothing so much as a high-Medieval European concept of a demon.  And some of the ""mutants"" are hostile and dangerous; but in my long life, all of the hostile, dangerous people I've ever known--all of the people who used their gifts and talents for selfish or harmful purposes--were NON-mutants.<br/><br/>So what are we to make of, say, Iceman's chilling effects?  If mutations are nature's way of adjusting to stimuli, what stimulus brought about this reaction?  Or if mutations are simply random genetic misfires, what recessive genetic trait gave rise to this capability? <br/><br/>
I look at the question from the point of view of one who rejects the ""pure"" scientific view of evolution: that life began by accident; that it (and we) developed completely at random; that it (and we) are simply biological phenomena devoid of any higher purpose or spiritual meaning.  I favor the view variously referred to as ""theistic evolution"" or ""intelligent design."" Based on that viewpoint, I'd take a wildly unlikely talent such as Iceman's to be proof positive that God is up to something, and is doling out the equipment that'll be needed to cope with whatever it is that's coming.<br/><br/>But Iceman's capability is like the laser at the time of its invention in the early 1960s: it was an answer without a question.  It took awhile to figure out the laser's usefulness in communications, surgery, etc. Similarly, the question presents itself: what is Iceman's gift FOR? and Storm's? and Mystique's? and Magneto's? and Pyro's? and so forth?  What are nature and nature's God up to with these people?  Why these gifts, and why these people?<br/><br/>At this time we have insufficient evidence to answer these questions.  But it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.  Meantime, it's a good and appropriate thing that Nightcrawler introduces faith into the drama, and it's wise of the filmmakers not to caricature it."

","Here's a good review X-Men 2 I found: <br/><br/>I saw X-men 2 today. I convinced some friends of mine to go see it because everyone else was seeing it so we should too. We got in early and got very good seats and so the sound was incredible even when the movie trailers where playing. <br/><br/>X-men 2 is about these people who people don't like because they aren't really people and it's a sequel to a movie called X-men. I thought it was a very good film with lots of people in it with super powers. They are good people and they try to stop the bad guys from killing others. There are some very funny things in the movie like when the Wolverine smells a cat and points his claws at him because he knows how other cats like to lick other cats so that they are not afraid of each other. <br/><br/>There are some very sad times too like when in the end the pretty girl is trying her best. <br/><br/>I give this movie two hotdogs and a coke because that is what I ate when I saw the movie.

More than once the movie has to come to a screeching halt for exposition and it really bogs things down. Also there were too many characters--that was a problem with the first film. This time they compound it by adding MORE characters! Also Cyclops and Professor X were horribly underused. There were also a few nagging questions left unanswered--<br/><br/>PLEASE SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Where does Collosus take the mutant children when the school is under attack? And why is Wolverine's past STILL a mystery at the end?<br/><br/>Still, the movie did a lot of good things. They did get rid of two of the stupider villains (Sabretooth and Toad). They added Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who gets a lot of screen time and beefed up the roles of Iceman, Pyro and Rogue. Also, Collosus has a few scenes. As with the first movie, Wolverine is center stage again (this is a good thing) and Halle Berry seems much more comfortable as Storm the second time around. The younger cast members seem very comfortable with their roles (especially Paquin) and Ian McKellan is great again as Magneto. Also Mystique has much more screen time and the sequences with her were just great.<br/><br/>Also the acting is good, the special effects terrific and it was very touching at the end.<br/><br/>So, aside from a few dead spots, this is a very good super hero movie."

","First and foremost, I enjoyed this film.  Second and secondly, it was too long. It started out well, with a strange entity/mutant teleporting about in a frenzy, threatening the president and taking on the secret service men. But afterwards, it seemed to take on exact feel as the last movie, with no real plot twists (except the end, which seemed a little out of the blue), or character changes. Of course, it is integral to keep on the old characters with their personalities intact from the last film, however, there were few or no new characters or character changes (excepting the end).  We bravely went exactly where we went before.  Wolverine is on a quest to discover his past, in which we are once again denied knowing who he was and why he was given his adamantium skeleton.  (He also is still sexually frustrated about Dr. Jean Gray).  Mutants are under threat by panicky and controlling humans, and humans are once again threatened by the renegade mutants bent on destruction.  Magneto has an ugly red helmet, and a blue shape shifting sidekick, motiveless in her seduction of Wolverine (and what was with her turning into Stryker once as supposedly part of Wolverine's sexual fantasy?).  We miss cutie-patootie Cyclops through half of the movie, and the fight scenes, while fast-paced and action packed, do nothing to continue the pace of the film, which considerably drags.  Particularly when the X-Men are up north in the frigid outback (again), and lost for hours (seemingly), in the tunnels of Skylark's domain.  I also now know, every panel of Prof. Xavier's mind controlling orb, Cerebro. This movie's plot could have been carried out in an hour and a half, instead of over two.  I do not regret the $7.00 I spent on this film.  It was a relatively pleasant way to spend a Friday evening, however, I was not as intruiged as by the first film, and unfortunately expected a bit more than a cookie-cutter marvel comic book to film."

","Ok, I have to admit I am not a huge comic book fan or a fan of the Marvel genre. It's not that I don't like them or the idea behind them but I just, as a kid, or as an adult, ever got into them, so I think that may have a big influence on people for this movie. I know that, being a HUGE Star Wars fan I can enjoy the new movies more then people who were just casual fans. But anyway, heres what I think. The things I liked: Special effects are awsome once again. The beginning sequence with Nightcrawler is great, the way he appears and dissappears is amazing. The scene with Pyro, where he takes on the entire Colorado PD, the scene where the school is overrun and you see the different kids power. That stuff is awsome.<br/><br/>The things I didn't like: The movie dragged. This is not as exciting as the first. It is long and drawn out. I understand that directors always are looking to make MORE then an action film, but in the end isn't that what we want? A film filled with fights, explosions, and strange creatures doing strange things? This movie has bits and pieces of that but doesn't reall focus on it too much. And the characters are old, I don't like them. The only new character intorduced in this film is Nightcrawler who has one good scene where you get to see what he is made of, and then that is it. I dislike Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Charles Xavier. They are boring characters with boring powers. Cyclops is hardly in this movie at all, which is good, and Xavier plays basically Jean Luc in a wheel chair this whole movie, getting into a psychological battle that puts the cat to sleep wih some Sixth Sense looking mutant. Wolverine, as usual, is the lynchpin of the movie and he carries it throughout. But even the bad guys. Last time around there was Toad, with his long tongue, and the lion looking guy, whose name escapes me. Now? Magnito and Mystique, who is hot as all hell, but in the end the idea of a shape shifter as her power is not that appealing. No new villians except for Special Forces General Striker? All these Xmen charaters and we only get Nightcrawler whose action is over within the forst 10 minutes? What a joke. And this Rogue character? Does she have any point in the comics cause she sure as hell doesn't in these movies. All these Xmen charaters and we get a girl with a horribly infectious rash to focus on. I don't CARE about her or whether or not she can ever touch anyone. I hope she doesn't. And the girl who plays her? Take a step back Heather Graham there might be a worse actress on the face of the earth then you. I cannot stand that ROGUE character and it is as if they HAVE to try and put things in the movie to make her interesting. Take her out and put in a charater with some really cool powers, that can do something interesting besides spread some sort of weird disease. And that also goes for Jean Grey. My God could there be a more useless character. SPOILER!!!!!!!! Figured I would put that in there about Grey, but she supposedly dies in the end, something I hope sticks but I know will not in the end. She'll be back, somehow, and the movie will be the worse for the wear for it. She is annoying, her powers amazingly uninteresting considering another character in the movie, Xavier, has the same power, and her love affair with Cyclops and Wolverine is stupid. Is the movie horrible? No, but it is just another high budget, high octane Hollywood movie that is big on hype and low on results. Here is to hoping that this is not a prelude to things to come for this summer. Last summer was a such a good one for movies, and the year before so bad, that hopefully this year marks its own terroritory with Martix and Hulk and the others coming out. But X2 is not the banner movie of the year so far."

","(may contain spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie yet don't read this) I saw X2:X-MEN UNITED on Friday(opening day!)and I feel the need to talk about it because it was such an awesome movie. First I'll talk about the few negative things though because they kind of bugged me. 1.)They had too many stories going on at the same time so just when you'd be getting into the scene it would suddenly jump to another group of characters. 2.)Cyclops(James Marsden) was absent for most of the film which was annoying because you never really know what happens after he and Xavier are captured-you only know about what they do to Xavier. 3.)You never see where all the kids go after they escape from the mansion. 4.)Some of the characters didn't have much substance to them. 5.)Why did Iceman(Shawn Ashmore)and Rogue(Anna Paquin)only get there X-suits at the end?I wanted to see Iceman duking it out with the bad guys. There's a few other minor things that bothered me but they don't really matter because overall the movie was amazing!The special effects were HUGE and the comedic relief lines were fairly well placed.I was so glad to see that Iceman(Shawn Ashmore)had a larger role(and no that's not just because he happens to be an attractive 23 year-old blonde, blue-eyed male)because his story is very interesting.I was also glad that they scaled Rogue's(Anna Paquin)role back a bit because honestly I think her power isn't that exciting.I was glad to see Xavier(Patrick Stewert)getting to use his powers a bit more and that Mystique(Rebecca Romji-Stamos)was more prominate in this movie.Lady Deathstrike's(Kelly Hu)claws were awesome!Plus Wolverine's(Hugh Jackman)reaction is perfect.I don't like how he killed her though-that was just cheesey and it looked bad too.It would have been nice if we'd seen more of the mutants that Stryker was holding hostage in his little fortress but I guess they just didn't have enough time.The action sequences were cool but they should've had more.It was nice touch when Mystique would be pretending to be someone else(ie. Senator Kelly)that the actor would walk like she would when she was in her regular form.I wonder how the guys felt walking like a girl?I liked the comic Colussous(Daniel Cudmore)drew of Iceman and Rogue kissing-its classic.I also liked when Wolverine and Iceman meet and when they have a talk over beer and ice cream(I'm not joking-Iceman was eating icecream in the middle of the night.Maybe that's his secret for keeping his ice powers 'cool'.)I also liked how some of the lines sounded familiar from the last movie but there was too many.It's funny the first few times then its just dumb. Overall amazing movie but make sure you've at least seen the first one before you go see this one."
"Jaguar564","Null","0","1","4 May 2003"," Great Movie Overall, Minor Discrepancies and Minor Spoilers
","When I went to see this movie I did not know what to expect. The opening scene was more than amazing. The arrival of Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler is the best additions to this movie ever. His accent the character's depth, if The Oscars were to actually look more at sci-fi films for once, he'd be a great nomination choice. Generally the acting was great. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great as usual. Those guys deserve some recognition out there (seems like the British actors always have the best acting, must be from all that theater). First off with the principal characters, Famke Janssen, was perfect for the role of Jean Grey. After looking at the cartoon series and comics she plays the role perfectly. I really hope to see this Phoenix storyline develop, especially to see the return of Jean Grey. Wolverine? What I can say, Hugh Jackman has been great in the role and continues to portray the character as remembered in the other mediums. I still wonder why they haven't given Halle Berry anymore storyline. Halle Berry looked great in the role; I think Storm would be a perfect Revlon spokesperson. Storm was a real popular character in the comics. Its actually sad to see Storm's accent go, especially since the character has not been given any real depth at all, but it was nice to see her use her powers all around though. Cyclops like Storm still hasn't been given any great storyline. Although I think James Marsden looks a bit young for the role not giving it the leadership quality Cyclops had (he makes a great Cyclops just not for this time period), I think its nice to see him give him some emotion at the end. Mystique was great as usual and looking good, I hope they attempt to establish the mother/son relationship between nightcrawler and mystique, so much potential there. Rogue was Rogue as usual. I hardly saw the character smile throughout the whole movie. I really hope they can age the role in the next movie, cause I really want to see the Rogue I saw in the comics and cartoon series, who was strong, funny, heart of gold, a leader herself and had that strong southern feel, something I don't see in Anna Paquin's portrayal, she plays the role well, but could have been better suited as shadowcat or another younger role. Especially if they bring Gambit who has to be someone in their 30s or late 20s to match correctly with the right Rogue. Rogue/Storm/Jean were equals with their different range of powers, but in the movies Rogue seems so much lower. Iceman was another one, who wasn't smiling, but I did like the actor, and I think he would be perfect for Jubilee. Speaking of Jubilee? Will they ever feature her? Nice to see Colossus pass by, even though it seemed he was missing his accent, probably the most familiar part of the character. Hope to see Beast, Gambit and Jubilee, making the X-team united for once. Kelly Hu was great, why didn't they give her more lines or maybe a deeper story. The fight scenes were awesome and she looked pretty good, she is a formidable opponent for the other great leading ladies Famke, Halle and Rebecca. Why did Jean Grey leave the plane, couldn't she use her power from inside? Why did they leave William Stryker's son in the dam? That was pretty horrible to see the guy in the wheelchair and everyone leaving. Why wasn't Xavier able to read Magneto's mind about what he was going to do, especially since Magneto didn't have his helmet, which was his only protection against Xavier's powers? Bobby's family was pretty cruel, especially his brother? Are all families of mutants as evil like that? Where did this whole mutant gene from the father's side come from? Makes no sense, must have only been there to get a few laughs. It was really strange how Wolverine this time around couldn't smell Mystique or anyone else for that matter? He used to be able to find everything and smell the wrong and right people, guess he lost that power this time around. Overall a great movie to see and hopefully it can be even better a 3rd time around."

","Just saw the new X men movie, and I think that the writers have completely sold out.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Way too much happens in this movie.  Sure, there is the whole deal with the bad guy trying to take over the world scheme, but too much else seems like it was just thrown in.<br/><br/>The movie begins when there is an assasination attempt on the President made by Nightcrawler (who's mind is controlled by Stryker).  Don't worry , Crawler turns out to be a good guy.  An immediate investigation is launched on both sides, human and mutant, to see who was behind the situation.<br/><br/>
Logan comes home, and immediately it seems he is in the middle of not one, but two love triangles.  It turns out Rouge and Bobby (Iceman) have accelerated their relationship, and the whole ""non-contact"" thing is driving bobby nuts.  Wolverine seems to be the childhood crush of Rouge (eliciting jealousy from Bobby), and Logan is still in love with Jene.  A little awkward?  No, just poorly placed.  Don't get me wrong, you can have a good comic book without the romance, but the movie blows it way out of proportion.<br/><br/>It's a good thing Logan comes home, because the rest of the X-team runs out to handle some things about the assasination.  Jene and Storm go to Boston to find Nightcrawler, Prof. X and Scott (Cyclops) go and visit their friend, Magneto.  This leaves the Xiavier university vulnerable to attack by government troops, which happens.  The attack forces the students to flee, sending a small team of them (Wolverine, Rouge, Iceman, Pyro) in a Mazday RX4 to Boston. Meanwhile, Prof. X and Cyclops are captured by Strykers forces.<br/><br/>And Magneto manages to escape.<br/><br/>In Boston, we are exposed to Pyro's very short temper and violoence fetish as he torches several police cars.  On their way back from Boston, the team (now heavy Storm and Jene, in the Blackbird) run into Magneto and Mystique. You figure there would be some fighting, instead, they ally to stop Strykers plan.<br/><br/>It turns out, Stryker was using mind altering syrums to draw out secrets and control people's minds.  Now, he has built a second Coloso that he will use, in junction with a sedated Prof X, to destroy all mutants, at once.  To make things more interesting, Strykers base of operations is Alkine Lake, Wolverines old stomping grounds.<br/><br/>The team manages to stop Stryker from killing all mutants.  Remember Magneto is on their team now, and he manages to change the unit from killing all mutants, to killing all humans (its a double-cross).  Don't worry, they all save the day, and force the President into giving a different address to the nation, one that is pro-mutant.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, Jene dies.  At least you think she dies.  She goes off to perform some dramatic psyhcic duty, and is crushed by a wall of water.  But something tells me we'll see her again, in the next movie.<br/><br/>Yes, at the end of two, they opened a whole can of worms for three.  Jene is coming back, as Pheonix.  Pyro goes bad, and will probably kill Iceman. And the movie will probably tank at the box office.<br/><br/>The bad part about these movies, character evolutoion is spread too far. I have seen no coming to reason from Storm, Prof X, or Cyclops.  they are just, there.  Wolverine is learning about his past, and growing stronger from it, Jene is developing her skills like no other, Rouge and Iceman are figuring out their whole mushy-mushy deal.<br/><br/>But what else would you expect an English major to gripe about?"

"gibberish56","Null","0","1","30 April 2003"," Great action, mediocre acting
","I am glad that I caught the movie in the middle of my examination period - glad to be one of the first to watch this great movie!<br/><br/>
This sequel is very much better than the first. X2 did not have to try very hard to explain who's who, and what happened - a flaw that hampered X-Men's story.<br/><br/>Adapted from the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", X2 did a magnificent job in translating the story onto screen, with a few twists on its own. Bryan Singer took the liberty to change the plot here and there, ensuring that the characters fit into the story. And he did a great job - my friends who do not follow the comics understood the movie rather well.<br/><br/>Action sequences are some of the best I have seen. Ok, maybe not as monumental as the Matrix, but the camera worked doubly hard to capture the unique abilities each mutant possessed. Be it teleportation, phasing through walls, or even telepathy, amazing special effects and imaginative camera work brought them to life.<br/><br/>However, in terms of acting, it was rather mediocre. Other than Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Patrick Stewart's Professor X, the rest has too fleeting roles to make an impact. Famke Jassen (Jean Grey) and James Marsden (Cyclops) made the reverse though. You just cringe when you see them on screen. Maybe it's bad casting, Jassen and Marsden just don't have the chemistry to sustain their onscreen relationship though.<br/><br/>The movie is also flawed by it's not-so-climatic ending. When you thought that the movie ended, but it didn't, then it's a teeny bit too long and strained.<br/><br/>For comic fans, it's great fun spotting mutant cameos - McCoy, Jubilee, Colossus, Kitty Pryde, Artie... Oh, speaking of cameos, for those who watched the movie, when did Gambit appear? Who is Alphonsus as mentioned in the cast list? And who is that kid who could switch channels without the remote?<br/><br/>Questions questions questions. Guess I will have to watch it again... :)"

The movie follows the journey of two seperate sects of mutants combining to fight an evil power whilst developing involved relationships between the characters.  The love triangle between Wolverine, Jean Gray and Cyclops is drawn wonderfully, culminating at the end of the movie with the perfect balance of tact and emotion.  Singer really has outdone himself with X2, every aspect is a major improvement on the first installment of the X-Men movie series.  He has made the true fans of the comic proud, and my only advice to you, is to get out of the house and see it!<br/><br/>Cheers"

","After the hugely, very VERY useless and extremely boring ""Daredevil"" along with the very much OVER hyped ""Spider-Man"" which was cheese city peppered with awesome effects....I was beginning to get a little worried that the whole super hero film franchise was in serious trouble. But I totally knew that X2 was going restore my faith and it has. Mr Singer has pulled it off AGAIN! X2 is everything I hoped for and more, very classy. Although I didn't feel it was as humorous as the 1st it has a more in depth story line and the effects are flawless! Nightcrawlers entire opening sequence in the white house is how an opening SHOULD be done. I haven't been this blown away with a movie opening since Trinity 1st appeared in the Matrix! Kudos to you again Bryan Singer and everyone involved in your effects team. I love the references that were made to the first film i.e. Liberty Island and the subtle things such as Mystique's scars from her first fight with Wolverine in X1. Little things also like Hank Mcoys brief appearance on the news are very intriguing. Its great also to see the Phoenix character starting to make her appearance. All the characters were well written especially Mystique who is perfect in her casting!! Along with Hugh as Wolverine, At first I was a little cautious with Hugh being cast as Wolverine but now I cannot imagine anyone else as Wolverine. Basically X2 is a great movie which everyone will enjoy. Fun, thrills, great original effects (Nightcrawler's teleport) and great acting. This is not a sequel but a successful continuation of the X-men saga, I'm already looking forward to X3. Bring on Gambit! Bring on Phoenix! and bring on another success. I saw the midnight premiere last night in Auckland and again today at 3PM ...and it won't be the last.  GO SEE IT!"

"manofhood","10","0","1","1 May 2003"," The Story Unfolding
","X2 had world premiere in Norway April 30th.<br/><br/>It is a great follow up to and even surpassing the first film. Without revealing too much it is basically about two of the main characters Jean Grey and Wolverine. There might be a hint of a spoiler here.<br/><br/>Among many themes, taken from 40 years of comics publishing history it is about Wolverine searching for his past and about Jean's increasing powers, escalating throughout the story. William Stryker, a bitter old man is initiating an attack on all mutants and they all have to be at their best to survive.<br/><br/>We're thrown into the story from the first image and it won't let go even long after we have left the theater. We see the story unfolding and it will only continue to intensify as more movies are made. They're really DOING it, telling the story about the next generation of mankind in all its horror and glory.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that they should have done a Matrix on us. The next movie should have come in 6 months, not in two years. But that's just a fan's natural instinct. The people behind the camera and the actors care about the story, they believe in it, and it shows. What most movie makers of today don't manage to do, what they fail miserably to do, namely creating engaging stories, these guys do with flying colors.<br/><br/>Indescribable"

","Three years down the lines and director Brian Singer has grown much more confident with action - or maybe it's just that the old team, (with composer / editor John Ottman), is back in place.<br/><br/>X2 is a joy to watch with a great storyline and fantastic set pieces. The intrigue and character development follow on from the first film and are taken further than your average sequel would usually bother to go.<br/><br/>The cast look superb and once again the solid Jackman as Wolverine keeps things trotting along with menace and some pace. Professor X and Magneto suffer slightly from reduced roles and Alan Cummings pathetic accent pulls his dialogue down somewhat.<br/><br/>On the whole a thoroughly enjoyable romp with much more sensibility than the average summer blockbuster.

"mizsjr","Null","0","1","29 April 2003"," A step up from the original.
","I'd like to start out this review by disagreeing with some earlier comments. I realise that there are going to be people out there who just dont like comic book movies, period, but this movie certainly belongs in the high end of the genre. I'd agree that it contains lots of 'in jokes', and makes references to relevant people and plot points from the first movie. That's because it's a SEQUEL, and well, if it didn't have any continuity from the first movie, we'd be ripping on it for that, too.<br/><br/> One thing is for sure, it's a huge improvement on the original and the addition of John Ottman's score definitely makes a difference. The majority of the cast are great in this, particularly Halle Berry and Alan Cumming - who really shines as Nightcrawler, by the way. The only person who seems to be at somewhat of a loose end is Cyclops (James Marsden) and considering the lack of quality in his performance, that's probably a good thing.<br/><br/> The cameos are cool, too; watch out for Colossus, Siryn and Banshee. Also, watch the screen when Mystique hacks into Stryker's Mutant Files - I'm a comic geek, so I got a big thrill out of seeing other X-Men's names come up on that computer screen.:)There's far more action in X2 than there was in the original, and what there is a lot slicker and more exciting than in the original. The conflicts seem far more convincing, too. Don't get me wrong, this was never going to be Academy Award winning material but it's surprisingly good. The script is sticky in places (boy, can't you tell that the re-writers were totally inexperienced!) but it's a fun movie. Well worth checking out."

","Having not seen the first X-MEN, I wondered if I could make sense of the story in here, since the first film was especially about introducing the characters. I must say I haven't had any major problems getting ""in"" the story, though some things asked for some explanation. Now, the film started out terrific: opening credits, first scene involving the new character of Nightcrawler (incredible, though I would have liked to see more of him), the escape from the ice cage, the raid on the mansion,.... I admired the fact that Bryan Singer didn't choose to copy THE MATRIX (like so many other films), and thought he did a great job here. I also liked how all of these characters used their specific ""qualities"" (there are some amazing ones in this film). However, the second half of the film wasn't up to par with the first half. It wasn't bad, but the story just had too many lulls, especially near the end. A pity, given the terrific start. Nevertheless, watch this one for the excellent action scenes. Some of it will get your heart pumping. 8/10"

","I was privelidged to be at the first public screening of x-men 2. Well i was excited about this movie, i loved the first one, i thought it was a great film, entertaining, had its own tone, and had wolverine. As an X-men fan or fanboy of comics, i usually love these films but i also have great expectations but am always satisfied, cos i know i cant do any better. I thought what the first one lacked even though it didnt really bother me, was that it didnt have enough comic book elements, it didnt feel totally like x-men, whereas spiderman felt like reading 70's spiderman comics, and daredevil felt like reading frank miller era daredevil. There wasnt enough berserker rage, wolverine said bub twice and you couldnt hear it. Cyclops didnt have that leadership aspect. Well there was fan response, and it wasnt backlash, it was just suggestions to make the next film better and more entertaining, Bryan Singer being an x-men fan, listened to these suggestions and went one step further, not only including all of them but delving deeper into the comic and making it one of the greatest adaptations ever. Fans complained that there wasnt enough berserker rage, it needed a deeper background story and more violence. Woaahh Bryan Singer does listen.<br/><br/>The story is great, the script is uber strong and it flows amazingly. But in adaptations of comics its about visuals and characters. The camera shots are unbelivable and perfect, the effects are God. So yeah the whole film aspect is amazing. But were gonna look at the comic side.<br/><br/>We get a new character nightcrawler(who is in one of the greatest opening sequences ever in film, mix matrix and marvel), we dwell deeper into the lead characters of the first film(wolverine,storm,jean, prof x) and we focus alot more on the minor characters of the first film(iceman,pyro). we also get villains, stryker a militant mutant hater and lady deathstrike(a female esque version of wolverine, who in the comic was partially cyborg like) and the return of the mutant malcom x - magneto<br/><br/>The film is great in bringing the characters to life, also including alot of wit and humour, alot with wolverine. But a big impact is the amount of violence, taken up a big notch, its x-men in full glory. Not witholding what wolverine can and will do.<br/><br/>Wolverine clearly steals the film again because even though there is a little less focus on him, his character is so strong but also due to Jackmans amazing and perfect portrayal of wolverine. He looks like he could kill you and take on an army, which is what i loved, apart from being way more buff than the first film, we get my favourite aspect, berserker rage, this comes into full effect when strykers team invade the mansion and bang! wolverine goes off. Screaming and aggressive fighting with unquestioned stylistic brutal killings, wolverine is what he is supposed to be. Brutal<br/><br/>The film also includes alot more of jean grey and for the next film we are shown that it involves mainly her as phoenix which is also in this film.<br/><br/>Even though cyclops isnt that involved, his character is so much better than the first, he is cyclops.<br/><br/>An amazing aspect of the film and script is the amount of great ideas they had in mutant powers, the way they can use them and the way they are shown, such as magneto extraditing iron from a guards blood. Its total post 90's X-men.<br/><br/>For an adaptation to be amazing, it needs to be faithful to the comic, it needs to be entertaining, and it needs to flow like a comic. Whereas books are more direct, X-men has more than 40 years of narrative so only the main and important aspects are needed. Spiderman went godlike and did it perfectly. Daredevil went even further and might as well of been written by Frank Miller. X-men 2 is its own film but the triumph of the film is that it feels like X-men. So go watch it Bub."

","I have to admit I had high hopes for this going in, which I don't usually allow myself for Hollywood big budget films - so often rubbish! However this was Bryan Singer, a great cast and the X-Men (a comic I loved as a kid). I was disappointed with the first film which was good but not the spectacular entertainment I had been hoping for. Now X2, this surpassed all my expectations.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say much but the scope of the film is much broader giving all the characters a proper storyline and blending three major plotlines seemlessly. You would imagine that at two and a quarter hours the film might seem too long but that is never the case. Uncommon for Hollywood summer efforts X2 is dense with plot and characters but is never weighed down by it.<br/><br/>The action is superb. From the moment the film opens with a stunning sequence which introduces a new character (won't say who you'll just have to seee it) to the very end the effects and stunt work are breath-taking.<br/><br/>As for the acting it is solid throughout. Once again it is Sir Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman that steal the film - along with the always excellent Brian Cox. However Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos also shine in far better roles than they were given in the original film.<br/><br/>My advice is see this as soon as you can because you'll want to see it more than once if you like it and if you don't then you were probably the person who never expected to like it in which case, well,  no harm no foul.<br/><br/>Those of you who want a kick-ass start to the blockbuster season but not as dumb and plotless as most, enjoy. Let's all just hope The Matrix Reloaded continues the quality while we wait for the end of joys that will hopefully be Kill Bill, Intolerable Cruelty, The Matrix Revolutions and (deep breath) The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.

","Firstly i would like to say that i enjoyed the first film immensely and feel it was the best yet of the marvel movies what this film achieved was a sense of the real world in relation to the characters of the world renowned comic book and although i loved daredevil it was grounded in the comic book world as was spiderman which i didn't like so much. X2 expands on the foundations laid in x1 and works as a companion piece to the original this is the only fault i can see in that those who have not seen the first film or ever heard of marvels mutants before may feel a little alienated as the powers of the original cast and certain conflicts are not overly explained if you have not experienced x1. For those who have seen the first well prepare to be blown away the nods to the fans are brilliant and as in the first the special effects serve to enhance the characters more than the story though they do both equally. I love that mystique has a lot more play in this film and i came out thinking Mystique was awesome not rebecca romijin nude with blue bits was ahh anyway i agree with the guy from london in that they are setting up a franchise but believe me this is not a bad thing if the development of a certain character's powers lead to the inevitable conclusion reached in one of the great... ill leave it there but Bryan singers film is a special one and the reteaming with his editor and composer form suspects is a big plus in the pacing and scoring department (score was about the only lax thing in the first film) and i can only hope they secure the rest (mystique is on board for x3) of the cast in what is looking to be the best marvel franchise to date - finally i implore those of you who have not seen x1 to do so before you you see x2 as it will enhance the x perience greatly and you will be hard pressed to walk out disappointed also it might help if you read...shut up man - go see it!"

","I was there too and must say that the film is an improvement. The only thing i hated about the first x-men was that is too damn short. Wth more character development, more action (with a bigger budget) and cool new characters, X2 will blow you away. Especially the sequence where the school is under attack. Wolverine slashes a lot of soldiers and shows his true temper. Although i have come to the conclusion that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos still can't act. She showed in the sequence where she plays herself (as a blonde woman). She doesn't have to say anything during the film, just being there is enough, but when she does speak it seems too constructed to be believable. Another negative aspect is that the film really jump starts at the beginning. When you haven't seen the first film or read the comics this could be a bit confusing since it overwhelms you with tons of information.<br/><br/>But for the rest it was a great ride so please put X3 on the fast track !!"

","The opening scene of 'X2' is a cracker, but from there the story and situations lack innovation and largely fail to deliver the goods. It's a real shame, as you won't find a more intriguing clutch of characters. The mutants are the whole point of 'X-Men' but most are developed no further than they were in the original, despite the filmmakers' pre-release promises to the contrary.<br/><br/>Rogue, Professor X and the phenomenally bland Cyclops are genuine disappointments, and while Storm and Magneto hold their own, Nightcrawler is a missed opportunity and Lady Deathstrike is only required for a single scene though she appears throughout. Hugh Jackman's brooding presence as Wolverine and the shape-shifting powers of Mystique give the movie a boost whenever they're on screen, and Brian Cox does what he can with a role which is essentially that of the army guy who's forever chasing The A-Team.<br/><br/>The whole set-up screams 'franchise' (you can almost hear the toy manufacturers drooling), but after the splash made by the original it deserves so much more.<br/><br/>When X3 eventually comes around (XXX has been done, so 'X-cubed' maybe?), I say plot be damned - just let the mutants strut their stuff."
