","I think this is an excellent movie..I've noticed many felt it ""too long, boring, etc..."" which is to be expected in today's ""gimme non-stop action; I haven't been doing anything for 5 minutes, I'm bored"" mentality.  This was a true man vs nature movie that really made me think about what I take for granted and I found myself wondering how I would react in such a situation. Would I talk to a volleyball?  you betcha...anyone who has spent any significant time alone can relate.  Bought the DVD and will watch it for years too come."
"Quinoa1984","9","187","223","22 December 2000"," Amazing performance shines through
","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.  Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.<br/><br/>The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)?  Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).  That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs.  The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance.  If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-"
"frwjames","10","152","185","28 July 2007"," What a fantastic film!!!
","I have never seen a more meaningful and thought-provoking film. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a classic film, and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit. It delivers such a strong message of fear, survival and hope, that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after. It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way. This is one of my all time favourite films, and I could watch it again and again without getting bored... so go and watch it...NOW!!"
"jtbrat3","10","78","93","10 October 2006"," It's all about love
","I liked this movie, but I can't say the same for the reviews found on this website. Far too many of these fall into 2 categories: Those who thought the movie was a Crusoe-like story of survival and loved it, and those who thought the film was an ad for Fedex and hated it. But the movie is neither about ""man against nature"" nor about Fedex.<br/><br/>Cast Away is about love - about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success, about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it, about an ordeal that led one man to re-think what is meaningful in life, and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland - creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped - not against his will - in a job that is eating him alive. How many actors could have made Noland's attachment to ""Wilson"" believable? Yet Hanks does.<br/><br/>The last section of the film, much reviled by many, is immensely touching. Noland has survived 5 year's of utter isolation hoping to be reunited with his fiancé and has resigned himself to death at least a few times before he is miraculously rescued. Anyone who remains dry-eyed during his meeting with Kelly, when their rich feelings are both acknowledged and of necessity abandoned - is unworthy of being allowed in the theater to see a film of such quality as this one.<br/><br/>That Noland's hard-earned wisdom about love and family will not be wasted makes for a marvelous ending to the film. It has required all of his ingenuity and endurance to survive on the island. It will now require strength of a different kind to accept the irrevocable loss of Kelly and open himself to a new experience, perhaps with Bettina. The last scene, with Noland standing at the crossroads, as the haunting theme is reprised for the last time, as Bettina drives toward her house and as Hanks looks into the camera with new-found resolve - is classic - though again, cynics are absolutely barred from enjoying it."

His imagination(he names a volleyball Wilson and talks with him as a friend),his perseverance toward love,and his courage to face problems,all these enable him to survive and finally return to his homeland.<br/><br/>When Chuck and Kelly embraced each other in the rain, I burst out crying.They are true lovers.But,fate is cruel.His beloved fiancée,his only belief during those terrible days and nights is forever gone.His hope is disillusioned.He is standing at a life crossroads,thinking and hesitating.He has to choose a way to begin his new life.<br/><br/>I greatly recommend this movie.Don't feel boring,just be patient.I think movies are not only seen by eyes,but also by heart.Use your heart to feel what the characters feel.Then the more you see it,the more you'll be inspired and the more you'll find.Finally,hope you enjoy other Hanks movies!!!"
"mjcmike1","10","85","105","18 August 2012"," The most deserving film not in the top 250
","This movie is the most deserving of all movies out there that is not in the IMDb Top 250. In fact, this movie should be in the Top 100. Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!"
"Taurus-Littrow","9","87","108","13 January 2005"," An excellent Robinson Crusoe variant
","I've always been intrigued with Daniel Defoe's ""Robinson Crusoe"", particularly the importance of the items that Crusoe salvaged from the shipwreck, items that Crusoe could not have made himself and which make his survival and the relative elegance of the life he built for himself quite plausible. The real-life inspiration for Crusoe was one Alexander Selkirk who, in 1704, choose to remain on one of the Juan Fernandez islands - four hundred miles from the Chilean coast - rather than continue on a voyage with a captain and on a ship he did not trust. Selkirk was left with bedding, a firelock rifle, some powder, bullets, tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, his mathematical instruments, and some books. Selkirk's four years on his own were a bit more austere than Crusoe's fictional life, in large measure because of his relatively meager stock of good quality tools. Selkirk also lost a lot of his social skills.<br/><br/>I was interested to see how Cast Away was going to solve the tool issues and how they would deal with a person living on his own for a long period of time. The solutions were simply marvelous: ice skates, volleyball, etc. Tom Hanks is superb in the role.<br/><br/>And as a bonus, the castaway's return home is a fascinating part of the story. The driveway scene between Hanks and Helen Hunt is very powerful and reminds me of the great Emma Thompson/Anthony Hopkins 'book' scene from ""Remains of the Day"". Highly recommended."
"pdjudd","8","237","314","8 April 2002"," Misunderstood
","I simply loved this film but was shocked by the bad reviews that people gave it. To this I say to them: You seriously misunderstood the meaning of it. Although I won't reveal any real details about the meaning because I think that you should try and understand it yourself. The movie was terrific and simply breathless the whole time.  I felt awestruck about how the life of one man could be so changed after an experience that Hanks went through.  I say that every element of the film was perfect.  And for those of you who hate Wilson, you have to understand about how human he really was to Chuck. I was amazed on how well this movie was made and think that everybody should have an experience that should cause you to take stock of your life.  I was so adamant to get this movie; I got it at 8:00 the day it was released.  I give it an 8/10.  Well done Robert"
"LebowskiT1000","10","102","136","14 October 2002"," Definitely worth a couple viewings.
","I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too sure if I liked it.  I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole.  I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around.  And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first.  But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say ""I love this film!!!""<br/><br/>When I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, ""Forrest Gump"").  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in ""Gladiator"", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook.  So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"Special-K88","Null","69","92","14 March 2002"," well-crafted and intriguing
","From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival. Hanks is a time-obsessed postal worker on a routine cargo transport. His life is forever changed after the plane crashes and he finds himself stranded all alone on an uncharted island. We're drawn into his long, arduous journey as he struggles not only to keep his sanity, but to stay alive so he can make it back to the love of his life (Hunt). A fascinating, believable, and thought-provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Tom Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows viewers to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. A small idea expanded into a one of a kind movie. ***½"
"SallyNabil","Null","39","52","27 July 2007"," a masterpiece for hanks and zemeckis
","it's not my first time to see this movie but it's been a long time since i last saw it, so i found myself, this time, pondering over the high spiritual meanings in this zemeckis masterpiece and decided to share my thoughts with you.<br/><br/>the idea that obsessed me after watching the movie is the spiritual aspect versus the physical one i.e spiritual loneliness versus physical/real one. the movie is inspired by Daniel Defoe's ""robinson Crusoe"", where the hero goes through a tough spiritual trial on an isolated island for 20 years, an experience which embodies the maxim of ""necessity is the mother of invention"".<br/><br/>tom hanks is an employee at Fed Ex, he goes on a business trip to deliver some parcels, unfortunately the plane crashes, he miraculously survives but is thrown on an isolated island for four years. on the island he begins to search for every means to survive both spiritual and physical death. he manages to make a house, a fishing net, to light fire and finally make a boat that would take to the middle of the sea where he can find rescue.<br/><br/>but the movie can't just be summarized in those few words it is the battle of man against the wildness of nature and the harshness of isolation. furthermore, it is man's journey inside himself, the hero discovered his abilities and re figured his true self when he was stuck in a situation where he can't find any hand. he was a strong person who didn't give up to the difficulties surrounding him everywhere. he rather managed to maintain hope, even if it is fake, find himself a source of consolation to overcome his loneliness and fill this void, emptiness, vacuum ...etc, he , thus, invented the character of ""wilson"", kept communicating with the picture of his beloved. i think,otherwise, he would have gone mad.<br/><br/>when hanks goes back to his comfortable,civil life and joins his old community i felt that, may be, he is more lonely than he was on the island, then come the final scene to confirm my feelings. he is standing all alone at a crossroad not knowing which direction to follow or who to go to.<br/><br/>Robert zemeckis did an excellent job in this unique movie. the shot sizes, the camera movement, the transitions, every visual element in the picture was perfect. the cinematography was also great especially the water scenes, the lighting was so convenient for the setting of the events.<br/><br/>on the other side, tom hanks controlled this movie from the beginning to the end; though he scarcely spoke throughout the movie his performance was outstanding in addition to the physical effort he exerted in many scenes. it was very intelligent to make him lose a lot of weight, since he stayed four years on the island eating only crabs and coconuts.<br/><br/>i remember the scene when hanks kept switching the lighter on and off several times after he came home, which sharply contrasts with the suffering he has gone through to light fire on the island. as for the final scene between Helen hunt and hanks, i found hunt so cold, just didn't like her.<br/><br/>to cut it short, the movie was a masterpiece"
"Stampsfightclub","7","49","69","12 October 2007"," A wonderfully silent drama with Hanks and Wilson spiritually sensational
","At the turn of the millennium technology started to get bigger and better. Films were starting to develop in a way that was never predicted, but so did the actors. After watching Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump 1994, I thought I had seen a true drama, but that was clearly only the beginning.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks (Big, Forrest Gump) stars in his Oscar nominated performance as Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex executive who is stranded on an isolated island after a thunderous plane crash.<br/><br/>When doing background research on this film, I was surprised to see that Russell Crowe had beaten Hanks to the Oscar in 2001. As good as Crowe was in Gladiator, I personally thought Hanks made the most sensational performance of his career here. Hanks' character Noland is truly remarkable. From being a comfortable and hard working executive at home with his long time girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt), to being an isolated figure in different circumstances. The change in character allows Hanks to express his full acting potential and dive deep within the soul of the character. It is a true battle of human intelligence and human power that Hanks does so well to give and some scenes really got to me, it is such a powerful role and does well to rival his other Oscar wins.<br/><br/>The text's semiotics are remarkably significant. Having left the wreckage of the plane with only a few supplies, Noland builds himself around what he can salvage and none is more recognizable, than Wilson. A silent volleyball, which was encoded into Cast Away so Hank's could use dialogue to express his traumatic emotions.<br/><br/>The plot is made exciting through various scenes. The plane crash is very dramatic and beautifully directed by Zemeckis and scenes shot on the island, when Hanks is alone and wandering what to do are silent and chilling, justifying the drama genre.<br/><br/>The beautiful island is contradicted by the drastic situation, a truly magnificent incentive.<br/><br/>The ending too is wonderful as it paves the way for many possibilities<br/><br/>a spellbinding film"
"Dario_Gino","9","14","18","18 September 2008"," Tomorrow the sun will rise...
","My only major beef I had with this movie was the way it was marketed. Thanks to the trailers and previews to the film, we knew that Chuck Noland would in fact be rescued from the island. However, even with that said, the previews didn't really spoil the movie. Though it would have made the message(s) that much more powerful if they didn't give that much of it away. Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland; A FedEx efficiency engineer who flies around the world at a moments notice to troubleshoot whatever problems the company is having at any given place. Helen Hunt plays his loving girlfriend / fiancé, Kelly, who is very understanding of Chuck Noland's plight. One day, just before Christmas, Chuck is called away to Malaysia. This is when Chuck Noland's life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane (most realistically) crashes into the ocean. As the only survivor, he washes up on shore of a small, isolated island in the south Pacific. This is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character. On the surface, Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to; He has a high paying job which he actually seems to enjoy on some level, and a girlfriend he is completely in love with. His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash. Now his life is turned upside down as he struggles to find the basic needs of survival. There are no cuts to the rescue efforts, no ""meanwhile, back in Memphis"" scenes. It's all Chuck on the island for the second act of the film. There are four basic needs of survival. Most people know about the first three: Food, Water and Shelter. Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need, which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls ""Wilson"". The acquisition of food, water and shelter are all epic struggles for Chuck Noland as we see him try to break open coconuts with rocks and make fire to cook crabs. We suffer with him as he does his own dental work. This goes on for four years... Finally, one day a piece of metal (from the plane?) washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape. He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island. He spends several days out on the ocean hoping to be rescued. Along the way, he losses his only friend of the last four years, Wilson, in a strange but very emotional scene. Shortly thereafter, on the brink of death from dehydration, he is rescued. In any other movie, this would be the happy ending. But this is not any other movie. Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life. And now he must find a way to move on with his. When he first arrived on the island, he only needed to find ways to physically survive, but now rescued, he needed to find ways how to emotionally survive in a world that moved on without him. The final scene, just before the credits roll, reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie. This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering, pain, or tragedy that someone may go through, their life will always be worth living. And it does so without invoking religion or astrology or any other kind of pseudoscience. This is a moral and spiritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another."
"ironhorse_iv","8","9","11","3 March 2015"," Don't even think of casting away this movie! This harrowing tale of survival deserves to be told.
","The movie tells the story of a Fed-Ex worker, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whom find himself, away from his normal life with his love one, Kelly (Helen Hunt) when his plane crash into the middle of pacific ocean and he washed up on a deserted island. Chuck has no choice, but to learn how to survive in the harsh environment, and find the courage to escape his island dwelling, when he's able to. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the structure of this film is divided into three parts: Chuck's life as a FedEx employee, the struggle to survive on the island, and the resolution with Chuck trying to regain his own life back and living with what has change. Each one has this 'show, don't tell', modality of storytelling. The movie doesn't have that much dialogue, which in my opinion works. This allows the beautiful, yet haunting visuals shots to tell most of the film's story. The way, the movie opens up with a quick POV montage shot of the package travelling the work, show how Chuck Noland's lives life under the punctuality of a running clock. The way, Director Robert Zemeckis shot the islands film in slow wide screen, show how hopeless and isolated Chuck really is, where time doesn't really matter anymore. I like how the movie moves from a very fast moving shot to shot pace in the beginning, to slow, near one location standstill. The movie has a lot of spiritual aspect of the film that makes this a great watch. Lots of symbolism like how the angel wings package serves as a McGuffin. It could symbolize an angel watching over him during this whole ordeal or how it shows that he must fly away from the island, and return back to normal home. Again, this could symbolizes, how much driven, he is at his job. It's really up to debate, what this item was really about or what's in it. Glad, they didn't use the deleted scene from the script that actually has Chuck open the box. It would had kill the movie for me. Another symbol is that of Wilson, the volleyball. The character was created by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. while researching island survival techniques in a beach in Mexico, in which this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. While, talking to a volleyball might seem weird on paper, it makes a lot of sense, as it show, how much people are willing to go for a sense of normal connection, when isolate from others. From a theatrical POV, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation. The movie really does makes a good job to it seem like Wilson, could be a person. In my opinion, he's the most famous inanimate object, put on film. It was heart-breaking, what happen to him, toward the end. Only Tom Hanks can make us feel something for a volleyball, and make it seem believably. In any lessor actor, this might come across as silly or boring. This movie is very engaging, because of him. Tom Hanks is a master of showing great range of emotion with his facial features and the way, he moves his body. You can tell, how much trauma, he went through, the way, he looks at things, or how he reacts. Not only that, Hanks went through, great stress to get his body ready for the role. Hanks gained 50 pounds during pre-production to make him look like a pudgy, middle-aged man. After a majority of the film was shot, production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his beard. He look like he had been living on the island for years. This was a very extreme weight lost, that might cause a lot of Tom Hank's health problems in later years. Hanks even was nominated for Best Actor that year for a Oscar. While, Helen Hunt isn't in the film, much. She did a great job as a supporting role. You really can tell, the struggle, she has, with trying to love Chuck, while also trying to move on. The film gives fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone. It's somewhat educational. I like how the movie begins and ends at crossroads. Two possible paths to an unknown future. It's all very symbolic. This movie has a lot of replay value. There are tons of little clever things that change into the timelines of the movie, you can only pick up on, if you watch it, a few times, such as how Chuck wears his shoes, during airplane flights, the irony of the dentist that cause him so much pain or the name of the ranch where the angel wing package came from. Then, there are those slight things, that foreshadow a lot of what will happen, later on the film such as seeing Chuck's sailing certification or the off comment mention of a tooth ache or the song 'Return to Sender' playing the background. While, the movie doesn't have that much music. Alan Silvestri's minimal score was beautiful to listen to, and good enough to win a Grammy Award in 2002. I like how he use nature sound effects to reinforce the feeling of isolation with his music. The weird product placement didn't really hurt the film. This film features a Fed-Ex cargo plane crashing in the Pacific Ocean, but it didn't hurt the company, as the film's success ensured help increased brand awareness. One thing that kinda did, hurt the film, is the trailer that really did spoiled too much. Seriously. Don't watch the trailer until you've seen the film. I like how the film, later helped developed the show, Lost. Overall: A great movie that showcase the triumph of the human spirit under harsh conditions. It's brutal, haunting and painful, yet compelling, enigmatic, & uplifting. This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again."
"DavidSim240183","10","16","22","13 July 2007"," When you haven't got anywhere, all you've got is nowhere
","Cast Away was Tom Hanks' second film with director Robert Zemeckis. The last time they collaborated was on the 1994 multi-Oscar winner Forrest Gump. I must admit I was never exactly a huge fan of Forrest Gump, despite being a great admirer of Zemeckis' work. It was a film that painted a rather naive portrait of America and its relationship with the common man. And the special effects (however impressive they might have been) were only a nifty selling-point to wow the Academy award winning crowd. One of the most commercially calculated and overrated films ever made.<br/><br/>Happily, Zemeckis seems to have learnt from his mistakes with Forrest Gump. Because Cast Away is a much more accomplished piece of storytelling. A fascinating portrayal of a man cut off from civilisation, and when he finally returns to it, he's just as shipwrecked. This is the type of film Tom Hanks should be winning Oscars for. Because the film rests entirely on his shoulders. And best of all, there's none of the false optimism that plagued Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>Hanks plays FedEx Express worker Chuck Noland. He is a man who lives and dies by the clock. Always on the go. One minute he's sorting out packaging schedules in Russia. The next he's delivering much needed vaccines in Malaysia. Its a hectic lifestyle, and one that doesn't leave a lot of time for a social life.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Chuck is in a happy relationship with girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt), even though she gets exasperated when they can't even finish a dinner date because his damn beeper goes off. And that's exactly what happens on Christmas Eve. After he's just proposed to Kelly, he's called away for a job. At the airport, he tells her ""I'll be right back."" Famous last words.<br/><br/>The plane he is on is caught in a storm, and dive-bombs into the ocean. Chuck survives in an inflatable life-raft, just barely, and is washed ashore on an island. Now all alone, Chuck must gather every resource at his disposal to survive. To make it through to the next day.<br/><br/>Cast Away is an outstanding film. One of the great survivalist tales you'll ever see. Robert Zemeckis' direction has never been so astute and intelligent. In fact for my money, Cast Away may be the best film yet to emerge from Zemeckis' mostly excellent body of work.<br/><br/>Before we even get to the island, there are the scenes of the plane crash and Chuck's valiant voyage in his rubber dinghy. The crash is a tour de force of action and effects work. Zemeckis shoots it in a series of frenzied camera angles and jolting close-ups. Its a startling scene, so affecting for its suddenness. And the scene where Chuck nearly gets shredded by an out of control engine turbine stays in the memory and doesn't easily fade.<br/><br/>Only for Zemeckis to outdo himself by staging the equally striking scenes of Chuck in his boat, caught in the ravages of a fierce thunderstorm. And its a brutal scene of frightening imagery. A scene of almost complete darkness, illuminated only by flashes of lightning, highlighting the tiny speck of Chuck and his boat on the vast ocean.<br/><br/>But its when we get to the island that Cast Away really opens up. Zemeckis' direction is clipped and concise. He never shows us more than what we need (and want) to see. The film goes through the motions of Chuck's trials and tribulations. But there's an almost terrifying immediacy to these scenes. Some of them are only about ten seconds in length. Little interconnected vignettes.<br/><br/>Chuck writing HELP in the sand. Shouting for help to no-one in particular. Spending his first night on the island surrounded by the sounds of crashing waves and bird-calls. Exploring the summit of the island. Gathering washed up FedEx packages for supplies. Cracking open a coconut (something that takes a very, very, very long time). Fishing. Sheltering in caves. Cutting himself. Bleeding. And the monumental feeling of ecstasy Chuck feels when he makes a fire for the first time.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks really turns in one of his finest performances here. Certainly his best since Big (another film he should have won an Oscar for). What makes his performance all the more impressive is its almost in complete silence. Which makes his isolation seem even more potent and poignant. And a little eerie too.<br/><br/>Zemeckis also comes up with an unusual method to draw upon Chuck's slowly unravelling mental state. A volleyball that washed ashore too. A volleyball Chuck names Wilson. It becomes like a character in the story. Its Chuck's only companion, and as he feels affection for this inanimate object, you'll find you will too.<br/><br/>Zemeckis constantly keeps coming up with grander and grander developments. None more shocking than when the film flashes forward four years and Chuck is much more lean and hardened by his experiences. Tom Hanks deserves some commendation for losing so much weight for the role.<br/><br/>And his method of escape is clever. Building a makeshift raft from timbers and using a portable toilet cover washed ashore as a sail, Chuck overcomes crashing waves and turbulent storms in his fragile craft to get home. The scene where he loses Wilson is a moment of surprising poignancy. Watching him float further and further away. Ultimately Chuck is saved. But the story doesn't end there.<br/><br/>Once Chuck is home safe and sound, he finds the world has moved on without him. Kelly has remarried, and Chuck is unsure of his place anymore. The ending is bravely not a happy one.

","Castaway is one of those classic movies that everyone must see. The plot is uncommon and it was very interesting. Tom Hanks played a great role as Chuck Noland. The fact that he had to face and understand the difference between life in the real world and living in an island with nobody else but a ball named Wilson, made the movie remarkable. Every second is mesmerizing and really made me wonder how scary and difficult it is if I were in Noland's position. This movie also contained love that played a main role to Noland's survival, which makes the audience to feel not as desperate to watch Noland getting lost with the power of love that brought him hope. Also the transition of time as Noland lived his different life being an outcast was really interesting. Not only by appearance, but also mental and behavior. It's a classic the everyone must watch. Tom Hanks played it really well. It also made me question his future fate as the movie goes on, telling about his journey and survival day by day. A very well done movie, it's definitely a story that everyone wants to hear about."

","Chuck Noland is a FedEx employee who lives his life as a workaholic, always working and missing many important dates, for the sadness of his girlfriend Kelly Frears. One Christmas night, when he needs to work, he becomes the only survivor of a harrowing plane crash.<br/><br/>Alone in an island, the poor Chuck needs to be creative and learn how to survive in the exotic place, having many difficulties and problems in the beginning with basic stuff, like how to make fire or drink water from the coconuts. Chuck stays in the island during 4 years, when he decides that his only option to not die in that place, is to try to scape.<br/><br/>I personally like this movie a lot. The cinematography is beautiful, and you can see that many of the scenes were shot in a natural habitat.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks by the way, is great as always: It is incredible how much weight he lose from the beginning of the movie to the end, and also his convincing dialogs with Wilson the Volleyball, as if he was speaking with a person. (Wilson, the ball, by the way, became an idol!

","This is a marvelous, heartwarming, engaging movie that features the genius of Tom Hanks. The film was neither too long or boring; it was just right. It might have been boring if it'd been anyone other than Hanks, but as usual, he melts into his role and delivers a riveting performance.<br/><br/>Kudos to Zemeckis also in capturing Hanks' ordeal on the island, from his weight loss to his desolation. This is one of the best ""Robinson Crusoe"" type adaptations I've seen.<br/><br/>And Hanks' journey back to civilization was so interesting and moving. He superbly played the part of the person who's struggling to find his place after being out of touch for five years! The scenes are so touching, especially his reunion with Hunt.<br/><br/>I was almost convinced this was based on an actual account, so much so I was looking to see the trailers at the end of the movie, saying ""Based on the real life account of..."" <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is one of the best character actors of his generation, right alongside of Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>As an aside, this is the only movie I've seen that's been a showcase of a corporate logo from beginning to end (and not a bad association, I might add), to which I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't produced by FedEx. ;-) <br/><br/>If you're looking for something more than the shallow and contrived dramatics of the reality series Survivor, or a movie without the standard pyrotechnics or other adrenalin boosting gimmicks, then this film will be well worth your time.<br/><br/>It's a human interest story, pure and simple.<br/><br/>I was so drawn in that when the movie ended, I really wanted to see what happens to Chuck in the new phase of his life, after meeting his next potential love interest at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>I guess that's left up to the imagination. Happily ever after. :-)<br/><br/>Enjoy a superb tour de force performance by Hanks."

","Cast Away stars Tom Hanks and, more importantly, a very special volleyball, a.k.a. my beloved Wilson. I love this movie because it's dramatic and inspiring but also because it's not utterly swamped down with swells of dramatic music. In fact, the whole time Hanks's character is on the island, there is no music, and this actually has a profound and unique effect. Don't get me wrong, I love a good soundtrack, but sometimes I think that there is definite overkill with music in scenes that don't necessarily need it.<br/><br/>I loved seeing the slow, forced transformation of Hanks's character throughout the movie. He went from sort of chubby, overworked and neglectful of his health to this hardened survivor with a huge, bushy beard. He even has to knock his own abscessed tooth out on his own, when back home he had the opportunity to go to the dentist and have painkillers and do it the ""easy"" way.<br/><br/>The only spot where some people feel this movie fell down was the ending, where Hanks's character makes it back to the US and his true love. But to be honest I think the ending was great. I don't believe it was an overdone Hollywood ending, and it also gave me hope for Hanks's character's future. It helps that he didn't get back with his love, because she had moved on with a family of her own. I actually found it quite wrenching.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this is a really well done movie. And I still love Wilson."

","Its such a shame that this movie would receive such bad press. The idea of just a man by himself on an island may seem boring and long-winded yet this movie isn't. It touches so many emotions, laughter, sadness, fear, tension. When released it was said to be one long advertisement for FedEx however this movie proves to be so much more than this. With a fantastic soundtrack, great storyline, great acting from Tom Hanks, this movie truly is something fantastic. Maybe a bit of a cliché, other than that the movie appears to be faultless and to find that it didn't make it onto the top 250 saddened me as the movie truly is something to be perhaps even considered a masterpiece."

","Jetting off on yet another important task, FedEx whizzer Chuck Noland leaves his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) behind just before Christmas. Disaster strikes during the flight and the plane crashes into the ocean. Managing to free himself from the sinking jet, Noland is washed up on an uninhabited island. Without basic modern comforts and fighting solitude daily, Noland must live in hope that one day he might be saved before he loses his mind or the will to live.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks (Noland) re-teams with director Robert Zemeckis after their hugely successful collaboration on 1994 awards stealer, Forrest Gump. Though Cast Away didn't win any awards (the usual cry of it being Oscar bait had preceded it) it can be argued to be Hanks' best performance. Few actors in the modern era could carry the film the way that Hanks does. Beguiling and drawing us into his loneliness, Hanks, with minimal dialogue (his only company being a volleyball that washed up with a few other FedEx parcels) excels with facial and bodily acting. Zemeckis, who should be applauded for the middle section and the terrifying plane crash that precedes it, puts Hanks' Noland through the mangler. The convenience of said parcels washing ashore aside, Noland is bumped bruised and dentally challenged, the Robinson Crusoe clichés exist of course, but Zemeckis and a heartfelt Hanks put us there on the island as well, with a pat on the back due for the excellent work by the sound department I might add.<br/><br/>Sadly Cast Away is bookended by not so great work. The opening character introductions are unremarkable but just about good enough for the plot set up, but the ending lacks emotional punch and defies what has been built up. Things aren't helped by Helen Hunt's lack of chemistry with Hanks, but that in turn is not helped by the writing from William Broyles Jr. since it's only really now that it's Noland that we care about. It's a bit churlish to complain too much though, because Zemeckis kept us on the island with Chuck, there was no cutting back to grieving family or fruitless rescue attempts. With that it was a truly fine one man show, even if that is something that ultimately renders the ending something of a let down. 7.5/10"

As Chuck stands in the middle of this isolated intersection, he finally gets it. He finally sees why life has given him a second chance.  He held on to three things while on the island.  A picture of Kelly, which gave him hope, Wilson, who gave him companionship, and one last Fed Ex package, which was his since of duty and purpose in the world he could not return to.  Wilson was lost in his attempt to rejoin the rest of the world, Kelly was lost in his absence, the package did save his life by providing that sense of purpose, which he followed through to the end, by taking it back to where it had shipped from four years earlier.  Only then, when this beautiful woman entered into his life did he realize that the sender of the package, not a picture of Kelly, represented his future.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","36","69","16 December 2006"," A Tom Hanks vehicle with Hanksisms, Hanky writing, Hanky melodrama
","Tom Hanks stars as time-obsessed FedEx executive Chuck Noland who literally lives by the clock, even when spending time with his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) during the holidays. On Christmas Eve his beeper calls him to catch a last-minute FedEx flight to Malasya for official business and he waves ""I'll be right back"" before he boards. Then his plane crashes in the Pacific and Chuck is indefinitely marooned on a desert island, with only a volleyball as his company.<br/><br/>I have huge affection for 'desert island' premises and subscribe to the thinking that whatever you do with the execution, it will still be a wonderful experience. It simply cannot go wrong. It does not go wrong in 'Cast Away' either  although I would have loved to see more exploration of the lush island jungle  in fact, its island sequences are all golden. The only problem this film has is the lachrymose final act in which Hanks fades and director Zemeckis pulls up the directing chair and starts pouring in relations-melodrama to sew things together.<br/><br/>Everything up until this rote lukewarm point is well-crafted with patient strokes, courtesy of the film's protagonist. Tom Hanks, who put forward the idea for the film to Forrest Gump-pal Zemeckis, is in nearly every scene and carries so much dramatic weight, effortless leading man appeal and sympathy-laden charisma that he sucks you in entirely. Initially I applied some skepticism to judging his businessman character and it was not until the vivid, epileptic plane crash sequence that he started to absorb me. As the airplane was sinking into the deep blue with Chuck trapped inside (I can't imagine anything more frightening), you knew, judging by how much you were pulling for him, that he was our hero. This is man vs. nature at its best.<br/><br/>Upon waking up on the beach of the stormy desert island, Chuck is faced with some of the weapons mother nature has in her arsenal: you can feel the energy being slowly drained out of him during the first couple of days as he struggles to crack coconuts, find water, build shelter, make fire, catch fish and tend to his wounds. Insanity sweeps across the shore and Hanks aptly embodies the hard-edged, blood-spilled, sweat-dripping, tear-shedding transformation of a time-driven businessman to a primitive instinct-driven maroon. It is eerily crafted with an harmonic silence and sans your dutiful MacGyveresque inventions, scaffolds or nifty tools. Here is a mere man, seen through epic aerial shots and with underlying subtitles that spell out ""desperation"" and ""loneliness"", both of which Hanks assuredly and crisply exemplifies.<br/><br/>So then, what is really wrong with 'Cast Away'? Nothing  aside from marginal missteps  is wrong with the cast away part, it's the ending that that is not in-tune once Zemeckis wields his clear-cut, spelled-out and moralist trademarks. I refuse to spoil anything (mostly because I remember the film having been spoiled to me long before I sat down to watch it), just rest assured you will be begging to be taken back to the exciting island.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","Castaway is a perfect Tom Hanks movie where he gets to showcase his skills as an actor. Robert Zemeckis has directed a new take on the Robinson Crusoe saga with a man marooned on an island with nothing more than his perseverance and patience. This may be an adventure film on the surface but there are underlying themes of loneliness, loss and isolation. Of course, there are some stupendous scenes, this being CGI obsessed (in a good way) Zemeckis. The plane crash is a highlight and different from what we have seen in other films and the island scenes with the waves are amazing. As mentioned above Hanks is so good you cannot picture anyone else in his role and his collaboration with the director keeps on flourishing (they also made the critically lauded Forrest Gump). Do not miss Castaway for anything."

CAST AWAY is one of his best performances - a tour-de-force one man show for most of the movies time on screen.<br/><br/>Hanks is Chuck Nolan, an executive official at FED EX, who seems to have everything going for him. He has a grueling but interesting and successful career in business, with many friends, and he is having a really hot and heavy romance with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), which is likely to end up in marriage. But he is sent on a business trip, like so many others, and the plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean. Although there were five men on the Fed Ex plane, only Hanks is lucky enough to get into a life raft with any supplies or provisions. Eventually he reaches a deserted island.<br/><br/>If you read the novel by Daniel DeFoe, Crusoe slowly builds upon his own knowledge of how to survive to make his island a fairly comfortable place to live on - despite the threats of cannibals. But DeFoe gave Crusoe one thing that Nolan does not get. DeFoe gives his survivor a companion: Friday. There is no loneliness on Crusoe's island. Nolan does not have such luck. He has to create even his companion: a volleyball with a painted face on it named ""Wilson"", whom he talks to when he is trying to do anything (and Nolan has to do everything, including rediscover fire).<br/><br/>It's a crushing situation, and leads to depression and some dark thoughts. But Nolan is one determined man - somehow he will get off that island, if for no other reason than that he wants to return to civilization, and best of all to Frears. It is the photograph of Frears that keeps Nolan's sanity together in that long, lonely vigil on the island.<br/><br/>So he finds a cave to live in in the island's rocks, to keep relatively warm and dry in the rain. He does rediscover fire. He does keep a fairly good track of time. He even performs (in one of the most grueling moments of the film) oral surgery on a painful tooth that you have to see to believe.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD: He does get off the island in the end - but finds his problems just as difficult to solve off the island as it was on the island."

","Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a top Fed-Ex manager, is a workaholic whose life is controlled by the clock. When Chuck accepts a last-minute job that interrupts his Christmas, he parts from his love, Kelly (Helen Hunt), to board a plane which ultimately crashes into the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor of this crash and is washed onto a deserted island. With only intuition and a few recovered packages, Chuck must learn to survive. His love for Kelly is the only thing which pulls him through this time, but when he is rescued four years later, he returns to civilization only to find that Kelly has moved on. With the love of his life taken away, he must now overcome his most difficult challenge: life without love. <br/><br/>In the film ""Cast Away"" (2000) director Robert Zemeckis depicts a great adventure of the hardships and tragedies that one man must face for survival. Zemeckis accomplishes a great feat through this movie. For over half of the 143-minute film, Tom Hanks performs with only a volleyball, ""Wilson,"" and somehow the film never ceases to entertain the audience. Aside from this achievement, Zemeckis successfully portrays his central idea of loss and return and the tragedies that accompany this. His idea is effectively depicted through Chuck's mood changes from desperation to optimism, from passive despair to aggressive hopefulness. In the end, his return is accompanied by the painful realization that he has been gone too long. The central message delivered to the audience is to appreciate life because it can change at any moment. <br/><br/>Zemeckis's intentions are also illustrated through sophisticated techniques. The most appealing technique of this film is its ability to attract both genders: females are attracted to Noland's motive for survival, and males are attracted to his techniques for survival. Camera techniques are also very important in this movie's appeal. The camera does not conceal imperfections; it actually strives to capture the unattractive moments to portray true ruggedness. To show Noland's frantic mentality, the camera moves quickly and restlessly. Another compelling technique is Hank's physical transformation. The production of ""Cast Away"" was halted for a year while Tom Hanks dieted to achieve his starved appearance. This along with the other techniques utilized make this film both compelling and entertaining to a wide variety of viewers."

","Although this movie is one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies, it still proves to be captivating and breathtaking.  First and foremost, Tom Hanks is once again brilliant, and should have won Best Actor.  Second, he and Zemeckis once again pair up for a brilliant director-actor tandem.  I love the way Zemeckis pays attention to particular details (i.e. the ocean, the night sky, like in ""Contact"").  I also think the end of this movie is unbelievable.  I'm kind of gullible and I usually don't get hidden messages, but this one was loud and clear: he reaches a crossroads in his life, and can do whatever he wants.  The two best parts of this movie are the ending and the music, majestically conducted by Alan Silvestri, who typically works with Zemeckis.  The music is beautiful and accentuates the action of the movie.  This may be the ""Tom Hanks Show"" for a good solid 2 hours, but it still conveys a powerful message: people may love, and lose, but they are still free to make independent choices."

I found that last 20-minute scene uncomfortable but maybe we were supposed to feel that way.

","Not to be confused with the movie ""Castaway"" 1986 - from the autobiographical book by Lucy Irvine about her 12 month contract with Gerald Kingsland to live with him on a deserted Pacific island.<br/><br/>** Spoilers herein **<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a laudable performance - especially as he made the effort to gain and lose a vast amount of weight to give a more accurate representation of his physical condition. However, the tooth extraction scene left me chuckling. The way he did it would have broken his jaw and he would probably have died from starvation as a consequence.<br/><br/>My main issue is with the character of Kelly - the fiancée. The time-line is that he disappeared for four years and upon his return finds her married to a smooth-talking, good-looking dentist with an infant of at least 6 months old to boot (you don't use a car seat for babies younger than that). Let's do some math. Fedex is a huge corporation - let's assume they would have continued search protocols for their Corporate Executive for at least 3 months after the crash (check out the extensive search patterns on Kelly's map). No one can be officially declared dead until 12 months after the date of their disappearance - and sometimes later. This would be when Kelly's family might start pressuring her to accept the fact that Chuck is never coming back and they would have held the memorial service. How soon would any woman who declares that ""You're the love of my life"" and ""I always knew you were alive"" submit to the advances of another man? Adding it all up, I calculate that the maximum time span Kelly waited before getting married was a mere 18 months (or thereabouts). Just how fickle is this woman? How soon would you get over the loss of the Love of Your Life - let alone marry on the rebound and have a kid? Check out the maps she has kept *on hand* in her kitchen. She kept the vehicle. She obviously still loved him. This is a jarring credibility error in the script and unfortunately ruined the whole movie for me. Now, if she had been recently married and several months pregnant - that would have been slightly more believable.<br/><br/>Up to that point I quite enjoyed the story - especially the food humour at his company's Welcome Home party. How thoughtless of the organizers to provide mounds of seafood (and so much of it is casually left behind) after he had almost starved on a tiny, deserted Pacific island."

"Byers","5","5","7","7 January 2001"," The Decline and Fall of ""Cast Away""
","""Cast Away"" has a brilliant performance from Tom Hanks, solid direction from Robert Zemeckis, and an intriguing plot from writer William Broyles.  The film quickly grows out of slow beginning to build to the fantastic island sequence, which leaves the audience hungry for the final climax.  Yet ""Cast Away"" squanders all these advantages and crashes in the last act.  Why did a movie with such potential self-destruct?  Some points:<br/><br/>1) Turning the film into a two hour FedEx commercial was disgraceful and unnecessary.  The family is eating Christmas dinner, and what do they talk about: FedEx!  Hanks and a friend are flying in a plane, and what do they talk about: FedEx!  Who greets Hanks upon his return to civilization: the president of FedEx!  The story would have been much better served with a fictional shipping company, which would have preserved key aspects of Hanks character but not insulted the intelligence of the audience.  People paid to see a movie, not a FedEx commercial.<br/><br/>2) The studio ad campaign, which made a super human effort to give away the ending of the film.  I don't know who was responsible for the second trailer, but I would advise studios not to hire them.<br/><br/>3) A poor screenplay from Broyles, who came up with a good idea but lacked the talent too properly execute it.  Top on the list is the failure of Tom Hanks' character to undergo any kind of change or growth: after suffering through a life altering adventure, he emerges as the exact same man as when he started.  He remains optimistic and cheerful, never displaying any anger or bitterness.  You would think that a man who was stranded on an island for four years and lost the love of his life would be at least a little upset or depressed.  And after spending these four years alone, living in the most primitive conditions, he needs no time to adjust to modern civilization, except that he doesn't like sleeping in his bed.  He also feels a need to apologize to everyone he meets for being marooned the island, something akin to apologizing for being hit by a drunk driver.  And the final scene with Helen Hunt looks more like it was written for a romantic comedy; in fact, that argument could be made for the entire final act, which is filled with site gags.<br/><br/>4) Casting Helen Hunt.  What a waste of talent.  She receives no billing (justifiably, see this is Tom Hanks' movie from beginning to end) and has a relatively small role.  Better for Hunt to devote her considerable abilities to a worthier project, and for Zemeckis to cast a less well known, up and coming actress that might surprise the audience.<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" is a movie in three parts: a decent (but slow moving) opener, a fantastic middle, and a disastrous end.  It's a movie that could have (and should have) been better.  On a scale of 1-10, with 5 being average and 10 being a masterpiece, I am forced to give ""Cast Away"" a 5, making ""Cast Away"" a discount theater or rental movie."

","i think this movie is the apitamy of a film that can draw out very deep emotions by just letting it happen... this movie is about the space in between the dialogue... When you are on an island all alone, for several years, you're forced to deal with the silence... or the noise of your thoughts... you're forced to be patient with yourself. This movie shows that and it also illustrates the relationship chuck (toms character) has with himself through the volleyball... this way we get to see what is going on inside of him... although it is still very plausible that someone would adopt such a friend in those circumstances. And at the end you really feel a sense of loss and vulnerability for chuck."
"nsmith-60127","10","7","11","3 May 2017"," Cast Away Review
","The film Cast Away centralizes its focus on a FedEx employee Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), who is the sole survivor of an airplane crash only to be stranded on an island that is drastically off-course. Throughout Chuck's extended stay on the deserted island he battles isolation, depravity, and the will to survive. After Chuck realizes he may never be found he battles the island both emotionally and physically in hopes of one day seeing his lover Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) again. Even though Chuck is faced with disparaging odds, he manages to accomplish great feats while maintaining his sense of humor and his drive to survive. <br/><br/>The major theme in the film is the importance of relationships. Throughout the film, this theme was repeatedly highlighted in various scenes. For instance, every night Chuck would fall asleep while staring at the pocket watch Kelly had given him with her photo in it, and in other scenes the camera would focus on the cave walls where he stayed, revealing the multiple pictures of Kelly's face that Chuck had drawn. Furthermore, as Chuck battles the crushing isolation of being helplessly alone his desperation for communication and a relationship begins to show when he begins to build companionship with a volleyball, that he names Wilson. <br/><br/>The bond between Chuck and Wilson becomes so strong that in a certain scene Chuck becomes angry at Wilson and throws him out of the cave only to rush out to the beach desperately trying to find him and apologize. Chuck's sanity wavers as the time on the island stretches longer and as his hope begins to fade; but with the help of his bond with Wilson, Chuck is able to talk through his struggles both physical and emotional, as Wilson seems to represent the rational side of Chuck's personality. Similar to the Life of Pi, Cast Away has a sense of dread and isolation that battle with the will of survival with metaphoric companions. <br/><br/>There are several techniques the director of Cast Away, Robert Zemeckis uses that amplify the feelings and settings in the film to its viewers. The camera angles that were used in multiple scenes were able to allow viewers to grasp the perils of Chuck's situation of being stranded on the island. In one scene the camera was angled downward as Chuck leaned over the edge to retrieve rope at the island's highest peak, this angle showed the danger of the task at hand for Chuck but also conveyed the intensity and tension of the moment. Another scene that used angling was when Chuck was attempting to start a fire again, the camera switched back and forth between Chuck's sweat covered face and the two pieces of wood he was using in his attempt to make an ember. With each shift between Chuck's face and the action of rubbing the sticks together the camera zoomed in closer on his face with each shot. This technique created a shared feeling of tension between the Chuck and the film viewers. <br/><br/>Another technique that was used was lighting, in many night scenes where Chuck was in the cave the screen was almost black and all that was view-able was the outline of Chucks face or body due to the faint moon beam the trickled in through the small opening at the top of the cave. In another scene, the cave was tinted with the glow of a fire that Chuck had created, as he uses the orange glow to view his swollen gums on the blade of an ice skate. Both dark scenes and even those lit by fire produce a feeling of solitude for the film viewer that instills the feeling of isolation. <br/><br/>Ultimately Cast Away is a story of never ending hope that is riddled with gut- wrenching scenes and depicts the human nature and its need for companionship and relationships. The old saying ""you never know what you have until its gone"" is amplified in this film as Chuck's love for Kelly never fades throughout his perilous journey."
"angelthomas","10","7","11","28 October 2012"," No Q&A here
","If you are looking for a life-lesson, this movie stubbornly refuses to teach you anything.<br/><br/>It modestly shows what you already know: You will give up almost anything just to live, because you're human and humans are survivalists.<br/><br/>It carefully hides what you normally look for in a life-lesson story: what makes life worthwhile? What reward is there for all the pain and toil you may have suffered in the name of survival? That's exactly why this movie could be most uplifting to watch AND AT SAME TIME brutally honest about the human situation.<br/><br/>There would always be some book, some authority, some self-appointed life coach along to show you: this is how life works, this is the meaning of life, this is the big answer; and it's almost inevitable you fall for those at some point. What normally happens is you try to live the way they tell you, fulfilling some goals failing most, finally become disappointed in their ""big answer"". Confused and cynical, you move on to the next stage of your life.<br/><br/>Yet you still struggle, you still try, for something you know absolutely nothing about, with no logical reasons to ever achieve anything. All the while, life beacons you on with mystery and you cannot help but to walk on.<br/><br/>This move is a commentary on life, on humans. Those who thought this movie is ""ambiguous"" are perhaps looking for a life ""Q&A"". I can assure you, you would find no answers here."
"esteban1747","8","7","11","5 June 2002"," A kind of modern Robinson Crusoe
","Tom Hanks once again performed very well his acting in this film. He certainly showed how difficult is the life for humans in areas where the so-called civilization did not yet arrive. At this point one should recall all what was taught at primary school to get fire, to feed himself, to sleep and to protect from rain and wind. He could not find any black Friday man as Crusoe did, instead he prepared a ball called Wilson as his only companion. Very strange that in that tropical island there were no mosquitoes or any other insects, at least he was not bothered by this problem, and the whale he found in the sea, was really very ""nice"", funny to see this sequence. What happened to his wife, who thought he died, may also happen to many other wives of soldiers going to war. In fact, she is still in love of his first man, and she married just to forget about him, but not because she was really completely in love of the new husband."
"donot_forget-remember_me","8","2","2","1 April 2009"," This movie couldn't be more dramatic..!!
","Cast Away is a 2000 film starring Tom Hanks. Hanks portrays a FedEx employee who is stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes on a flight over the South Pacific. The film depicts his attempts to survive on the island using remnants of his plane's cargo, as well as his eventual escape and return to society. A very well executed story. This is a silent movie obviously A guy won't speak to himself in a lost island. Its about his survival and his battle with nature. This movie couldn't be more dramatic. A very calm and incredible movie, which will take you to a completely different journey to an island. The authenticity and Outstanding plot was enough to made me attract towards such a movie. In terms of acting Tom hanks did an awesome job. No wonder he got nominated as the best actor. This volleyball part was very innovative. Wilson is the name given to the volleyball which plays the role of a mute, infinitely patient, non-living listener in the movie, providing Chuck with a companion for the 1,500 days he spends on the island. Overall a must see flick which is a hell of a ride. I will give it 8 ratings out of 10"

","Chuck Noland is a man who lives by the clock. Working for Federal Express he accounts for every second of his life and lives for efficiency. His Xmas 1995 dinner is interrupted when work calls him away to supervise a flight to Malaysia. He promises his girlfriend Kelly that he'll be right back. He doesn't realize he's making a promise he can't keep.<br/><br/>While passing over the Pacific his plane enters a storm and ditches into the ocean, very violently. Chuck is the only survivor of the flight and manages to escape into the water with a life raft, but loses the radio transmitter in the process. When morning breaks he discovers that he has washed-up on an uninhabited island. Rescue does not come, and Chuck must figure out how to survive while torturing himself with memories of Kelly.<br/><br/>In an annoying cop-out, the film then jumps to Four Years Later where Chuck has reverted to a cave-man appearance. He's not a happy man, but his outlook changes when a steel section of a port-a-john washes up on the beach. Using a analemma he has etched onto a cave wall, Chuck is STILL keeping track of time and plans an escape from the island using the sheet of steel as a sail for his rickety raft to freedom.<br/><br/>Cast Away (not Castaway) has lovely sound design and photography (why Zemeckis chose to shoot it in 1.85:1 is rather odd though, as many shots seem uncomfortably tight), and really immerses you in the threatening silence of the island. It actually reminds me a lot of the video game Myst in that respect. But the film is book-ended by boredom. The only part I ever really watch is the middle section on the island. Skipping over Chuck's 4-year transformation from mailman to caveman was bad enough, but once he eventually makes his escape from the island the movie skips over the 4-weeks of his reintroduction to society, which is yet another cop-out.<br/><br/>Zemeckis attempts far too much ambiguity with Cast Away. It's usually a sign of a writer/director attempting to cover-up failings with mystery, but Cast Away is a better script than that and it comes across as just being pretentious. The middle section of the film is intriguing. The non-island scenes haven't got a leg to stand on."
"Zwergs","5","9","17","2 June 2002"," **SPOILERS** Well-made but unsatisfying **SPOILERS**
","I had high expectations for this movie and really wanted to like it, since it contains many themes that I like in a movie. And it is well-made and cleverly-done.<br/><br/>But after seeing it, I am left unsatisfied. At the end, nobody is happier than they were at the beginning. Chuck's and Kelly's lives were turned upside down--he was in agony and lost four years of his life; she grieved for a long time and gave up her dreams--but for nothing.<br/><br/>By the end, I was searching for a reason for the movie, but instead there was an unclear ""open"" ending. The Texas character shown at the very start and the very end was written as a woman for some reason, but I don't know why. There's no hint that Chuck goes in her direction, and there was no reason for him to.<br/><br/>I found no message, moral, or lesson to this film. Not every movie has to have a point, but the best ones do. Yes, Chuck triumphed over the island, but if the movie was supposed to be just about that, the beginning and ending wouldn't have been included. And even the victory over being stranded is shallow considering the cost involved.<br/><br/>When it was over, I asked, ""Why did you tell me all of this?"""

It is very challenging for a single person to keep an audience engaged over the duration of the majority of a film, especially a long one. Hanks pulled it off and he makes it seem so effortless.<br/><br/>Hanks carried this film on his back, up a mountain, through a blizzard while being struck by lightening. That is just how awesome he is in this film. The writing is flawless. The location is perfect. <br/><br/>You gotta love the other star in this film, Wilson. Wilson had attitude and played his role well. Wilson took no guff and gave as good as he got. Bravo!<br/><br/>Hanks acting was so on the mark throughout this film, even if you didn't speak English and subtitles were not available, you'd still get the gist of every scene because Hanks was just that good.<br/><br/>

","A classic shipwreck tale that is flipped into a love story. This isn't just about surviving a deserted island with limited resources. No! It's about testing our limitations and capabilities, proving that even the faintest of glimpses of humanity still resides within us when all hope is lost. A FedEx employee travels on a plane, it crashes, he is washed ashore on a remote uncivilised island, he must survive. It sounds formulaic, uninteresting and all too familiar. Yet, the most overlooked director for the past few decades, manages to turn the simplest of plots into something much grander in scale. Time seems to be stationary for Chuck, who is marooned on this island for four years, however the rest of civilisation keeps on ticking. It doesn't hit you until the last thirty minutes where you suddenly become overwhelmed with emotion. You feel for him. You've witnessed him struggle for survival and even contemplate death. Only for the rest of the world to forget about him. It's a sad truth, but a poignant one. Chuck befriends a volleyball with a bloody hand print for a face, symbolising the need for social interaction. But more importantly, so that Chuck can shout ""WILSON!"" which, to me, is extremely satisfying. There is a really profound scene towards the end where Chuck walks around a buffet table looking at prepared crab and a lighter, things that we take for granted. Utterly resonating. So simple yet so powerful. Tom Hanks had a physically transformative role, although at times was slightly bland. Zemeckis' direction is the star. Easily one of his best directorial efforts. Love the camera angles at the beginning where it's conjoined with the FedEx post. I did find that the second act starts to lose steam, especially when we fast forward four years. I feel like some vital and pivotal moments were missed out. I wanted more Helen Hunt, just because I love her. However, Cast Away is another strong entry in Zemeckis' filmography and a decent acting performance from Hanks."

"TheLittleSongbird","10","3","4","23 June 2017"," Not a film to cast away...
","Quite the opposite. Admire both Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, and honestly feel that 'Cast Away' is among the best work of both. It is long and the opposite of feel good, but utterly riveting, thanks to the bold risk-taking and Hanks giving a performance for the ages.<br/><br/>'Cast Away' has been criticised by some for having an unsatisfying ending. It is understandable as to why it is polarising, and why it is seen as inconclusive and depressing to some wanting something happy. Count me in as somebody who found the ending incredibly powerful and who cannot fail to tear up. Have been picky about endings recently and the inconclusive nature didn't bother me that much and actually appreciated that it was more downbeat rather than happy, who to me would have felt a little too on the pat side.<br/><br/>There are so many great things about 'Cast Away' that help make it quite a superb film. Zemeckis' direction is some of his boldest, there are some courageous risks taken like his use of camera work and done in an ingenious way and not overdone. Even better is Hanks' one for the ages almost one-man show performance, sometimes not saying much but expressing a lot in a nuanced way. He is instrumental in making the island and his resilience in struggling to survive riveting viewing and he does so phenomenally.<br/><br/>It is a very well made film too, beautifully and cleverly photographed, atmospherically lit and with a lovingly created island setting. They blend so well with the film's tone and with its boldness. The score avoids from being overwrought, while there is a beautifully constructed script that provokes a lot of thought and wide range of emotions. While deliberately paced, the story is an engrossing one, with a excellently harrowing plane crash and the very telling section on the island that to me didn't drag at all even with events being a little on the slight side. Plus there aren't many times when you feel so much for a volleyball, you do here.<br/><br/>While the other characters aren't as well written or as interesting as Hanks', it is not in a way to bring down the film in any way. Helen Hunt makes a moving impression even with limited screen time, her meeting with Hanks one of the film's most powerful moments.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a powerful, bold and superbly acted, directed and made film that is moving without the audience being forced or manipulated into feeling so. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"zkonedog","10","3","4","11 March 2017"," Utilizes Multiple Genres And Nails Them All
","In 1985, director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre-diverse film of all-time with Back To The Future. Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane, washes ashore a deserted island, and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions.<br/><br/>The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action, adventure, disaster, comedy, and drama and, most importantly, make them all mesh together and work on the big screen. All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always-moving (I never quite understand why some people consider it ""slow) plot & character development.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart. The mental & physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!). It speaks volumes that, within 90 minutes, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.<br/><br/>Overall, I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away. It has a little something for everyone. Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks' crowning achievement, I personally enjoy this effort tenfold, as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent, dramatic narrative in the end. All in all, a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth."

The Robinson Crusoe aspect is slowly developed as Hanks employs what knowledge he has to do the rudimentary things that are required to survive. Crusoe has Friday; Hanks has Wilson. The despair that develops as one begins to realize that he may die, never seeing another human being or experiencing some tenderness, is so disturbing. When Hanks walks around, arms in the air, announcing to the world that he has made fire, it's a primitive conquest that seems so grand yet so minuscule. The final scene in the film is so gut wrenching. No man is an island but a part of a greater universe. I'm not speaking from a religious foundation but that which is within us."
"SnoopyStyle","7","3","4","3 January 2015"," Great one-man performance
","It's 1995. Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a FedEx systems analyst troubleshooting around the world. He is meticulous about time in his work. He comes home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) in Memphis but he's called away. Before he leaves, he gives Kelly a box with a ring and declares ""I'll be right back."" His plane goes off course in the storm and crashes in the Pacific Ocean. He gets marooned on a deserted island with some of the packages washing on shore. His only companion is a volleyball he names Wilson.<br/><br/>This is one of the best one-man performance ever. The story itself isn't as compelling as one assumes. It is a lot of wave sounds while Tom Hanks discovers survival techniques through trial and error. Wilson is a fascinating invention. It's interesting that Robert Zemeckis doesn't insert a voice for him. It actually works very well. The movie can drag at certain places but Hanks is always a fascinating watch."

","Cast Away is survivalist film starring Oscar award winner, Tom Hanks, that takes place on an island in the South Pacific after a disastrous plane crash. The main character ,Chuck Noland who is played by Hanks, works for the FedEx company shipping packages around the world. During a storm, Noland's plane goes down and he is stuck on an island fighting for survival. Far away from home and any form of society he starts to break-down emotionally and physically. The plot of this film is the strongest story I've ever seen captured on film. This is probably the only film that can make me feel distraught over a man losing a volleyball. Chuck is battling loneliness and depression while he is trying to survive. Hanks' performance makes the story come alive and really immerse you. The reality of the plane crash and the island was incredible. To further the ""realness"" of the film, they include Chuck's desperation to get home as he paddles in his deflated raft trying to get over the waves. The director and actor really worked together to show the emotion and desperation of this man Chuck Noland. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies. The cinematography is lacking a little bit as it uses elementary camera shots and angles. However, the literary element makes up for what the cinematics lack."

","Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a man that works for FedEx and travels around the world for the company. During Christmas dinner with his family, he gets a call to catch a plane for work. Something goes wrong with the plane on his way and it crashes into the ocean. The rest of the film shows how he tries to survive on the island he ends up on and him living without the love of his life, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt). <br/><br/>One of the major themes of the movie is survival. Chuck makes the most out of what he has to fend for himself and keep himself alive for the amount of time he is on the island. He makes a bow and arrow type of thing out of sticks to catch fish and crabs to eat, he made a fire with sticks to keep himself warm and to cook his food, and he used the blow up boat from the plane as shelter. <br/><br/>The camera crew did an amazing job showing Chuck's will to survive through the camera work. They used aerial shots to show how alone he was, close up shots to show the emotions he felt, and cut to shots during his conversations with Wilson to show that the volleyball was the only ""friend"" he had on the island. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks' portrayal of Chuck Noland is one of the best on- screen performances, in my opinion. He did an amazing job showing the desperation Chuck felt while he was alone on this island struggling to survive."
"alfredsmith","10","3","4","31 July 2014"," Tom Hanks is Incredible
","At the time of its release, this was Tom Hanks best effort yet. As he appears in nearly every frame, the film relies heavily on his screen presence and acting. Amazingly he pulls it off with considerable ease. I loved the narration and the way it was filmed, especially on the island. When it comes to realism, the plane crash was one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. <br/><br/>In western society we come to expect so many everyday comforts as the norm and living without them is both disconcerting and frustrating. The central character's daily frustrations and loneliness are well presented and we all felt great empathy with him throughout. Plus, having audience members nearly in tears over a basketball is no mean feat, but that's what happened. Everything worked well and the story was rewarding in so many ways, especially towards the end. I found this film difficult to fault, incredibly enjoyable and would recommend it to all without reservation."
"brett-donald","9","3","4","4 February 2014"," A masterpiece
","Entertaining, moving and powerful. A masterpiece of cinema. Few actors could carry a movie solo, as Tom Hanks essentially does here. We feel as if we are right there on the island with him, feeling the initial panic, the frustrations of getting food and making fire, counting the days, battling the loneliness, struggling to keep it together. And the emergency dental procedure, ow!<br/><br/>The length and pacing of the movie suits the subject matter brilliantly. Time passes slowly when you're marooned. So many movies rush their ending, leaving the climax right to the end, but this one does not, with over 30 minutes of it occurring after the rescue. The denouement deals with Chuck trying to find his place in society again, and the resolution of his relationship with Kelly."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","4","16 June 2013"," Must see survival film
","A film that would be nothing without a powerhouse actor like Tom Hanks. Let's see, this is a film where a single man gets stranded on a deserted island and most of the film's running time is nothing but him talking with himself. No big emotional speeches, barely no action, no real climax - the movie kind of just ends on a mystery, but in a good way - and very little dialogue compared to other recent movies. And it pulls it off, if only barely in certain parts.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the saving grace of this film. He is charismatic enough to fill the screen with his presence and is able to convey a lot of themes and emotions without talking, which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. Still, the deserted island part of this film is its weakest. I enjoyed both the beginning and the end a lot more than I did the part where he's just going through the known motions of surviving on a deserted island. Yes, some of that stuff is creative, like the reuse of skates for various tasks, and the ""character"" of Wilson adds a touch of both humour and drama into the scenes. Still, Hanks' character Chuck Noland is an interesting guy and he's opening speech at the beginning of the film easily both sets the character, arouses our interest and gives a lot of room for growth, not all of which gets explored. The island was an important lesson for him, but it was more of a necessary evil, if you ask me.<br/><br/>That being said, it's a strong movie. The film makers went the extra mile to give it nice little finishing touches that lift it above its peers and make it film worth watching. Definitely recommended."

"jack_orange_18","10","3","4","1 May 2011"," In my opinion, the best movie ever made.
","This is the movie that defines perfect. Every way I look at it, it's amazing. Now, if you don't think this movie is perfect, erase all of the thoughts you had about this movie before reading this, or else you'll probably disagree with many of the things I say.<br/><br/>This is my favourite film of all time. I love Tom Hanks, I love the location, I love the story, I love the camera-work, I love every aspect. I'll start off with Tom Hanks himself. Well, he sure says a lot without saying much. The emotions on his face are unbelievable realistic. Every breakdown Hank's character has seems real. He can also make the audience emotionally invested in a volleyball, now THAT'S good acting.<br/><br/>The camera-work is astounding. There are many shots that last much longer than the average take in a movie. At first they annoyed me, but now I love them. The pans that can take a minute long really add to the realism, and just lets you take in the situation the main character is in. The effects are pretty good too, sometimes the porta-potty sail looks kinda iffy, but for the most part it's solid. Zemeckis nailed it with how this film was put together, and the camera crew did amazing too. <br/><br/>The story comes off outlandish, but in the end seems realistic. I found that the chances of Noland actually surviving a plane crash and then stumbling upon an unoccupied island slim to none. But hey, at least it's not like Lost, where not only to they crash onto an island, but like 20 or so people survive. I absolutely adore the ending. It shows that the movie will take risks, and that it's willing to vary from the crowd. Some people might say this movie is depressing, but for me, it's a perfect balance. We see a whole bunch of sad and dramatic stuff, so when the happy, funny moments come around it makes them all the more enjoyable. <br/><br/>Finally, I will put all the stupid complaints to rest. A feature length FedEx commercial. Ya, right. Regardless if Zemeckis made a deal with FedEx or not, it makes the movie even more realistic. A real company makes it seem like it really happened or really could happen. Not to mention, why does it bug everyone so much? I didn't even notice how many times the name appears until I read someone complaining about it online. The next thing is the runtime. I'll admit, this movie is a bit long, and is not very convenient. When i saw this for the first time, it bugged me how long the events went on after Chuck is rescued, but now it makes sense to me. More story needed to be told. This wasn't just a survival movie. It's supposed to be more than that. A character study, as we look at the lengths someone will go to stay alive, and the effects that being taken away from civilization for a long time can have on a person and the people around him. And for everything else, you don't like Tom Hanks or the story, that's really just personal preference and I probably won't change your mind on that.<br/><br/>Well, I think Cast Away will always be my favourite movie, and for me, It's a dream come true. My favourite director and my favourite actor come together to make a masterpiece. It's Zemeckis' best movie (Forrest Gump is a close second) and Zemeckis has mastered the art of telling a good story. But, can you please stop with all those CGI movies? It was cool at first, but now it's getting old. Oh well, we've still got his early work, one of the best films ever made, and my favourite film of all time.<br/><br/>Cast Away 10/10"
"evanston_dad","8","3","4","13 July 2010"," Hanks Pulls Off What Not Just Any Actor Could
","I remember being fairly dismissive about ""Cast Away"" upon its initial release before I'd seen it. I wasn't thrilled with the direction Robert Zemeckis had gone as a director (""Forrest Gump"" anyone?) and I was just about Tom Hanks-ed out by the time he made this. But then I saw it, and found myself impressed by both the direction and more notably by Hanks' performance.<br/><br/>The difficulty of that performance should not be underestimated. Hanks plays a man stranded on a desert island and spends the vast majority of time alone on screen. Even if there are better actors than Hanks out there, it takes a certain kind of screen presence to pull that off, and Hanks has it. His Academy Award nomination was richly deserved.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"honorhorror","8","3","4","16 June 2010"," Culture Shock Series: Cast Away.
","There was an earthquake in Sino 1978, when the government decided to open the gate of the country and allow the free trade and economics. That marks the first wave of material renaissance in Far East. That's something you can easily check from any history books nowadays, but what you probably won't find in the books is the sentimental values of people at that time. When Sino people had their very first color TV, first Teddy bear, first turbo washing machine, they attached their feelings to them, only to find out there are far better quality of products out there waiting for them. Into the 1990s, they are all confused because there's no clearer boundary between good communism and bad capitalism. Former garbage and treasures now exchanged ID cards. Now in 2010s, despite one's denial of his/her lost status, we are all castaways.<br/><br/>The image Cast Away portrayed with Tom Hanks is quite simple, an everyday man was the sole survivor on a coral island, and the only friend he got was volleyball. People take an interest in seeing this movie for questioning our take-for-granted identity of human being, etc. However, the true controversy off the screen comes from the ever-clever product placement in it, that the storyline actually is one huge super commercial for Fed Ex, Wilson sports, and some other brands. Whoever wrote the script must be a genius. Yet, we as conscious, commercial-spoiled human beings are questioning something beyond Chuck Noland's humanity issues. That is, is there ever a point of rooting your sentimental values on mass-produced products? How about actually hug the values provided by your everyday Coke commercials and such? I am afraid no one will go to bed with a Wilson volleyball even after seeing Cast Away, but I am quite sure there are people who get frustrated when they find out half their life was devoted to something equally lifeless as Wilson.<br/><br/>My first guess is the value system everyone possesses in this world. Taking mine for example, my system told me the most valuable existence in my life was those time with my family, especially when I was only a child who's not ashamed asking for a hug every minutes. But, that's the answer I got when I was older and things can't be same ever again. When I was 18 years old, I had my favorite computer, Nintendo game console and my admission letter from a University. My value system told me at that time the most valuable in my life was again something from the past, the moment I celebrated my manhood with best friends, the family and hometown I am about to say goodbye to, etc. There can be many explanations to this stupidity. For me, it would be immaturity because I was a teenager at the time. However, the moment my father saw me off the way to the university at the train station, he also felt his life was pumped out into a vacuum after parting with me. For months and years this vacuum was choking him so harsh...... Another explanation would be an uneven value system. That we do not have multiple types of wealth that can balance out if one goes wrong. I graduated from finance major, so I personally like this explanation as it sounds slightly more scientific and economic. However, the dilemma presented to me again was like this: as an atheist, I accept ""we are here and now only"" values. But again, any reasonable, self-respected realists would end up in a paradox, that any wealth in the long run is perishable so there's no need to raise a family(remember you may end up like Chuck Noland that your wife accepted your death when you are just missing), there's no need either to plan for your living, etc. Then in a month or two, the wreckage of your consciousness and health would be warning that you are walking drunk and sleeping in death.<br/><br/>But you won't be that ignorant. Like Chuck Noland you will finally learn to pick yourself up and find something to behold. Luckier than Noland, besides volleyball we've got football, the world cup, Beckham's tattoo, NBA, and what we IMDb guys like the most, movies. You can even make a ranking list to value them like I did. I listed God as No.1, and that's predetermined because otherwise my pastor's going to have a serious conversation with me. Then, it didn't take very long for me to find out whatever was at No.2 in my authenticated value system tends to overthrow the God. Matthew 13:44: ""The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field."" It finally appeared to me that a value system I made that had God on the highest ranking doesn't work. Instead, a value system put into me by God would be beyond my reasoning. It asked me to put behind everything and accept him and him only. As a sinner, I have run away from this answer several times.<br/><br/>The enormous ocean washed up Chuck Noland. His passion, his 5 years of life, his family and every other thing possibly he owned in his value system. What proved to be waterproof in his heart was pain and loneliness. What would bring him salvation? I don't know because this is only a movie, a world conceived in people's mind, which may or may not have the concept of salvation at all. But I know his pain and loneliness can't be more real than ours. And, it doesn't seem like a value system dilemma to me anymore. It seems more like a dilemma of soul. On one side, it's the brooding and evolving sin, still escalating in the time-line, while on the other side is Holy Spirit's unchanged whispering prayers for us, echoing in the eternity."

","I once stated that due to Tom Hanks being such a great actor that a film could be made with him being the only character and it would still be great. This film prooves that theory.<br/><br/>Hanks stars as a fedex worker named Chuck. He gets stranded on an island and must survive there, the only possessions he has with him are a few fed ex boxes.<br/><br/>This is a great survival film. Stranded on an island with no help makes for a great conflict that someone can relate to as it could happen to anybody.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is phenomenal in this film. He really plays a man stranded on an island well. Shows all of the emotions needed; fear, panic, excitement, anger, and determination. I never thought that anyone could make a volleyball seem like a person but this film did that thanks to Hanks great acting. THis really could be his best performance, but he has so many and I think it is safe to say that he is one of the greatest actors who ever lived.<br/><br/>Zemeckis deserves a lot of credit too. THis film obviously had great directing and Zemeckis is a really under rated director in my opinion. Everything seemed perfectly right in this film.<br/><br/>Great conflict and legendary acting. Highly recommended and easily one of Tom Hanks's best films and that says a lot."
"g-bodyl","8","3","4","4 April 2009"," Interesting Film!
","Cast Away is not a bad movie as some of the negative reviews say. This is certainly not an ad for Fed-Ex. What this movie is is a serious piece of art by acclaimed film maker Robert Zemeckis that stars Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>This film is about Fed-Ex worker, Chuck who gets stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. That happens because his airplane crashed. Now, Chuck has to outwit nature in order to survive and come back home.<br/><br/>The acting is great. The only two well-known actors are Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Hanks did a phenomenal job.<br/><br/>I will admit that some things are incredulous and boring at the least. Some parts are slow especially during the island scenes. The scenes with the volleyball made me think, ""What the heck?"" The thing that gets this movie to work is the odds of surviving on a remote island no one have ever heard of. Overall, this is a basic survival film. I rate this film 8/10."
"mstytz","10","3","4","25 January 2009"," Excellent movie
","Sometimes a movie comes along that communicates on a level deeper and more meaningful than words or emotion can possibly express. This movie is one such movie. Its not merely a man vs nature, man vs himself, or man vs fate movie; its a monologue about life and its meaning. The things that are important, the things that steal away the times we should cherish, how little control we really have over our own lives, and hope. And, oddly enough, hope in the face of hopelessness is the one thing we can control, not all of the other things in life. Unless you have been alone, truly alone, this movie may not touch you at first, put after several watchings it will. And if you have been alone, you will understand Chuck's struggle almost from the first. Oddly, it has a lot of action, but all the action is in Chuck's mind and the struggles he must face at the start of the movie, while on the island, and when he returns. A classic that will, I think and hope, stand the test of time. Mr Hanks does a magnificent job, and conveys the turmoil and struggles of his character in a magnificent and understated way. He is the everyman of our time, and this movie once again demonstrates his vast reservoir of talent."

","spoiler alert? I really enjoyed this movie. It is amazing to think that Tom Hanks carried such a huge part of the film by himself. There wasn't even much music. during his time on the island, without much dialogue, he was amazing. Not too many actors could pull it off, I think.<br/><br/>In the last scene, after the girl drives off in the pickup with the dog in the back, Tom Hanks stands in the middle of the intersection staring, then the movie cuts away. What is he staring at, and what is he thinking. What did he decide to do? I can't quite figure out what he is thinking. Does he get an ""aha"" about what direction to take and why? Help!"
"Bumdark","8","3","4","23 December 2008"," A refreshing change of pace with a touching story
","'I'll be right back!' Such were the words shouted by Chuck Noland to his girlfriend Kelly Frears as he hurries off to catch his waiting plane. Little does he suspect how horribly ironic these words become once his tale is over.<br/><br/>In Robert Zemeckis' great 'Cast Away', Tom Hanks incarnates Chuck Noland, a highly-efficient FedEx executive whose life is mercilessly governed by the clock. He's in a relationship with Kelly Frears (the pretty Helen Hunt), yet their love is constantly postponed or halted by Chuck's unforgiving timetable. Soon he's called out on a business trip just before Christmas, and he and Kelly exchange some quick gifts: she gives him a pocket watch with her picture in the lid, and he gives her an engagement ring box, which she is to open on New Year's Day only  with him there with her. He then leaves and boards the plane.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, something goes terribly wrong during the flight (we never learn what, nor is it relevant) and the plane smashes somewhere into the Southern Pacific ocean. The crash scene, with all its technical and visual excitement, is the most terrifying and heart-pounding sequence of its kind I have ever seen. It's so sudden, so unexpected, and so realistic, that you can't help but feel nearly as shocked and horrified as Chuck himself as he sees clouds, and eventually waves, scream past the cockpit windows, coming ever closer  He is the only survivor, and soon he washes up on a large and eerily magnificent desert island, and a quick look-see confirms his worst fears: he's absolutely isolated in the middle of the ocean, and no-one knows where he is  or that he's even alive.<br/><br/>By then we're barely a quarter into the movie, and the pace, formerly so fast-paced and hurried, suddenly crashes to a halt. All time stands still on the island, itself unchanged for millions and millions of years; only the dull thuds and cracks of falling coconuts, or the occasional arriving flotsam, provide distraction to the new routine Chuck has to endure: survival without any electricity, food, water or equipment. Everything he uses, he improvises  sometimes with painful results, other times with triumph. A man who once lived by the pager and the timetable suddenly finds himself in a land where the very concept of 'time' is as alien as fish on Mars, and what he does to survive, both physically and mentally, is where the true storytelling power of the movie lies.<br/><br/>The movie is very slow-paced as we follow Chuck's attempts at staying alive, yet unlike most other times where I'd say this, for this movie, being slow is far from criticism; it's praise. The movie doesn't hurry through Chuck's exploits and actions just to 'get to the point'. The story takes its time to settle comfortably into its niche, and once it does, it's truly riveting, even though all we're really looking at is one man on an island, drinking coconut juice and suffering from a toothache without a dentist.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding, especially for Tom Hanks as the castaway in person; he supports the entire movie, and the audience gets to feel both his triumphs and his pains. One scene where he finally is able to light a large signal fire is surprisingly jovial and heartwarming as we see the desperate man jumping, ecstatic, around the burning flames, chanting and avoiding sparks. Other scenes truly make us feel terribly sorry for the man, but rather in resigned, compassionate way. For example, to stay sane, Chuck begins to speak to a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball, on which a smeared bloody handprint inadvertently created a vague face. Naming the ball 'Wilson', Chuck speaks to 'him' as thought they were old friends, and by then we're so in-tune with Chuck's desperation and loneliness we barely even realize the oddity of a grown man merrily conversating with a volleyball.<br/><br/>I naturally can't divulge what happens at the end, or if Chuck ever makes it off the island or not, but I can nonetheless comment on the fact that personally, I found it slightly disappointing. It was a logical ending to the tale (one you may already have guessed if you haven't seen the movie yet), but some parts of it seemed forced, even somewhat clichéd and corny at times. I also didn't understand some of what happened at the very end; perhaps it was too subtle for me. (But then, 'too' subtle would also be ground for criticism.) This is not a movie for viewers who expect action and flash, or for sufferers of short attention spans. For those who are able to take a break from their lives, which so often mirror Chuck Noland's in their pacing, this story will be a soothing and refreshing change of pace while it lasts, and will make a very good addition to any movie-lover's collection.<br/><br/>* * * * * For giving us a story with a refreshing change of pace, a lot of sentiment and depth, and some formidable acting, I award 'Cast Away' 8.5 friendly volleyballs out of 10."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","3","4","14 December 2008"," a very strong performance in a very strong film
","The idea of a drama about a lone person being stranded on an island has always fascinated me as a moviegoer. In real life, there have been many castaways such as the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who spent half a decade alone on a tiny island off the coast of South America when he was confident that his ship, under deplorable conditions, would not make it back to port. Selkirk was probably the basis for this movie Cast Away. No, it's not a true story, but it's manufactured so well that if somebody was to tell you that it was based on an autobiography, you would probably believe it.<br/><br/>Cast Away stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a busybody FedEx executive who's ""all about time"", who soon discovers he has all the time in the world when his plane crashes into the ocean and he, alone, finds himself on a deserted island where he ekes on the barest living possible. He improvises his own shelter, tools, companions, and accepts the fact that help may never arrive and if it ever does, it may be too late for him.<br/><br/>This is an exceedingly wonderful movie. Not only is Tom Hanks the quintessential choice to play a castaway, but he does his performance so well that you quickly forget that you're spending most of your time looking at a superstar instead of a character. And you have to admire Hanks for his nerve to play such a character. When he first arrives on the island, Hanks is a tad bit obese, cleanly-shave, and perhaps a bit unsightly. When we effectively cut to a scene that takes place four years after his marooning on the island, he's a gaunt, scrawny survivalist with shrunken muscles, exposed ribs, and a hardly recognizable face through all of the beard and overgrown hair. In order to achieve this, production was shut down on the film for a whole year so that Hanks could lose a tremendous amount of weight and fit the description mentioned in the script. Now you have to admire an actor for such an undertaking.<br/><br/>Cast Away was nominated for two Academy Awards after its release at the dawn of the century. One was for Hanks himself, the other was for the sound design and the sound, next to Hanks, is the most important element in the movie. The film clocks at two and a half hours in length and it's not until about seventy-five percent of the way through that we even so much as hear a click of music. The soundtrack is taken up by amplified sounds that heighten the feeling of a lonely place. The crashing of the waves, the howl of the wind, the grinding of wood against wood as Tom Hanks vainly tries to build a fire, the list goes on. Without such incredible sound design, I don't think the island scenes of Cast Away would have been half as effective. And it's because of these two important elements that the movie stays interesting rather than bogging down as one might expect. I mean, after all, you're spending a long time just watching a lone man struggle to survive on an island. And it's not like he's doing anything incredible like wrestling with savage beasts or running from cannibals or anything like that. Just an average, everyday man just worrying about whether or not he's going to live long enough to see home again.<br/><br/>Before I conclude my review, I want to give just one warning. It has nothing to do with the film itself, it has to do with the advertisements. I saw the movie before I saw the trailers or the ads. And good thing I did, because I soon found out that the ads spoiled the movie from beginning to end in just a few minutes, ruining any feeling of question or the height of our expectations and thus, spoiling the integrity of the film. In short, see the movie, then watch the trailers if you want. As for the film itself, it gets an enormous amount of recommendation from me."

Four years in an island... all by yourself... no one could have thought of anything like that. The best 'silent' actor in the movie was Wilson and his attachment to Chuck (Hanks).

","A movie of depth at many human levels, Cast Away was a unique film among the many of the great films of the 20th Century. And what a great film and story to start the 21st Century, this new Century that is certain to hold rapid change for the human endurance, as was the last. The main character, Chuck Noland lives in the fast lane, his life but a blur, representing a person who is but a cast away from family and life, a runner in a global world of change and commerce, with little time to ponder the important things in life, putting all the important things aside. But as fate would have it, Chuck Noland is cast away into another world, one of loneliness, and stripped to the bare essentials of life, in a quest for survival on a remote island, he is now a cast away from the civilization. Apart from the life he took for granted, and his love, he is stripped to the bare essentials, with only the slim hope that he might one day see his fiancé again, and not take everything for granted as he did before. With little chance of rescue, he carries the human quality of hope. Hope for rescue, and hope to see his fiancé and family once again, and this hope is granted through a sail, which starts him back towards a return to civilization.<br/><br/>But his human struggle was not over. Upon Chuck Noland's return he must again cast himself away from the love he once knew, and cast away a love he once knew, that carried him through all those years of loneliness. Once again, in the middle of all of modern civilization, Chuck Noland is again a cast away from the life he knew, and is alone again. But as fate would have it, he would find himself again with hope, as he struggles to return to the meaning of life. and like the winds that helped rescue him from that desolate island, he again finds hope in the emblem, an image of angels wings that had sustained his existence for a very long time. And in this moment, among the empty expanse of land, not ocean, he once again casts away his past, and must begin a new life, where time is not a master, having learned to enjoy life as it comes. It is this meaning that all humans must learn, or suffer being a cast away in the sea of humanity, in a world of sea of change.<br/><br/>A story perhaps, but maybe there is something more meaningful for all of us...and a lesson we could all learn easily."

Four years before Lost saw the light of day and one year before 9-11, Cast Away glows in retrospective as a chilling drama that foreshadowed things to come. However, the fact the film is followed with an optimistic note and has some truly moving sequences, gives us all hope there might still be a light at the end of the tunnel.

","I saw this film in the theater and had to buy it when it came out on VHF. I usually watch it once a year. The only reason I'm writing is because I have seen so many reviews that say it is uninteresting, slow and even confusing. I find it none of these and can't understand anyone coming to that conclusion. First: Tom Hanks, where is there a finer actor. Second: the story. Excitement from the start. Then as he lives his next four years you have to wonder how he can cope with the situation and what you could have down any differently. He beats the island not by luck but by his own ingenuity. Coming home to his fiancée can he fall back into the old life and live happily ever after or will there be problems? Can the problems be overcome? And what happens at the crossroad? Does he go to the farmhouse or on down the road? How can this film be considered uninteresting."

","""Cast Away"" tells the tale of a successful and much revered Federal Express Executive who's dynamic life takes a surreal turn after he is the sole survivor of a horrific plane crash into the ocean. The storyline pits a business savvy workhorse against the wrath of nature in a desperate attempt at survival.<br/><br/>At the core of the movie is a story of hope, survival, love, and faith. The movie explores the personal successes and failures of a white collar, high-powered Executive who's career and many aspects of his personal life are ruled by the clock. An unexpected and traumatic life-altering event removes Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks)from his regimented lifestyle bound by self-erected parameters, and deposits him smack-dab-in-the middle of a new life where he realizes that, ironically, he now has an abundance of his most treasured and precious resource-the resource of time.<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" is an excellent cinematic experience for viewers who have a strong sense of faith, spirituality, and perhaps even divine intervention. Throughout the film, Chuck faces obstacles and scenarios that make ""Survivor"" look like a walk in the park. Everywhere he turns he is seemingly subjected to tests of his mettle and intestinal fortitude. Watching Chuck navigate each experience, the viewer cannot help but explore his/her own circumstances and wonder if they have what it truly takes to survive if they were left to their own devices. Notwithstanding the physical challenges, one must ask themselves if he/she could overcome the emotional and psychological challenges.<br/><br/>Perhaps most importantly, I believe the premise of the movie is that you are only bound by your own parameters. You can survive just about any situation if you look deep down inside your core and pull out reserves you never knew you had. It also seems to teach you that you should never give up. However, if the situation is too much to handle and you have done your absolute best to survive, you may just get a little help from a divine source.<br/><br/>Powerful, emotional, gripping, exciting! Highly recommended!"

","I just had the unexpectedly strange and very moving experience of seeing CAST AWAY for the first time with a 39 year old male friend who is deeply traumatized because he is estranged from his pretty blonde wife and gorgeous young children. He lives in a coastal holiday resort; palm trees, hibiscus and mountain cliffs. His complete inability to previously express his agonizing emotional solitude whilst living here (in Australia) in paradise had him descend into sobbing heartbreak throughout in a way I have never previously witnessed. He kept exclaiming to the screen (and Hank's emotive performance and situation) ""This is ME, This is how I am feeling"" and for the first time in many years was able to melt, awash with emotional relief at being able to translate his feelings whilst watching the ordeal in play. It was an astonishing paralyzing experience for me to share with him and it has as of today (today!) allowed him to seek the help and professional guidance with a degree of confidence and heartfelt understanding previously unavailable to him. So I had a double feature! A real life human drama in the room with me, and the film itself! It all added to the experience of having someone alongside who was living CAST AWAY for real in his own heart and head. Maybe if you have a distressed friend unable to break into or out of the emotional knot caused by bereaved family loss, this film will allow a way forward. It worked for us. <br/><br/>any way.....<br/><br/>One has to hand it to Hanks though for a front and center performance that allows every man watching to see his everyman persona on show and apt in every movement and emotion. CAST AWAY is a magnificent looking film, in c/s and on a huge screen it must be astonishing; great plane disaster set pieces and tropical traps, hilarious and heartbreaking Robinson Crusoe level drama and photography and sound design worthy of Oscars. I was queasy about all the FedEx ""ads"" throughout but agreed in the end it was a great device. I especially liked the North By Northwest farm locale seen early and late in the film... and even the positive denouement allowing a realistic life pointer to be an acceptable ending. For a few moments there in the final act, I gripped the seat in apprehension hoping the schmaltz possible wasn't about to really happen. I would watch CAST AWAY again, in fact I want to and will start from the terrifying and spectacular plane crash through the excellent compelling Island sequences and exit with the ocean tanker in the background. CAST AWAY is a uniquely American film success, too long in the last act, and perfectly realized in all the island scenes by the irreplaceable Tom Hanks. I thank you and my pal is today able to move on as well. <br/><br/>Other similar theme movies worth seeing are: ""Man Friday"" (1975) with Peter O'Toole as Crusoe and Richard Roundtree as Man Friday, and the excellent LOST style telemovie made by Universal in 1969 called LOST FLIGHT which stars Anne Francis. (see my comments for that elsewhere).... and of course the best of the lot, the original version of LORD OF THE FLIES (1963)."
"ohwail","10","3","4","10 June 2006"," Outstanding. A MUST SEE!!
","I have to say I was utterly moved by this film. This is watching it for the second time after its first release almost six years ago, and I think it was better watching the second time. Tom Hanks was amazing in his role, especially when 80% of the movie is just him.<br/><br/>The whole story is an embodiment of struggle, hope and the will to survive, emotions every human being needs to experience. It seems that some people have under-rated this movie, I just don't think they understood the real message behind it. Wilson, even though just a volleyball, was a symbol of friendship, he helped chuck in his journey of loneliness. The part where chuck loses Wilson was so emotional; it actually made me cry, at that moment I forgot he was even a volleyball.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film then you're definitely missing out and if you didn't like it or at least appreciated it then you don't deserve to watch good movies like this. I just wish Hollywood brings out more good ones like this one. Great job Robert Zemeckis."

I was crying when he felt desperate or when he came back home. This movie is not that kind piece of art which is made by new method, some kind of art experiment, you know, this movie is not the revolution in film-making. But there are at least two things which make this title worth seeing. The first one is, as I mentioned before, the performance of Tom Hanks. It his very hard to write about it, it is just needed to be seen. The second reason why to watch Cast Away is the deep humanity of the story. I assure you, that your gonna think about it for a weeks.

I have rewatched this film over 10 times and I am still spotting new things.<br/><br/>To keep a film so interesting when 2/3rds is only one actor requires great craft. At no point in the film do we lose empathy for our character and there is always movement and growth. Most of all the film brings you into the main characters struggle.<br/><br/>By the end of the film you will be able to say, ""yes, I would have needed a friend like Wilson"" and ""yes, I will always be happier here than on a deserted island"".

"Wuchakk","6","4","6","11 October 2013"," One-of-a-kind type of film
","I went to see ""Cast Away"" in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like ""Mysterious Island"" (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, ""Cast Away"" was a surprise hit at the box office.<br/><br/>Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.<br/><br/>As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to ""Dick and Bettina"", but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end? <br/><br/>Like I said, ""Cast Away"" is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it. But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even... enlightening.<br/><br/>The film runs 143 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-/C+"

","CAST AWAY – 9.3/10 <br/><br/>Director: Robert Zemeckis<br/><br/>Writer: William Broyles Jr.<br/><br/>The greatness of a film is normally traced to the director; there are no two ways about that. We seldom know who the writer is and are even less curious as to who it might be. Cast Away is a case-in-point; it made me shout half way through the film – ""who the hell wrote this"" ? One of the finest stories of the 21st century, there is much more this film talks about than what it was given credit for. The director, Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump fame) needless to say has done a brilliant job, but what needs serious mention is the writer – William Broyles Jr.<br/><br/>The writer marooned himself for a week on an island to understand what people do in survival situations and consulted several survival experts. Cast Away deals with the very basics of human life; it pokes the viewer with questions we never ask ourselves. Or maybe the need to ask these questions never arise - Why are we here? The film has a strong existential undertone and Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee marooned on an island after a plane crash, has given one of the finest performances of his career. The film deals with the struggle of a man who must survive, for the sake of surviving. Chuck, after repeated attempts, has given up hope of returning to the civilized world, and after realizing he has no control even over the way he wishes to die, he simply lives on with the memory of his would-be-wife – Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt).<br/><br/>During the period when Broyles had marooned himself on an island, a ball came in with the tide and pop came the idea of the inanimate character – Wilson. Broyles highlights how a man is so helpless and no better than a rock, if his existence is not recognized by another. The character of Wilson has given the writer some creative liberty to make the film something not close to a silent film, and this stroke of genius mixed with some luck has been craftily used. The cinematography is commendable and the almost one sided conversations throughout the film are interwoven with hidden philosophies and memorable humor.<br/><br/>An emotional poetry of love, fate and belonging, Cast Away is a milestone in Hollywood cinema. To breathe so much life, meaning and humor into a subject so dark and tragic, needs pure genius. Chuck's longing for Kelly and his ultimate acceptance of his fate in the final scene between them is a timeless poem that will outlive the film's critics and lovers. Man needs to belong; that is the very crux of him. Don't forget this. This film won't let you."

","This film was interesting, however not as good as I was expecting. The film about what amounts to a delivery man in a plane crash and stuck on a desert island for a while is rather good. I just did not care for the run time after he is rescued as I thought it went on a bit to long after he was rescued. I went to the movie to see a man on an island and how he copes, I did not really want to see how his former wife could not wait a bit longer before she remarried (seriously a guy would be expected to wait twice as long before anyone pushed them to marry someone else I am betting the female here started getting prodded to get married again about two weeks after his disappearance). The story on the island was good though, the volleyball was a bit lame, I realize I am rather antisocial so the lack of people would not affect me as much as it would someone who loves people, but I still do not see talking to a volleyball as something that is going to be helpful. I liked the way at the start of his island life he kept getting hurt and had trouble eating and such and then it flashed forward and he is spearing fish and eating them raw. His escape plan is both brilliant and reckless at the same time. This film could have been really special had they cut a bit of time off the run time and got rid of the annoying wife."

I'm not sure many would have attempted this. But I think it is one of things that makes this picture unique and memorable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending is quite poignant. I don't often cry during movies, but the scene with Hanks and Hunt in the street in the rain had me balling my eyes out.</li></ul><br/><br/>One of the closing lines has always stuck with me: ""And I know what I have to do now.

"ghook","Null","9","19","9 October 2001"," Good movie. Full of Jungian archetypal images and symbols
","I saw the movie Cast Away and enjoyed it, not only for the fine acting by Tom Hanks (who doesn't need my praise) but for the thorough integration of Jungian psychological symbols throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The image of the island is an age-old symbol of alienation where the ego is `cast away' (note that the name of the movie separates the two words usually conjoined when referring to a person, but separated when referring to a physical state or in this case, a psychological state) and meant to engage in a task of self-discovery. Hanks does so throughout the rest of the movie. We see the character played by Hanks at the beginning of the movie, a slave to the clock - an executive of a company - a cog in a system. Who cares if it is Fed Ex as some of the other commentators have mentioned. So what? Would they feel better about the movie if the air courier service was named `No-Name Airlines'?<br/><br/>After the plane crashes he makes his way to the island where shortly afterwards he undertakes a symbolic burial of his old self or ego when he finds and buries the crew-member of the airplane. Then he descends into the island cave - an image of his unconscious where he encounters himself. Four years on the island. To any Jungian this is a quaternity symbol. Other Jungian images are apparent: the faint light he sees in the distance to which he tries to swim after on the island a short time - his goal that he is not ready to assume: the waves (his unconscious) push him back. Wilson, the basketball, a symbol of his self with whom he converses by why of psychological projection. The primitive paintings on the wall of the cave in which Hanks sleeps - reminiscent of the ancient wall paintings in France and Spain - all archetypal images of the collective unconscious. The whale which looks at Hanks after his release from the island - a symbol of the dynamic unconscious with which he has reconciled or rather integrated. Finally, the eagle wing symbol on the Fed Ex package - the symbol of the archetypal Self in Jung's psychology, the very place he seeks at the end of the movie and which he finally realizes at the very end while standing at the cross-roads. He has arrived at himself and integrated his life, no matter what direction he goes in, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>There are many other Jungian symbols in this very good movie. Some are very explicit while others are subtle. Think I'm over psychologizing this movie? Ask Semekis the director. I bet he has either undergone Jungian analysis or read an awful lot of Carl Jung himself. Those are my thoughts."

","What is so good about this film that critics and moviegoers alike insist that is deserves not only the praise it's getting, but Oscar nominations? I can only conclude that, sadly, it was such a poor overall year for quality films that we're all so desperate as to rate a below average movie much higher than it deserves.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that the story was nothing more than a dull, overlong, contrived piece that was supposed to be something about 'time', it was just bad filmmaking.  Frankly I think the little P.O.V. shot of the package near the beginning of the movie was one of the most annoying shots that I've seen in a long time.  Just what did that accomplish that a simple closeup of the package wouldn't have.  Follow the package in extreme CU if you must, but please, a package, nor the hand of the delivery man, has eyes for us to see through!  Unless for some reason there was supposed to be a camera strapped to the package.<br/><br/>Granted, there is some nice cinematography in the film as well, but it is overshadowed by the sheer lack of any real coherent storyline.  Someone else said it best - Tom Hanks gets stranded and suddenly he's a man without a brain.  FOUR YEARS???  It didn't cross his mind to build a boat before then? I hope I don't get stuck on an island with Chuck Noland, thank you.  Why all the silly gaps in time?  The film would have been much more interesting had we actually seen what he went through in order to survive for that long. (hmmm, think the screenwriter couldn't come up with much for him to do over the course of four years, and if he built a raft right away then the movie would be cut in half... so hey, just put in a long passage of time with a title card and everything is solved?)<br/><br/>It pains me to see a film like this getting so much praise.  Yes, it has been a bad year for movies, but there were some good ones too.  High Fidelity, Gladiator... heck, even Mission Impossible II was a better made film than Cast Away.  Here's hoping 2001 is better, so maybe audiences will start expecting a little more from their movies."

Zermeckis portrays a message in this film that if a person does not keep up with the world, the world will pass them up with out any thought.<br/><br/>Cast Away is a film which captures the audience with a story of love and nonstop adventure. It puts the audience in a place which can only be imagined. This is a very well acted film, because even after having only one person on the screen for over an hour and still it has the attention of the viewers. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who is interested, because even though it has heartbreak, it leaves us with a chance of hope."

","At the end of this film and found myself just saying 'why', why would anyone bother to make this film.  It didn't appear to cover any new ground; it wasn't a true story, so seemed rather pointless.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, and some of the cinematography was good, but there were some basic errors.  The whale scene was poor; the scene in Moscow was a joke.  If anyone has visited Red Square, it's behind a number of pedestrian areas and although, in special circumstance, can be access via road, why would you.  Oh, because, to show you're in Russia you have to have the backdrop of Red square.  The scene in question was impossible, so I assume it was computer generated.  The cliché scene with Helen Hunt was so Hollywood' it was a bit sad.  Not to mention that she didn't waste too much time getting married and having kids, he was only gone just over 4 years.<br/><br/>Overall, I didn't hate the film, it was a bit boring, but I just could see why anyone would be interested in such a poor, uninteresting story."

For that reason, 2-3 years of marriage with some dentist has nothing over the destiny that her and Chuck were meant to have. She should've left her new husband and gone back with Chuck. True love is true love and if you ever have a chance to be with the one true love of your life you should never give it up -- let alone after just 4 years. The movie is decent, but I HATE THE ENDING AND WILL ALWAYS HATE IT. Chuck deserved to have her back. Period. Post a counter argument if you want, it will be dismissed. I've made up my mind on this.<br/><br/>BUT OK... Well then, could destiny have something better in store for Chuck? Gee, the writer doesn't even ever let you find out.

"augurar","6","3","5","13 May 2012"," Flawed, but worth watching
","When I first saw this movie, I enjoyed it. But I had a nagging feeling that something was off. Upon reflection, I realized what the problem was: the movie is actually very poorly written. In fact, the only thing that saves it is Hanks's powerful, largely wordless depiction of a man struggling to survive in the harsh environment where he has been stranded. Everything else about the movie is pretty bad. Here are a few of the main flaws.<br/><br/>Poor dialog and characterization: The characters don't behave like real people, they behave like movie characters. A classic sign of an untalented writer. This is especially true of the main character, Chuck, who undergoes the largest amount of development. His character changes, but everything basically occurs offscreen. First we are presented with an exaggerated caricature of a work-obsessed businessman. Once he arrives at the island, we see him face some of the challenges of life away from civilization. Then four years later, we see the character transformed into a kind of Robinson Crusoe, toughened by years on the island, grimly determined to survive in his harsh environment. Finally, we see him back in society, pretty much the same as before but more subdued, having found new meaning in his life as a result of his isolation. This is all well and good, but the problem is that the movie doesn't really give insight into the nature of this transformation, it just tells us the results. There's not really a sense of gradual change, just ""before"" and ""after"" pictures.<br/><br/>This leads to the second major flaw, a poorly delivered message. The message itself -- that we should appreciate life, pursue the things that matter to us while we still can, remain open to new opportunities, and so on -- is a good one, though certainly one that we've all heard before. But the writer, in delivering this message, uses the same tactic of telling the viewer what to think rather than showing it naturally. The main character even has a monologue where he tells his friend (and the viewer) what he's learned from his time on the island. And the movie ends with a particularly blatant scene of the main character standing at a literal crossroads as he considers his future. The writer clearly thinks that viewers are idiots and won't understand the message without scenes like this. Give the viewers some credit! That kind of didacticism is both unnecessary and ineffective. It cheapens the message to the level of a greeting card or self-help book.<br/><br/>The third major problem is inept pacing. In an attempt to create a certain unity of action, the writer introduces us to all of the characters before the island part, then shows us them all again at the end. This isn't always a bad thing, but he spends far too long doing so. A more skilled writer could suggest all of this background with a few deft strokes. This writer, though, gets bogged down trying to show us all the details and tie up the loose ends. This is distracting and tedious, especially given the unrealistic dialog as I already mentioned. Also, it gives the movie a distinct sense of unevenness. Nothing really happens during the beginning and end scenes. The writer is just telling the viewer the setup (at the beginning) or telling the viewer the epilogue and delivering the moral (at the end). The result is that instead of a natural sequence of rising and falling action, we are given a kind of ""plot inselberg"" (in a double sense) in the middle surrounded by flat, rolling hills of boring exposition at the beginning and end.<br/><br/>Even with so many flaws, I'd still recommend this movie. Tom Hanks gives a truly gripping portrayal of a man almost completely cut off from society, forced to depend entirely on himself for survival. For best results, just fast forward until you see the main couple opening presents in the car, then turn off the movie after the scene with the cargo ship. The rest is just a waste of time."

","Contrived, overly pompous, predictable, and uncompelling is the best way to describe this overrated film. If you saw the previews for this film, there was really no need to see the movie. In the previews they showed:<br/><br/>A) Tom Hanks as a Fed Ex delivery guy who's girlfriend is Helen Hunt. B) Tom Hanks getting on a plane. C) The plane crashing. D) Hanks stranded on an island, so long he eventually grows a beard. E) Hanks saying he'd ""rather take his chances out there than die here"", as he floats away on a raft. F) Hanks making it back home. G) Hunt running out after him in the rain.<br/><br/>There were no surprises! And it's just so unmoving. He gets off the island and inside you're saying to yourself ""ok, so what?"". The moment after i saw the previews i knew it was gonna suck, but everyone was gonna love it and get all these award nominations just cause it was Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, and Rob Zemeckis. Notice the commercials pitched it with ""Zemeckis and Hanks team up for the first time since Forrest Gump!"" I'd heard the initial concept was Tom Hanks' idea too. That doesn't surprise me. The last time Hanks had an idea for a movie it came out as That Thing You Do!. A word of advice for Tom Hanks: Stick to what you're good at. That's ACTING. Leave the writing to the writers. Not that they got a good one at that for this film. The scenes with the ball and where he starts a fire were just so pompous and overly dramatic. God, i can just see them in the developement process for this film: ""Hey! let's give him a bad tooth in the beginning, so that way we can have him knock it out with an ice skate later!"". How freakin' contrived! The whole time i felt like i was watching a Kevin Costner movie. Self-righteous and absorbed. Basically this was a crap movie that was successful due to star power.

"cashbacher","10","2","3","6 November 2019"," The ultimate survivor
","Literally from the moment when humans began traveling the seas and oceans out of the sight of land, there have been tales of people being shipwrecked and marooned. Sometimes it is small groups of people on an uninhabited island, other times there are natives on the island and in a few cases, it is one person all alone. Different and more expanded versions of this story arose in science fiction after interplanetary travel became plausible. The recent hit movie ""The Martian"" is the best-known example of the lone person marooned.
This movie is one where a single person somehow manages to survive a destructive plane crash and wash up on the beach of an uninhabited tropical island. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Nolan, an engineer with FedEx that is a hard driving, yet somewhat personable individual. He is flying as a passenger in a company cargo jet when they encounter a violent storm and there is an onboard explosion of some kind.
Once on the island, Nolan needs to immediately satisfy his basic needs of food, water and shelter. He struggles to get a fire going, open a coconut and other basic tasks with no modern tools. Fortunately, a few packages from the plane wash up on the beach and he finds some useful items in them. After four years, he realizes that if he does not leave the island, he will die there alone and largely forgotten.
This movie is nearly all Tom Hanks and he does a superb job of playing the increasingly eccentric exile in an odd form of solitary confinement. In order to keep himself sane, he must go a little insane, inventing a semi-imaginary companion to talk to. It is a worthy addition to the story of how humans can adapt in the most strenuous of circumstances and with no hope of any assistance."

Picture composition is astonishing, I guess that's just nature untouched.
Tom Hanks did a hell of a job going through all of the emotions of the character with nothing but his eyes and body language, not only on the island but back home too.<br/><br/>It is to expect that poor movie goers will fall flat on the surface of the coconut and lack the patience and effort to crack it open and delight themselves with its heavenly waters. That is to say, to not see the island as a metaphor.
Isn't life an island, limited, physically?
Is Chuck crying for a ball or for a friend? Isn't a friend someone who is the object of our hopes and joys?<br/><br/>The lose-lose monologue he has drinking with a friend, talking about his former girlfriend is perhaps the moment the character's deeper understanding of life occurs.<br/><br/>There's also a very tasteful (for its subtleness) criticism to the run-market-money-global-news-no time to think-way of life (""the dream""). ""But it's a hell of an advertisement of FEx and Wilson!"" Is it not mocking them?<br/><br/>I also really like the end. ""Unknown this way. Unknown this way. Unknown this way. Home."""

"gimili3979","10","2","3","25 October 2018"," A movie classic called Cast Away, not Castaway
","Cast Away is about a Fed Ex executive who is involved in a plane crash and has to survive on a deserted island. From that description you might think this is a rather mundane movie with no plot and no story. It could not be further from the truth.<br/><br/>This, simply put, is a movie about time. It is a movie about the emotions that time evokes on any ordinary human being. But what makes this film a classic is what the late film critic Roger Ebert called suture. Suture is how much a movie, whether through acting, story, or soundtrack makes you feel just like the main character. You feel like you are in the movie and can relate to the characters and the story. Whether is it the deserted island, the romance, or the job you feel like Tom Hanks character, Chuck Noland.<br/><br/>The one aspect of director Robert Zemeckis films that I think are perfect are how he uses metaphor to tell the story. In this film, there is a beginning and an end. And they are both perfect and complement one another. It is hard to believe that a film can make the viewer relate to such a long period of time in 2 and a half hours. But Zemeckis does it with this movie just like he did it with an earlier classic called Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>There was one other aspect of this film that I realized myself and I wonder if others did too? If you type into a search for this film the word, Castaway, you will not find it. That is because the name of this film is actually Cast Away with a space. And to myself the meaning between the two titles is totally different. I think the hidden meaning is this: This is NOT a film about a castaway on a deserted island(like so many people think). It is a film about a guy, through some unavoidable event in his life, who is cast away by time and has to find himself all over again. The beginning and the end of this film made this point beautifully. This is a movie classic."

All important aspects is an average human life has been beautifully visualizes. Survival, friendship (Wilson), love, humility, and the importance of basic necessities in life. The music on top of this beauty makes your heart go even softer. This movie is a complete package and a absolute lesson to the new movie directors and a treat for movie lovers and critiques."

","A good film though, of course, a little bit humdrum since we are dealing with a rewriting of the famous Robinson Crusoe story financed by FedEx. Of course, our Robinson Crusoe has to have a Friday, and it is a volleyball with a bloody handprint on it.<br/><br/>It shows how resilient a man can be in any situation, even when he speaks of or caresses the idea of suicide. Life will call him back to resilience please and he will get some satisfaction. Here he twins his fate with his favorite hand-imprinted volleyball named Wilson, its brand name. The relation is close and he speaks to it all the time, to the point we could call it ""him"" as if it were a real boy.<br/><br/>He manages to conquer some fire, then to cook some food after breaking many coconuts. He survives like that for four years till the tide brings in some plastic contraption he is going to use as a sail for the raft he decides to build. He will stay lost on the vast Pacific Ocean for days, meet one curious whale and finally be picked by a container monster ship and reinstated in life by FedEx. His girlfriend has married in the meantime. He sure rediscovers her one night but that does not go beyond some preliminaries, at least we think so, though maybe . . . <br/><br/>The good ending will come from one FedEx package he had recuperated on his desert island and brought back with him but the film remains open on the suggestion that there is always a good ending to all stories around the corner if you are receptive to any extra-sensorial messages.<br/><br/>Enjoy the adventure and dream of what you could have done in such a situation.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

"colinmtech","7","2","3","30 April 2017"," Chuck was a time obsessed FedEx executive who was on his way to an assignment in Malaysia when his plane crashed somewhere over the Pacific during a raging storm.
","Cast Away was released in 2000 starring Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland. Chuck was a time obsessed FedEx executive who was on his way to an assignment in Malaysia when his plane crashed somewhere over the Pacific during a raging storm. As the only survivor, Chuck washed ashore on a desolate island. On this island, Chuck learns to survive after he finally realizes that no help will come for him. <br/><br/>The theme that Cast Away is based around is to never take things for granted. At the start of the film Chuck leaves behind the girl of his dreams because he's always chasing time. Little did Chuck know, when he boarded the Malaysian plane his schedule was about to clear up for the next four years. Chuck was driven to replace his relationship with a volleyball named Wilson, that this is when it was finally apparent to him what he lost. When Chuck finally escapes the island, and finds his way back home, the first thing he says to Kelly is that he should have never left that night. You could always tell how much Chuck regretted leaving her that night – on the island, one of his pass times was laying in the dark shining a flashlight on the portrait she gave him before he left. This is a perfect example of how they used lighting to show how Chuck was realizing what he's missing. He was hoping that she was still there waiting for him. <br/><br/>When Kelly found out that Chuck was alive, her world was turned upside down – everyone kept telling her that he was dead, they even had a funeral for him. Unfortunately for both, she ended up moving on and having a family with someone else – all because Chuck left that day and never returned.<br/><br/>The film Wall-E exemplifies a similar theme – having robots to clean up after the mess that humans made. The humans in the film kept taking the robots for granted, and never realized that they developed a dependency on them. This dependency lead the robots to become misguided all while the humans had no idea what was going on. To tie this together, Chuck is similar to the humans, he became dependent on keeping schedule and took granted that the one he loved will always be there waiting for him, and the robot captain is similar to Kelly, as she became misguided by others saying that he would not return to her."
"ronnietg","9","2","3","29 April 2017"," Tragic Romance/Drama/Adventure
","The sheer genius of this script has unfortunately been overlooked by many. First of all, this is indeed, a Romance genre, but it is more of Drama genre, with Adventure as the spine for the Desire Line. And further, this is Tragic Romance: Oh! What could have been! The Hero's Desire in the beginning of the story is to be a workaholic, and by the way, he's also getting married to a great girl. The script does not dwell on the Romance genre from the first few pages – Therefore, the audience doesn't have a vested interest in the Hero and his love interest despite the fact that their very meet-up is the Inciting Incident of the story. We also see, from the very first scene, the symbolic importance of ""time,"" which is ironic, as the Opening Story World is barren, empty, almost as if time has no beginning or end here – Very symbolic use of Story World for the writer. This ""time"" element portends for what lies ahead in Act 2, on a desert island where ""time"" no longer has any significance. The genius of writing this Story World is that man must find beauty no matter where he is: Noticing the stars, the flashing lights of the moon, the red/brown of the Tennessee clay, the clapboard houses set off in the setting sun, the isolation on an island that is barren, yet lush with vegetation. How difficult it is when man must survive and bleed and make mistakes as the Hero of this story does – All to survive, which is the new Desire Line beginning in Act 2. To write a Hero in an adventure/drama/romance story, the decision must be made as to which genre should be primary. In the case of Cast Away, the writer decided on Drama and Romance as the Designing Principle, and Adventure for the spine of the plot. The Hero's Desire is to find a way to survive and get rescued. The island is both his savior and his prison. He understands this, as time goes by. The photo of his great love is also his savior and his prison, as he knows he will probably never see her again. Adventure is a sub-plot of Action. However, this is not an Action story by any means. In Action genre, the Hero must think ""on his feet"" and engage in action at every turn. Honor is the driving force behind an action Hero. The elements of Drama override the Action genre here though – There is a very strong moral dilemma in Drama genre. The characters are intimate and the Opponent is also a known entity, as opposed to Myth, whereby the Hero encounters dragons and slays them, one after another. In Cast Away, the Hero says that he even tried to hang himself at one point, but true to form, after he tested the bough, it broke and even his attempt to kill himself was not in his power. The Premise of a story for film should include three elements: The Hero; the Inciting Incident; and the Hero's Desire line. So the Inciting Incident should have been the plane crash, if Adventure (sub-plot of Action) were the genre that took precedence. But the Inciting Incident is when the Hero and the love of his life meet up during the Christmas holiday, thus taking from the Hero a break in the concept of time that means so much to him in the beginning of his Character Arc. So the screenwriter made a very important decision: The Romance genre, key to the Designing Principle, is really the key to the plot of this story, as opposed to the Adventure/Action genre. But the Hero's Desire Line is in sync with the Adventure/Action genre. The fact that his Desire is also to be reunited with the love of his life is the moral dilemma that he has always faced for the better part of his life. So herein lies the genius of this story: Sometimes a love that keeps us alive might have to be given up due to life's circumstances. There is a story element called a Double Reversal in Romance genre: Both the Hero and his great love do a reversal from where they were emotionally in the beginning of the story. We see this in a very powerful way in Cast Away. Both characters have a moral epiphany and then a Self-Revelation that has most of us in tears because this is a cathartic experience for anyone who has ever loved and then lostThe genius of the writer was to have the FedEx employee whose wife was dying of cancer as the Hero's audience, while the Hero is telling in exposition before the Moral Epiphany and Climax scene what the Designing Principle of this story was really all about. About the use of Wilson, the volleyball, as a character: Obviously, to craft a story with a Hero on a desert island would be a challenge. Because in film, as opposed to novel, the audience needs to know what's in the character's mind- what his feelings are- his emotions, etc. So the Point of View Character, also called an Ally serves this purpose. The writer came up with the idea of Wilson, the volleyball, so the Hero would have someone to emote to and thereby express his feelings to the audience in a believable way. Again, the cathartic emotions we feel are that if we were stranded on a desert island and we had the ingenuity to craft a ""volleyball friend,"" we would absolutely do it!"

We get to peek into a tragedy situation comfortably from home, while Tom Hanks fights for his survival for us.<br/><br/>Our main character, Chuck, is a FedEx manager. He is extremely focused on getting his job done in a timely fashion. His job keeps him very busy due to his trips around the world. The film picks up right before Chuck is about to take another trip. While on the flight, Chuck awakes to turbulence. After a few minutes of struggling the plane crashes into the ocean. Chuck survives by hanging on to a life raft. He eventually loses consciousness and awakes on the shores of a remote island. He quickly finds that there are no other inhabitants of the island and that in order to survive; he is going to be pushed to his limits.<br/><br/>Cast Away explores many themes. Coping with loneliness and isolation is something that is hard to display in film but is shown beautifully throughout this film. The cinematography does an amazing job at getting these themes across. The film features very little dialogue, but you won't even notice it due to the very visually appealing sets. Long shots out towards the ocean and aerial shots of the island get the points across easily. Such a potentially dark premise is given a bit of light with lovable, comic-relief such as Wilson. <br/><br/>It is hard to find a drama that everyone in the family will enjoy equally. Cast Away is no exception. To get the point of the film across darker elements had to enter into the film such as suicide. This isn't the movie that you bring the whole family to, although mature children could handle it and most likely enjoy it. Cast Away receives a 9/10 from me due to the exciting premise and unique way of telling it."

","There's really a whole lot more to this than just Tom Hanks alone on an island. It works on a visceral level as a straightforward tale of survival amidst the harshest conditions imaginable, but underneath the surface there's all manner of allegorical goodness also at play. It's intense and powerful no matter how you choose to take it, though, and that's the sign of a real masterwork. That whole stack of cards teeters on Hanks's work in the central role, of course, and he flat-out crushes it. In a way, his whole career up to this point has been preparing him for this kind of an effort; I can see shreds of many of his earlier roles, alive in his gamut of expressions, as he slowly, grimly comes to terms with the fact that there's no form of rescue on the horizon. He's familiar but lost, a modern-day everyman denied his tool belt, stripped bare to the very core of his being. It's an all-world performance, easily among the best of his career, though it didn't quite draw the accolades that his turns in Philadelphia or Forrest Gump enjoyed. Behind the lens, Robert Zemeckis also hands in some of his best work. Experimenting with before-their-time camera angles and quick, effective snapshots of daily life on the island, he's able to evolve his craft without losing touch with his typically warm, lush brand of storytelling. And, needless to say, Cast Away's famous crash scene remains one of film's most historically intense, white-knuckle rides. I didn't realize I'd been holding my breath until it was all over. A fantastic picture that only stumbles in the payoff, lingering in the moment for longer than it really should, then momentarily giving in to its indulgent, romantic side."
"gwnightscream","7","2","3","10 July 2014"," ""Good Drama!""
","Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt star in Robert Zemeckis' 2000 drama. Hanks (Forrest Gump) plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee who tries to make time for everything. Hunt (As Good as It Gets) plays his girlfriend, Kelly Frears. Chuck wants to marry her, but he has business to attend to first and takes a flight to Malasia. Soon, his plane crashes on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean where he becomes stranded for 4 years with love and hope helping him to go on. Chuck learns that time stops for no one and things can instantly change. This is a good drama, Hanks is great in it as usual as well as Alan Silvestri's score. I recommend this."

","The greatest movie i have ever watched.<br/><br/>The struggle of tom hanks shown makes the movie forget. I liked Wilson the most in the film and tom hanks treats him as friend this concept is remarkable and that is the he does not tend to forget speaking as it has been long time 4 years. Planes crash looks like real.<br/><br/>The struggle shown for collecting food and water is amazing. The best scene in the movie is lighting fire. Finally he decides to move and build his own small ship to cross the huge ocean and he succeeds. Through out this journey he loses Wilson very emotional scene. Also he makes optimum use of parcels land with him at beach.<br/><br/>Great movie !!!"
"callanvass","9","2","3","25 February 2014"," A splendid film
","After a horrific plane crash, Chuck Noland is the only one left alive, marooned on an island with nobody but himself. He is forced to try to adapt to everything around him and conjure up courage he never thought he had. This is the second time I've seen this movie, and it was as good the second time around. This is a real character study that requires patience and your thinking cap to be activated. The slow build serves this movie well, but I'm not sure how much this movie will appeal to casual film goers. For true movie lovers it's a real treat. It's a very a powerful experience, despite being a tad overlong. Watching Chuck be disillusioned for so long, almost the point of going crazy was very gut wrenching to watch. I give credit to the writers and Tom Hanks himself for managing to be so sympathetic. This was a daunting role to portray and Hanks was up to the task. He must have been emotionally and physically exhausted after this movie was over. I have to imagine it was a tough movie to film. Helen Hunt is very solid, despite having limited screen time, she does play a pivotal part. The most cringe inducing moment for me is when Hanks is forced to resort to drastic measures, to get rid of an insufferable toothache. Anyone who's ever suffered from an excruciating toothache will probably look away. There a couple of scenes involving waves from the water that were harsh as well. The ending felt real and not contrived. I'm not gonna lie. This is one of those movies where I wanted a happy ending, simply because this movie is emotionally draining. It was a wise decision, but not exactly an ending I hoped for. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: What would you do if you were marooned on an island? would you be able to have the intestinal fortitude to not go crazy? I sure as hell wouldn't. Not only is this a triumph of the human spirit, it's great filmmaking. It shows us the stuff we tend to take for granted, such as water and living. It will make you think heavily<br/><br/>9/10"
"Laakbaar","9","2","3","19 February 2014"," Still entertaining after 14 years
","This is the kind of Hollywood movie I really like. I've seen it three times now, and after 14 years it is still hugely entertaining.<br/><br/>Hanks is fantastic here. This role was perfect for him, and he really gives it his all.<br/><br/>I suppose it's because I enjoy all castaway films; however, this is a particularly good one. Who hasn't dreamed of giving it all up and spending a long period on an island like this? To me, this movie is pure escapism. Unlike Chuck Noland, I'm sure I wouldn't need a Wilson.<br/><br/>The main star in this movie is not Hanks, but the island of Monuriki, Fiji. I really wonder whether there is any island like this left in the world anymore.<br/><br/>Has anyone been truly lost on a deserted island in recent years? Most castaways seem to be voluntary nowadays. Is something like this even possible in modern times? And aren't most beaches in the Pacific covered in garbage? We've already ruined it all, haven't we? <br/><br/>I suppose I could have done without the FedEx promotion. However, this didn't ruin the film for me.<br/><br/>I suppose it's all a metaphor for a harsh, uncaring universe. Sh*t happens, and when it does you have to get off your a*s, stop blaming the world, and make the best of it.<br/><br/>This movie could not have gone wrong with Zemeckis at the helm, Broyles as the writer, and Hanks in the main role. Kudos to them all for this great movie. It's worth about 8.5. I can't decide whether to give an 8 or 9, but for now I'll round it up. I think of this as one of my favourite movies."

","The commitment to create a marvel does not stop with the director, it sure goes a long way than that. This movie sure proves the point and when you look at Tom Hanks in the start of the movie and then on after the mishap, the physical transformation and the commitment to make this movie work from the actor is commendable.<br/><br/>Creating a story out of delicate issues such a plane crash with a legit company name (FedEx), we are aware there will not be any heroism or any racy sequences which is a selling point for a commercial potboiler. But if the creators can compromise on the fact the movie can be rated ""Documentary"" then a real-life event can be adapted. But this movie is neither a documentary nor it has stupid goose chases. Still wins in every aspect of movie making and the credit goes to the director's mammoth effort and enacting it on the screen by Hero.<br/><br/>Many movies had limited characters with which the movie churns its story, here it has been limited to ONE. All over the movie you see Tom Hanks, except for the start and the end. Being a authoritative FedEx employee Tom hanks has sure got the grit to survive the ordeal and head back home from a deserted island<br/><br/>In such movies the end is always predictable, the hero lives to tell the tale, else how could we even recreate his suffering. Despite this fact the creators gives a gripping experience of his daily survival. Effective utilization of the resource, logic for his actions and the pain, agony that the character goes through everyday are the selling point of this epic.<br/><br/>There has been very little use for special effects team, but for the limited usage they have done a exceptional job. The wreck is sure looks real and whole incident is eye catching. If you look at it from point of a critic, i am sure they would come up with flaws, but from a common man point of view, this movie is success in every way and shouldn't be missed!!"

Everyone should always be aware that Life can turn upside down at any point of time.

You very quickly get involved in the story and you find that you actually care about this man stranded on this island. You really want him to survive and get back to the woman he loves; and you feel his pain when things don't go quite right. It's quite emotional and can be quite harrowing in places.

"The-Stalingraduates-review","7","2","3","30 September 2012"," good, but not as good as i remember
","when i was a child, i really liked this film, being one of my favourites for a long time. i finally watched it again a few days ago, and I'm sad to say, its not as good as i remember it.<br/><br/>granted it is still a good film, a very decent one. Hanks carries the role very well, never for a second giving you the impression that hes just acting, he makes you believe he's there, making him the soul of this film. his interaction with Wilson is believable and well done, creating this sort of one sided relationship that battles the loneliness of the island, keeping him going. another device used to keep him going is a package. some packages float ashore from the plane crash, and he opens most of them except one, a package with wings on, which he is determined to deliver. it keeps in with his character and makes him all the more believable to watch.<br/><br/>the thing is though, it always seems to be when its just Hanks on screen that the movie becomes really strong. I liked the part towards the end where hes now off the island. he has new shoes, he has ice, all the food at the party, the lighter, all these things that he never had for those 4 years are just there, and it makes him appreciate them more. its the little things that you take for granted is part of the message and its done really well.<br/><br/>one thing that did annoy me on the island though is the pacing. it felt rushed, some scenes barely lasting a minute, not giving you enough time to let it sink in. if zemeckis had cut some shorter scenes out, allowing more time for more meaningful scenes i would have liked it more. He gets the loneliness right, but it all goes by a bit quickly, not giving you the feeling of the long amount of time he spent on the island<br/><br/>when other people are on screen how ever, the film seems to be at fault. its nothing bad, it just loses its strength, particularly the end. i felt quite empty at the forced whimsical ending zemeckis played. it ruins the films a little and loses some of good it had been building up. the ending of Hanks relationship with his wife was played well to start with, but falls flat as it progress'.<br/><br/>overall its still a great film, the acting is solid, the story is well done and sad at times, but is spoilt by certain elements, mainly the forced ending and side characters. its a strong film with a few cracks in but i would still recommend it. it just saddens me that it wasn't as good as i remembered it."
"MovieGuy109","8","2","3","29 October 2011"," Worthwhile for Hanks's performance
","Filmmaker Robert Zemeckis has stylishly and artistically made an impact on pop culture with his unique movies. Cast Away is one of those films that made an impact of cultural substance. Tom Hanks gives a great performance as the central character and only Hanks could make him so likable. Hanks's strong, moving performance keeps us from losing attention in the story, however preposterous it may be. The movie is overlong and flawed, but it has great moments of seriocomedy and melodrama. Zemeckis does manage to give us insights into isolation and half-insanity with masterful results. Hanks fans should love it, despite all the flaws in realism that Zemeckis does mange to redeem through his solid storytelling."
"michaelthompsonmcgill","10","2","3","22 March 2011"," A friend called Wilson.
","For me, this movie summed up much more that Tom Hanks being alone on a desert Island after a plane crash.<br/><br/>This film hit home real loneliness in the shape of a ball with a face painted on, to give Tom Hanks' character someone to talk to, and the efforts Tom Hanks goes to, to retrieve his ball friend, Wilson, when it gets knocked off Tom Hanks' raft during an escape from the island, will make you weep.<br/><br/>Because deep downside we all know what it's like to feel lonely, even among friends we can feel lonely, because we are largely a pretentious society, living purely on the outside, letting our friends see just what we want them to see. We do take each other for granted.<br/><br/>When Tom Hanks finds this ball among shipwrecked goods, he inflates it and paints a face in red on it, and whilst on this island, Wilson, is his only friend, starring at him with a smiling face from a Rock Hanks has placed him on.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the relationship between Tom Hanks' character, and his desperate need to create a friend, and talk to it, and even argue with it, more moving than the actual picture.<br/><br/>Disaaster movies are two- a penny in Hollywood, even when the relationships have been built up, so we all have someone to root for, to care about. But Tom Hanks, and his friend Wilson, beat the lot of them.<br/><br/>I will finish by telling you this, in the raft incident, and Tom Hanks loses Wilson to the sea and it's current, you will feel for Tom Hanks, if you don't, you just ain't human."

Wilson was a great actor as well (hah), I've never felt so emotional over something like Wilson.<br/><br/>Cast Away isn't only about survival, it's about so much more, and it's truly inspirational.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film because of whatever reason (especially because it's a bit long) then you need to rethink your decision.

The story is simple,it is about how Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks),a FedEx employee becomes a castaway in a island after a terrible plane crash in the ocean,is left to fend for himself. The rest is how he survives the island and finally comes out of it.<br/><br/>The locations are exotic and the story is wonderfully executed. As for the Special Effects,it's amazing.<br/><br/>The movie,like Forrest Gump,The Shawshank Redemption,Its A Wonderful Life speaks about hope,courage,survival and in short about the strange twist and turns of fate.Frame by Frame,the movie reminds you of Robinson Crusoe but, then you realize that even a common man can become a Crusoe,if he wants to get back to his world,his family,his love.<br/><br/>On the acting front,the movies,in its entirety belongs to Tom Hanks,Helen Hunt does her part well,but the rest of the cast come only for a while in the beginning and in the end.Its a Tom Hanks show all the way.<br/><br/>While I can't call it a masterpiece,the movie is definitely worth to be watched a few times.<br/><br/>Thank You for reading"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","2","3","15 June 2010"," Cast Away is a good movie
","One thing I talk to my friends about is star power in an actor, can an actor carry a film by him or herself? I explain that it's actually a rarity that we find an actor who can keep your interest for an entire film and also have massive appeal. Tom Hanks is one of those rarities, if it wasn't already proved enough with Philadelphia or Forrest Gump, it's proved with Cast Away that he can not only carry a film but keep you interested in the story and character as well. Cast Away is a film that takes chances because this could have been a total flop or a very boring movie. After all, being ship wrecked onto an island is not a new story. The reason it took me so long to see this film is because I thought it would be tedious and most people I know that saw it said it was just an alright film. Now I don't think this is the film of 2000, but it definitely ranks up with one of the strongest performances of the decade. Not having any dialog for most of the film, Tom Hanks keeps your interest as we see this tragic character trying to hang on to any inch of his live and survive hoping to come back home to his true love.<br/><br/>Chuck Noland is a time-obsessed FedEx systems analyst, who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He is in a relationship with Kelly. Although the couple wants to get married, Chuck's busy schedule interferes with their relationship. A Christmas with relatives is interrupted by Chuck being summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. Flying through a violent storm over the southern Pacific Ocean, Chuck's airplane crashes into the ocean, making him the only survivor among five. He clings onto the life-raft as it floats all night in the storm before being washed up on an island. Chuck initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life-raft, but he cannot pass the powerful surf. He searches for food, water, shelter, and opens the FedEx packages washed up ashore, including a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball. A short time later he draws a face on the ball, naming it ""Wilson"" and begins talking to it as if it was a person. Four years later Chuck is dramatically thinner and bearded with longer hair and wearing a loincloth. Finally deciding that it's now or never, he'll never be rescued so he'll do whatever he can to get off the island or die trying.<br/><br/>This was a hard movie to get through because you know it wasn't going to be a typical story. If Tom Hanks gets home, what is everyone supposed to do or how do they even act around him when they thought he was dead? As he's gone through an amazing transformation himself through this journey. Of course everyone has made fun of Wilson the volleyball, honestly I was expecting it to be stupid because of all the parodies that have been done on it. It was possibly one of the most honest characters I had ever seen, after 4 years on an island by yourself, to keep yourself from going insane, you would talk to anything. Who doesn't have that moment where they just need to hear their voices? The film is very well made and Tom Hanks is a tour-de-force actor who takes risks and they usually pay off. He made his character very real, sad, funny, and sympathetic. How could anyone not like Cast Away? I would recommend this for the film lovers because obviously for those who do not like this film don't seem to have a passion for the actor's performance or seeing the message in movies. Cast Away was a wonderful movie and Tom Hanks should be proud, this is one of the finest performances in cinema history.<br/><br/>8/10"

"Gunn","10","2","3","17 May 2009"," What a Magnificent Adventure!
","I have to admit that I had made up my mind I was not going to like this movie. I'd heard enough about Tom Hanks' two Oscars and actually hated ""Forest Gump"". At the time I thought Tom Hanks was way over-rated. I left the theater feeling bored and that ""Cast Away"" was too long. Eventually I bought the DVD and I can't say why, but on viewing it I did a complete 360. I loved it! On subsequent viewings I realized it was a masterpiece and Tom Hanks is one of the major reasons why. He makes this adventure work from opening frame to the end. Someone here said this movie was depressing and if that's the case, so is life! Life does not always go as planned and this movie illustrates that with perfection. In a single moment one's whole life can change due to circumstance. Cast Away (not Castaway) is life affirming. We struggle to survive crisis, we do not give up. Things always work out if you give them a chance. I won't go into the plot, but rather would like to pick up on some of the film's interesting moments, some with unanswered questions. The film opens with an attractive female receiving and returning Fed-Ex packages. At the end Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) returns to deliver the only Fed-Ex package he saved but didn't open. The film ends with him pondering. Pondering what? Going back to talk to the girl? Wondering where he goes from here? I guess we choose the ending. Favorite scenes include: making fire (fun & funny), using the Fed-Exed skates to open an almost impenetrable coconut, using video tape as rope, building a raft, talking to Wilson, Wilson's face, losing Wilson at sea, encountering a whale, the arrival of the ship. One scene I cannot watch is self-dental surgery with a skate. It makes one want to go to the dentist more often to care for the teeth. Robert Zemeckis, a terrific director (save Forest Gump) deserves credit for his work. At first I thought it was too long, but a great film is never too long and deserves many viewings. Props also to Helen Hunt who shines in a fairly small role. Don Burgess' cinematography is stunningly beautiful and Alan Sylvestri's score is excellent. I urge people to give movies a second chance, if possible. We miss subtle details and sometimes more, on first viewing."

","A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed-Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash. Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties. Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength. Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!

","Believe it or not,until last night,I had never seen this movie. I'd seen snippett's of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn't seen it. I made one attempt about 2 years ago,checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged. Finally though,my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it. He's seen it several times.<br/><br/>My overall impression after watching it was,""Wow,what an amazing story"". The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy. Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever.<br/><br/>The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done,as were the scenes of Hanks' character surviving the angry seas. Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island. Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test.<br/><br/>He finds food,makes shelter,works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival. All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket-watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane. Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he'll return to her someday soon.<br/><br/>After 4 years pass,he's still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality. He's taken to painting a face on a soccer ball (with his own blood) and nameing it ""Wilson"",as it says on the ball. ""Wilson"" becomes his best friend.<br/><br/>Finally (and quite amazingly) near the end of this,another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds. It's actually a credit to Hanks' acting when ""Wilson"" falls overboard into the ocean and floats away,Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend.<br/><br/>Upon being rescued and getting home,he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return. Se's remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him.<br/><br/>His now ex-wife realizes she shouldn't have listened to her friends & family who said she should just ""let him go"". Which gives us a slightly ""hollywood"" scene of her calling to him & chasing after him in the rain as he's driving off. They still love each-other but the damage is done.<br/><br/>With the life he knew gone he's now at a complete loss as to what he's supposed to do with it now. The ending really doesn't provide a clear-cut answer but merely hints at it. I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is,""What would I do if all this happened to me""? I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging,moving even a bit suspenseful (if you've never seen it. The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch.

","I first watched Castaway when I was 4 years old (and am currently 13). I've never forgotten it, or it's emotional impact.<br/><br/>Incredible, yet subtle physical acting (i.e. he spends so long trying to make a fire, horribly injuring his hand in the process, and later, at his 'welcome back' party he picks up a gas fire lighter and just flicks it on and and off) that soul'ly conveyed Chuck's (Tom Hanks) thoughts; extraordinary, yet again - subtle camera-work and direction. Hanks' acting of Noland's distress at losing his only companion for the last 4 years (even if it is an inanimate object), was one of the only times a movie has brought a tear to my eye; and his strength of will to overcome massive waves, and all the things the elements can throw at him never ceases to amaze me. All of these made for a film of IMMENSE emotional proportions on every scale. If you have seen or are going to see Castaway, then I hope you feel the way I do about it. :)"

","Before there was ""Lost"" and before there was ""Survivor"", there was ""Cast Away"". ""Cast Away"" is Giligan's Island if Giligan were the only one on it, and if he were Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>There was a t.v. show in the late 80's to early 90's called ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"". They should have called it ""Tom Hanks Can't Lose"" because he is doing everything right. If Tom Hanks' popularity wasn't already astronomical enough, he just served to increase it with his role in this movie. How good of an actor must you be to have nearly an entire movie in which you are the sole focus. He was not the focus of several other characters, he was the focus because he was the only character. This movie, as simple as it was, was brilliant. Hanks did a great job as did the writers and director. Very few movies have mirrored the feat that ""Cast Away"" accomplished."
"sophielambe","8","2","3","30 October 2006"," a really enjoyable and exciting movie.
","I enjoyed this movie throughly.<br/><br/>I do not normally watch movies with Hanks as the lead as i find them pretty dull. This was an exception.<br/><br/>I saw this on TV and thought it was really well done. The scene were Hanks plane crashes, and he finds himself on an island were he must work with nature is especially well done. The lighting and waves were excellent.<br/><br/>The character Hanks plays, is an uptight and busy man. When he goes to the island, he meets his worst nightmare, Time. With nothing to do and no comforts he makes himself friends. He takes a simple volleyball, names it and with this, remines sane.<br/><br/>I have only three small faults with this movie. The first is that the time on the island is a little short. He doesn't even spend half the movie here.<br/><br/>This isn't really a fault is just me but does anybody ever wonder what is IN THAT STUPID BOX?? Sorry, but really what's in it? He says he saves his life with that box, so what's in it? Tell me if you know please, sophielambe@hotmail.com . Thanks.<br/><br/>This is also not a fault but there should be a sequel!!"

","Robert Zemeckis will probably never again reach the heights of ""Forrest Gump"", but I'm glad he continued making quality movies such as this one. Like ""Forrest Gump,"" this movie is one of a kind; it's unlikely we'll ever see another movie that takes the risks that this one did. To make a movie where over three-quarters of it is just Tom Hanks, half-naked and not talking, takes a lot of guts and a lot of skill. So did ""Forrest Gump,"" and Robert Zemeckis pulls it off again, though not quite with the same knack for weaving sentimentality into genuine drama that he displayed with ""Forrest Gump.""<br/><br/>The first two hours or so of the movie is brilliant. Zemeckis and Hanks present us with Chuck Noland, a by-the-clock-or-die FedEx supervisor, who is obviously in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), who, just as obviously, loves him back. He boards a plane to Malaysia to deliver some packages and tells her he'll ""be right back."" The plane crashes in the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor and is washed up on a deserted island. And there is where the real movie begins. We see Chuck learn how to survive and fend for himself in sequences that could have been slow and tedious but, with the realism in which they are presented, become fascinating.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks's performance is just plain great. He takes up most of the screen time and Zemeckis lets us see into his passion and despair. Hanks, in fact, never takes a wrong step. It is the screenplay that trips up in the last 20 minutes of the production. Some people say the ending feels tacked on. I disagree; most of the ending is just fine, and fits right into this examination of what a real person would do in a situation like this. However, a few of Chuck's lines near the end strike a forced note- not because of Hanks delivery, but because one feels that no one could say something that cheesy well.<br/><br/>Even so, this is quite an experience. Not as creative as ""Forrest Gump,"" to be sure, but who cares? I don't think Zemeckis will ever try to beat his masterpiece and if he keeps making movies like this one he won't need to. This is good enough for me."

It's a great movie, a movie where you actually need the skill of acting because there is very few lines in it. Another fact I find very interesting is that he gets screwed in many ways in the movie I mean getting stuck on an island for years is crappy enough but he sticks through it all and comes out the end with hope and just keeps going on like it was just a part of life to learn from."

","First off, I'm using the previews for Cast Away's as a guideline for not revealing any of the film's plot. The sad thing is that the previews pretty much show everything that happens in the film. If by some chance, you missed them, they basically show Tom Hanks, a Fed-Ex worker, going down in a plane crash and then getting stuck on a deserted island only to return years later. This is an exciting premise, the idea of a fast-paced worker from fast-paced world being thrust into an isolated world where time slows and daily decisions become paramount to survival. Unfortunately, Cast Away manages to cheat the audience at every turn by focusing on the least interesting aspects of being forced into isolation and what how it will affect a person once they return. How would you react to the first person you saw in four years? How about your first hot shower? How about your first hot meal that wasn't fish or coconuts? You can keep asking yourself because, in a odd story-telling decision, the creators of Cast Away have chosen to skip over this entire portion of Tom Hank's story. What the audience is left with is a protagonist we learn little about, his initial life on a deserted island, and a return to civilisation that lacks any dramatic punch. A real disappointment considering the talent involved."

","Tom Hanks and Wilson <3<br/><br/>It's all about love - about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success, about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it, about an ordeal that led one man to re-think what is meaningful in life, and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland - creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped - not against his will - in a job that is eating him alive. How many actors could have made Noland's attachment to ""Wilson"" believable? Yet Hanks does.<br/><br/>Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together.

","Cast Away is a survival drama movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt and Nick Searcy.<br/><br/>The story of a FedEx employee who was living a great life with plans to settle with the woman he loves the most, suddenly he met with a plane crash and got stranded on a deserted island with only one companion Wilson the volleyball and his life changes completely.<br/><br/>The movie depicts different aspects of Chuck's life. The transformation of Chuck from an enthusiastic talkative person to a calm and controlled man. A person stuck alone on a deserted island finds a companion in a volleyball and started treating it as a human. There were two scenes which shows the real emotion of the person, first when Chuck throws Wilson the volleyball in frustration from the cave and then searches frantically calling his name as if the volleyball will respond back and secondly when he tries to save Wilson the volleyball when it gets drifted in water from the raft while escaping from the island. These two scenes shows pure emotion of human as we all must have or had something like this in our lifetime which we use to treat a living being and was or is part of our life.<br/><br/>The screenplay of the movie is evenly placed as the first 35-40 minutes he is shown as a dedicated employee who always prioritise work, the next 1:20 hours is based on his struggles to survive from catching fish, trying and succeeded in burning fire, making arrangements for drinking water and then making a raft and the remaining time his reintroduction with the mankind in the form of a transformed man who is quite and calculated.<br/><br/>The only drawback I felt in the movie was the ending of the movie. A happy ending wasn't expected and it was certain that his fiancÃ© would have moved on but still that section of the movie could've been avoided.<br/><br/>To conclude it's a good survival movie with powerful acting by Tom Hanks as the movie is mainly focused on him and he had done a great job. A must watch movie."

","""I've got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?""<br/><br/>For a film noted for its sparseness, Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away is one of the richest film-going experiences I have ever had. It is a story of mythic simplicity: a man, stranded alone on an island. And yet, this film contains multitudes.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex executive whose life is dictated by the clock. The love of his life is Kelly Frears, played by Helen Hunt. While performing a routine delivery, Noland's Fed Ex aircraft crashes, and he washes ashore on a small tropical island. These are the select few components of Cast Away's plot. The film is carried almost completely by character and theme. Once the story gets to the island, the movie becomes a deeply reflective allegory. William Broyles Jr.'s script is fluid, moving organically around its central character, following him through the trials of island survival and the human mind. It is impossible to discuss Cast Away without mentioning Tom Hanks. Hanks' performance is an all-encompassing master class. He is tasked with selling every conceivable emotion from sorrow, heartache, fear, and misery, to hope, joy, and optimism in his time in and off the island. Then there is the physical transformation from plump Everyman to raw, naked vulnerability as an emaciated creature of the jungle. We spend an extreme amount of time with Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He is so layered, so pitch perfect in every moment, that you never want to leave him.<br/><br/>Zemeckis excels with the details of Noland's years-long struggle to survive. The direction is intimate and tactile, placing us right there with Chuck as he uses relatable ingenuity (he is never superhumanly intelligent) to fight for each new day. While so much of the pleasure of watching Cast Away is the realism in which it depicts island survival, The film is always operating on the level of myth or fable. The island is not simply a setting. Fire is not simply a source of warmth. A volleyball is not simply a toy. Deeper meaning permeates every pore of Cast Away. When Chuck Noland washes up on that island, he lays out the pieces of human desire. Longing, desperation, joy, companionship, hopelessness, and resilience. Those tenets of the human heart are what Cast Away is really about. The story is told completely in metaphor, lending every small moment an impact that goes beyond the surface. What is so remarkable among all of these ideas is the entertainment value encased within them. Tom Hanks makes wonderful company, and Robert Zemeckis wisely finds room for humor. Cast Away is also a beautiful looking and sounding film. It works on very basic levels as well as the metaphorical ones.<br/><br/>Finally, in a third act that left many wrongly underwhelmed, Cast Away reveals itself as, among many other things, a suicide parable, and it's themes crescendo. In one of the greatest monologues of Hanks' career, we're given a line that transcendently crystallizes the film's messages. A line that has stuck with me for years, and one that I believe has the power to change lives. To anyone who has ever experienced intense loneliness or depression, anyone who has felt hopeless in the face of the enormity of life's challenges, Cast Away is a spiritual journey. The movie holds a special personal connection to myself, as someone who has been emotionally paralyzed by depression. Like me, it doesn't wallow in sadness, but instead pushes toward gentle optimism about overcoming it. It provides a pillar to my own philosophy. An extraordinary inspiration when I feel marooned within my own life.<br/><br/>99/100"

","When I saw this in the theaters, I was in my 20s. I was expecting a lot from it, considering it starred Tom Hanks and it was a reunion between him and Zemeckis, who scored Oscar gold with Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>I recall enjoying the island stuff, but then when it came to the parts when he returns back to civilization, it felt anti-climatic, and that final ending...was disappointing.<br/><br/>But as I've gotten older, I get it. You appreciate what you have, because it could be gone in an instant. And for Helen Hunt's character, imagine losing someone you love, only to find out they are still alive. The guilt, turmoil, etc...especially if you moved on and remarried and had a new life.<br/><br/>The ending is open ended for a reason. Hanks character has been re-born. He's got a new lease on life, and now he must make a choice which road to take. And I believe he takes the road leading back to that home with the wings.<br/><br/>So, I would say if you don't like this movie when you first see it, give it a few years and revisit it. I think you will appreciate it more."

","Robert Zemeckis directed this compelling drama that stars Tom Hanks as FedEx executive Chuck Noland, whose plane crashes into the ocean for an undetermined reason, and he manages to swim ashore to a deserted island, where he must learn to survive, as he will be marooned there for several years... Thoughts of his girlfriend Kelly(played by Helen Hunt) and a friend named Wilson(a volleyball he discovers among the damaged packages) keep him sane, though his eventual rescue at sea will in some ways be just as difficult...

His girlfriend Kelly is often neglected by his dedication to work, and his compulsive personality suggests a conflicted man. But on Christmas Eve, Chuck proposes marriage to Kelly right before embarking on a large assignment. On the assignment, a plane crash strands Chuck on a remote island, and his fast-paced life is slowed to a crawl, as he is miles removed from any human contact. Finding solace only in a volleyball that he befriends, Chuck must now learn to endure the emotional and physical stress of his new life, unsure of when he may return to the civilization he knew before.<br/><br/>This film isn't the first to recognize our modern need for primal tales, but it is among the most accomplished. It plugs straight into our unplugged fantasies.And definitely,it is more than just a similarity with Robinson Crusoe.Tom Hanks gives one of the towering screen performances of all time as his scenes of complete isolation on the island, where barely a sound is heard for minutes at a time, are the best thing about it.Overall,it offers an intelligent script, some of Robert Zemeckis' most mature directing, and a showcase performance from talented Tom Hanks in this fascinating film."

Where will people go? Where will people choose? As the best way to go is not easy to be figured out, people always suffer from their choices. This movie tells this point exactly. The man, who drifted to a island, confuses many times until he escaped the island; if it is right to be alive and it is all unworthful in front of me....It shows people's typical life.

","I believe the older a person is the  better one is able to understand what Chuck Noland experienced on that island. One has to be beat up a little to gain life's true perspective. Watching the movie several times I still am moved by Hank's ability to bring out the sadness of his character's plight. At 66 years old I see things in the movie that move me to tears. About my third viewing I was moved by the scene of his getting over the wave. As he turns to start rowing he looks back toward the island. That look on his face shows such ambivalence. What he learned on that island has such a bittersweet after taste. This is so significant to Chuck that he turns Wilson around so he can take a look. Then the rain and fog come in to fade out the island. Great stuff! This is where also the theme music begins,it has been silent on the island. What a moving musical score. It comes in when there is emtional conflict in the remaining portion of the story."

The story of a succesfull businessman who lands on a desolated island is intriguing (especially when he lost his mind...just imagine what you would do!!!). Of course it's all a bit too Hollywood to be real but still a tour de force for Hanks who once again plays in the sort of movie the whole world talks about.

"Pavel-8","9","1","1","20 March 2003"," Simply Stellar.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>While watching ""Cast Away,"" the word that came to mind more than any other was 'right.'  Everything (except one thing) was done right, the way it should have been done.  From Hanks's metamorphosis to the unique ending, each decision of each character was perfect.  <br/><br/>If you saw the trailer (which gave away entirely too much), then you know the basic storyline.  In the prelude, he nails the American obsession with work and time, and their conflict with relationships.  Then his plane crashes, and does so spectacularly.  Nothing is ordinary about how Robert Zemeckis shows the wreck.  He uses primarily interior shots, rather than the standard airplane-hurtling-from-the-sky visuals.  As perverse as it may sound, this is the best and most frightening plane crash I've ever seen on film.  <br/><br/>The middle act features Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) stranded on his island. This act is split into two distinct parts that are separated by four years. The first features Hanks merely adapting and surviving.  The second shows who and what Hanks has become, and how he has honed his survival skills. This transition dominates the film.  The only noise for an hour are the natural sounds and occasional Hanks dialogue.  How many actors can not only keep but demand your attention for sixty minutes w/o scarcely a word?  Hanks truly deserved another Oscar for his remarkable interaction with the island and Wilson, in manners both subtle and exuberant.  The cinematography here was marvelous, displaying both the magnificience and grittiness of the island simultaneously.  Finally he manages to escape, and after several dramatic encounters, including the nearly tear-inducing loss of Wilson, Hanks is discovered by a freighter.  <br/><br/>That set the stage for what I was looking forward to, Hanks returning to civilization and adapting back to a different life.  I desperately wanted to see him experience the joy of a clean shower, brushing his teeth, or tasting food again.  But most of those scenes were never shown, and that's my singular complaint.  A few nods to this were seen, such as Hanks toying with the pocket knife, chugging the bottled water, and flicking on the lighter. I suppose my desired scenes would have extended the running time too long, but I still missed them.  <br/><br/>The stage was then set for Noland's reunion with Helen Hunt's character, Kelly, who had essentially started a new life in the Hanks absence.  To continue a theme, this was done right.  In a lesser film, the two might have blissfully run off together into the sunset, but ""Cast Away"" is smarter and more realistic than that.  While admittedly still in love, the two characters realize that they both must move on.  This is heart-breaking. There can't be much worse in life than knowing where your heart lies, but not being able to follow it because of something ludicrously random. <br/><br/>
The coda is perfect too.  Noland finds closure by delivering the package that kept him alive by providing hope, one of the most powerful feelings. Upon delivery and a chance encounter with the recipient, Noland ends his journey by standing at a literal and symbolic crossroads, not quite sure what's next.  Perfect, because that is precisely where he is at, physically and mentally and emotionally.<br/><br/>Overall, so much is well done.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: One of few films in which I have zero complaints regarding the characters' decisions.  Well written, made, and acted.  In a dead heat with ""Traffic"" for the best film of 2000.  9 of 10."
"kintopf432","7","1","1","4 March 2003"," Surprisingly powerful
","I was not a Tom Hanks fan when I approached this movie.  Probably my favorite of his projects up to this point was `Bosom Buddies,' and, yes, that includes `Saving Private Ryan.'  I swore and threw stuff at my TV when he won his Oscars.  What in hell were people thinking, giving this guy awards for his saccharine, watery-eyed everyman schtick? This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials.<br/><br/> Then I saw `Cast Away.'  I was nervous at first--although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous, it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate.  Cute, boring guy's cute, boring girlfriend thinks he works too much; he very cutely, very boringly tricks her into thinking he's not going to propose, etc.  Again, to the filmmakers' credit, the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand--but it doesn't take much to make me gag.<br/><br/> Then the plane goes down, and the movie turns into something else: part silent film, part philosophical indie, part horror movie. The direction is really quite amazing, especially coming from Robert Zemeckis.  Who knew he had it in him, to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery (the spear-fishing transition is an incredible movie moment), all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non-story? Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence?  Who knew that he, or anyone, could milk honest-to-God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his `friendship' with a volleyball?  There were times when I couldn't believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters, it was so quiet and strange and sad.  It had almost none of the usual crowd-pleasing crap, and that was beautiful.<br/><br/> And yes, Tom Hanks is good, very good.  And I was ready for him to bomb, believe me.  I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food.  (Where's your watering eyes now, Buffy?)  But he surprised me--his performance was completely subtle, and completely believable, and completely sad.  He probably should have gotten the Oscar this time.<br/><br/> But of course it couldn't really last, and in the final act the cuteness does creep in again.  But it doesn't really matter.  You can't take that middle section away from me, and in this case that's enough.<br/><br/> Much has been made out of the endless parade of FedEx logos, and you don't have to be a film-school graduate to notice (and laugh at) the over-the-top mise-en-scene.  But who really cares about that?<br/><br/> All in all, the beginning and ending make my grade something of a compromise, but I definitely recommend checking this one out.  7.5 out of 10."

","I've got to admit, this movie is one of the finest I have ever seen. Not only it focuses on survival, it also has an interesting field on how we can enjoy those many things that keeps on fascinating us. We all know that there is a saying, ""no man is an island"", well, beleive me, everything can be possible if we try to look deep in our hearts, on what we really want and what we can really focus on. For all those things, Cast Away gives an example for every one of them. It gives us inspirations to lead us to a life full of enlightment, and love for oneself. Not only this movie gives these valuable messages in life, but for me, it does tell us how beautiful the world really is. And on how we can love and interact with it, for all our problems and struggles we can just look at on how pretty the world is. For me, this movie is one big inspiration and will be one important part in my life."

"tigersontop","7","1","1","25 November 2001"," Journey to Self Discovery(Spoilers)
","Tom Hanks is a Fedex Executive and Helen Hunt is his girlfriend.  Tom is your classic yuppie workaholic and is forced to abruptly leave during the Holidays to go out of the country on business. He leaves with her a mystery package in the shape of a ring(box).  His plane goes down somewhere in the South Pacific. Hanks is washed ashore and over the course of 4 and half years he undergoes a transformation in which he learns to build fire, survive off spear fishing and coconut cracking, and the pipedream of rejoining his girlfriend one day.  During the first part of the movie fedex packages are constantly being washed ashore, and within those packages are the keys to his survival. Hanks accidentally paints a volleyball with a bloody handprint during a fit of self rage.  During the course of the movie Hanks deprived of all civilized contact forms a bond of friendship with the Wilson Volleyball. The ball almost becomes his alterego as he caries on conversations with it through out the movie. While his quest to reunite with his girlfriend seems to be his motivating factor for his survival in which he contemplates suicide and his inevitable fate, in reality without his ""pet"" volleyball he probably would have given up hope. This movie doesnt have the Hollywood ending most long for, however it is a fine performance delivered by Hanks. Not many people could carry a movie without human interaction for most of the movie like he does. In the end Hanks is at the crossroads literally, and in the midst of self discovery. 7/out of 10. Good movie overall."

","It's sad -but not surprising- to hear people complaining that this movie is boring or long. This is a simple yet effective story about a man on a deserted island. In fact, this isn't even an island; it's a big rock.<br/><br/>Now I know that 90% of the audience expected some action on this island. You know maybe a huge bear, or a lion, or a tiger attacking Tom Hanks. Well as I said, it was a rock.<br/><br/>'Cast Away' is a move about a man staying alone on a rock for four year, helpless. So if you strip man from all the technology and society what do you have? Can this creature survive and exceed its limitations?<br/><br/>Zemeckis did a tremendous job, so did Hanks. The environment is suffocating and beautiful at the same time. Tom Hanks succeeds at making this character believable.

","If you found no redeeming value or lesson to take with you after re-viewing this film, the boat passed you by.  I didn't go see this movie at the theatre because the thought of watching an entire movie based on a lone man's experiences was not appealing.  However, as is the case with many of Tom Hank's latest films, the message was more valuable than the price of a theatre ticket.<br/><br/>Many times in our lives we find ourselves alone on a metaphoric ""island"", isolated from everyone else as a result of some tragedy or unwelcomed consequence that has drastically affected our lives.  And like Hanks' character, we find ourselves without the familiar surroundings or things we have taken for granted.  So we struggle to learn again many processes and procedures that before were simple and available to us.<br/><br/>When the struggle becomes to much of a burden, we begin to wonder if it is worth the life that was presented to us at birth.  If that hurdle is overcome, then you realize that faith in the next day is all you have for hope.  And like Hanks' character was presented with material to form a sail to escape his predicament, we also carry the hope of surviving our experiences as a result of life's waves.<br/><br/>The soliloquy that he delivers toward the end of the movie is priceless. He sums up his fears, his challenges, his triumphs and his failures with the statement, ""I have to keep breathing.  For tomorrow, the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring.""<br/><br/>The final scene with Hanks standing in the middle of a rural intersection is the icing on the cake.  For when we survive our crises, we find ourselves at a crossroads with many roads to choose."

Like in Forrest Gump, I felt that serious moments were somewhat awkwardly acted - since I have seen better from both Hanks and Hunt in other movies, I'll blame the writing or director.<br/><br/>In contrast to others, I did not feel this movie was ""disjointed"", the very distinct parts make sense from the story-telling point of view and emphasize the experiences of the main character.<br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed this movie and it lingered on for while, even though the heavy, heavy Fed-Ex exposure almost managed to spoil it for me."

","Before seeing the result of a new cooperation between Hanks and Zemeckis I read lots of reviews and praises about this film. My opinion is: It is the ordinary Hollywood mainstream movie targeted at the average America's audience (by the way, in Europe this movie did not score at all).<br/><br/>The first ""let's meet our hero"" part is just terrible. The worst part is about the FedEx guy's visit to Moscow. Hey, Mr. Zemeckis..it is year 2001 now, and you show Russia as it is 20 or 30 years ago. The most ridiculous thing is a lorry stuck in the middle of the Red Square (as far as know, there's no traffic there!) and Tom Hanks ""the savior of under-developed Russians"" paying his employees with bars of Mars and cans of Coke. Hey...this is nominee number 1 for the worst movie of the year!<br/><br/>Then we see Helen Hunt with another non-convincing performance this year (I think her popularity this year is a big mistake of the studios' casting). She tries (without success) to show at least some emotions towards her husband played by Hanks. But it seems like Ms. Hunt read her script just before shooting somewhere in between her other numerous movies, because her acting is not convincing at all.<br/><br/>Then we are supposed to be stunned by crash-scene, after which the ""one-actor"" show begins. I do not think that Tom Hanks is a bad actor, but his level is not high enough to carry the weight if mega-million dollars' movie alone. For sure, this part of the film contains lots of stereotypes about ""a-la Robinson"" situations. For almost one hour we see how Mr.Hanks learns to make a fire, to open the coconut shells, etc, etc. In fact, Discovery Channel would do this part of the movie in a better way.<br/><br/>Then our hero fights with the ocean, loosing his companion, Willson-ball, which was supposed to be a very touching scene. Then our hero is happily home, being saved in the middle of the ocean. His wife is already married, and here it's better to stop the movie, but the director uses the audience's patience for another half-hour, posing some moral questions (finally!) if it is good to ruin new family of his ex-wife.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is boring with exception of some moments (10% of the movie or so). After leaving the theater I just felt like I left an American-style fast-food, feeling lots of food in my stomach but being unable to recall the taste of food. Same here: expensive movie longer than 2 hours with nothing to recall in couple weeks. Indeed, this year was not good for Hollywood."
"ralphvz","6","1","1","24 January 2001"," Hanks' Tour de Force
","Just saw this movie a couple of hours ago. Let me get straight to the point. This movie is not good, it isn't bad either but it doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. The first part (introducing the character(s)). We meet Tom and Helen, Tom is a sleazeball yuppie who only cares about his job, Helen euh... has no character. I didn't care about either one. The second part (plain crash) this was good, but not as good as the ""ALIVE"" plain crash, but it had it's moments. The third part(Tom only on island part 1). This is were the problems lie. It's very very slow, it's all about the nature cinematography (if you want to see this, please rent or buy THE THIN RED LINE) it was nicely done but not perfect. Tom Hanks is a good actor, but I simply do not care if, I know he is alone on the island, I know he will make a fire, I know he will learn to break coconuts, I know he will make an imaginary friend, (all seen in the trailer), but there's NOTHING more. This trailer ruined the entire film. That's why this part is very boring. The third part (Tom on island 4 years later and escaping). This part I enjoyed, we see a man who was spend 4 years of his life alone, of course he's cracking up, wouldn't you, but this part isn't long enough, In the beginning we only see the first weeks/months of his solitude, if you really want to see character development it had to be spread out more over the years, not only the first and last month. The last part(Tom and Helen meet again) some good parts (his sleeping on the floor/his disinterrest for being wet and the towel he gets) but mainly bad parts. The dialogue with ""Stan"" for not being with him when his wife died, and the scenes with Helen Hunt. So what do we got : Tom Hanks' role was good (oscar-nominated worthy, not winning) and another Robert Zemeckis film I just didn't get a real good feeling about.(Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her being the others)"

","This is probably just a matter of expectations, but I found Cast Away disappointing. The opening 20 minutes are so action packed they take your breath away. Once on the island, though, things slow to a crawl. Tom's character is such a slow learner and not particularly clever. You find yourself wanting to give him advice. The physical effect of years on the island are totally unbelievable. He suffers numerous wounds, but looks buff and unscarred after four years. Huh? Once he leaves the island, you hope things will pick up but they actually get worse. There's too much wasted time and too much that is pointless. And I haven't heard one person who liked the ending."

"Movie-12","7","7","18","13 March 2001"," Good performance by Tom Hanks, good sequences on the deserted island, but the movie really only succeeds by a margin. *** (out of four)
","CAST AWAY / (2000) *** (out of four) <br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>(this comment on ""Cast Away"" does contain material of a spoiling nature).<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" starts on a fairly entertaining note, but devolves into a contrived love story and becomes buried in tedious sequences in which its characters have nothing to do. The main character spends most of the movie's dreadfully long running time alone on a desolate island-but we determined from trailers and TV ads that the character is retrieved after four years, which kind of eliminates the tension of whether or not he will get off the island alive. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Nick Noland, a systems engineer for Federal Express who intends to wed his long time girlfriend, Kelley (Helen Hunt), after he returns from a business trip over the south Pacific. We are not surprised when his plane encounters a horrible storm. During one of the most intensely convincing crash sequences ever made, the aircraft plummets into the ocean below, miles off course. Nick is the sole survivor, finding a resting place on a deserted tropical island. Time passes, he builds shelter, losses hope, but nonetheless survives. If you are not aware of his eventual rescue after four years, then you are not among the movies target audience. The story really focuses on Nick starting his life over and overcoming extreme odds. He finds out that Kelley became married and the rest of society has assumed his death. Nick's determination is encouraging, but the movie needs more detailing survival on the island. The scenes on the island are the movies best. The film is very careful not to become idle. There are constantly new situations and conflicts being introduced, even though their scenes are often slow moving and tedious. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as the only real character in the film, all other's are plot devices. There are a few attempts to introduce side characters, but in a movie like this that is nearly impossible, although the actors do a reasonable job with what little screen time they behold.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemekis stays focused on a consistent narrative instead of going back and forth between characters, like the mediocre ""Six Days, Seven Nights."" This is a thought-provoking situation, but most of us already know how the plot concludes. The actual conclusion itself is actually dissatisfying and inconclusive. ""Cast Away"" is still a good production, well made, and beautifully crafted. I liked the directors consistent style and focused narrative, the plane crash sequence, and I give the film a marginal recommendation."

"tedg","Null","5","12","24 December 2000"," Pathos is not Deep, but The Nesting Is
","(Spoilers herein.)<br/><br/>I write this on opening day for this film, while it is still an event. Lots of people are excited, but when significant talent comes close to creating something important, I use a higher standard. There are some fine elements and moments in this film, but the total disappoints.<br/><br/>The best two moments are the fire creation sequence, and the plane crash. The firemaking episode is the center of the film as I note below. The plane crash is as harrowing as it gets (speaking as one who was touched by such an event) and supplants the equally person-centered crash in `Fearless.'<br/><br/>Scene-wise, the most unsuccessful episode is near the beginning when Hanks gives a motivational speech to Muscovites about the importance of time. His good guy persona keeps him from convincing here. Contrast this to a similar but crackling speech by Alec Baldwin in `Glengary Glen Ross.' I blame Zemeckis for this, exhibiting his execrable `What Lies Beneath' as proof. It was filmed between the first and second halves of `Castaway.' He just doesn't understand global scope - all his skills are local.<br/><br/>My disappointment has to do with the point of the film. A biting existential angst is eschewed for a more desperate pathos, in order to lower the risk of the film I suppose. But what's left is empty. There's a small nobility in leaving the old girlfriend to her husband but this only incidental. John Sayles' `Limbo' used the same story to much better effect because he wasn't so namby-pamby about despair.<br/><br/>On the other hand, what's remarkable about this film is the way it is structured: it has a many-tiered frame. Often a film is bracketed as a story (`The Princess Bride ` comes to mind), but scriptwriters use all sorts of brackets and here pull out all the stops. It is an elegant structure.<br/><br/>The obvious bracket is the package. We see it being picked up from a pretty (we find out) Texas artist in the opening shots. She paints a distinctive winged logo on the box. This box is either returned by the adulterous husband, or a similar box is sent in reply. It appears on the island, inspires Hanks, and is returned at the end of the film, presaging a possible new life. The content of the box, created by an artist, is metaphorically the film.<br/><br/>But there are more brackets, both outside and inside of this one.<br/><br/>Inside, we have the bracket of the `outside' world, from which he comes to the island and to whence he returns. This is primarily a sound bracket, contrasting the sounds of ships and jets to those of nature. And within that, we have the creation of Wilson by Hanks, just as the screenwriter creates Hanks' character. Wilson is the star, truly the one being with no life, no future. His creation (with fire) is a clue that Hanks will get some distance on his own life. I suspect that much of Wilson is on the editroom floor when the decision was made to tone down from despairing angst to just pathos. Too bad.<br/><br/>(Another internal bracket is more of a small plot symmetry. Hanks confronts a painful tooth (`truth' since Lewis Carroll). His dentist is Spaulding (mirrors Wilson as alterego) is on the `outside' (mirroring location) and sets up his exgirlfriend's husband (mirroring relationship). Its clumsy as it is, and probably had a less film-schoolish feel in the original script.)<br/><br/>
Outside, we have more brackets too. The film leverages Hanks' role in real life as everyman by setting it at Christmas, and inviting the Christmas audience in. We literally bracket the film with our own lives, a point I'm sure the writer wanted to make.<br/><br/>Two other virtual exterior brackets are worth noting. The `Imagemovers' production company is a very clever conception, entirely congruent with the use Fedex is put here as the vehicle for connection. Also, a much overlooked element of movies is the font design of the titles. This film is very clear about titles; there is no visual prelude or underlude. You have the titles, then the action, then the titles again on black.<br/><br/>Font design is a non-trivial art. Tied up in the creation of display fonts is a deep hardwiring in the brain about communication, eons deeper than cinematic conventions. I know that extraordinary effort often goes into the design of fonts for major films, as the effect is extremely powerful, albeit subliminal. If you get a chance to notice this font, it is an ambiguous design, half in the calligraphic world (human, nature, free) and half in the chiseled world (civilized, formal, self-aware). But the blurring switches from side to side for each character. An apt bracket.<br/><br/>Hanks understood all this nesting, I'm sure. I wish he hadn't squandered the opportunity. But because he performs with such commitment as an actor, we'r e prone to forgive him for his lack of courage as a producer. With `Joe vs the Volcano' in his past, he should have been more adventuresome in commissioning the script."

"MCL1150","5","3","6","6 April 2007"," Not as bad as some Zemeckis films
","I'm currently going through another one of my ""watch films that I truly think I'm going to hate"" phases. After all, this IS a Robert Zemeckis film. It does violate one of my rules because I truly like Tom Hanks. I've been a fan ever since I first saw him as Kip in ""Busom Buddies"" back in '79. I think he's terrible whenever he's a serious actor like in ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Philadelphia"", so he's much better here with the hope of an Oscar as far off as a pending rescue. Anyway, not as bad as I had thought but way too long. The official running time is 143 minutes and could have easily been trimmed by 20 minutes. The rescue scene proves that when this director wants to just cut to the chase, he's more than capable of doing so. It's probably the best scene in the film as it comes very unexpectedly and is terrifically shot. You only see that Hanks sees the ship and they just cut right from there to him on a (what else) FedEx plane. They could have dragged things out here with a ton of over dramatics but they didn't. The ending was decent. Of course he delivered the unopened package, but I'm glad we didn't find out what was in it. Revealing that was a no win situation. If it was something completely mundane it would have been another unneeded scene. And if was a cell phone, well that would have been too contrived. The one contrived thing people dredge up is the whole FedEx ""Product Placement"" framework. Zemeckis claims that FedEx didn't pay a nickel for it, and I believe him. If I were FedEx, I wouldn't have put money into any film that had one of my jets going down, but I'd cooperate with it for free. I'm sure that the Hollywood types TRIED to extort $$$ from FedEx, but settled for their help instead. If I were a director, I definitely would rather use a real corporation in a film like this than a made up one. How many times have you seen a movie with a made up corporation and it becomes almost distracting because you just KNOW who it's supposed to be anyway? Well I guess that every movie deserves at least one viewing and I'm not sorry I spent the (including commercials) three hours watching this one. I love movies and you have to expect the bad with the good with the mediocre. The most amazing thing about a major Hollywood movie like this is the amount of people in the credits! Seems so simple a film to me, but my rough count comes in at almost 500 on the crew alone!"
"gottogorunning","8","3","6","9 August 2005"," Greatly Enjoyed!
","I was not a Tom Hanks fan when I approached this movie. Probably my favorite of his projects up to this point was 'Bosom Buddies,' and, yes, that includes 'Saving Private Ryan.' I swore and threw stuff at my TV when he won his Oscars. What in hell were people thinking, giving this guy awards for his saccharine, watery-eyed everyman schtick? This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials.<br/><br/>Then I saw 'Cast Away.' I was nervous at first--although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous, it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate. Cute, boring guy's cute, boring girlfriend thinks he works too much; he very cutely, very boringly tricks her into thinking he's not going to propose, etc. Again, to the filmmakers' credit, the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand--but it doesn't take much to make me gag.<br/><br/>Then the plane goes down, and the movie turns into something else: part silent film, part philosophical indie, part horror movie. The direction is really quite amazing, especially coming from Robert Zemeckis. Who knew he had it in him, to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery (the spear-fishing transition is an incredible movie moment), all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non-story? Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence? Who knew that he, or anyone, could milk honest-to-God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his 'friendship' with a volleyball? There were times when I couldn't believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters, it was so quiet and strange and sad. It had almost none of the usual crowd-pleasing crap, and that was beautiful.<br/><br/>And yes, Tom Hanks is good, very good. And I was ready for him to bomb, believe me. I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food. (Where's your watering eyes now, Buffy?) But he surprised me--his performance was completely subtle, and completely believable, and completely sad. He probably should have gotten the Oscar this time.<br/><br/>But of course it couldn't really last, and in the final act the cuteness does creep in again. But it doesn't really matter. You can't take that middle section away from me, and in this case that's enough.<br/><br/>Much has been made out of the endless parade of FedEx logos, and you don't have to be a film-school graduate to notice (and laugh at) the over-the-top mise-en-scene. But who really cares about that? All in all, the beginning and ending make my grade something of a compromise, but I definitely recommend checking this one out. 8 out of 10."
"emms75","Null","3","6","26 April 2004"," Story about survival
","Cast Away is a story about survival. Chuck Noland is a Federal Express systems engineer whose ruled-by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island.<br/><br/>I was most impressed with the plane crash sequence which takes place about 20 minutes into the film, after Chucks character has been established and the equilibrium is understood.<br/><br/>Chuck, along with the crew of a Fed-Ex aircraft are travelling above the Pacific Ocean, 200 miles off course. At this point the audience realises there may be something wrong, as Chuck is told by a crew member to fasten his seat belt for a bumpy ride.<br/><br/>The camera is hand held and is no higher than Chuck's shoulder height throughout this entire sequence. This helps us feel closer to Chuck by being involved in what is happening to him. The audience is seeing what Chuck is seeing as the sequence is shot from his side of the story. We never know more about the situation than Chuck, and this adds to the fear.<br/><br/>The fact that the camera is quite jerky makes the viewer feel uneasy, as though in danger. These types of camera movements are necessary as there are no external points of reference to show the plane is moving.<br/><br/>Suddenly there is an explosion and within a split second Chuck is being sucked out of the bathroom. This is a very dramatic sequence as the entire mood of the film changes suddenly. The camera is positioned on Chuck, as he is clinging for life onto the bathroom door frame.<br/><br/>The sound becomes one of the most effective elements of this sequence in creating fear and panic.  The noises of the plane as it descends are abstract and eerie. A mixture of engine noise and wind howling through the plane become the forefront of the sound, and almost block out any other noises, for example voices of the crew and the banging of objects flying round. This creates a very frightening yet surreal atmosphere, which you may expect if thrust into this situation.<br/><br/>The camera remains with Chuck, following his actions and watching his reactions. Although there are other people on board the plane, the viewer's main concern is Chuck's safety.<br/><br/>The camera techniques used during this sequence go a long way in creating a very intense and terrifying atmosphere. The camera movement allows the viewer to realise the danger the aircraft is in, whilst also creating a documentary style which gives the viewer the feeling of actually being there.<br/><br/>Also, the hard cuts and swift pans and tilts again give a factual feel, allowing the audience to be a part of the scene. This technique makes it seem as if there has been no creative image processing involved, and is a very clever example of how a camera can be used to create an atmosphere so intense."

This film by comparison makes Bosom Buddies actually seem good with its predictable plot turns and sappy dramatics. If you want to see a really good film in the vein of this dissapointment, rent Hell in the Pacific(1968) with Lee Marvin and the incomparable Toshiro Mifune Or Papillon (1973) starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Both of these films excel where this flick falls short (in particular they actually have good actors in them...)and neither has to use a mega budget to compensate for rushed cinematics and cliche plot. If you like Hanks and his overated acting style then by all means see this movie, you WONT be dissapointed. But on the other hand if you prefer movies of substance stay FAR AWAY from CAST AWAY."
"bob the moo","Null","3","7","30 December 2003"," Slow but engaging drama that is driven by Hanks' brave performance
","Chuck Noland is a driven employee of Fed-Ex.  He has a loving girlfriend and a lifestyle that sees him travelling the world.  When he takes an overnight flight across the Pacific, his plane crashes killing the crew but he escapes on an inflatable dingy.  Washing up on an island Chuck finds himself shipwrecked and must survive until he is found.<br/><br/>I wasn't won over by the idea of this film when it came out at the cinema and gave it a miss.  However on TV I'm graceful enough to give anything a chance for free!  In this case I had no hype or bad reviews about the film to colour what I thought of it, coming to it fresh enough to have an open mind.  Fortunately I was in a patient mood and looking forward to seeing it, so it didn't bother me that the film was very slow, although I can understand why some audiences were straining at the leash for more pace. For me the story itself was interesting enough as a human story to defy `things happening' - it was Chuck I was watching the film for, not a fight scene or a dramatic rescue.<br/><br/>For this reason the film succeeds - to me it was dramatic and engaging on a character level and, because things were always happening to Chuck, I didn't need some constant bit of plot to be happening.  The film is quite brave in that way and, while other reviewers have criticised the ending, I thought it displayed good taste and control - imagine trying to get that ending through a pitch or a preview audience!  Most films would have looked for a more positive and conclusive ending - but this one was very good.<br/><br/>Hanks does great work to hold the attention for the whole film - he is barely off screen for a minute of the whole 120+ minutes.  His performance is good; whether he is acting normal or talking to a volley ball he is convincing and never dull, he makes it very easy for us to get into his character and his situation - which was vital to keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this film but I do feel you need to be ready for what you're sitting down to.  It is slow paced and, if you're impatient, then you may feel like `nothing's happening'.  Hanks does great to hold the audience otherwise and the film is grown up and lacking in the sort of syrupy smaltz that could have killed the film.  Not perfect but an great story well told if you're in a patient mood."

","Cast Away shows you what life would be for a lucky shipwreck or plane crash survivor on a deserted island in the Pacific. It's tough, and very lonely.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job of showing us that, and also of setting up the character's life, and what would happen after he returns home. It is a drama, but it's not something designed to upset the viewer. Everything is done right: the editing, the soundtrack, the camera shots, the sets, the costumes, the accessories, the scenario, the dialogs, and the story.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is perfect, a high note in his career, without a doubt. He brings excellent dramatic emotions to the screen, as well as incredible poise in the loneliness of his character and his defeated look, not to mention going to incredible dietary length to get really emaciated.<br/><br/>The only negative things I've found, are not that noticeable. First, the Christmas family dinner is a bit over done in true Hollywood fashion. Second, the ""sea"" during the crash is obviously set in a large artificial basin and the huge waves are CG. Third, the night time scenes on the island don't look real.<br/><br/>That being said, it's a must see."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","2","4","19 December 2008"," A fine effort that falls a bit short due to a couple of poor choices
","""Cast Away"" centres on Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island after his plane crashes. Entrenched in a desperate struggle for survival, he faces constant physical and emotional hardships. It's a high concept movie that harks back to the classic novel ""Robinson Crusoe"".<br/><br/>This was a demanding role for Tom Hanks and he ably carries the picture. The middle portion of the film is basically all Tom Hanks with his only interaction carried on with a volleyball that he transforms into a makeshift companion. Unfortunately, the film's other big name, Helen Hunt, delivers a performance that really makes you wonder how she ever won an Oscar. She and Hanks have absolutely no chemistry together and her poor acting makes the role even more unappealing.<br/><br/>The surprising thing about the film is how it turns a simple story of survival into an engaging film. Obviously, life on a deserted island is bound to be somewhat uneventful but Hanks & Zemeckis nevertheless retain our interest. The concluding portion of the film, however, leaves much to be desired and nearly ruins the film. Part of this is due to Hunt's performance but the storyline is hokey to begin with.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis delivers an attractive looking film with a wealth of fine outdoor cinematography. Also worth noting is the sound design, which really enforces the sense of realism on the island. Alan Silvestri's score is wisely dormant during this time, which gives it greater impact when featured at other times. All in all, the entire film is marked by high production values.<br/><br/>The film's glaring flaws do not outweigh the more polished elements but it is disappointing to see the film nearly derailed by a couple of poor choices. Nevertheless, the film is certainly worth watching for the good parts."

Either she or her directors believe that simply keeping the camera on her while she purses her lips and widens her eyes is something akin to acting.  It is not.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, perhaps the luckiest actor in the history of film, (don't get me started on his TWO Oscars) does a fine job throughout the island portions of the film, but falls completely on his face in the God awful last half hour of the film.<br/><br/>Here comes the spoiler.  Although anybody who has sat through the preview has seen it by now!! (nice marketing in Hollywood nowadays!!) Once he returns to the mainland and attempts to reconcile with Hunt's character, we are reminded how mediocre a film this truly is.<br/><br/>I continue to be shocked that Zemeckis would actually have Hanks ""standing in the crossroads"" of his life!!  This kind of blatantly stupid visual metaphor, not only insults the audience's intelligence, but is simply laughable!<br/><br/>I would have been content with Hanks' travails on the island, clearly the most interesting and believable portions of this film.

","Although ""Cast Away"" is effectively a 143 minute commercial for Fed Ex, it is nonetheless a good movie. In the midst of the many ""reality based"" TV shows, Director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks give us a feeling of what it would really be like to have to survive in the wilderness.<br/><br/> Hanks plays Chuck Noland a troubleshooter for Fed Ex whose plane goes down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean during a raging storm. He somehow survives and washes up on the beach of a deserted island. He is forced to learn how to survive by using the materials and resources that are available to him in this wilderness.<br/><br/> Zemeckis and Hanks through his stunning performance, are able to convey the loneliness and isolation of an everyman in a seemingly hopeless situation. We see the Hanks character grow his hair and beard, lose weight (which he actually did for the film) and form a touching ""friendship"" with a volleyball onto which he has drawn a face and calls ""Wilson"", to keep from going mad. He also longs for the girl he left behind (Helen Hunt) by constantly looking at a picture of her in the watch that she had given him.<br/><br/> Hanks is outstanding in the lead role and Hunt does what she can in a limited role. Watch for Chris Noth in small part.<br/><br/> I thought the producers went a little too far though in their Fed-Ex tie-in. I mean, we see Fed-Ex trucks and packages all through the picture and yes, even on the desert island. Oh my god, I think they got me too. How many times have I mentioned ""Fed-Ex"" in MY comments?"

He says so much without saying much at all. He is a very expressive actor who lets his facial expressions and body language tell it all. <br/><br/>The movie was actually well paced.

The movie does have a lot of letdowns which I will focus on, instead of the predictable plot that the film somehow turns interesting.<br/><br/>First is the movie's intentional way of not using any music during Tom Hanks' whole stay at the island.  Although I am aware that the producers meant for this to symbolize the loneliness of being stranded, I feel that the lack of music played a bigger role in reducing the passion and interest of the film.<br/><br/>Second, (and THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER), I was very disappointed at the end, because the lone unopened package during his stay was left unopened.  Tom Hanks delivered the package and just left.  Now, the film sort of developed in a way as if to say that the package held some very valuable contents, so I had been eagerly awaiting to see what was inside.

","Tom Hanks does a superb job of carrying ""Cast Away"" all by himself for about two-thirds of its running time, but isn't much helped by additional characters in the opening and closing sequences. Here is a strong and simple story surrounded by needless complications, and flawed by a last act that first disappoints us and then ends on a note of forced whimsy.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a time-obsessed Federal Express executive who troubleshoots all over the world, arranging hurry-up package transfers in Moscow before flying off to solve problems in Asia. Helen Hunt plays his fiancee, Kelly Frears, who tries her best to accept a man ruled by a beeper. She comes from clock-watching stock, and for Christmas gives Chuck her grandfather's railroad watch.<br/><br/>Noland hitches a ride on a FedEx flight across the Pacific, which is blown off course before crashing after an onboard explosion. That seems like two catastrophes when one would have done, but director Bob Zemeckis uses the storm for scenes of in-flight fear, wisely following Alfred Hitchcock's observation that from a suspense point of view, an explosion is over before you get your money's worth.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: If you have not seen ads for the movie, read no further.<br/><br/>Noland survives the crash, and floats in a life raft to a deserted island. And . . . am I telling too much of the story? I doubt it, since the trailers and commercials for this movie single-mindedly reveal as much of the plot as they can, spoiling any possible suspense. Not only do they tell you he gets off the island, they tell you what happens then. What am I to do? Pretend you haven't seen the ad, or discuss what we all know happens? The early scenes are essentially busy work. Exotic locales like Moscow add a little interest to details about Noland's job. An airport farewell to the fiancee is obligatory, including the inevitable reassurances about how Chuck will be right back and they'll have a wonderful New Year's Eve. Then the crash.<br/><br/>The movie's power and effect center on the island. Chuck, the time-and-motion man, finds himself in a world without clocks, schedules, or much of a future. There's something wonderfully pathetic about the way he shouts ""Hello? Anybody?"" at the sand and trees. Those are his last words for a time, as he tries to remember childhood lessons about firemaking and shelter construction. Then there's a four-year flash-forward and we see the formerly plump Chuck as a gaunt, skinny survivor. (Zemeckis shut down the movie while Hanks lost weight.) I find it fascinating when a movie just watches somebody doing something. Actual work is more interesting than most plots. Chuck splits coconuts, traps fish, builds fires, and makes use of the contents of several FedEx boxes that washed up with him (too bad nobody was mailing K-rations). And he paints a face on a volleyball and names it Wilson--a device which, not incidentally, gives him an excuse for talking out loud.<br/><br/>Hanks proves here again what an effective actor he is, never straining for an effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen.<br/><br/>I liked every scene on the island and wanted more of them. There's a lovely moment when he squats on the ground, contemplating a crate that has washed up, and the shot is composed as homage to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Hanks' favorite film. I also liked the details of his escape. A shot of the giant bow of an ocean tanker, looming over his raft, could have been the setup for the movie to end. But no. As the trailers incredibly reveal, he returns home, where. . . .<br/><br/>Well, I can't bring myself to say, just on the chance you're still reading and don't know. Let's say that the resolution of an earlier story strand is meant to be poignant and touching, but comes across flat and anticlimactic. And that the smile at the end of the film seems a little forced.<br/><br/>I would have preferred knowing much less about ""Cast Away"" on my way into the theater. Noland's survival should be an open question as far as the audience is concerned. You might assume that the 20th Century Fox marketing department gave away the secrets over the dead body of director Zemeckis, but no: Zemeckis apparently prefers to reveal his surprises in the trailers. He got a lot of flak earlier this year when the ads for his previous film, ""What Lies Beneath,"" let you know Harrison Ford was the bad guy, there was a ghost, etc. At that time he was quoted in David Poland's Web column: ""We know from studying the marketing of movies, people really want to know exactly every thing that they are going to see before they go see the movie. It's just one of those things. To me, being a movie lover and film student and a film scholar and a director, I don't. What I relate it to is McDonald's. The reason McDonald's is a tremendous success is that you don't have any surprises. You know exactly what it is going to taste like. Everybody knows the menu."" A strange statement, implying as it does that Zemeckis is a movie lover, student and scholar but that he doesn't market his movies for people like himself. This is all the more depressing since he usually makes good ones."

","Tom Hanks I one of my fav actors so it wasn't much of a suprised that I like this movie like a lot. I even loved Wilson a ton. Tom Hanks did a great job in this movie he was acting by himself for most of the movie but did a fantastic job. This movie was super emotional too. The plot, storyline, characters, character development are all really good. This is a survival, plane crash, life kind of movie. I liked that Tom Hanks character liked working at fx a lot. The love he had for his wife seemed so real. The romance was so good and the chemistry was great. Every scene in this movie was done so well. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves ton Hanks acting or even if you don't like his acting you should still see this movie it that good."

","Although the movie was excellent, the trailer ruined the experience. I actually thought about requesting a refund. I'm not going to give away any spoilers because I practice what I preach, but the trailer gives away a major plot point. It has to do with the amount of time Chuck is on the Island. I'm not the first one to complain. You can read what Zemekis said about the trailer controversy on this site. What the F does he care? He still made his millions regardless.

","The movie begins in a faraway place, continues in an unknown and far-off place, and finally ends in the same first place. Maybe it wants to say that you can live in the distance and somewhere, you can be in love, you can be hopeful and you can be responsible. Because in these distant places, there is no supervisor to oversee your actions, no judge to judge you, only yourself, who is the highest observer and judge. The philosophy of creation is the same, inner discovery, external discovery, search and hope<br/><br/>When Chuck entered the island, the rhythm of movie seems to be slowing down, and some viewers are complaining that the movie is going to boring. But I think this slow pace is intentional to show the daily routine of life. As long as there is no goal and we are only trying to meet the basic needs (eating and sleeping, etc.), we will suffer from monotony. And this story continues for Chuck for four years, until it leads to emptiness and suicide. Excitement returns to the movie when he decides to fight for his life, risk it, and escape the monotony.<br/><br/>Before entering the island, Chuck was a lover and responsible person. Elements that saved him against loneliness and wild of nature. He opened all the packages except one in order to keep it alive in the hope that it would reach its destination and use this lever to escape to life. Man is a social being, even in pure solitude. It is necessary to have a companion, even if it is made by one's own hands.<br/><br/>The film's clear message is hope and a desire to live, even in the most cast away places."
"thomasmitilis1995","8","0","0","14 April 2020"," WILSON, I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!!!
","PROS:The film captures successfully the triumph of human spirit under difficult conditions. Tom Hanks gives an outstanding and dedicated performance as a man cut off from civilization and through his character's eyes are developed the themes of loneliness, loss and isolation. The little dialogue and the nonexistence of music, when the character is on the island, amplify this isolation. Robert Zemeckis manages to make a volleyball one of the most compelling characters of the film and symbolises the hope throught it. Also, it's worth mentioning that the way that he shoots the plane crash is very impressive. The relationship between Hanks and Hunt's characters is developed nicely so their reunion is emotional.
CONS:The movie could me trimmed down some minutes without loosing its charm. In addition, the connection of the first and the last minutes is a little off-putting and the symbolism that displays could be presented differently."

","Obviously I am many years behind with this review, but it is only a proof of how this classic despite the age, is still able to deliver an enormous satisfaction in its theatrical form. Cast Away is a film that I like to use quite like the example of good cinema; it is a film with a simple premise, simple in his veins but with a fantastic execution, fun and emotional. It is an art of being able to see it, entertaining from top to bottom, full of classic moments that we can remember forever, moments that are already captured as part of the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Everything inside the movie is great, I was sincerely hoping to see something simple with a little adventure, but ended up being a trip quite emotional and passionate about the survival story of a poor FedEx worker who ends up spending years lost along with nothing but his companion mind, which makes great use with the classic ball, Wilson.<br/><br/>And practically, these are the two protagonists of the film, although if there are several characters, the story itself is concentrated in Chuck, perfectly personified by Tom Hanks, achieving that we have a great affection for the person and his interaction with the world around him. Finishing with an excellent and simple end, emotional and moving, a classic instant that despite the years, must be seen."

","Sunday Family day, so yeah thanks HBO hits. Probably my 5th rewatch of this film (story below!). When I was young, I considered Cast Away as the greatest of the greatests (I would've given this 5 star if Letterboxd existed 19 years ago) of Robert Zemeckis. Present day, I just realized that some parts of it were really bad, and there were good parts too. If I cried to this film before, now I'm just laughing- it's definitely a Survivor show but sort of comedy. BUT THIS IS NOT AN AWFUL MOVIE. Not at all. Others might see it as boring and tedious but as far as I am concerned, it is still entertaining as ever and with hardly a set, hardly a supporting cast, a minimum of dialogue and expressions, but with a hurricane of emotions, a credible and breathtaking Hanks still keeps me (and the audience) at the edge of their seats from the beginning till the end, in this masterpiece of a movie. Yes, even though I laughed at it sometimes, it's still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>As for the story (this was never important anyway)... I've first seen then when I was 4th grade, also in fifth grade for a class film viewing, in high school and in college, and the most memorable of all was summer of 2001. We had a DVD of copy of this and my sister invited his boyfriend (now his husband) to watch it at home. My sister and I pretty much connived because I also got to invite my crush who happens to be my neighbor- all four of us watched it together. Bad decision. After we finished the film, I blurted out- ""so he didn't have sex for four years???, my crush replied, ""he was a true survivor then"".....<br/><br/>
and I never saw his face again."

","I've seen it a half-dozen times, and always love it for the sense of adventure it stirs within me at the thought of being stranded on an island like this and having to survive (even though in reality, I probably wouldn't last more than a month). But upon watching it again recently, a couple things struck me that I think are a bit off.<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't think his woman would have moved on from him and gotten married and had a kid. If she was so in love with him as is depicted in the beginning, and if he was, as she says in their final hug after the reunion ""the love of her life"" and she had always been in love with him and always would and, again as she says, ""I always knew you were alive, even when they told me to give up and move on, I still knew."" then four years is not long enough for him to be gone for her to move so completely on with her life. She might have dated, but I don't believe she would do this for at least a couple years, and she might have needed to find a guy to have sex with - but maybe not - but I do not believe that she would get married and have a kid - not in only four years.<br/><br/>The second thing that struck me as being off was the entire sequence involving the ""hanging tree"" at the top of the cliff. Watching these scenes, I started thinking about the practical reality of this supposed scenario and realized that it was probably impossible. Firstly, given the closeness of the dead tree to the cliff's edge, I doubt anyone could tie a rope to it, then carry or lift such a heavy ""test trunk"" and throw it off the cliff without losing their balance and falling over the edge. But let's say that part was doable, okay, but when Chuck goes back up there to retrieve that extra 30 feet of rope, there is NO WAY he could go back up there and to such a precarious perch, reach out for that rope - stretching his hand like he did to actually grab the rope - and then haul that ""test trunk"" back up one-handed on that cliff edge. He'd fall for sure. Of course, in the movie, they cut out just how in the hell after getting a hand on the rope he manages to then get himself, the rope and the trunk into a position where he can haul it. They cut from his hand precariously grabbing the rope to him standing with both feet firmly planted and both hands hauling the rope up. But what did he do in between those moments? Use magic super powers?<br/><br/>The final thing that bothers me is all the nonsense with FedEx deliveries in the beginning - boring - but luckily, able to be sped through using the trusty fast-forward or skip buttons.<br/><br/>Otherwise, still a great movie."
"tabathaking-05542","Null","0","0","29 April 2017"," Music and Sounds effect our emotions - Review includes a ""spoiler""
","Review includes a ""spoiler"". The filmmakers of the film Cast Away illustrated a plethora of different sound effects throughout the film. Some examples of these sound effects are the noises of the waves, the rain, the thunders, the wind, the horns of the ships, the crackling of the wood, the coconut droppings, even the removal of other sounds you would expect to hear on an island, music and much more. The film Cast Away is about loneliness, relationships, and hope - sound effects are used to demonstrate these effects.<br/><br/>In the film Cast Away, Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland is FedEx executive that is very punctual and almost neurotic about time. This behavior is displayed at the beginning of the movie while he is Russia. He returns to his girlfriend Helen Hunt as Kelly Frears in Memphis, Tennessee. He shows up at her place of employment and greets her in the copier room, glad to see each other, they hug and kiss. She says, ""You are home, I love that you are home"" and they begin to dance. Chuck and Kelly then attend a Christmas dinner party that is cut short. Kelly gives Chuck a family heirloom pocket watch with his favorite picture of her in it as a gift for Christmas. Before he leaves, he gives her an engagement ring, she says, ""I'm scared."" He walks away saying, ""I'll be right back"". These scenes are used to illustrate to the viewers how much Kelly and Chuck love each other and how much Chuck has to lose. He has successful career, girlfriend, friends, and family.<br/><br/>While flying over the Pacific Ocean the plane goes through a thunderstorm and crashes into the sea. Chuck the lone survivor was saved by an inflatable raft. He drifted away from the flames of the crash into the dark sea. MUSIC?? He wakes in the morning to find himself alone and on a deserted island. While on the island Chuck uses his primal instincts to survive. He had to find shelter, food, water, and even companionship. The companion was a volleyball, he called Wilson, but it was a companion. The lack of music, background noise, helped to reinforce seclusion of the island Chuck was stranded on. There are several times in the film that off-screen or invisible sounds were used and effectively employed to enlarge the boundaries of the visual frame or to create the mood and atmosphere. One example of off-screen or invisible sound was during the coconut dropping scenes. It wasn't until something fell out of the tree right in front of him that realizes it was coconut. The sad truth was he is alone and had just been hearing coconuts fall. I believe these sounds along with the others helped in aiding the authenticity of the island environment and the feelings of loneliness and fear felt by Chuck. I believe without the sound effects throughout the movie it would have been significantly different The pocket watch gave Chuck hope while he was there for four years. Like we stated earlier he is very neurotic about time, Chuck used hash marks on the wall to track time, which ultimately saved him from the island. Yes, he was faced with and had to overcome demands of physical and emotional strength but without know the time and when the waves would change he would have never been able to get through the tides.<br/><br/>After his escape from the island, Chuck is floating in the Ocean and experiences another thunderstorm, when he wakes up he discovers he has lost his companion, Wilson. The somber music that played will bring tears your eyes. Chuck has lost everything that was something to him from the last four years. Once Chuck returned home he discovered the Kelly had moved on and was married, ironically to his oral surgeon, and she had a child with him. After a dramatic re-connection and what seems to be a start to rekindling their romance, Chuck realizes he has lost her all over again, once again it is raining and storming. You hear what seems to be the same somber music that was being played when he lost Wilson. If I were Chuck, I would steer clear from all storms, he seems to lose everything during them.<br/><br/>During a monologue scene, Chuck explains to his friend Nick Searcy as Stan. ""I've got to keep breathing. Because tomorrow, the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?"" Again the lack of sound in this scene connected you to the emotions being felt by Chuck.<br/><br/>While on the island there was one only package he had not opened, it had angel wings drawn on it. In the closing scene of the film, Chuck delivers, on a sunny bright day, this package in Texas. The package is being returned to the sender, he knocks on the door and no one answers so walks around sees a sculpture of the same angel wings in the yard. No one is home so, Chuck props it on the screen and leaves a note, which reads ""This package saved my life."" Chuck leaves and stops at a crossroad to look at a map and a friendly, pretty lady about his age stops and says ""You look lost."" She gets out of her car and she explains to him where all the roads and intersections lead, he thanks her and then she drives away. Chuck notices the same angel wings are painted on the back of her truck. He looks down at his map and then walks to the center of the crossroads and uplifting music begins to play as the camera focuses on his face and he smiles.<br/><br/>Music and lack of music play an important part of this film and is used appropriately. The music changes and puts you in the emotions of the Chuck and reinforces the loneliness and hope throughout the movie. This is by far one of my all-time favorites."

","Cast Away, is based on a man (Tom Hanks, starring as Chuck Noland) who ends up stranded on a lonely island after his FedEx plane crashes, and he is the only survivor. Chuck ends up being stranded on this island for four years, without any human contact. The only contact Chuck has during these four years is with his friend Wilson (who is a volleyball). During this movie they show Chuck finding different ways to survive. He builds a raft that helps him sail home. The theme of Cast Away is not to take things for granted. Chuck leaves behind the love of his life several times to pursue his career. He ends up leaving around Christmas and doesn't come back for four years due to his plane crashing. When he sees Kelly again, after four long years, one of the first things he says to her is that he never should have left that night. Kelly was distraught when Chuck came back because everyone told her she needed to let him go, although, she still knew he was alive. Because they told her to let go, she ended up getting married and having a daughter with someone she did not truly love. She described Chuck as the love of her life. Wall-E, is a movie that has the same theme. The characters in this particular movie do not take care of their garbage properly and it ends up destroying the earth. Wall-E shows the beauty of things on earth by saving the items to enjoy for himself. When Chuck wakes up on the Island, it is really gloomy outside. This symbolizes the loneliness that he will be feeling while on the island. A motif of Cast Away, is when Chuck keeps pulling out the gift that Kelly gave him with her photo in it. It is constantly shown throughout the film and displays the emptiness he feels from leaving Kelly that night. The film Cast Away, Chuck displays his feelings of taking Kelly for granted. She wanted to be with him so bad, and it really hurt her when Chuck would leave. When he leaves around Christmas time, he doesn't come back for four years due to the plane crashing. Throughout his time on the island, you can sense Chuck's loneliness and how much he misses Kelly. When he comes back he tells her he never should have left that night. The director of Cast Away, Rob Zemeckis, does an amazing job at displaying the importance of the theme through the whole movie."

","Tom Hanks answered the question once (on a talk show) and it went something like: What word do you hear most often when fans see you? And he answered that fans often yell ""Wiiiiiiilson""!!! :)<br/><br/>His fans like ""Cast Away"", but not only them. It is difficult not to fall for the movie's charm, not to fall in love with natural beauties and landscape (of Fiji) and not to connect with the main character. I watched the movie ages ago, but I often remember it. It is an ode to human race, a hymn to survival and a story that the average can relate to. *Spoilers* Finally we have a hero with no special powers, well-paid job or a model girlfriend. Chuck Noland is an ordinary man who works at Fed Ex, has an ordinary girlfriend and he survives a plane crash. The story is pretty much simple and resembles the survival tale of Robinson Crusoe. It is not the universal story itself that makes this movie so great: it is the setting, the atmosphere and psychological and physical struggles inside the main character. <br/><br/>Being left on an uninhabited island, Chuck Noland (not to be confused with Chuck Norris :) has to find things from the plane wreckage and use the pieces of material found on the island in order to survive, day by day. While watching, we cannot resist asking ourselves: Would I think of that?, How would I react in the same situation? And by doing so, the viewers have to admit that they are truly embedded in the story.<br/><br/>The director and the whole crew succeeded in making us relate to Chuck. Tom Hanks' acting was tremendous. The audience can relate to his feelings of despair, emotional and physical pain, fear, hunger and loneliness. He had his ups and downs on the island and I think most viewers celebrated his achievements with him, like catching a fish or making fire. Loneliness was the biggest issue for him and therefore he made friends with Wilson, the ball. I bet that the scenes of poor Chuck talking to the bloody face smudged on the white leather background are among the most memorable and humane scenes depicted on screen. Whether we admit it or not, we all have our ""Wilsons"" in our lives, in one form or another.<br/><br/>Another proof that Tom Hanks is one of the best actors is his wish to make a physical change for a role. His body literally transformed from the average couch potato who doesn't do sports into the skillful and fast athlete with sunny tan and strong muscles. His body changes are really realistic and Tom Hanks put a lot of effort into training, so that his body would reflect malnutrition and other challenges that he faced. <br/><br/>There are many wonderful aspects of the film, but it's difficult to list them all. To sum up: watching ""Cast Away"" is an emotional and aesthetic 1st class journey."

I watched it with the grand-kids and they loved it.<br/><br/>The story pulls one in to the point so that a person can feel the remoteness of the island and the respect for the friendship Noland forges with Wilson. It's not a silly volleyball but a representation of a friend, like the friend who washed up on the island beach.<br/><br/>My view of the film is that it is all about transitions. From Moscow to Tennessee, to the brink of death, to a remote island, to the dark Pacific, to hopelessness when the paddles are finally to the ocean, to the whale who seems to bring a smidgen of hope.<br/><br/>I can't picture any actor but Tom Hanks in the lead either."

However, when the ball floated away, you can see the desperation in his eye as he had the face the decision to save his friend, Wilson, or hold onto the raft that will bring him back to the society and home. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family."

","Cast Away was released in 2000. Some are the main characters are Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), and Ramon (Paul Sanchez). This film mainly revolves around the main character, Chuck, who gets stranded on an island after his plane crashes into the ocean. This film shows how he tries to survive on this island and try to get himself rescued. The film shows how hard it can truly be to try to survive and the emotional toll it would have one someone. Of course you have to watch the film to figure out whether Chuck survives this situation or not.<br/><br/>The theme of Cast Away is pretty straight forward. It is one that shows human survival when we are forced to try and survive or die. This theme focuses on the idea of the struggle for human dignity. Chuck is put in a position of disadvantage and dealt a bad hand when he gets stranded on the island. He is fighting against tremendous odds for his survival. There are also several other films that have a similar theme to Cast Away's theme. 127 Hours is one film that has a similar theme to Cast Away's theme. The main character gets dealt a bad hand when getting stuck in the canyons with his arm crushed and stuck. His is at a disadvantage and fighting against tremendous odds for his survival just like Chuck was in Cast Away.<br/><br/>There are a couple of film techniques that have relevance to the film's theme. One technique is lighting. There is a darker lighting during most of the movie, which helps show the significance of the theme. If the lighting was bright during the whole film, then it would be harder to portray the significance of this theme. Sunny and bright usually means happiness. You wouldn't want the audience to feel OK and happy during the movie, you want them to feel sad, nervous, anxiety, fearful at times. This way the audience can have a feeling of being there and have a sense of reality of what is going on in the film and about the theme.<br/><br/>The second technique is camera angle. The camera angles changes from the viewer seeing Chuck and his surroundings to seeing what Chuck is seeing, like they are looking through his eyes. Interchanging between these camera angles really gets the audience in tune with Chuck and what he is possibly feeling. Getting the audience involved like this really helps get the theme of this movie across to the viewers. This makes the theme very straight forward. A theme of survival against all odds is a great theme that most audience members enjoy and it works great for Cast Away."

","I had great expectations from the movie. And it didn't disappoint. Tom Hanks is way too good. This is one great movie which certainly goes much deeper than the portrayal. Nature, mortality, necessities of life, passion, never give up determination, love, humour, ET AL. You name it. This one here has everything in it. And a splendid display of them all. This goes to the topmost shelf of my mind and the most decorated cabinet in my heart. I am watching this many a time. Excellent. I am sure there's a lot in the audience who bought the DVD just in order to watch it over and over again. Well that's quite natural. You are in for a very nice experience. People having complaints about their situation. Just sit and admire this. There's a lot of help on offer."
"deasonisaiah","8","0","0","18 October 2016"," Cast Away review
","Cast Away<br/><br/>The critically acclaimed movie Cast Away is a test to one man's psychological and physical will to live. It stars Academy Award winner Tom Hanks and that is about it. Oh and his buddy Wilson (a volleyball). Robert Zemeckis is the director, who was also the lead man in Forest Gump. Hanks and Zemeckis really work well together in this survival flick. Cast Away accurately describes man's will to survive, even when times become desperate.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays and average man named Chuck Noland who is a supervisor for the corporate shipping business FedEx. His girlfriend is Kelly Frears, played by Helen Hunt. The filmed is based in 1995, where Chuck and Kelly live in Memphis. The beginning of the film has him struggling with the daily duties of his FedEx job, where is placed in Russia, among other places. He seems to be a normal man in which he is slightly overweight, and has a terrible tooth problem. Chuck wishes to marry the love of his life, Kelly, but business absence has halted the proposal.<br/><br/>One Christmas day 1995, Chuck gets an unexpected business call in which he has to travel on a plane again. Chuck and Kelly exchange gifts in their car before he boards the trip. Kelly gives Chuck a compass with a picture of her inside of it. This plays an important role later in the plot. Like the title of the film implies, the plane has some technical difficulties and ends up crashing into the Pacific. A water raft ends up saving his life, and to his amazement, he suffers little injuries. Isolated In the middle of the Pacific, Chuck floats to the nearest island he stumbles upon. His survival skills are immediately tested. He has to learn how to hunt, how to make fire, and how to stay sane. Chuck uses some of the FedEx deliveries to help him cope and survive. Some of those things are video tapes, ice skates, a dress, a mysterious unopened box and his famous companion, a volleyball (with a face) named Wilson. <br/><br/>Moreover, the island is a tropical one, with sand layering the outside. And tropical trees and some animals fill the deserted island. There is small mountains with rocks and trees covering them. Other than some lizards and bugs, the island is largely uninhabited as far as we can see. <br/><br/>Chuck continues to improve on his survival skills, while constantly thinking of Kelly and the people at home. He talks to a volleyball with a face to give him company. He eventually learns how to start a fire. Tom Hanks does a great job of showing the frustration his character displays after failing many times. He also learns how to hunt and fish on the little island, which also takes time. In the middle of the movie, Chuck appears on the screen with a large beard and long hair. We learn that the movie fast-forwarded 4 years without any of us seeing what happened in that time. While I won't spoil anything, Chuck attempts to take his life out to the unpredictable sea, desperate to see the world again.<br/><br/>Of course the rest of the movie will be up to you to see. For me, Cast Away is a great film to see about resilience, will-power, perseverance, you name it. But any movie could show those traits. How good does Cast Away do though? I think it does pretty well. It shows how desperate Chuck was when he was starting the fire, and how hard it was to take his life venturing out to the sea. He even talks to a volleyball, in which he pretends the volleyball says stuff back to him. But the perseverance the film attempts to show is when he was so lonely for so long. The writers make some of the scenes uninspiring like when was hunting and fishing, but also very unique, when Chuck was talking to Wilson. A lot of the movie could be viewed as boring, but it is definitely not uneventful. Everything that happens in the film means something in the climax and ending. The beginning is 'meh'. I think it accurately portrays the struggles of his job, but how it is nothing compared to what will happen later. The initial landing on the island is very interesting. I was quite curious as to what an average Joe would do in those desperate measures. Tom Hanks is especially well in this role. Hanks shows the curiosity and panic of someone with those unlucky circumstances. He masters the role of being by himself virtually the whole plot. That role would make or break the film, and Tom Hanks definitely ""made it"". It was an Oscar worthy performance by Hanks.<br/><br/>There were not a lot of 'negatives' in Cast Away. I think the story would not even be as close to as good as it was if it were not for the great performance of Tom Hanks. The dialogue between Wilson and Chuck would have been 'pushed' if it was anybody but Hanks. He drove the movie forward in bleak scenes, and took control over the movie. The writers did a fine job of showing the perseverance and willpower it took to try to survive on the island. The movie was dependent on Hanks' performance, and he killed it. While the film is Tom Hanks' dependent, Cast Away is a unique journey through the eyes of a desperate man's will to survive. That is why I give it an 8/10."

","This is the most favorite movie of mine. You are bound to enjoy the full movie. It starts slowly and after around 10-15 minutes the non stop thrilling begins which will keep you glued to the movie till the end. The way Tom Hanks tries to survive and inspire himself is really amazing. A must watch movie for all kinds of movie lovers. We all try our best to survive; this movie reflects that effort perfectly. Even a simple volley ball ""Wilson"" becomes a good companion of Tom in the lonely island. ""Cast Away"" does not show any magical or absurd tricks to survive that is why it appeals more to the viewers. You may feel yourself trapped in the island while watching this movie as the movie is so engaging. You may have watched ""Life of Pie"" but this one is way better than that."

","This film is very interesting because it shows a story of survival, in ""Robinson Crusoe"" style, something not very common in movies. It consists of a deep psychological drama, which brilliantly explores the despair, depression, the need to survive in extremely harsh conditions, homesickness, loneliness. If we add to these features the particularity of the film has virtually only one character during most of the time (Helen Hunt plays an essential role in the plot but appears very little), could be expected a film absolutely still and lifeless. But it's not the case. The film uses the psychological ups and downs of Chuck (the main character, played by Tom Hanks) to keep moving and avoid dead times, finding space for great moments of tension and hilarious moments of humor. Hanks is a highly capable and talented actor, able to suck his character to the bone and do a first class job, truly chameleonic. Literally, Hanks carries the film with the back thanks to this superb performance. The sets and shooting locations are also worth a positive word."
"Horror-yo","7","0","0","24 September 2016"," Good but left hungry at the end
","This is one of those films that seems to set up everything in the story for a massive emotional landing, with a lead actor like Tom Hanks, the same director as Forest Gump's, and this incredible journey the protagonist goes through... one could feel that something great is in the brewing process. But not really. Not at all, in fact. The very beginning is pretty boring up until the crash scene which is amazing, and much more intense if not brutal than one would expect of such a mainstream production while not being overdone either. Just a great cinematic moment on all accounts.<br/><br/>Then, it was very ambitious to make a film with such a main idea. The film goes on 2hrs25min, and the bulk of it does take place on that island. And yet it never gets boring and as an audience we're spontaneously mandated to participate in the adventure as being people ourselves we immediately relate to the great difficulty of surviving both physically, and mentally in such dire conditions. The film does a good job staying fresh from scene to scene, and not bordering on the purely depressing realm this easily could've dwelt in.<br/><br/>The problem is a highly forgettable final act, it's made clear at the end that there isn't any of that earlier high promise that will be fulfilled and a very ordinary and flat-out weak, if not also ambiguous and unclear in itself conclusion to a story that seemed to possess immense potential on an emotional and human level. Some elements that seemed important get a very plain and often disappointing resolution in the ending narrative, and one really would've wished for a much stronger depiction of the protagonist's relationship with his dearest love of his life, something of a deeper kind with parallels back and forth between his current, hindering life and the one he longs to get back."
"Tweekums","9","0","0","7 September 2016"," Tom Hanks is all alone of a tiny South Pacific island
","Chuck Noland is an executive with global delivery company FedEx and he is obsessed with punctuality that is until the plane he is travelling on goes down in the South Pacific during a storm. He is the sole survivor and when the storm is over his life raft has washed up on a small island. He quickly establishes that there are no other people around and it isn't much longer before he realises that there is no immediate likelihood of rescue as the plane was four hundred miles away from its designated flightpath due to the storm. All Chuck has to survive is his punctured raft, a few FedEx packages that washed ashore and the limited food on the island. He will learn how to exist in a far more primitive manner; lighting fires without matches, cracking coconuts and catching fish; he will also have to cope with no medical help when he injures himself. His only company on the island is 'Wilson' a volleyball that he has drawn a face on and increasingly talks to whether this is a sign of insanity or a method of preventing it is hard to say. The only other things keeping him going it the knowledge that he has a loving fiancée back in his hometown and one FedEx package that he didn't open and is determined to deliver one day.<br/><br/>For a film that is over two hours long surprisingly little happens once our protagonist has been marooned on his island; that does not mean it is boring though. This is almost entirely down to Tom Hanks' performance as Chuck as we don't see another living soul from the time of the crash till almost the end of the film. That is not to say that nothing happens and his location means that things that would merely be unpleasant become life threatening. Some of these events are fairly wince inducing such as the time he is cut on coral and the less said about how he deals with a bad tooth the better! Without going into too much detail the film's conclusion is suitably bittersweet. As previously stared Hanks is great; the camera is on him for almost the entire film and he makes us believe in his character even when he is having a conversation with a volleyball. The rest of the cast inevitably have much smaller roles but they are impressive enough too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody who doesn't need none stop action."
"CadenR22","10","0","0","24 July 2016"," My favorite film of all-time!
","This is definitely one of my favorite films, if not my favorite film of all time! It is really, really underrated! There are so many great things about this movie that I can't possibly explain everything, but I will explain some things on why I love it so much. First, lets start with the acting. Tom Hanks delivers an outstanding performance! Never once is he monotonous or boring. You actually feel his emotion and it is just him on the island. The acting just has so much raw power, it is insane. Also, you better like Tom Hanks, since it is just him on the island, or you probably won't like this movie (but then again, who doesn't like Tom Hanks?) Now, I want to talk about the plot. I'm not going to reveal every detail or anything, but I just want to say that I like survival stories, and this is no exception. There is also a romance aspect to this film that I love, and also like how it isn't just straight-up romance, but it is subtle almost. Also, Robert Zemeckis directed this really well. Also, how is there so much emotion in this film? I felt sad and also started developing feelings for the characters, like Wilson and Chuck. Finally, I want to talk about the amazing cinematography. The amazing camera shots that they use are some of the best that I have ever seen. Also, the island allows for some good cinematography. Beautiful blues, lush greens, bright yellows (from the raft) makes for one of the best color palettes I have seen to date. Really, the cinematography is just breathtaking. Just such great scenery makes this a movie to see on Blu-Ray. No color grading present, just beautiful natural colors. Also, I mentioned camera shots. They really are some of the greatest shots that I have seen. Basically, just watch this movie. You will NOT be disappointed. One of the greatest films of all time and so incredibly underrated."

","I like how Hollywood takes gambles with films from small or simple scenarios. Sometimes they don't always work. Examples of this as successes are Phone Booth or My Dinner With Andrew. There are a couple of moments that suck or don't work in Cast Away, as with Hank's make believe friend, Wilson (a volleyball with a face or was it on a shaved coconut?) where it gets in quite pathetic waters. Hanks in a deservedly nominated role, plays driven non slack ass Fed Ed boss, Chuck Nolan, with solid conviction. He makes one two many deliveries via plane. Towards the end, he says to girlfriend Hunt, who he loses after a four year absence, ""I should of never got on that plane"". He was right, but of course then, we wouldn't have a movie. When his transport Fed Ex plane, goes downs in the Pacific, en route to some place, he being the lone survivor (another Fed ex passenger, that being ex Aussie soap star, Vince Martin) he washes up on shore, with a few scattered Fed Ex boxes, one that apparently saved his life. Another has a brand new pair of ice skates, and you don't want to know how, he utilizes them later. Hanks pulls off the role beautifully with the business of the actor, who given so much opportunity to live this movie, if in the real situation where he has to get his bearings, and fend for himself, sometimes subjecting himself to real agony (you might want to reschedule your dentist after seeing this) The plane crash sequence was thrillingly well done, where there are some real nasty moments, and some really big waves too, amidst a killer thunderstorm, some heavy blood shed prefore. What too I also liked about the film, was the moments Hanks shares with girlfriend, Hunt over Christmas, and a little of the inner conduct and aptitude when working for Fed Ex. And also, I liked the after (probably the best part of the film) where Hanks returns, where it was not all roses and a sad realization came to light which in reality, made sense. Hanks blown opportunity to go off with a redheaded hottie, well that didn't make sense. On the whole Cast Away, is another of these great films about the triumph of the human spirit against the most impossible of odds. A wonderfully put together, inspiring, well shot, and scripted movie, with attention to realistic survival themes of our hero survivor. The CU whale scene is beautifully shot and many a wondrous sight. Hate Hank's beard too, but you'll never forget Wilson."
"bbewnylorac","7","0","0","1 July 2016"," Very good film
","For a big Hollywood film, this is good. As ambitious Fed Ex worker Chuck Noland, whose plane crashes into the Pacific and who washes up alone on a deserted island, Tom Hanks is great. The cinematography by Don Burgess is lovely. Director Robert Zemeckis keeps a tight pace and engages the viewer constantly, despite just one character, little dialogue and one location. The plane crash is shot brilliantly - just as you'd imagine it would be like. One minute you're doing something trivial, the next, the plane is diving towards the ocean. You feel like you're inside the plane, and you can see Chuck thinking, this it it. The film has a lot to say about how consumerist and shallow we are, and how utterly work obsessed and ignorant of what really matters Chuck is before the accident. On the island, he proves to be both incredibly vulnerable and incredibly resilient, as he learns to feed himself, find shelter, and even create an imaginary friend - Wilson the volleyball. It's to the credit of Hanks and Zemeckis that the volleyball Wilson -- yes, an inanimate object - - almost seems human at times. On second viewing, I understood the ending. I love the final scene. But most of the coming back scenes go on for way too long. Hanks and Helen Hunt don't have much chemistry. Maybe the situation of Chuck's resurrection after being dead is just too hard to act out. I like how Zemeckis is very serious about what a tragedy, what a loss his four years without human interaction have been. And he depicts well just how harsh, unforgiving and godless Chuck's life as a castaway is, The choice Chuck makes to leave the island is rightly seen as a momentous one. If he stayed, he could have continued to eke out a living, but it was a pretty paltry existence, with a poor chance of ever being rescued. By building a raft and paddling out into the ocean, he risks death, but also gains a greater chance for salvation. The most effective feeling the film evoked in me is 'what would I do in the same situation?' So it's a film with both empathy and sympathy for the enormous bad luck that befalls Chuck."

","Up until two days ago, I had never seen Cast Away. Not once in my life. I know, try not to have a heart attack. I knew the whole story, each and every beloved plot twist mapped out for me by eager friends, word of mouth, online fare and pop culture over the years. I just never sat down and actually watched the darned thing. Well I did two nights ago, and damn if I didn't wish I'd done that sooner. It's every bit as incredible as I've heard all this time, and more so. It's one thing to know everything about a film just because of its notoriety, and quite another to see it, obviously. I experienced every scene, every landmark event in the film for the first time ever, and my foreknowledge of it did not dampen one wondrous second of the experience. Few films bring you as close to their protagonist as this does, for two and a half patient, spellbinding hours in the life of a man whose path has taken a turn for the extraordinary. Tom Hanks is the right guy for the job, and then some. He's immediately likable and exudes currents of good nature and humility. Perfect casting choice. He plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx honcho with a busy life that scarcely makes room for his doting girlfriend (Helen Hunt). One Christmas eve, he's forced to run out on her for an overnight package flight. As we all know, his plane crashes somewhere in the South Pacific, and he's forced to survive on a deserted island for almost half a decade. We feel every empty minute, every momentous triumph right alongside Chuck, from the first dazed stroll along the wave speckled beach of his new home, to the final, raging ditch effort to find his way back to civilization. Director Robert Zemeckis let's this larger than life tale unfold with steady, earnest shots and a down to earth score, a very simplistic approach that let's Hanks do most of the heavy lifting. And lift he does, in a performance of sheer courage and transformative qualities. We see Chuck go from suburban joe and real world businessman to a near feral being, forged into something more than himself by the same forces that govern and mold the geography which he now inhabits, while never losing his humanity in the wild chaos. The time spent stranded is sandwiched between two segments that bookend the film, in which we see his life in civilization before, and eventually after his experience. The impeccable pacing tricks the audience into feeling like we've been watching this play out for as many years as he's been living it. I mean this as a profound compliment to the filmmakers and not to say the film ever drags, in fact, for a two plus hour running time it feels surprisinly slight. It all rests on Hank's shoulders, and he carries it beautifully, selling this man's plight with truth, humour and resilience. An experience for the ages, and one that you should see right out of the gate in your cinematic exploration, as opposed to waiting till your mid twenties like someone we know. Masterpiece."

","Cast Away demonstrators the struggles between man verses wild. Chuck Noland (played by Tom Hanks) is on his way overseas to help fix a production and processing problem at a FedEx station. Chuck is an expert at this, and he loves his job. He loves his job so much that it has kept him from getting married to his longtime girlfriend, Kelly Frears (played by Helen Hunt), because of him always leaving unexpectedly. Right before he boarded the plane, though, he finally decided it was time to give Kelly the ring. While on the plane, chaos suddenly takes hold when the plane starts to shake around. Before he knows what is happening, the plane is falling very rapidly into the ocean. Chuck is the only one on the plane who survives the crash, and he manages to float to a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Now all alone on this island, Chuck has to not only figure out how to survive but also get off the island. For four years, Chuck lives on the island until he finally manages to create a raft that can withstand the powerful waves. After a large boat rescues him off the raft a few hundred miles from the island, Chuck finally returns home to find Kelly. Chuck's worst nightmare comes true when he finds out that Kelly had in fact moved on and got married. Now Chuck has to start his life all over, and move on from everything he had lost and missed while being on the island.<br/><br/>A main theme in this movie is how devoted people are to things they love. Chuck had such a will to live and survive because he had promised Kelly he would be right back from his trip. He did not like having customers wait for their packages in the mail, and he did not like knowing he was keeping Kelly waiting for him. Another movie that displays this theme is the Titanic. Jack was willing to freeze to death in the cold water so Rose could be safe on the board until help came. Rose was also willing to lose respect from her family by wanting to be with a man of much lower social ranking. Rose was willing to lose her family, and Jack was willing to lose his life, all in the name of truly devoted love.<br/><br/>Cast Away did a very good job in showing how a situation like Chuck's can change a person mentally. Chuck started to talk to a volleyball and considered it his close friend. The producer also used this as a good way of having Chuck talk to something instead of just talking to himself. The movie also showed the physical changes Chuck went through. After being on an island for four years, Chuck lost a lot of weight. His teeth were yellow and his hair was very long and dirty. This helped make the progression in time seem more realistic.<br/><br/>During the entire time Chuck was on the island, all he could think about was Kelly. He would draw pictures of her on the walls of the cave he was living in. He was also willing to risk his life and leave the island on a small raft because he just could not stand living there without her anymore. Through Chuck's strong devotion to the woman he loved, he was able to survive an unthinkable situation we all hope never to have to experience."

","***Possible Spoilers*** Castaway is a movie about loneliness, discovery, and figuring out what is truly important in life. A FedEx employee that works too much ends up having life changing experience when his plane goes down on business trip. The main character of this film is Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), and he spends most of the movie by himself on a deserted island. Because he worked all the time he didn't get to spend much time with the women he loved, Kelly (Helen Hunt). This ends up being one of the main driving forces for Chuck while he is fighting for his survival. Chuck has to dig deep from within and conjure up every survival instinct he can think of to stay alive. Being stranded alone on island can show you what you're really made of, albeit he got lucky he was traveling with FedEx packages that washed up with him. After spending years on this island, the number one driving force for Chuck was his love, Kelly. He wanted to get back to her so badly and that's what kept him fighting. <br/><br/>The sounds in this movie are so wonderful. They make you feel like you are in the mist of whatever is on the screen. You really get the sense once the plane starts to go down. While Chuck is on the inflatable raft you almost feel you are right there with him, getting hammered by waves and the raging storm. When he gets washed up on the island, you get the feeling of emptiness. All you hear are the sounds of the sand beneath his feet and the waves crashing in on the shore. When he yells and you can hear the hollow of the lonely island, you really get the sense of sheer aloneness. <br/><br/>They way this movie is cut together works perfectly. The scenes move seamlessly from one to the next. Even when there are time jump scenes, the editing team does a great job making it work. My favorite editing decision made was that of the rescue scene. I won't give it away but you'll know it when you see it. Overall, I think this film was very well done. They did a great job telling their story, while keeping things interesting. I believe the story they were trying to tell was that you have to dig deep and fight for the ones you love. Just like in Cinderella Man, even when he thinks he can't do it anymore he thinks of his family and it gives him the necessary drive to keep going. This is similar to the determination that Chuck gets when he thinks of Kelly. Even though this movie takes place primarily with one actor, I think the team that worked on this did a great job and in my opinion it was very well done."

","Where do I start, I have lost count of the times I have watched this beautiful film. Tom Hanks performance is perfect, but there is more, the overwhelming feeling I am left with at the end of this movie, is that you can overcome anything and what you think you may have lost may not be as good as what you are about to receive. I believe that Helen Hunt's character, came into Chuck's life so that she would simply be his guardian angel through the hell that was the desert island and its isolation, she helped him survive! After his ordeal, he had changed and she had changed, he had become almost worldly and his experience allowed him to become aware of what was really important and what wasn't. She either appeared to have become or perhaps the pure genius of this film made me feel as if she was boring or staid compared to the person Chuck had become. The angel wings on the FedX package, was such a constant throughout the story and I choose to believe that he ends up with the woman at the center of the creation of those wings. The message: people come in and out of our lives for different reasons, we may not know the reason, or we may mourn when they leave or move on, but it is all part of our journey and with a little bit of faith and luck we can all end up where we were supposed to be at journey's end.

","Cast Away (2000): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Nick Searcy, Chris Noth, Jenifer Lewis: Intriguing yet overrated film about regret. It regards what Tom Hanks casts away and spends long secluded time regretting. He is the head of a Fed-Ex delivery service and Helen Hunt plays his girlfriend whom he departs in a car. They exchange Christmas gifts before he makes a mad dash for a plane. A nasty storm causes the plane to crash into the ocean. Hanks is washed ashore and for four years an island is his home. He learns how to make fire and uses various objects that wash ashore as tools. After placing his blood covered hand upon a volley ball, he creates his only friend just by marking facial features. Terrific island footage with ideas throughout but the conclusion is not satisfactory. In fact it is down right depression from a certain angle. An achievement for Robert Zemeckis who successfully takes us into Hanks's thinking and vulnerability. While Hanks remains resourceful, supporting roles are out performed by the volley ball. Hunt's role is too obvious, as if we are to be surprised what Hanks learns by the third act. Nick Searcy and Chris Noth are featured in flat roles. This is a film where a volleyball steals more moments than the supporting cast. Theme regards mending bad decisions and getting back on the road to recovery. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","How did Tom Hanks do it?<br/><br/>First of all, I wanted to say that the emotional quality of this film was impeccable. <br/><br/>Chuck Noland is played brilliantly by Tom Hanks, to be honest I believe he brought unmatchable emotion to this film.<br/><br/>Well, Wilson is a volleyball who is a great addition to the film. You must be thinking how is a volleyball a important part of a film? I will tell you this now, you have to watch the film to feel what the volleyball brings...<br/><br/>Obviously the graphical quality might not be up to the flabbergasting quality it is at today, as the film was made in 2000, though it is fine and shouldn't be discarded for its age.<br/><br/>For a film shot a number of years back it still could get a high scoring box office taking. Of course Tom Hanks is a great actor and has starred in numerous films; but being able to talk to a volleyball and mean so much pure emotion is a wow factor for this film.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film to anybody who is an adventure movie fan. <br/><br/>What a masterpiece of a film!"

","Tom Hanks is an incredible actor. He never ceases to amaze his audience. He's truly alone in over two-thirds of Cast Away. Chuck (Hanks) is a Fed-Ex manager who ends up stranded on a small island after the plane crashes that he's aboard. Much hardship and toil follow, as Chuck tackles with the forces of nature. There are no stand-out scenes, no music, no non-diagetic sounds, only Hanks and the materials he can use around him. It's a absolutely phenomenal performance, sorrowful and weirdly joyful, with Hanks at his best when he's alone. His single friend, Wilson (a football), almost resonates human emotion through Hanks' communication with him. Robert Zemeckis has done well with relying on their solitary performer."

","I can't say much about this stunning movie that others haven't said before me but I did want to remark on a few memorable things. The deeply portrayed emotion between Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks - utterly sensitive and spellbinding. The plane crash scene, probably the greatest cinematography and special effects of such a scene in all of cinema. Makes the shaky-cam effects of TV's Mayday look like rank amateurs. Also Alan Silvestri's magical, haunting score. Without that score it would have been a loss for the movie equally as great as when Chuck loses his one true love. Sometimes you are so blown away by a movie that you can't even get up to leave the theatre and just here the composer treats us to his masterful work. It washes over us like the waves on the island. Beautiful."

","Lost-at-sea/stranded-on-an-island movies apparently agree with me. ""All is Lost"" and ""Life of Pi"" are a couple of perfect modern examples, but ""Cast Away"" does a fairly good job as the stranded-on-an-island variety. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away"" features great visuals and a miraculous gathering of greater actors. Helen Hunt is Chuck Noland's wife...and Chuck is played by the one and only Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Chuck and Kelly are happily married, always happy to see each other once Chuck gets back from his journeys (he works for FedEx). It's around Christmas time, but Chuck has to leave anyway, and heads out on the plane...until something unknown happens to the plane to cause it to go out of control and crash and make Chuck the lone survivor. He floats up on an island and does his best to survive, wisely using the FedEx boxes that get washed up on the island. Even, Wilson, the volleyball, comes in handy helping him keep his sanity (although sometimes all it seems to do is make him insane). He struggles at first, taking an infinity trying to light a fire and open a coconut. Eventually, though, his experience grows and he acts like he was born on the island, surviving until he can get a raft built. While he works, he makes small chat with Wilson, even jokes around with him a bit. ""You want to hear something funny? My dentist's name is James Spalding."" He looks at Wilson a bit, expecting him to laugh, but apparently Wilson didn't think it was funny.<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" can be a bit dull sometimes, or slow-going, but it is also thoroughly entertaining, especially near the climax. When he gets back home, it turns out that he's not as happy as he thought he would be. Although the time on the island is enjoyable, the heart of the film lies in his return and what tragedies await him...and the chance to start a new life.<br/><br/>82.5/100"

","If you are feeling lonely and nothing is working for you. This is the movie you should watch. This movie will motivate you not to quit, keep patience and focus on your work, whatever the situation. Directed and produced by Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away"" is an American adventure drama film released in 2000. This is a great movie in which Tom Hanks (Chuck Noland) a FedEx employee stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific. In the film, Wilson the volleyball serves as Chuck Noland's personified friend and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted island. He learns to survive and doesn't loose hope. He stayed alive even there was no reason of hope as he believed that the sun will rise tomorrow. Who knows what the tide could bring?"

","Director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite after working together in the 1994 Oscar-winning film Forrest Gump. Setting the two-time Oscar winning actor in a powerful story of survival and hope, this adventure delivers a story that embraces an intense and emotional character study of a stripped away from his comfortable life on civilization and casted out in a lonely world where only the strong-willed survive. The film stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEX executive who goes on a business trip overseas. However, when his plane caught into a nasty storm and crashes, killing everyone on board except him, he finds himself stranded on a deserted island thousands of miles away from home and his girlfriend Kelly (played by Helen Hunt). With no one to contact for help, Chuck must test his physical, emotional, and mental skills to survive on a deserted island until someone comes and finds him. In the process, he finds a volleyball in an undelivered FedEX package. After cutting his hand, he gives the ball a face using his bloody hand print and befriends the ball as a companion, and names it 'Wilson'.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis blesses this film with an ingenious script and story telling, and Tom Hanks delivers an endearing performance as the main character. This film deals with a man with finds himself loss on a deserted island with absolutely no contact with any individuals, and must transform himself to a new person to survive a place where there is no ""real"" food, technology, or communication. How Tom Hanks' character develops is quite amazing and really moves the story along at a fairly effective pace. As the story progresses, his body becomes thin, his grows an excessive amount of facial hair to where he resembles a cave man, and his meals are reduced to crabs and fish he catches in the sea. He also begins having verbal conversations with a volleyball as a way coping with his loneliness. While there is little excitement to experience, the film always managing to keep the story alive and moving, and all this thanks to its captivating screenplay by William Broyles Jr. There are some emotional points towards the second half that have the potential of making sensitive viewers shed a few tears. Luckily these scenes are done in a manner that allow viewers to express emotions rather than manipulate them into sadness.<br/><br/>Cast Away is Robert Zemeckis's best film behind Forrest Gump and Back To The Future. It is a film that tells a brilliant story of survival, courage, and loss. How this film didn't receive any Oscar nominations other than Best Actor and Best Sound surprise a bit. Overall, this movie is nonetheless satisfying."

","Believe it or not,until last night,I had never seen this movie. I'd seen snippett's of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn't seen it. I made one attempt about 2 years ago,checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged. Finally though,my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it. He's seen it several times.<br/><br/>My overall impression after watching it was,""Wow,what an amazing story"". The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy. Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever.<br/><br/>The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done,as were the scenes of Hanks' character surviving the angry seas. Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island. Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test.<br/><br/>He finds food,makes shelter,works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival. All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket-watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane. Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he'll return to her someday soon.<br/><br/>After 4 years pass,he's still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality. He's taken to painting a face on a soccer ball (with his own blood) and nameing it ""Wilson"",as it says on the ball. ""Wilson"" becomes his best friend.<br/><br/>Finally (and quite amazingly) near the end of this,another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds. It's actually a credit to Hanks' acting when ""Wilson"" falls overboard into the ocean and floats away,Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend.<br/><br/>Upon being rescued and getting home,he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return. Se's remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him.<br/><br/>His now ex-wife realizes she shouldn't have listened to her friends & family who said she should just ""let him go"". Which gives us a slightly ""hollywood"" scene of her calling to him & chasing after him in the rain as he's driving off. They still love each-other but the damage is done.<br/><br/>With the life he knew gone he's now at a complete loss as to what he's supposed to do with it now. The ending really doesn't provide a clear-cut answer but merely hints at it. I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is,""What would I do if all this happened to me""? I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging,moving even a bit suspenseful (if you've never seen it. The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch.

","I absolutely love this movie. The photography is amazing, and Tom Hanks hits the ball out of the park with his role as Chuck Noland. The sadness that Noland feels upon learning that Kelly has married another man is passed along to every audience member by Hank's great portrayal of Noland, unfortunately making the Chris Noth character (Lovett) the most hated character in the movie. The movie is an adventure and a love story, even though the love story takes place (for the most part) without the presence of the woman he loves. While there is hope for a Chuck Noland future with Bettina, I found it difficult to forget about the obvious love of his life, Kelly (Helen Hunt)."

And I'm not talking about the plane crash scene which was just impressive. Look at the track records of Robert Zemeckis (before the perfcapt movies) and tell me he's not a good director. The narration here works so well because it's always focused on something, mainly Tom Hanks, and never wavering, and all the drama is channeled through him. When you think about it, there's only 1 character for 1h30 of the movie (unless you count Wilson as a character) and it's never boring.<br/><br/>Only the end felt a little flat, Tom Hanks is basically mute, and we don't really experience how what he's gone through has changed him.<br/><br/>In the end it's basically a very well made and thoroughly researched mass entertainment movie, which of course has these little annoying 'merican narrative things (Tom Hanks is SO good at his job, he loves his wife SO much), but it moved me, so kudos."

","The central story, Tom Hanks' character surviving a plane crash, being the sole survivor, and spending four agonizing years surviving on an uninhabited island is well done. After watching the film 3 o4 4 times, some detail jumped out at me that I hadn't previously noticed, or just wasn't paying enough attention. There are two women overshadowing Hanks' spiritual/physical journey. There is Kelly, the love of his life who becomes a ""lost love"" with the passage of time. Then there is Bettina, first merely a symbol (the orange wings) on the one FedEx parcel that Hanks decides to hang on to in case he gets rescued. Before his ill-fated air trip, the sign on the Texas Ranch says ""Tony"" and ""Bettina"". Over the passage of time Tony and Bettina (who we do not see or know) have become uncoupled just as Hanks' character and Kelly are uncoupling because of separation. Hanks is sustained by the pocket watch mounted photo of Kelly and to a lesser extent, by the presence of the ""Bettina"" parcel. Near the end of the film, when he is back on the mainland, he has to come to terms with the loss of Kelly, while simultaneously if not knowingly opening himself to finding new love with Bettina. Love lost; love found. An interesting juxtaposition. This is, as stated, a more cameo part of the overall story but one which should not be lost sight of--for what can motivate a man to survive against all odds is the possibility of finding new love to replace the one lost?"
"schroeder-gustavo","9","0","0","30 June 2015"," Fascinating
","Cast Away is an excellent film. It has a great performance by Tom Hanks, the script is smartly written and the cinematography is great. I believe the movie has two flaws: one, too many characters are introduced in the beginning and in the end which really aren't relevant and the second one is that the early 2000's CGI really doesn't hold up. There's a scene in the movie where you see a whale and it just looks really fake. But these two things are minor, really, and don't really affect the movie experience.<br/><br/>This is also one of the saddest movies in my opinion. There are two moments in the film that get me every time in tears: when Wilson drifts away, and when Hanks goes to Helen Hunt's character's house in the rain near the end of the movie. Hanks' great performance only adds feeling to these moments. The last act of the film usually gets a bad rep, which I really don't understand because I think it is an essential part to the movie and the last scene is the perfect ending, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Cast Away is heartbreaking, touching and often hard to watch. It is also a great film."

It takes in his darkest moments where he believes the only way out is suicide - and you don't judge him. It makes you start o think what you would do in his circumstances, and I'm sure for most people the option of suicide would cross your mind on more than one occasion. The transition of his life after he does manage to get off the island and get rescued is superbly portrayed. He comes back to a world that is just as lonely even though he's surrounded by people.

"Gideon24","8","0","0","16 April 2015"," Another triumph for Hanks and Zemeckis
","After winning Oscars for Forrest Gump, star Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis teamed up for a 2000 epic called Cast Away, a compelling and well-made drama but, for me, a very difficult film to watch, with minimal re-watch appeal.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Federal Express whose life is changed forever when he is involved in a plane crash, which he survives and ends up stranded on a deserted island for four years. No episode of Gilligan's Island here as we watch this man, initially in denial about what has happened to him, anticipating rescue in a few days but as time passes, he can no longer deny what is happening to him and must learn how to survive, while simultaneously trying to cling to his sanity, evidenced in an actual relationship he develops with a volleyball, which he names Wilson and takes care of like a newborn baby.<br/><br/>This film is challenging because it goes places where other plane crash dramas have never gone. For example, there is a horrific moment when Chuck actually discovers the body of the pilot of the plane and goes through his wallet. I don't ever remember a film like this where the body of someone who didn't survive was even mentioned let alone revealed. The film also takes its time in having Chuck accept his plight. I like the way Chuck keeps his clothes on initially because he really thinks he's going to be found quickly, but eventually he starts wearing less and less to the point where he is just in a loin cloth and his pants are now covering his head. Even common health issues come to the surface here when Chuck develops a toothache and has no choice but to pull the tooth out himself, a scene I literally cannot watch anymore.<br/><br/>Director Zemeckis employs a keen eye for detail and realism here...this film contains what is probably the most frighteningly realistic plane crash I have ever seen in a movie. The moments before the plane hits, the panic in the pilots voices, Chuck's iron-fisted clutch of a picture of his fiancée (Helen Hunt), it all rang true and was just horrifying to watch and when Chuck was literally underwater trying to fight his way out of the plane, I was literally holding my own breath. Another Zemeckis touch to ensure realism is that after the initial scenes up to the plane crash were filmed, he shut down production of the film for a couple of months to give Hanks time to lose 30 pounds, to make his desperate diving for fish in the ocean look more desperately authentic and to show that Chuck was no longer eating regularly.<br/><br/>Zemeckis also knows how to make his viewer squirm, particularly in his depiction of Chuck's relationship with Wilson...the moment when Wilson falls off the raft and Chuck is unable to save him is heartbreaking and pathetic. You feel for Chuck while at the same time, you can't help but think, ""Uh...it's a volleyball.""<br/><br/>One of my absolute favorite cinematic pictures occurs in this film as well...the shot of Chuck's raft quietly floating in the ocean as a giant ship floats by right next to him.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully made and tells a very difficult story. Tom Hanks received a richly deserved Oscar nomination and Helen Hunt makes the most of her small role as his confused fiancée, but this film is really hard to watch. Putting myself in Chuck's shoes was a very uncomfortable experience that I don't wish to duplicate. It's a superb movie and I'm glad I saw it, but I have no desire to ever see it again."
"ElMaruecan82","8","0","0","23 March 2015"," A time-challenger man caught at his own game ...
","What if ""Cast Away"" was only focused on the Island sequence? Say, five or ten minutes of exposition, the pivotal plane, crash, the Island and then make it end with the freighter passing by an exhausted Chuck Noland on his raft? Maybe it would have puzzled many viewers but I think the movie would have worked better.<br/><br/>That ending would have been the film in a nutshell : a man overcoming the limitations he inherited from comfortable and convenient modernity in order to domesticate wildlife, to make everything we take for granted a challenge worth to triumph over, and to find over patience and intelligence, the strength to go back to civilization. ""Cast Away"" was the modernization of the stranded-in-an-Island myth, of the Robinson Crusoe figure, something that was begging to catch the eye of a talented filmmaker, which it did.<br/><br/>The before-and-after are only important on a minor screen writing scale, yes we have a character's arc to close, a man who starts as a cocky workaholic employee for FedEx and then discover that there's more in life than stress around the clock, if you try to challenge time, beware that time challenges you (that would've made an interesting tag-line) We've been through that thousands of times anyway, so why wouldn't Zemeckis trust our intelligence and spare us the whole sequence of Chuck 'learning his lesson' while he's back to ordinary life? <br/><br/>Indeed, the film is told through Chuck's perspective, like him, we find ourselves confined in a hostile world, after a spectacular crash sequence, we discover the island through his eyes: the loneliness, the silence only covered by the perpetual sound of tides, the darkness only enlightened by the shining stars. It's nature at its most majestic and scary. Then step by stem, through a meticulous and patient directing, we see Chuck trying to get over each step of comfort: finding anything that would make shoes, food or habitat. Anything with what is at hands.<br/><br/>And no matter how famous Robinson Crusoe's story is, or how used to Survivor reality shows we are, this is cliché-proof, because although we know it's a matter of time before he learns fishing, before he makes fire or ropes, Zemeckis opts for a documentary-film like precision that keeps our eyes hooked on the 'how' rather than on the 'when'. We don't have time to wonder what will happen when we're fascinated by what we see. And Tom Hanks brings so much naturalness than we share every feeling he has, even the ache on his teeth and the inconvenient self-made remedy he makes, is something we can oddly relate to.<br/><br/>The trickiest part of the film is with Kelly (Helen Hunt). She represents his last connection to the real world, but for some reason, I wasn't impressed by the flash in / flash out sequences on her little picture in the pocket watch. She's his love life, okay. He was about to propose her before the crash, got it. But didn't he have parents? Cousins? Friends? The character of Kelly was made like an artificial synthesis of every human relationship in Chuck's life it made the ending even more incongruous, as if Chuck was just a man of his job and a woman. Then having lost one, he had to focus on the other. The romance was too predictable for such an epic start.<br/><br/>And I'm sure ""Cast Away"" would be regarded as a masterpiece had it focused on the Island, not just a classic film of the early 2000's. The only emotional climax it deserved was the farewell to Wilson. Yes, Wilson! The film's ticket to immortality, a character made of a Volley Ball with a bloody hand that drew a smiling figure, a hazard leading to Chuck having finally someone to speak to. Wilson confirms what was hinted in the pilot's burial sequence, a man needs to be a man, and one of the first manifestations of civilization were funerals. A man needs abstractions, he needs to communicate and that's what Wilson is, and we're so in-line with Hanks performance that we take Wilson as a person too, and his disappearance is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>And it was necessary, because that was the only way for Chuck to lose the ultimate connection with the Island, to be normal again. At one point of dementia, he was almost going to drown just to catch a damn volleyball, this was the final test before finally getting back to his senses, and waiting for either death or a boat to catch him. The death of Wilson, so to speak, was the only possible climax. Having Chuck getting back to life and discovering all its insolent accommodations of modern life, sleeping on the ground, having troubles is important on a broad way, but not within the context of the film.<br/><br/>So, why not leaving that for our imagination? I thought a man like Chuck would become an instant celebrity, would publish a book, would understand Kelly getting married, would get back to his family etc. etc. Oddly enough, Hanks plays the second Chuck like a kind of Forrest Gump whose slowness would result from that trauma. It's like watching a whole other film. A pity that the film gets drown in cinematic conventions for a concept that asked for more simplicity and straightforward narrative, and I suspect the film would have garnered more awards and nominations had it focused on that, and if Zemeckis was so eager showing the aftermath, then make a two-part movie and leave the Island for this one.<br/><br/>The Island sequence was enough to make a masterpiece or in other words: why would you put a cliché kiss-in-the-rain scene in a film where the most memorable relationship and interaction is between a man and a volleyball !!!"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","2 January 2015"," Story of a plane crash survivor
","""Cast Away"" is the film that reunited actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis after their massive success with ""Forrest Gump"" a couple years earlier. It was written by William Broyles Jr., the man who wrote ""Apollo 13"" previously, another Hanks movie. Here the two-time Academy Award winner is basically in every single scene from start to finish and that is especially mentionable as the film runs for almost 2.5 hours. Other parts are played by Helen Hunt and Chris Noth, who I really liked on ""Criminal Intent"".<br/><br/>Anyway, back to Hanks and the performance that won him another Golden Globe and almost brought him his 3rd Oscar. The first half hour, we gain an insight into Chuck Noland's life, work and family, especially into his professional life as a FedEx employee giving training courses in foreign countries. After the 30-minute mark his plane has already crashed and he made it to a remote island, where he fights for survival for many years until finally, after he decides to sail away, he gets picked up by a cargo ship. The last 40 minutes or so then take place back in civilization again and we see how he struggles with his now remarried wife and life in general. That was one of the very few parts that I did not like at all. If he is truly the love of her life, she also should get back together with him and there is no real excuse for staying married to Noth's character. I don't really need a happy end (it somehow was one looking at the very last scene), but if they make it somehow unhappy, it needs to be at least realistic. Maybe they should have kept it without the two meeting again and just ended it with Noth leading Hunt's character to the car.<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the best parts of the film is the constant approach to time, the way he talks about it before the crash and how he has basically found his peace at the end not trying to beat it anymore. Most of that happened on the island, where also the majority of the film takes place. We see how he fishes, hunts, tries to make fire, is thirsty etc. pretty much everything you would expect. And we also see Wilson the Volleyball of course, one of the greatest performances from an inanimate object in film history. He serves as a person being with Noland on the island, so he has somebody to talk to and won't go insane due to lack of human relationships.<br/><br/>The title ""Cast Away"" is certainly not only a reference to him being on the isolated island, but also about everything what happens when he is rescued. There were a few moments on the island during which I felt it dragged a bit and I don't really feel the need to watch the film anytime soon again, but as a whole I enjoyed the outcome and would recommend it. It came in 2nd most-seen film after ""The Grinch"" in 2000 and it is certainly a good quality movie with a stellar lead performance. And if you have already seen and enjoyed this one here, let me recommend you the more recent similar-themed ""All is Lost"" starring Robert Redford (unless you have seen that one too)."

","I initially didn't intend to see this film, but did so when a good friend suggested that I watch it And that it was one of his favorites, I decided it was worth checking out. I wasn't expecting any major emotions for a setup like this(a guy is stranded and has to get back home) And didn't have very high expectations, but this movie just blew my mind with how down to earth and simple it was, yet how much heart and dedication was put into each and every frame. First, the positives that I praise are (obviously)Tom hanks performance as chuck Noland, a caring yet very serious and dedicated boss, and its very hard not to like him. He isn't a jerk, and doesn't boss anyone around, hes just a guy that wants work to get done. He travels on a FedEx cargo plane right after he proposes to his girlfriend, but the plane crashes, leaving him stranded on an island with no means of communication. His character is very believable and realistic, and is pretty hard not to root for. Aside from that, i have to praise how the movie was so natural and realistic, it had no music for the entirety of chucks stay on the island. I didn't even notice it, and it was amazing how well it was done. The special effects are quite good, but do falter occasionally, like when chuck sees a whale while hes on his raft, it doesn't really look too real. One of my favorite points has to be Wilson, his volleyball companion. At first, i figured there was nothing to him, but i found myself actually saddened when he drifted away from chuck during the trip off the island. There are very few things I have problems with, namely the time span of the movie. How on earth did no one find him in four years? He clearly saw a ship once before, wouldn't one have come there? It just bothered me the whole time. All in all, this is an amazing movie, and another masterpiece by Robert Zemeckis, who had the balls to actually consider this idea, let alone make it."

","Cast Away does an incredible job using cinematography to convey a message. Film makers using extreme long shots to show distance and the enormity of the island. Close shots are also used to make you feel secluded. They are used to make you feel like there is nothing else around except for Chuck and you as you are watching it. The directors did a create job with just casting one actor (Tom Hanks) and using him without dialogs to portray everything that was going on. There were incredible aerial shots of Chuck standing on top of a large cliff that is over the island and ocean to show how massive that the island itself is and how high up that Chuck is. Panning shots were also used very well to make a specific area of land or body of water to seem longer or bigger than it actually is. Symbolism played a big role in Cast Away. It created multiple ideas in an audience's mind of how the movie could go. The use of natural lighting made the overall film quality better. <br/><br/>If you love wondrous, slightly intense dramas then Cast Away is for you. It does not keep you on the edge of your seat but it keeps your mind always thinking ahead about how this story could possibly end out. If you enjoy just a little romance and not an extreme amount you would also enjoy this movie. This movie is for all types of people. It is not over dramatic and girl like. It is for both guys and girls. If you like feeling a part of a setting this movie will give you that exact feel. If you love adventurous movie shots, such as, views from a top of cliffs and underwater then this is a movie you will come out of wanting to watch over and over."

","Cast Away is one of the few movies that I had watched multiple times. It begins with Chuck (Tom Hanks) who works for FedEx and is always rushing around the world and living by the clock, often against his girlfriend's wishes. At Christmas he is called to travel to Malaysia to solve a problem, just before he can pop the question. He promises to return, but a storm and resulting plane crash change his life forever.<br/><br/>While on an uninhabited island for four years Chuck lives on his own, learning survival skills during this time, with Wilson (a volleyball) as his only companion. Despite his situation, he has hopes that one day he will escape and return to his family and to Kelly. After building a raft, he manages to escape the island, but loses the companionship of Wilson (the only friend he's had during his time on the island).<br/><br/>When Chuck finally makes it back to society, he encounters problems just as great as the ones he had on the island, finding that no one was as loyal as Wilson (Kelly has married someone else, his family held a funeral a while back, etc). Once again, Chuck is stuck on an island, but on an emotional (not physical) one, since everyone has left him behind. At the end of the movie, he is left at a crossroads, having to decide where he will go to start a new life."

","It is all all about shedding the ego. Chuck has a HUGE ego. Not in the sense that he is a jerk or selfish but in the Buddhist way definition of ego: he think he can control everything (ego) and lives totally in time (ego) and puts his job first, because it creates a sense of order (ego) and so on. He puts more stock in giving Kelly a ring at the car than staying behind to be with her for the holidays because, to the Ego, a ring is more important than the relationship. Ego loves symbols and form more than what is behind them. However, the universe endlessly tests his ego by showing him that he is actually powerless. Which he cannot accept. First, he is in Russia and he gets the clock that he sent himself and it took many days to get there and shows him he is out of control. But he makes that everyone else's problem and even steals a kids bicycle to speed up the package delivery. he is willing to do anything to regain control rather than accept any powerlessness. Then his friends wife is dying and he , again , can't accept his own powerlessness and suggests a doctor to ""fix this thing"". Which, of course he can't. It's death. Since Kelly knows what he loves best, she gives him a watch because time is the only thing he finds valuable (ego). And then the plane goes down. On the island he is endlessly shown how powerless he is, and again wont accept it. He cant make fire, he cant eat, his tooth is decayed. But he wont accept it, he keeps trying to overcome it with reason. He still is collecting packages. Finally, he cant even kill himself correctly. At this point, is his first glimpse at a higher self because, later, when he tells the story to his friend, he say that when he realized that he couldn't even kill himself, a ""warm feeling came over him"" and stayed with him. This is his first moment of enlightenment, a forced realization that he is totally powerless and thus a moment of forced alignment with something higher. Then it takes four more years of ego battering before he has let go of ego enough internally to be able to just float where the winds take you (as Lao tze says) ... literally.. as a sail comes in. <br/><br/>But when he gets home, his dormant ego flares up again, as it tries to control the uncontrollable, he still hasn't totally learned. So he tries to get Kelly back instead of accepting the situation. thus he is still on the island in his head which is a metaphor for separateness. ""No man is an island"" The island IS Ego itself.<br/><br/>in the third act, every time his ego flares up and he is trying to control things again ... there is a clock in the background. he is still stuck in time. Again, his ego is pummeled and he must accept his own powerlessness. And then finally, BOOM, it really all comes at once. he lets go. He accepts his own total powerlessness totally and gets in a car and gets to a crossroads having no idea, for once in his life, where he is going. At which point, his angel arrives. His angel tests him one last time. She tells him that to the right is Flagstaff but back the way she is going is ""a whole lot of nothing"" In the end, he looks back toward nothingness (the direction she is going"" and we know he is going to choose the road to nothingness instead of the known destination of Flagstaff, because he has released his ego, accepted powerlessness. He is now capable of drifting powerlessly toward nothingness which is really not nothing at all, it is an alignment with the Universe. Especially so, because the cute girl with the wings lives in that direction and they may fall in love. One last great thing here. When he went to her ranch to leave the package. She has removed the Name ""Dick"" from ""Dick and Bettina"" and this now, it only says ""Bettina"" . From a symbolic perspective, the ""Dick"" (male organ/ ego) has been removed which represent man and power and only the feminine power is left, the return of the feminine power is associated in Joseph Campbell as mans realignment with God. Bettina which in Hebrew means ""God's Promise"". And finally, he stand on a cross. (crossroads) resurrected. Wow.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: To shed the ego, totally accept your powerlessness. You will be tested again and again till you genuinely do this. When the ego is shed, then the true self, the one aligned with the Universe and God. Can emerge and take you where you need to go as you are now part of the whole."

","""Cast Away"" shows that a person's life and dreams can all change in an instant. Not only does Robert Zemeckis show the affects death has on close individuals, but also he shows the affects it can have on the world, or in this case a company. Zemeckis portrays a message in this film that if a person does not keep up with the world, the world will pass them up with out any thought.<br/><br/>Cast Away is a film which captures the audience with a story of love and nonstop adventure. It puts the audience in a place which can only be imagined. This is a very well acted film, because even after having only one person on the screen for over an hour and still it has the attention of the viewers.

","""Castaway"" was moving and powerful. Although Hanks relationship with Helen Hunt should have been developed a little more, as the relationship between those two was vital to the story, and could have enhanced the empathy of the viewer for the situation he later finds himself in. However, Helen Hunt doesn't really turn in a spectacular performance here (the only roll I really liked her in was in As Good As it Gets) and it may be for the best that she doesn't get a tremendous amount of screen time even considering the length of the movie.<br/><br/>This film I think further cements Tom Hanks in the roll of the Jimmy Stewart of our time; he is again cast in an ""everyman"" role, in which he so excels. The main character is an intelligent, interesting, straightforward, good, honest, unassuming person that I found easy to like and to sympathize with.<br/><br/>This movie is not filled with fireworks, and if you don't like movies that take their time and move at a steady pace, rather than racing from crisis to crisis, you might not be that enthused. This really is more a drama than an action movie. I do like movies that allow me to get to know the characters involved, and I did quite enjoy it. I have recommended it to friends."

","I watched the DVD which has been sitting around for years, just so i would have something to do for a few hours, but came out amazed! Many people misunderstand the whole movie, saying it didn't have enough action or the four years with Tom Hanks on the island was too long. I myself think that the entire movie was well balanced and well done.<br/><br/>The movie showed extremely well how you would try to survive on an island by yourself. It showed the challenge of hunting your food, creating fire so you could cook you food, and mainly STAYING SANE! The one thing that kept Tom Hanks' character sane (or at least some what sane, he does talk to a vollyball) is Helen Hunt's character, but we never really got to know her, because later Hanks finds out(when he gets back) that being with her again, is not possible. Sort of ironic.<br/><br/>Many people thought the ending was horrible, but i think it shows well the many choices that Hanks had to face. By putting him in the middle of the intersection, he must go one way, and that direction may change his life. The woman that came and told him what there was each direction, was not a ""replacement"" for Helen Hunt, but merely another choice, and kind of a guide by telling him what each road lead to. And anyways, she is better looking if he does end up with her, so good for him!! In conclusion this movie was very risky, because of the lack of dialogue and action (after all he is on an island for four years by himself) but Tom Hanks was able the pull it off and give and excellent performance. I could not have chosen a better movie to watch when i need something to do. You can find this video for probably not that much money these days. I recommend strongly."

","Baseball. Cool Ranch Doritos. Tom Hanks. What is more American than these three things? That's what I thought. Nothing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks will forever be America's funny, charming Uncle. He's a guy you want to be like, makes you feel better when you see him, and most importantly, you are sure he would like you too. He's the kind of guy who could be stuck on an island with only an ugly sweater and a volleyball, and you'd still want to watch him do his thing. And if you've had dreams like this, I know I have, you're in luck, because there's an entire movie with this exact premise; Cast Away.<br/><br/>Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a hard-working, oft traveling FedEx honcho. He's well liked and respected, and all signs point to Chuck having found the woman for him in Kelly Frears (Hunt).<br/><br/>It seemed like just another routine flight aboard a FedEx plane, to which a smiling Chuck says to Kelly, ""I'll be right back."" The rest as they say... is history.<br/><br/>It as at this point that we get to see the true talents of Tom Hanks really take flight (no pun intended). After a truly amazing plane crash sequence, this becomes Tom's movie.<br/><br/>Hanks literally transformed himself for this role, gaining and then losing 50+ lbs, and growing his hair and beard so long it that surely made ZZ Top question their own follicle abilities. After years on the island, the result is a rugged, fish catching, shelter making, fire starting, tiny shorts wearing survivalist who would no doubt make Bear Grylls proud.<br/><br/>Hanks is nothing short of mesmerizing on screen. As one of the most recognizable people in the world, it's not easy for an actor of his stature to completely fool the audience in thinking it's somebody else on that big screen, but Mr. Hanks rises to the challenge again. This is not Tom Hanks, this is Chuck Noland; A man thrown into a situation few will ever experience. And in becoming Chuck, Hanks has shared with us one of the greatest performances the cinema has ever seen.<br/><br/>I will not go into the specifics of what takes place on that island. That is for your eyes only.<br/><br/>This is simply a great performance in a phenomenal film.<br/><br/>Go watch Cast Away.<br/><br/>Thank me later."
"hnt_dnl","9","0","0","22 July 2011"," Perhaps Tom Hanks' greatest film performance
","Interesting that it was the early 90s where the critics and Academy started recognizing Tom Hanks as an actor of considerable depth and universality. I really think it's A League of Their Own in '92 that got the ball rolling; Hanks totally stole and dominated an ironically female-laden film; Hanks SHOULD have been nominated Best Supporting Actor in a now iconic comic role as Jimmy Dugan. Then in '93 and '94, there were back-to-back Best Actor Oscar wins for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, respectively. Hanks was undeniably great in those films, but I still felt like the praise came a tad too early. I actually wasn't too keen on some of the nominees that Hanks was up against in those two years, so while I felt like he deserved his wins based on his competition, there were some actors who were overlooked in those two years that I felt gave career performances (Kevin Costner in '93 for A Perfect World and Johnny Depp in '94 for Ed Wood) that would have been my personal picks for those awards in those respective years. I guess the question at that point for me was, ""Did Tom Hanks just fluke his way to TWO Best Actor wins?!""<br/><br/>Then Hanks put my fears to rest! He continued his roll with Apollo 13 in '95 and it was evident that he wasn't going anywhere! The man proved he was great actor. Heck, he even was a success in his first directorial effort in '96 with That Thing You do! Then, of course he stars in Spielberg's powerful Saving Private Ryan in '98 (another Best Actor nom, for which I think he should have won), then the beautiful The Green Mile in '99 (in retrospect, I think that should have been another Best Actor nom) And it all culminates in this film Cast Away (2000). Hanks would receive his, to date, last Best Actor nomination. Right now, I'll say it, this should have been another Oscar for Mr. Hanks!<br/><br/>Hanks plays Fed Ex executive Chuck Noland, whose plane goes down somewhere in the South Pacific. Noland is washed away on a desert island for 4 years and must learn how to survive off of instinct, guts, savvy, and determination. After learning how to make fire (a great scene!), Noland copes day to day by making friends with one of the packages he was delivering, a ""Wilson"" volleyball which he attaches the same moniker to. I'm still astounded as to how Hanks pulled this off! Tom Hanks and a volleyball is one of the best pairings in Hollywood history! Of course Hanks went full method with this performance, literally losing a large amount of weight since his character had to live off of sparse island food for 4 years. But, of course, Hanks pulled it off, totally involving the viewer and putting us in his place. The great actors will do that.<br/><br/>Many complained about the late scenes of Hanks back in civilization, but I have no problem with them. They're really not that long. I liked the scene with Helen Hunt (Chuck's ex-fiancée who thought he was dead and had married someone else in his absence). It was emotionally involving and I love the music accompanying it with the rain pouring down on them. I also love the real ending, with Noland deciding to go cross country delivering the Fed Ex items recovered on the island, and then meeting angel on earth of a woman that you just KNOW Chuck ended up with! <br/><br/>Generally, I think Robert Zemeckis is an overrated director, with Back to the Future being his undisputed masterpiece. But Cast Away 2000 is definitely 2nd on my list of Zemeckis films. It is involving throughout without ever devolving into being boring or unbelievable. Hanks was robbed big time at the Oscars. This is perhaps his greatest role and film performance and should have been his 3rd Oscar!"
"compi24","10","0","0","16 June 2011"," Review of ""Cast Away""
","Robert Zemeckis' ""Cast Away"" is a movie that is not only a revolutionary piece of film, but it is as poignant and affecting as they come. One of the most interesting and, often, unsung aspects of ""Cast Away"" is that Zemeckis and his crew basically crafted this movie on the fly and during production. In fact, the whole concept of ""Wils...on The Volleyball"" was not conceived until about halfway through shooting. Another interesting aspect of the film is that a very large portion of it has no dialogue, yet it still remains highly entertaining experience. Much of the film's complexity comes from the incredibly moving performance as Chuck Noland, a FedEx engineer who is tragically separated from everything he loves. Which leads me to another point, and, possibly, my favorite aspects of ""Cast Away"" - the themes conveyed. The movie is deeply driven by the central idea that life can be cruel and unforgiving thing, but that shouldn't stop us from pursuing something better. This theme is accentuated to an enormous degree by the movies soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. Though the soundtrack is absent throughout most of the first half of this movie, the movie's main theme is slowly introduced towards the end of the film. It's a very solemn musical piece that effectively illustrates the pain the Chuck Noland experiences throughout the movie, but it also presents a sort of hopeful tone to the film. In the end, I feel that ""Cast Away"" presents a number of innovative and impressive techniques that, ultimately, make it a perfect film."

","Robert Zemeckis's film, Castaway is one of my all time favorite films and he can probably thank Tom Hanks for it as well.<br/><br/>The story follows a man by the name of Chuck Noland who works for FedEX and upon his delivery around Christmas he gets wrapped up in an unfortunate plane crash. Some how, he survives this crash which is probably the only strange thing I found about this film. Anyway, Chuck is washed ashore on a strange island kilometers from any other continent and is left to fend for himself. Personally, this is my favorite part of the film as well, as we watch Chuck experiment and use as many resources he can to survive the tormenting, 4 years he has been on the island for. The only thing that's keeping him from dying is his lovely fiancée and a wonderful, volleyball friend known as Wilson. I don't like to make fun of Wilson or Tom Hanks's role to speak to just a volleyball because it kept him from going insane. So, I really loved Wilson hehe.<br/><br/>Anyway, he finally gets off this island, returns to main land and sad stuff starts happening.<br/><br/>You can't hate this movie...and if you do then you're missing out on a lot or you just don't understand the film on an emotional level.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Yes, it's too long. Yes, there are lots of goofs. And, if you watch closely enough, errors of time and place. But, this is one movie that is worth watching closely. Even if, as I found at the fourth sitting through a TV showing, you have to watch a raft of cleverly placed product-placement ads. OK, we know that FedEx comes out of it well. And Snickers bars. And Wilson the sports goods maker. But it does not improve a movie to show ads for men's deodorant. Nevertheless, it is a truly absorbing show. On TV the film runs for three hours. But it remains watchable. Looking back at the several versions of this film that I have seen, it is apparent that many viewers have not seen the original hardtop version. An example: In one TV version, the suicide attempt has been cut. In another, it is elaborated in a conversation between Chuck and his friend. Perhaps television broadcasters have their own agenda with regard to timing of programs. In one TV version there is much footage wasted with no significant visuals. Is this so that ads could be inserted by local operators? I believe that good movies (and this is a very good movie) deserve better."

Wilson. love. the package.<br/><br/>Wilson was one of the core aspects to this film. Spend enough time talking to a ball and eventually it becomes family. Though i personally feel that having Wilson in the picture really was one of the only ways for tom hanks to have a conversation in the movie. Nevertheless Wilson brought a whole new dynamic to the screen play. Nothing more to add but to say the scene where he lost Wilson in the sea was so amazing yet sad to the extent of losing someone close to you. <br/><br/>His love for her was obviously strong and touching. When reunited the two no longer had the space to be together anymore. The reality of the situation is yet again so sad. A woman who lost the love of her life has moved on, while the man had survived the almost impossible. Both are positive scenarios yet when the two unite again, you actually feel worse for the lady. i felt mixed emotions watching them two unite again.<br/><br/>As for the package that Tom did not open, to me that package represented hope. So long as the package is not opened there would still be hope, or at the very least purpose. the package symbolizes the unknown, we all know that the contents of that package may very well useful to someone surviving on an island. But to leave the package unopened means that there is at least a last resort. To open the package meant discarding hope to ever leave the island. In the end at the crossroads, the lady in the truck yet again represented hope, and whether or not Tom followed that lady, or took another road, that is up to interpretation. To me, he did not follow the lady, because the lady represented the package. Instead of opening the small package, i think he would rather embrace the bigger package which is life that is full of uncertainty, much like venturing into the sea when he was stuck on the island. <br/><br/>This movie is great seriously."

But it's an extra-ordinary film, that is hopeful by nature. About 142 minutes long, 'Cast Away' is not about an isolated man, it's not about his sadness, but about love & hope. 'Cast Away' is film that has it's heart, mind and soul in the right place.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has gone down as one of Hollywood's most talented filmmakers ever. His body of work is impeccable and a true legend. 'Cast Away' is amongst his strongest and fittest efforts to date. William Broyles Jr.'s Screenplay is wonderful, with memorable dialogue. Cinematography by Don Burgess's captures each moment effortlessly.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Tom Hanks is outstanding. He is the most successful actor, box office wise, and as an actor, he easily ranks amongst the best in his dictionary. Helen Hunt is excellent, as well. Chris Noth also, is very effective.<br/><br/>On the whole, Such Films Come Very, Very Rarely! A awe-struck, Two Thumbs Up!"

Tom Hanks takes you through all of the roller coaster emotions that you actually experience during extreme loneliness.<br/><br/>Cast Away is just overall a brilliant film about what one man must go through to get back home. When Tom Hanks meets and becomes friends with his volleyball friend, (I'm not going to give out any names) you actually start to become attached to the object just as Tom Hanks was in the film. when what happens at the end happens, the viewer actually feels sympathy for the volleyball! That's how great this movie is! The viewer actually begins to treat the ball as a person! <br/><br/>Cast Away is an instant classic, and is a film that absolutely everyone should see."

","This is a film about survival. Having survived a plane crash, the plane sinking, and being cast adrift in towering stormy seas, the next stage of Chuck Noland's survival is the basic Robinson Crusoe problem of keeping the ""body"" part of body and soul together - solving the problems of not starving or dying of thirst, and of being sheltered from inhospitable elements.<br/><br/>This film shows us those trials and tribulations, but also makes it clear that Noland had difficulties just as great with the ""soul"" part of body and soul. He survived this (barely - suicide was not only considered but rehearsed) with the help of three psychological crutches. One was his companion Wilson, the volleyball which he turned into his constant companion and confidante. The second was the preservation of one unopened FedEx package - as long as that package remained there to be delivered, Noland held on to a reason for surviving. And the third was the thought of returning to Kelly Frears, the fiancée who was waiting for his return.<br/><br/>In the event, of course, his engagement to Kelly didn't survive. But even the demise of that engagement was something else for him to survive.<br/><br/>This film struck a good balance between true life adventure, action spectacle, and human drama. Hanks is always good, and Cast Away was substantially better than the sentimental drivel of Forrest Gump, his previous collaboration with Zemeckis.<br/><br/>I watched it with my wife and 24-year old son (who, unusually, sat in the same room with us to watch TV), and all three of us thoroughly enjoyed this film"

","Towards the end of the movie, Chuck tells his friend how he had contemplated suicide, going so far as to rehearse it. Now, Chuck is marooned on an island where the struggle to survive takes up most, if not all, of his energy, yet in order to test the hanging tree, he goes to the trouble of searching out a tree from which he can make a fairly realistic human-like figure. All he needed was a lump of wood of approximately his own weight. So, why did he do it? Consider that Wilson could represent an externalization of Chuck's conscience or Ego, so the tree-body would then represent an externalization of some aspect of his body, his Id or sexuality. And notice that Wilson is lost at sea, while the tree-man is left at the highest point of the island. It's as though Chuck takes his body back before he leaves the island, and takes his ""head"" back just before he is rescued and returns to the human world.<br/><br/>So, the question: if Chuck externalized his ""head"" and his ""body"", what part did he keep to himself, so that he remained alive?

However, the presentation is what counts, and this film is worth watching.<br/><br/>If you are ever experiencing something in your own life that seems insurmountable, and happen to catch this film, it may help suspend your disbelief, and actually make you feel better about life in general. After Hanks is stranded on a remote Pacific island, he realizes the frivolity of what used to be his life. He opens Fedex packages that contain a ballerina outfit, a greeting card and some other inane souveniers. He realizes the insanity of his predicament, and almost starts laughing.<br/><br/>Eventually he constructs shelter, and learns to spear fish; in his isolation he creates an imaginary friend, which is an alter-ego promoting his survival. These scenes were particularly well written. There is no sensationalism, no explosions, just a real person, trying to survive.<br/><br/>When he is finally rescued, his company (Fedex) throws a party for him- he sees the waste and futility of everyday life- lobster and King crab claws he lived on for a month are tossed in the trash.<br/><br/>He also loses his fiancé (Helen Hunt) to a dentist.

"tohu","8","0","0","30 May 2006"," Another good Hanks movie
","Tom Hanks is an interesting actor. Or rather, the reactions he provokes are interesting. There are those who love him and those who scratch their heads wondering why he has achieved such extraordinary success in his career. He is after all quite 'ordinary.' He is not a great actor, though not a particularly bad one. His main claim to fame seems to be his unfailing ability to generate sympathy from the audience for the characters he plays. You always 'like' Hanks in his film roles. Varied as they are, that's quite an achievement. And it is based on that very ordinariness that many of us seem to find perplexing.<br/><br/>Cast Away is a very good example of this. Hanks has to hold the attention of the audience for the bulk of the film, as he is the only human character on screen. The vast, inescapable power of the ocean and the primitive beauty of the island vie with him for that attention, but come off worst. He is certainly not the only actor who could pull this off, but it is still a neat trick and there were certainly many who felt in the run-up to the launch of the film that this would be the one that finally found him out as a rather average talent. It does no such thing.<br/><br/>He slowly draws you into the predicament of his character and persuades you to suspend the cynicism that might make you question a number of the events in the plot. And, true to form, he has you firmly on his side at all the most critical moments. The direction and photography both help to sustain the illusion of what you are seeing, and the plot - though faintly ridiculous - has enough meat in it to allow the drama to play out.<br/><br/>Though the period of isolation on the island is the main body of this film, one of the more interesting aspects for me was the way the character inter-acted with the real world. Without giving anything away, there is a deeply emotional thread to this story about an intense personal relationship that is destroyed by cruel events and this, I found to my surprise, provided some of the most impressive scenes towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Rating Cast Away was for me a decision between 7 and 8. I went for 8 in the end, perhaps generously, because it is basically a feel-good movie which works. You should not watch it expecting much more than that. Few deep human questions are asked here, and when reviewing the plot after the film has finished you conclude that - even as it held your attention at the time - it was in fact quite formulaic.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it is, as I said, another classic Tom Hanks movie. And these have become almost a genre in themselves. If you like The Terminal, The Ladykillers, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, you'll enjoy this film too - essentially for the same reason: the star himself."

It is a wonderful film of the more ""artsy"" side of things. The silence used in the film really adds to the movie, in a way that it becomes such a part of the feel, that without it, the viewer does not get that same feeling. There is an awful lot of time to think in this movie, but that is the point, time is the only benefit being stranded alone on a desert island can offer. To some, the film may come off as being boring and too long, but the rest will understand and begin to understand the plight of the character played by Hanks. It has an all too realistic theme to it as well, really, a good movie."

","This is a rather unusual take on the Robinson Crusoe deserted island survival tale. I agree with another reviewer who noted that it's the only movie where you get all emotionally attached to a volleyball. In fact, I was so attached that I cried over that foolish volleyball. Yes, I cried. For me, this film is all about Wilson!<br/><br/>The movie chronicles the survival tale of a workaholic Fedex systems engineer, Chuck Noland, whose plane to Malaysia crashes during a storm, stranding him alone on a tropical island with little prospect of rescue. He stays alive for four years by catching fish, copes with dental problems in a primitive manner, and keeps his spirits up by looking at a picture of his fiancé, Kelly, who's back home with no news of him. Finally, he builds a raft and sails off, hoping for a return to civilization.<br/><br/>During his isolation on the island, the loneliness of having no human contact forces him to come up with some sort of companion he can communicate with. This turns out to be a Wilson brand volleyball that he names...yes, Wilson. Wilson is really the co star of the movie and the recipient of Chuck's conversation. This dramatically illustrates one of the movie's main themes...just how unconsciously dependent we all are on companionship, even those of us who are not particularly outgoing. None of us realizes the devastating psychological effects of extended and complete isolation. <br/><br/>The film shows Chuck's various struggles on the island for food, water, and shelter. In fact, the island segment is the most interesting part, as far as I'm concerned, the earlier portion showing his relationship with Kelly (Helen Hunt) not particularly gripping. The earlier scenes serve mainly to outline his workaholic lifestyle, ever dependent on the clock.<br/><br/>I didn't object to the jump from his ship rescue to four weeks later, when he's reintegrated into society. However, I was disappointed with the movie's ending. I didn't mind that his fiancé, Kelly, has moved on with her life, married, and has a child (all as you might predict, given the circumstances of his presumed death). However, I found the whole crossroads scene at the conclusion ambiguous and unsatisfying, and felt I wanted a bit more information as to Chuck's fate, even if it didn't involve a love interest.<br/><br/>Other than that, a gripping survival story and touching tale. But I'll warn you, if you get too attached to Wilson, you'd better have your Kleenex ready..."
"MT-15087","Null","0","0","29 March 2004"," An Unconventional Piece of Mainstream
","Though this movie belongs to the department of Hollywood mainstream, it can boast a couple of devices that distinguish it from productions, normally spawned by this machine, and, at the same time, taking into account these devices' quite daring nature, render its tremendous box-office a bit puzzling. <br/><br/>The first one of them is, of course, that uncompromising with no breaks, regular dialogue or music island sequence which shows a quite memorable encounter of the hero with the ""benign indifference of the world"". This part of the film, especially the detailed description of the first days on the island highlighting how important our every step or action can - and, probably, should - be, reminds me of 1956 Robert Bresson's ""A Man Escaped"" that contains a meticulous report of an escape endeavour undertaken by a French prisoner during WW2.<br/><br/>In his usual merciless manner not only Bresson manages in his movie to render extremely important the main character's every single action and movement. He practically makes the audience ""fulfill"" them along with him, and thus creates tension beyond conceivable providing us with an actually ""physical"" notion of what it takes here to succeed (F.Truffaut called Bresson's movie one of the most accomplished attempts at creating a real time out of an imaginary one).<br/><br/>Similarly, Mr. Zemeckis in his one doesn't take the path of least resistance, and instead of just delivering a sympathetic character and emotionally involving situations makes us literally spend some time being encircled by the beautifully ruthless ocean and conjuring a spark out of damp wood (by the way, the French lieutenant's whispered recounting of his actions somehow corresponds to the dialogues with ""Wilson"").<br/><br/>And when the ""man escaped"" there comes the second device - which, I guess, has surprised, if not disappointed, those viewers who had been expecting a more conventional structure. And which evokes another allusion - this time to the similar structural device used in A. Hitchcock ""Vertigo"". In his masterpiece Hitchcock suddenly reveals the secret somewhat forty minutes before the actual ending and thus elegantly shifts the emphasis. He eliminates the mystery as a driving engine, but significantly amplifies for the viewer the dramatic effect of the heroine's final metamorphosis.<br/><br/>Here the escape from the island doesn't triumphantly round off the film either, but opens the third and, in a sense, most dramatic part of it - in which the protagonist goes back to the world that didn't get frozen when he had left it. And this part leads to the resolution that might seem not entirely satisfactory to some viewers, but, in fact, makes a perfect ending for this movie. Which does not probably avoid all clichés of conventional mainstream but, at least, gives it a good try. And, at the end of the day, manages to provide the audience with a fresh, in some ways bold, and in many ways touching contents."

It's right up there with Philadelphia (awesome movie) and Forrest Gump, which are the two movies he won Oscars for. He is such an amazing actor. The plane crash scene is very nerve-racking and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. But I just loved watching the scenes of him alone on that island trying to survive. I thought the fact that all he had to talk to was a volleyball named Wilson was very creative. Some scenes made me cringe, like when he had to knock that tooth out of his mouth with a skate and a rock. Ouch! I also cringed at the parts where he cut his leg on the coral and his feet on the sharp rocks in the water. Thank God there weren't any sharks around! This movie makes you think. What WOULD you do if you were stranded on a deserted island all by yourself? This film was also very sad. He loved Helen Hunt so much and he kept her picture all those years. Then he finds out she's married to HIS doctor and they've got a child after he's rescued. The scene where he lost Wilson was also kind of sad. That was his only friend for four years! The transformations that Tom had to go through to make this movie were also amazing. He truly is one of the best actors out there.

","""Cast Away"" is an excellent portrayal of one man's determination to stay alive, no matter how impossible the situation seems to be.  After a freak storm sends a Federal Express plane down in the Pacific Ocean, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is the only survivor.  Clinging to an emergency raft that he found during the plane's decent into the raging ocean, he eventually drifts onto a deserted tropical island.  He quickly learns how to survive in this harsh environment but reality sinks in as he realizes that there can be no rescue from this isolation.  After a while, Chuck begins to lose what sanity he has left and befriends a volleyball (Wilson) that he accidentally imprints with his bloody hand.  Chuck and Wilson remain on this island for three long years until the winds and tides are right for getting his handmade boat off the island.<br/><br/>Hanks does a brilliant job of bringing to life the agony and despair of being the sole human operator in complete isolation.  His monologues with Wilson (which he actually believes is communicating with him) keep him focused on making the boat and his undying love of his wife (Helen Hunt) keep driving him to strive against all odds.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9 and a half stars out of 10, because the ending is a little too open."

","I saw Cast Away in wide release two years ago and it  was a strong experience then primarily for Hank's marathon performance and the interpersonal chemistry between Helen Hunt and Hanks. But in my second viewing the film's deeper mythic level hit me. Few films go so deeply or for so long into one man's psychic solitude and what he must construct for himself psychologically when isolation and deprivation is imposed upon him. The fall from grace and all that comes after it, the watch, the wings, the burial, Wilsons arrival and departure, the rope back to the raft, the final visit with Kelly. Zemeckis obviously went to the wall for this film. It's not standard Hollywood fare, it takes all the time it needs, which accounts for the slams posted here by those seeking more spectacular mindless fare. No music, just the sounds of the environment. Hanks ain't gussied up either. Well shot, well scripted, well directed, and the elements rage. Hanks is even more brilliant in the final scenes of the movie than he is when left to the mercy of Planet Earth.<br/><br/>Cast Away would be unique opportunity for any great actor, and Hanks sinks his teeth into this. Sorry Gump fans. Forrest Gump doesn't hold up as well to repeated viewings. Hank's Gump character work starts feeling forced in a few scenes. His Chuck Noland in Cast Away is perfect and natural and shows him once again at the top of his game. 2000 Oscar goes to Hanks, not to Russel Crowe - my vote.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

However, the viewer may have a hard time staying awake by this time.

","I was surprised by the number of religious themes in ""Cast Away"". I should have suspected though, it's the story of a hard-charging yuppie go-getter who, because of a plane crash, is stranded alone on a tiny Pacific Ocean island. There he is forced to live by his wits, and keep his sanity while he waits for deliverance. <br/><br/>Knowing these story elements I was expecting to be bored to tears. The only reason for renting it was to see Tom Hank's performance. But no, I was not bored at all. The first quarter of the movie introduces us to Tom, his fiancée, and job as a FedEx troubleshooter. He's a nice guy, but something's missing. The fateful flight over the Pacific fills us with dread, and by the time the plane gets lost, we're on the edge of our seats. The middle half of the movie covers his castaway years on a tropical island, and how he learns to cope both physically and mentally. The final quarter of the film chronicles his escape and return to civilization. <br/><br/>Religious symbols and themes are all over ""Cast Away"", from the blatant (the angel wings on the only FedEx box Tom never opens) to the more subtle, (the cave iconography, and the meaning of the hangman's rope).  ""Cast Away"" is more than just a storytelling movie, there's lots to think about also. I highly recommend it for a family rental."

","Tom Hanks talks to a volleyball on a deserted tropical island. He remembers his boy scout skills to start a fire. He developes a taste for raw fish, and becomes quite a tailor, seamstress and boat maker. It sounds like outlandish stuff, but Hanks makes it work for me, at least while he is on that island. The movie loses steam, and some creative writing once he gets back to the mainland. It is almost like one person wrote the screenplay on the island, and someone else wrote the screenplay when he is rescued. I followed the plot while he was on the island all alone. I expectantly hoped as he found ways to cope, survive and win against all odds.  Back home again, people seemed harsher than the sea and its creatures. The final scene, in particular was really disappointing and a cop-out.

His busy time dependent life suddenly comes crashing down with him in a plane being the lone survivor on an uninhabited island. Tom Hanks then gets to experience a new life where time has no influence. While on the island you get to slowly suffer with Tom Hanks as he tries to live on the island. When he finally makes a tough decision of leaving or staying on the island after four years, he chooses to leave the island in hope of getting back to a different world. After 4 miserable years Tom finally sets sail on a long little expedition on a tiny boat made out of trees and logs. He gets spotted by a ship and then gets brought back to his hometown of Tennesse. While on the island he wants nothing but to get back to his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt). When he gets back he learns his dentist, Dr. Spalding has married his wife and he has lost her all over again. At the end of the movie, he stand in the middle of a 4-way interesection puzzled on the next move he should make.

","Much has been made of a few elements of this movie: the importance of the volleyball; the extended period in which Tom Hanks is the sole character (except for his schizophrenic conversations with Wilson); the package he returns at the end.<br/><br/>However, what struck me most about this film was the score--or, more accurately, the lack of it.  There are some standard pieces during the beginning segment (Elvis tunes, Russian symphonic/choral pieces, Christmas songs) but otherwise, there's no incidental music for about the first 1 1/2 hours of the movie, and no music at all during the extended island sequence. The first real appearance of the score is when Chuck leaves the island and reaches the open sea.  Even more remarkable is that the score stops during large portions of the credits, for just a recording of the pounding surf.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is almost as short on score as Shindler's List was on color.

Hanks is quite simply one of the greatest actors out there.  No this is not his greatest film, but I still put it in a category of being a great film.<br/><br/>The Fed-Ex thing is a little annoying, but its better to use a real company rather than ""Ye olde delivery service"" to bring some realism to the movie. I've only ever seen the movie in Japan so I've always seen it with Japanese subtitles and the fact that there are no subtitles appearing on screen for long periods of time give testimony to how powerful the movie is despite no real dialogue for about a quarter of the movie.<br/><br/>Chuck Noland goes through a real transformation during his time away.  We see him at the beginning being a company man who can't relate to his colleague on a personal level and who brings a beeper to Christmas dinner. By the end he totally opens up to his colleague and looks willing to settle into rural life with the woman at the end. He is also willing to give up the woman he loves, the old Chuck wouldn't have done that.  There is no way that this movie is about how shallow women are as one reviewer said.  I admit that 4 years is a little soon to fall in love, remarry and have a child, but anyone who has lost someone they loved would probably support her for doing this. The last scene is very strong.  Chuck only had one road ahead of him at the beginning, but now he has a choice.  I think most of us would like to be him standing at that intersection having a choice. And to those who felt Wilson had more character than Chuck, really just don't get it so its not worth informing you of the significance of that.<br/><br/>Simply put, a great film that really shows us what a materialistic world we have become and shows us what can happen when we are given a choice in life.

Firstly, this movie starts off in a quite confusing manner, we are briefly introduced to characters that we don't see again for 3 HOURS.  We think they are relevant when actually they are not.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plane crash scene annoyed me also.  The plane suddenly takes a dive for no reason, it was not hit by lightning or anything. Just before it crashes we can see from the cockpit window that the plane is diving at quite a steep angle. Into the sea. In a storm. At night. How could anyone survive? Beats me. Not to mention the fact that when Tom Hanks is in the water it is crystal clear, not pitch black, and he doesn't even have a scratch on his body from the impact. These may seem like petty things but it is not hard to make scenes relatively realistic.  The fact that it is ""only"" a film does not mean this should be an excuse to insult the viewer. When Hanks returns to his girlfriend after being rescued, she does not ask him a single question about his ordeal! come on! you think your man is dead, and 4 years later he returns and you don't even ask him how he coped or anything. Finally, that busniness with the unopened package. Why did he not open it? Why did it save his life? What was in it? Why did they not tell us what was in it?

","I personally hold the opinion that Tom Hanks is an over rated actor. I must admit that I haven't seen the Road to Perdition (it's not even out in Australia yet) a performance that apparently may change my mind. He has put in one truly great performance in his career, that being Philadelphia, his other major triumph was Forrest Gump, which was only really a good performance in a great movie. I personally liked him better in his earlier roles such as Joe versus the Volcano and the Burbs, back before he'd developed as an unmistakable presence in a film. The success of this film depended almost entirely on how the audience responded to Hanks. According to the poll I just voted in, the response was nothing short of remarkable. Not just that it made so much money, but also that no one seemed to notice that Wilson the volleyball seemed to have more of a personality than did Hanks' character. (OK, That one is a blatent lie, but I had to use it)<br/><br/>It's all the more remarkable if one considers that the entire film is one big commercial for Federal Express. A kind of cross between 'The Postman' and 'Robinson Crusoe'. They spend the first 20 minutes or so telling us how reliable the service is. Then we learn that the mail is so securely bound as to not become redundant and useless when it falls out of a plane into salt water and floats there for a few days. The real clincher is the film's final scene when Hanks' character actually delivers a package that he has been saving over the four years that he has been stranded on a desert island for.<br/><br/>Federal Express: Not even we can deliver this film from mediocrity."

It's indeed a worthwhile experience. ""Cast Away"" is a film with wisdom. It shows a lot of metaphors (sometimes with humor) to the truths we go through in life, and the one thing that it points out couldn't be more clearer to me by the time I finished watching the film. This film made me appreciate what life has to offer for me and eventually taught me more reasons why we shouldn't give up in life.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis's 2nd collaboration (Forrest Gump being the first one) in this film is an excellent idea. They're both geniuses in their fields. The rest of the cast and crew of ""Cast Away"" also did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Definitely a worthy movie to buy in DVD.

Eventually, the batteries die and has to work very hard making a fire to feel civilized again. But, if he had removed the front of the flashlight, he could have used it as a lens to concentrate the sun's light and easily have made a flame.

During a flight, his plane hits a thunderstorm that sends it into the Pacific Ocean.  Only Chuck survives.  He floats in a life raft to a deserted island with only a few FedEx packages as the only remains.  Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job directing while Hank's did an even more excellent job acting out two-thirds of the movie on his own.  The only dialogue during this time is when Chuck speaks to Wilson.  Wilson, the volleyball, comes from a left over FedEx package and has a face drawn on with Chuck's blood.  This movie has an emotional tug and it makes us feel just like we are on the island with Chuck.  The ending to the movie isn't the normal perfect ending.

Instead I was surprised by the complex themes examining the contrast between typical modern life of abundance and a scant life spent in solitude.  The pace of the movie was slow and contemplative, especially by Hollywood standards, without being boring.  This sparse set gave Hanks room to give a very personal and entertaining performance, and gave audiences time to digest the deceptively complex themes.  The ending was satisfyingly uncompromising.<br/><br/>The opening scenes show Chuck (Hanks' character) enforcing somewhat exaggerated yet realistic capitalistic regimens on simpler foreign cultures by training them to sort FedEx packages and measuring their competence down to the second.  But before long Chuck finds himself stranded on a small island with nothing to do, where the smallest unit of time is a day.<br/><br/>During what becomes a multi-year period of isolation, Chuck and the audience are able to reflect on what is simplest and most important in life.  And Chuck learns the important lesson that life is so precious that it is probably worth living even if it seems unlivable, and that anything can happen, both good and bad.<br/><br/>Chuck's eventual personal transition that leads to his return to the modern world is reminiscent of Buddhism's ""Concept of Emptiness"", wherein you must truly have nothing before you can gain enlightenment.  Chuck's perspective on the modern world after his ordeal should cause the audience to reflect upon their own position in the same world, and ask themselves how they would react if they lost things that they currently deem essential."

","My trip to my small hometown of Peterborough, Ontario included a visit to their new Galaxy Theatre. I must say I am impressed. In a city of 65,000 to see a theatre that would be at home in a major centre was quite a surprise.<br/><br/>
On the schedule for the night was Cast Away. One of the saddest lessons I learned was that importing a high class theatre does not guarentee a high class audience. My enjoyment of the film was harmed immensely by chatty idiots all around me. To quote Max Eilerson (from the criminally short-lived Babylon 5: Crusade series) ""I hate it when I go the movies with kids in the audience, because there's always someone there that tells me I can't kill them when they get loud. Now who makes up these rules anyway?""<br/><br/>
With that out of my system I'll move on to describe the film. First will come my spoiler free review and some spoiler notes will be at the bottom. You have been warned. <br/><br/>Cast Away dares a great deal. Only the attachment of big names like Hanks and Zemeckis could have gotten this movie made. And, to be certain, Hanks is amazing and should be considered the Oscar frontrunner as of now. His performance is very believable and the lengths he went to for the role should be given credit by many in the Academy. <br/><br/>Cast Away is based on a book and, before seeing the film, I read a review speculating the film would shy away from many of the darker aspects of the storyline. It doesn't. However, there is so much story to cover here that much of it has to be told in shorthand. This is not a film that spoon feeds its audience everything they need to know. You are expected to be able to fill in a lot of gaps yourself. It's refreshing to be treated as a thinking, perceiving being for a change (though judging from the comments of idiots around me they weren't up to the task; I guess I won't recommend the film to idiots which should only serve to enhance the moviegoing experience of others) but the gaps in narrative can be jarring at times.<br/><br/>
Still if the greatest fault of the film is that its reach exceeds its grasp that is only because it has reached very far. And a film that dares and falls short is far more satisfying to watch than a formulaic film that touches all the bases in a routine home run. I give Cast Away an 8 out of 10."

I thought that nothing could scare me in movies anymore but the scene of the plane going down was terrifying, and after the crash when he grabs the liferaft and surfaces, the lighting effects are fantastic.  I give this movie a 10, and if you don't agree then obviously you are perfect and take nothing for granted."

","...but devolved into typical shallow Hollywood fare. There were some really lovely, genuinely moving moments (like when he discovers a fellow passenger who perished in the airplane, when he is completely alone on the raft and is crying)but they were overshadowed by a lack of commitment to REALLY explore human terror and loneliness. They didn't go far enough into the insanity that was only hinted at. I found the stuff with the ball (wilson) annoying if only because it came off as cutesy instead of desperate.  I had a hard time believing that he was really stuck on the Island for four years and there was little to help alleviate this feeling. I was far more focused on the knowledge that Tom Hanks had lost all that weight and was thinking of the newspaper articles I had read. The real waste for me is that the filmmakers put their toes in the water at various points in the film which showed that there was the potential for more.  Robert Zemeckis should be made to take a page from the Steven Soderbergh handbook to see how you can make Hollywood movies with balls."

","Movies like Cast Away which center on someone trapped in a hostile environment are all about timing.  There must be adequate time for us to get to know the character before he embarks on his adventure, but not too much time or we feel the director is delaying the inevitable.  The time the character spends in isolation must be just right: Too little and we don't feel the depth of despair the character feel; too long and we get antsy. And the resolution must also be timed perfectly: If it happens too quickly it seems too easy; too long and we begin to feel exhausted along with the main character.<br/><br/>Director Zemeckis times ""Cast Away"" perfectly. Throw in an amazing plane crash scene and an Oscar worthy performance by Tom Hanks, and you have a good film.  Good, but not great.  Zemeckis sets Hanks up as a time-obsessed Fed Ex executive.  We want to see Hanks obsession with time change, but we don't get a clear payoff that it does.  The movie ends on an ambiguous note, leading us to question which way Hanks will literally head.  It's a question best resolved, but it isn't here."

"TheDemko","Null","0","0","23 December 2000"," Another confusing ending for Zemeckis (probable spoilers)!
","Just had the opportunity to see Cast Away with my wife. She liked it, and I wanted to like it, but the ending completely baffled me (but then again, most Zemeckis films wind up baffling me somehow).<br/><br/>The character Tom Hanks played, Chuck Noland, was quite believable, and most certainly well-acted. The scenes where he's by himself on the island were quite intriguing in the fact that he carried an entire hour of the movie alone, with no one to interact with (except ""Wilson"", of course).<br/><br/>Kelly, portrayed by the usually-uplifting Helen Hunt, was a very drab and even somewhat unnecessary character. Obviously, as the love interest, she was needed, but when Chuck got back to civilization, she might as well have been dead herself. The scenes with the two of them after he returns just seemed superfluous to the story.<br/><br/>But this all brings me to the ending, where Chuck is on the back-roads of Texas, delivering his final package to an ""angel"" of sorts. First of all, don't get me started on the package. The moviemakers could have at least let us SEE what was in the box, but noooo... Anyways, I didn't quite get the ending. What were Chuck's thoughts at that moment? Obviously, he's reached a crossroads, but from where? And to where? I honestly felt stranded on an island when I walked out of that film. The ending did NOT satisfy, and in fact, I just didn't get it."

Great movies have many underlying messages, and this flik a had a plethora.  Made me wonder how important the man made stuff is (ie. like the computer I am typing on right now)<br/><br/>2) The Immature ME:  Wow!  What a plane crash that was!!  I bet this is one of those movies that won't be shown on an airplane!<br/><br/>3) The Horny ME:  The lady at ""Bettina's"" was hotter than an egg on Route 48 in Texas (and in July).  I was teased to see that Hollywood had Helen Hunt running in a white blouse during a rain shower.  Unfortunately, I did not see any flesh beneath it.<br/><br/>4) The What-If ME:  Made me marvel at how much skill and luck Noland actually had.  Would I have been able to start a fire?<br/><br/>
and finally...<br/><br/>5) The Critic ME:  This was hands down the best movie of the year I have seen thus far.  It is not the best movie of all time, but it may crack the top 250.  Tom Hanks is incredible, however, the same credit should be given to whoever is responsible for selecting his movies.  The screen play was top-notch.<br/><br/>Any movie that makes forces you to draw upon your own reflection, is a worthy movie.  Cast Away reaches out to its audience like an older brother trying to save you from a bad accident, and when it grabs you it teaches you a lot of good things.  Should be a multiple Oscar contender."

I can't discuss specifics without spoiling here, but we learn about Helen Hunt's agonizing decisions only after Hanks gets back to civilization. It would have been more interesting for me to see what she was going through parallel to, and intercut with, what Hanks was dealing with on his island.

","My favourite Zemeckis films have always been Contact and Forrest Gump. Now his new film Cast Away is added to that list. Cast Away is the ultimate Man vs. Nature epic. This films starts off with Chuck Noland,(Hanks) a Fed Ex executive who takes his job very seriously in Moscow pushing everybody to make their deliveries on time you find out alot about his character in the way he handles his job. He is a person who always has to be on time. When he returns home to Memphis you meet Kelly Frears (Hunt)who is Noland's girlfriend. During a dinner party with family and friends Noland is unexpectedly paged and has to go to somewhere off the east coast of asia to deliver some mail. Hanks and Hunt quickly exchange christmas gifts in the car on the way to the airport. During the very realistic and intense airplane crash into the Pacific Ocean Hanks finds himself stranded on a uninhabited island. The movie takes a daring turn here. The film becomes a one man show as Hanks finds himself stranded. This could make or break the movie for you. Hanks now does what he does best to make this a very entertaining one man show. During his stay on this island you will laugh, cry, and most importantly think about what is in store for this very entertaining character. The comic relief comes from a volleyball named Wilson with a face painted on it with Hank's blood. Cast Away is really everything the summers blockbuster The Perfect Storm was not. I didnt really feel for the characters in perfect storm. Hanks pulls off the role of Chuck Noland magnificently. The cinematography make you feel like you are with Hanks on the island. And best of all Robert Zemeckis's directs this film with so much genius and poise he becomes one of the best at what he does again."

","How many actors would you pay to watch alone on screen for nearly an hour and a half? Casting Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a no-brainer.  Not many other working actors could carry this film or even Tom Hanks' loincloth.  Director Robert Zemeckis won the first battle just getting Hanks to star.  He won another battle getting Fed Ex to agree to be featured in the greatest product placement since ET's Reese's Pieces. Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Fed Ex, who flies from meeting to meeting on the company's cargo jets.  He has to survive one of those plane's crashing and learn to thrive on a deserted island in the south Pacific. I have to admit, I was thinking about the TV show Survivor as he struggled to catch food and make fire.  But, sadly for Chuck (Hanks), there were no reward challenges to provide him with the occasional call home or water proof matches. Cast Away is such an appropriate title for this film, because not only is Chuck a castaway, but for Hanks, the rest of the Cast is Away.  Most people feel Tom Hanks is a talented actor, but also an interesting person, I think, someone we'd like, if we hung with the Hollywood crowd.  And, whether that was Chuck Noland out there on the island or Hanks, I didn't get bored watching him get acclimated to his lonely life, because I cared about him. One of my younger co-workers says he was bothered by the fact that there was no soundtrack and the quiet of many of the island scenes.  I would hate to generalize by age group, but the silence didn't disturb me at all.  I didn't even notice it until later in the film when I thought, `Hey, they should have some big building orchestrated music here!'  I think the lack of background noise was perfect for the movie.  All you can hear most times is the relentless crashing of the waves on the beach and reef, and that's a terrific scene setter. Mostly, I love Cast Away for what was left out of the film.  There are some major questions left unanswered when the credits roll.  That's so cool! Studios seem to want everything tied up in a neat package at the end of movies.  Could Cast Away be the start of some novel trend?  Let's hope so. Cast Away is rated PG-13 for intense action sequences and some disturbing images, including the death of a toy. Cast Away earns three and a half stars, on my scale 0-5.  Bottom line, if you like Tom Hanks, you'll like this movie.  And, if you too live and die by time, be sure you've got two hours and 23 minutes to enjoy him."

","I came into ""Cast Away"" with a couple of strikes against me. Although I have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks, I hated the melodrama and sappiness in ""Forrest Gump"". And I'm not usually into dramas, because they're too deep for me. But since I'm an action movie guy, I figured there would be some action in the film.<br/><br/>There sort-of is. But the film is primarily a drama / thriller, with plenty of suspense about our hero's survival chances. Tom Hanks makes the movie. I can't say it plainer than that. The acting is so gripping, so compelling -- and keep in mind on a desert island he's mainly playing off inanimate objects -- that even though I'm not an arty type I just had to watch fascinated, similar to how in a good action flick I'm fascinated at how the stunt people put together the stunts.<br/><br/>The only negative comment I might make is that the end of the film was slow-paced and not entirely satisfying to me.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Everyone, even if you hate dramas<br/><br/>I'll give ""Cast Away"" a near-miss perfect 9 out of 10."

","Tom Hanks has yet again starred in one of the year's best films. After a little film about the AIDS virus called ""Philadelphia"", Mr. Hanks has been on a terrific film streak. Well his new film, Cast Away is another terrific eye-opener, about a FedEX troubleshooter (Hanks) who gets stranded on an island for four years after his plane crashed into the middle of the South Pacific. Chuck's last words to his fiancÃ©e, Kelly were ""I'll be right back"". A perfect touch to the film, that tells you of things to come. Chuck now must survive on his own both physically and emotionally without human contact and everyday devices that we all take for granted. The first hour or so after the crash has pretty much no dialogue, until Noland finds a package wash ashore. The package contains a Wilson volleyball. Well after Chuck cuts his hand; in pain he picks up the ball and throws it. It turns out, the blood stain on the ball shaped into a perfect face. Alot has been said about how stupid and unrealistic that a man would actually talk with a volleyball with a face on it for four years. Well I'll tell you something; picture yourself on a deserted island. Got it? Now here's the catch... YOU'RE ALL ALONE! You got absolutely no contact with anybody, and all you got is a volleyball with a face on it. I don't know about you but I'd go insane without anybody or anything to talk with. Wilson was symbolic to the other part of himself. He needed to talk to somebody (or for that matter, something) about the things he's learned in life, ideas, feelings, fears, jokes, stories, and memories. It's normal human behavior. We need some sort of a social life! It's impossible not to express your feelings with something, so he vented with Wilson. Let's also remember that he had a relationship with Wilson for four years! That is a very long time. The Wilson idea is very realistic and a perfect touch to the film.<br/><br/>Well after four years on the island, Chuck goes through many changes: his appearance and more importantly he has become much wiser. Chuck also managed to completely conquer the four of the basic human needs: food, shelter, water, and clothing. The film is about the human spirit and how strong it can become in difficult situations.<br/><br/>Cast Away is probably one of Robert Zemeckis' (Forrest Gump, What Lies Beneath, Back to the Future trilogy) greatest achievements since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". Robert Zemeckis is one of the most innovative and outstanding young directors and is definitely the future for directors and everyone should keep their eye on him... along with M. Night Shyamalan and David Fincher.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the best films of the year and will leave you breathless. For those who thought Gladiator was the best film of the year (this means you the Academy), what I ask is, why? Sure Gladiator was a great film, and I liked it alot, but Cast Away has a moral (as did Requiem for a Dream which I personally thought was the best film of the year) and will teach you to respect the things we take for granted like fire, clothing, a place to live, etc... So I believe that the Academy only gives the picture that was most popular the Oscar, and that is quite sad.<br/><br/>Go see the film and learn to respect the things we take for granted.<br/><br/>****1/2 out of ***** 9/10"

","I Love his movies.  They are filled with detail.  Sometimes you don't realize until a day or two later how much detail is dropped into a Zemeckis film.  It is in the details that his stories are really brought to life. At face value I would have given Cast Away a 5 of 10 as an average movie.  Then I started rolling over it in my head and when I awoke from a realistic dream about that tiny island Tom Hanks was deserted on I knew it was more the first washes across you.  You have to watch it more than once I decided. You HAVE to look for all the details.  The religious symbolism.  The Major Zemeckis theme throughout many of his films: Fate versus Free Will.  The Man Vs. Nature.  The Comedy is an average man's faults.  These are the things a Bob Zemeckis film explores and makes you feel.  <br/><br/>I loved this film. I give it a nomination for Best Director and I give it 50-50 odds of winning. I nominate it for Best Picture.  It will be a close race with Almost Famous and The Grinch.  Tom Hanks is definitely a nominee for Best Actor.  He was simply REAL.  There is no better performance this year.  Maybe an equal, but no better performance.  Amazing.<br/><br/>As I said, at first glance I didn't like it much.  The ending was something I didn't like.

","I liked this movie, but from start to finish, I kept feeling like something was missing.  I think what it may have been was character development.  I'm sure the director as well as the viewers wanted to get on with the main character getting deserted on the island but I think they hurried it a bit too much.  The whole time that Chuck (I think that's right) is on the island, we see just how much he loves his wife Kelly but we can't really relate because we hardly know her.  That's the way I felt anyway.  And even Chuck, we don't really know him, we know that he takes his work very seriously and allows it to take time away from his wife but that's about it. I just didn't really feel I knew the characters.  But the portion of the movie starting from the crash and the time he is on the island, I thought was very good.  I know many people would have laughed at the idea of a grown man making friends with a volleyball but I think if anybody was alone on an island for 4 years, they might be desperate enough to form a close personal relationship with a volleyball.  I might talk to an inanimate object after being left alone for a few hours but then again, I might be a little crazy... anyhow, overall, I liked the movie and I gave it an 8 but I thought it needed better character development. Tom Hanks did an excellent job but the lack of character development took away from his good performance I thought.  Also, I thought it should have explained that ""special"" package a bit more.  For some reason, this package meant a lot to Chuck.  I chalked it up to, well he had an intuitive feeling but I thought maybe I was missing something."

I think that's been done a time or two, and since I read ""Robinson Corusoe"" and ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" and have watched every episode of ""Gilligan's Island"" I didn't think this would be much more than a few wasted hours.  It just goes to show how low expectations can affect your viewing, and it also demonstrates how the ""lost on an island"" fantasy still appeals to us (hey, why do you think they have all those deserted island Top Tens and such). <br/><br/>
Of course this had some added attractions, such as the thrilling plane crash and the extended ego that is Wilson.  I also liked the fact that they continue his story after being rescued in some depth.  His welcome back into civilization and ultimate meeting with his lost love were well portrayed.  I guess the bottom line here is that if you can relate to the guy, and put yourself in his shoes, you will probably enjoy this one.  If you don't you probably won't.<br/><br/>Because so many have asked I will give my take on the unopened box.  He leaves it sealed simply because it provides the only sense of mystery he has left in his dull existence.  The reason he says it saved his life is that because the pondering of what was in it gave him reason to live.  And as far as the ending I think he's at the crossroads and thinking about the lady's advice.  It's up to you to decide which direction he takes.

","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. i kind of assumed it would be a melodrama not unlike Forrest Gump. And that is how it began. I thought it was going to be a very formulaic movie about a man who survives for a while on a desert island, escapes, and then reclaims his love. Fortunately, it is much more complicated than that.<br/><br/>Zemeckis and Hanks take a lot of risks in this film. There is a great lack of dialogue. This will alienate a large portion of the audience who is used to inane dialogue. They do find a way around it after a short while, by making a volleyball into a nonspeaking character with whom Hanks can converse. This does not particularly help the majority of the audience to get more involved in the film. In fact, to most people, it provided comic relief. There were many in the theater who laughed whenever the volleyball, Wilson, made an appearance. To a certain extent, it was supposed to be funny. actually, there were several parts that made me laugh. To a certain other extent, they were completely serious.<br/><br/>****************BIG TIME SPOILERS******************<br/><br/>several important critics have claimed that the last segment of the film is anticlimactic, where Hanks is rescued and has to reconcile with Helen Hunt, the love of his life, after a prolonged period of mourning and supposedly false hope married another man. Roger Ebert expressed his dislike for this section of the film. I don't think he or any other critics with similar criticisms were paying any attention. Yes, the survival stuff on the island was very exciting and interesting to watch, but the final sequence anchors the film and makes it truly special. Hanks' meeting with Hunt is so overwhelmingly powerful that it brought me to tears. For God's sake, the only thing that kept him alive on the island was her picture. Don't you realize that to leave us without a resolution on the most important plot point is going to disable the film profoundly? The scene where they meet is masterful. It is extremely realistic and subtle in its emotions. This must be Tom Hank's best performance, and probably Hunt's also (although she was masterful in As Good As It Gets, too). She is not in Cast Away for very long, but I think she should be considered for an Oscar. And since Hanks has won for far less good roles (i.e., Philadelphia, one of the most terrible pieces of garbage ever made in Hollywood), to not nominate him would be sad, and I am usually a Hanks detractor (I like him, but find him too unaffecting usually).<br/><br/>The finale of Cast Away has been equally debated. In my opinion, it was a small, symbolic, but tacked-on event: the delivery of a package that he decided not to open on the island because it had angel wings drawn on the side of the box. I don't care how symbolically the character interpreted the wings as being, that package could have contained something very useful and it would be ridiculous not to open it. I am very glad that the film did not end with Hanks trying to get the woman in the truck whose package he delivered. The real ending is actually quite beautiful. Roger Ebert calls the final moment of the film, a smile, ""forced whimsy."" I did not notice a smile. I did not interpret his expression as a smile in the least. Instead, it was a look of farewell. His character is now letting go. He is choosing to no longer try to run his own fate, but just allow himself to be taken along where the world takes him. Through his ordeal, he knows that it is foolish to try to control fate. The final decision he has to make is which of the four ways to go. It ends quite beautifully.<br/><br/>********************END SPOILER**************************<br/><br/>I do have a couple of complaints: the film begins very poorly with some very silly and formulaic scenes that establish Hanks' businessman ethics. If you ever find yourself on your knee outside of a car window about to propose to your girlfriend mere minutes before you step on a plane, stop and think about it. You are obviously setting yourself up for an imminent death. Please avoid this situation at all costs. The movie plot gods will strike you down, I promise you. <br/><br/>The biggest pain in the neck in this movie was the CONSTANT, NEVERENDING stream of product placements in this film. It should have had a large credit at the beginning of the film: Producer - Fed Ex. Tom Hanks' character is a Fed Ex exec, and the beginning of the film spends an outrageous amount of time telling the audience how good Fed Ex is. ""87 hours? We might as well be the U.S. Mail."" I once ordered something to be delivered by Fed Ex. They came four days after the company had told me they had shipped it. They came to my door, rang the doorbell which I cannot hear in my room, and walked away without even knocking at the door. I later found a note on my door that said that they would try again on the next delivery day, Monday, three days later, between the hours of 8am and 4pm. The U.S. Mail generally arrives at my house approximately 3 days after a company ships it, and even on a saturday. <br/><br/>The only other problem is an annoying third act speech, the sort of speech that reveals the point of the movie, even though everyone in the audience should have already figured the meaning out already. I still give this film a 9/10. It is the best Hollywood film of the year, and is the only Oscar type film to deserve even consideration for most anything."

","This film is as ambiguous as life itself and, for that reason, it does not provide a fascile, crowd-pleasing Hollywood ending. Are there flaws?  Yes, and I have a few quibbles myself. But imperfections aside, Cast Away is a highly unappreciated film which I enjoyed more than anything else I've seen in several years.  As for complaints about the ""4 years later"" break, what were the film-makers to do? Roll cameras daily, for close to a year, while Hanks shed over fifty pounds? Certain restrictions apply!  All in all, Cast Away (a pun, by the way--the character is a castaway who has been Cast Away from his societal identity) is a moving and compelling piece of work which gets better with each successive viewing.  Kudos to Tom Hanks, who gives an extraordinary performance, and to all involved."

","In life we all make our mistakes. Some cost us very little, and others cost us a lot. Yet it is what we do about these mistakes that makes a person who and what they are. While it was a different movie to experience, Cast Away gives the viewer an incite into what it is like to try and survive after nearly losing their life, in addition it is  a chance to see what it is like to have to go back to the basics, to see what is needed to have a second chance at living a normal' life again. <br/><br/>Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer whose ruled-by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a harrowing plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island. As Chuck struggles to survive, he finds that his own personal journey has just begun. <br/><br/>Cast Away is an extraordinary movie. It goes for almost half the time with no dialogue and only one actor on our screen. Yet the whole film works. The main star is Hollywood legend Tom Hanks who plays the stranded Chuck Noland. He is brilliant, with his role showing us how talented he really is. His on-screen presence made me at times happy and others sad. It would have been very taxing role for Hanks, yet I could not imagine anyone else doing it. In fact Hanks is rather unlucky not winning the academy award for best actor for this film, as he would have been a worthy recipient of the honour.<br/><br/>
The other main star of Cast Away and an important friend for Chuck was Wilson. Wilson was just a volleyball, yet the relationship between him and Chuck was just great. This was an ingenious part of the film and one, which I will remember for a long time to come. Another significant part of this film is the delightful Helen Hunt, who plays Chuck's girlfriend Kelly Frears. The scenes that are between Hunt and Hanks are very touching, especially at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Cast Away was shot in one of the beautiful parts of our world  that being Fiji. The little island that was used was just beautiful and was the perfect place to shoot this film. All the time and effort spent to set this film up would have been very taxing on all involved, yet the end result was one great movie. Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job on this film, yet it was a shame that he allowed audiences to see far too much of the film in the trailers before the film was released. <br/><br/>If anyone was to actually go through what the character Chuck Noland experienced and survive then it would be a real miracle, and I guess there would be stories similar to this. This film is all about being able to go on against all the odds and making it, when everything says that you shouldn't. Cast Away for me had an ending that was adequate, yet I can understand people being left unsatisfied and mystified by it, with several questions being left unanswered. If you want to be left inspired that you can achieve anything, then sit down and get cast away! <br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 or 9/10"

","Judging from other comments already posted, 'Cast Away' has touched as many people as it has left others mildly indifferent. I watched it in the cosiness of my living room, on a pretty smart digital wide screen TV, and found it riveting.<br/><br/>It is a bit long and disjointed, and the least that could be said is that the transitions between consecutive periods in the movie are too abrupt. I guess this can happen when one tries to cover several years in a two-and-a-half hour piece, but the lack of smooth transitions destroys the rhythm of the movie.<br/><br/>So why did I find it riveting? First and foremost, Tom Hanks makes an outstanding Robinson Crusoe. Credible from the first minute to the last, he adds to a great acting performance the physical prowess of changing body shapes. One minute a chubby, over-fed executive, the next a survivor close to starvation.<br/><br/>The credibility of his acting brings out one of the main messages of the movie: Corporate America and the pseudo-comfort it creates (but which comfort does Chuck Noland enjoy when travelling from continent to continent in the back of a FedEx aircraft?) mainly serves the purpose of alienating human beings by destroying their relationship to nature.<br/><br/>Ok, some of you will find this statement far-fetched, and Chuck Noland certainly did not crash his plane to enjoy a return to nature. However, I took the contrast between a life in the fast lane and the painstakingly slow pace of survival as a reminder that we should not rely on appearances too much, it doesn't always matter if things happen a few minutes too late.<br/><br/>Beyond the thought-provoking aspects of the movie, I enjoyed some superb photography and scenery, as well as a good plane crash scene. What I wasn't impressed with: too many FedEx signs around - but then, this is corporate America and Hollywood."

","""Cast Away"" is, at once, both a simple and a complex film.  At its core, it is the story of a man who survives a plane crash and lives for four years alone on a deserted Pacific island.  But it also deals with the profound changes in its hero's life after his rescue, wrought by four years in isolation under circumstances that had long ago convinced all his friends and loved ones that he was dead.  In a role in which many actors might have been tempted to eat the scenery, Tom Hanks is restrained and always believable.

","This movie is the dumbest thing ever. If you are under 40 years of age, and are not currently experiencing a mid-life crisis, skip it. The message - too simple.  We know that materialism is bad.  I have a degree in Sociology, so maybe it was a little too remedial for me, but come on, aren't we all a little beyond this simple a life lesson?  Unless you are a yuppie and are currently also on your cell phone, this movie will not enlighten you. The acting - too bad.  Helen Hunt CANNOT ACT.  Hello, Hollywood?  Are you reading this?  SHE CANNOT ACT!  <br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>She shows no emotion when he comes back, when she says she cannot take him back, nothing.  And the plot that she would not try to take him back is totally unsupported (since the creators thought we needed to see 45 minutes of footage of him trying to open a stupid coconut instead of developing her character, who only has about 5 minutes of screen time).<br/><br/>The movie will not surprise you ever.  Everything... everything is foreshadowed!  The film is as dry as toast.  And spoon-fed.  Did we need to see him play with the lighter to realize how much we take fire for granted? WASN'T THE 30 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE OF HIM RUBBING STICKS ENOUGH?<br/><br/>And why on earth did he keep that package?  The 5 year-old in front of me asked out loud ""HOW did it save his life"", and the whole section turned to their partners and whispered, ""yeah, how DID it save his life?""<br/><br/>The film was too cute, too perfect, and had a warmed over ""you never know what the tide will bring in... maybe a box of chocolates"" type moral.  Gee, thanks, I hadn't considered that.<br/><br/>I still cannot believe that they had to ""go there"" and make a ""happy"" ending where he finds some new woman.  In fact, the romantic subplot altogether seemed incomplete, undeveloped, secondary, and just added in because the executives' formulas say that movies need a romantic sub-plot, even if it adds nothing to a movie.<br/><br/>Instead of 2 hours of Hanks trying to eat a coconut and talking to a volleyball, perhaps the film could have given us some REAL insight to the metamorphosis in his mind.  OR let us know what was going on in her life. They could have cross-cut scenes between the two to break the boredom and complete the film.<br/><br/>And lets face it, the volleyball was just a device so we could hear his thoughts, really, wasn't it?  I know it was supposed to show him as crazy and needing companionship, but I think that they only really used it as a device.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds in two areas.  1) It really does make you go through what he goes through... the viewer feels bored, tired, exhausted, and starts to go crazy... just like he does.  The director accomplished that task.  And 2) the film displays human vs. nonhuman technology (Traditional Weberian theory) quite well.  Before the crash, he uses nonhuman technology, things that control people: the clock, beepers, etc.  On the island, he uses human technology, things that people control: a blade to cut coconuts, tree bark to make rope, etc.  <br/><br/>But alas, I am a socialist, and realized a long time ago that the value of an item is decided by its usefullness, and not its so called ""market price"". Nothing new to me, or the Russians in the film.<br/><br/>I was most surprised that FED EX would use its name in a film that A) displays a crash and death of employees, and B) as mentioned in the above 2 paragraphs, is essentially anti-capitalism.<br/><br/>But hey, advertising execs are never too smart, and probably just thought, ""there's a blockbuster, lets hop on it!""<br/><br/>A bit of irony, no?"

","Tom Hanks gives another Oscar worthy performance as a time obsessed Fed Ex worker who, after a stunning plane crash, gets stranded on a deserted Island for about 4 years.  During this time wee see Hanks become self-sufficient and more mature.  He learns to forget about the unimportant things in life and focus on the most important, like trying to survive.  He also begins to lose his mind, the only thing keeping him alive is the thought of being reunited with his girlfriend, Helen Hunt.  Cast Away is a truly unique film.  The hour and a half of Hanks on the Island contain practically no music and very little dialog.  In fact Hanks' only company is that of a volleyball with a face on it.  This may sound a little dull, but it isn't.  The film runs about 2 hours and 40 minutes but it zooms right by and I felt it wasn't long enough, and that more time needed to spent on the island.  The most interesting thing about this movie is just watching Hanks try to survive.  To see how a person adapts to conditions they have never experienced is always a fascinating thing.  The film is also beautifully shot and director Robert Zemeckis does a wonderful job of showing Hanks' isolation.  Not only is this one of the best films of the year, but it will probably be loved by anyone who sees it."

","Fate or chance events removes a Chuck (played by Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee driven and consumed by the constant advance time, from all he knows. He is left on a deserted tropical island with almost nothing. How can he survive? Why should he?<br/><br/>In the most powerful fade-to-black ever, we are utterly alone with merciless rainy night as our raft heaves in the South Pacific. Thus does Chuck begin his journey of self.<br/><br/>Chuck's value for time fades, letting years drift away as he becomes a primitive. Chuck clings to his humanity with his remembered love relationship (played by Helen Hunt) and developing a new friendship with Wilson the volleyball (played by Wilson the volleyball). Chuck's friendship with Wilson shows the strength of social bonds and his desperate need to have a relationship. That social side of humanity is every bit as important to survival as finding water or food. Seemingly chance events ignite Chuck's rebirth as a master of the time than once ruled him. Time becomes just another tool he uses to go on surviving.<br/><br/>Don't think of this movie as an island survival movie whose epilogue begins with his rescue. You will think the ""ending"" is too long, and you will miss the point. The island portion with its random cruelties of nature is a model of the survival that Chuck (and all of us) must face. He returns to civilization and must choose to go on with the good and bad consequences of what has happened. In fact, this movie does not end, it continues within your own imagination.<br/><br/>This film makes marvelous use of the absence of music. On the island, he is without it. Elsewhere, the most powerful moments are created with silence, or with sounds of nature, which may only be set up, or framed by music.<br/><br/>The film has wonderful sense of irony in its use of time and its references to time: the train conductors pocket watch (symbol of the first industrialized need for time accuracy) with the photo of his beloved is Chuck's tie back to his previous life. Chuck creates an analemma calendar. Chuck quotes himself on the importance of time.<br/><br/>Chuck's journey of self teaches him to accept what he cannot control, to shape what he can, and, like a true survivor, to heed small hints sent his way. His profound apologies to his FedEx friend and to Hunt's character show his mastery over fate does not excuse him from his humanity. He discovers on the island and back in Texas the role of hope in survival. The opening and ending of the movie have many details which reward viewing multiple times.<br/><br/>A Christian perspective: Chuck's character would not work so well were he in a living relationship with Christ.

","Cast Away is a very good film; I've put off watching it for a while because many people have told me it's boring, well it's not. True, if I had to see just ONE actor on an island for about two hours then Tom Hanks would not be my first choice, but to his credit, he is very good. The film starts by showing us the day-to-day triviality of the FedEx department and their task master boss Chuck (Hanks). After bidding goodbye to the love of his life Kelly (Helen Hunt) he boards a plane. Of course the plane crashes on a desert island leaving Chuck the soul survivor.<br/><br/>The Island scenes are the best of the movie, Hank's everyman personality helps us identify with the character greatly, he isn't skilled in action hero, jungle tactics, so the smallest things can create a problem (making a fire for example). The photography by Don Burgess is also spectacular, the use of deep focus lenses letting us take in the full beauty and at times terror of the island, making Chuck seem small and insignificant in the middle of this huge unknown territory. <br/><br/>Four years pass and Chuck has now become skilled in hunting for fish, and now with his only companion's Wilson the Volleyball, and the picture of Kelly he must make the decision to stay on the island, or take the step to get home. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The problems with the film however is that Zemeckis doesn't know what to focus on, sometimes he shows us Chuck experiencing things, but the ""four years later"" tag that fades up on screen means we miss a great deal of interesting discoveries, Chuck's suicide attempt, how he's managed to figure out the months and days. The tag seems lazy, as though Zemeckis just couldn't be bothered to take the extra time, instead rushing towards the sentimental ending.<br/><br/>This is another problem; the ending just isn't handled correctly. Four years has passed but Kelly just excepts Chuck like he's been gone for a couple of weeks, never mind the fact that she's now married with a daughter. It's up to Chuck to tell her it's over, which I just didn't buy. Personally I don't rate Hunt as much of an actress, I think she gives the same performance in every film and this is no exception. We never get a real feel for her character or their relationship prior to Chuck's crash so it's hard to feel any real pain for them. I was more upset by the loss of Wilson at sea.<br/><br/>SPOILERS END<br/><br/>It's such a pity that the ending of the film couldn't have been more satisfying, because for the most part Cast Away is a fascinating and well-acted drama, a film not afraid to take risks. Just a shame about that ending.<br/><br/>7/10"

","This movie portrays the typical 'stranded-on-a-deserted-island' storyline. I give this movie credit for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1.  Realism - while no movie can truly portray an accurate depiction of real life, this movie makes an honorable attempt.  A truly believable story overall, but believable in the same way that 'The Old Man and the Sea' is believable... it is so dull that it might actually happen.<br/><br/>2.  Creativity -  I give this movie a higher rating because of the writers/producers creativity in making everyone's favorite piece of sporting equipment 'Mr. Wilson' an integral part of the plot.  Unlike the 'Old Man and the Sea' I mentioned earlier, the leather bound counterpart to the protagonist works much more effectively than a large decaying fish.  While the fish is treated more as an object to be worshiped, the volleyball is treated more as a companion, and makes for much better dialouge.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie.  Very respectable performance by Tom Hanks... who incidentally lost a decent amount of weight for his part.  Also, this movie is yet another example of his ever-expanding variety of roles and how his characters continue to evolve and mature."

I know that I would never be up to gaining weight, then losing a lot (Tom Hanks did that in this film as well as ""Philadelphia"".)

","If this movie would've starred anyone else, it surely wouldn't've worked as well as it did. Tom Hanks plays his character as an everyman. Not as an ever-confident superhuman, but not as a total wimp either. That makes it easy to relate to his character, Chuck Noland. Technically, the movie is a marvel. Beautiful cinematography and excellent use of sound. They had the good sense to let out a music score to convey the utter silence on the island. The situations on the island he finds himself in are realistically portrayed, mostly thanks to a well-written script by William Broyles. The way he used the volleyball to make him have someone to talk to (other than air) was a master stroke. SPOILER AHEAD! It's even more amazing that the movie makes us sad when Chuck loses the ball. That is perhaps the saddest moment of the film. Some people were disappointed with the ending. Well, trust me, it's the only way they could've wrapped this kind of film up. Think of any other plausible ending and it just wouldn't've worked in the film. Everyone involved did a very respectable job in this film, making it one of the best ones released in 2000.

I think there´s no score for nearly 90 min, which is really nice in a Hollywood movie. But when it does surface, it is of course the same romantic nonsense we´ve heard a million times before.

","Cast Away' (2000) 20th Century Fox/DreamWorks Pictures<br/><br/>
  Cast Away' enables a viewer to experience isolation and desolation like no other film in recent memory.  Director Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump) crafts an ambitious and elegant story revolving around Chuck Nolan (Tom Hanks), a Fed EX employee who is stranded on a desert island for several years due to a horrific plane crash. Zemeckis makes no secret of handing over the complete second act to Hanks to retain the viewer's attention. No music, no 45-degree camera angles -just simple storytelling to demonstrate Hanks' isolation. Cast Away' is quite an achievement in terms of a film's power to play with the human emotion. This film is structured into three related yet completely different acts which all have a different story to tell. The film opens with an energetic and rowdy scene in Russia where Hanks's character is leading a giant Fed EX shipment. With the use of frantic editing and great camera tracking  including a p.o.v. shot from a Fed Ex package, Zemeckis demonstrates the importance of delivering packages on time. Here we see Hanks' character's obsession with his work in which he utters these great lines, ` We live and die by the clock. We must never allow ourselves the sin of turning our backs on the clock'. Yet, in watching the film closely, we see completely that Hanks had to have let go of this mantra to survive. Within this first act, we enter Hanks' life through an enormous Christmas dinner with his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) and discover all that Hanks has to live for.      Cut quickly to a terrific plane crash sequence that comes completely unexpected in which our main character finds himself stranded on a deserted island with nothing but his sanity to keep him grounded. In this second act we are limited to extraordinary filmmaking with little use of dialogue and musical score. Instead, we are treated to Hanks' tour-de-force' performance in which he commands his screen presence. We see Hanks struggle with the impossibility of starting a fire from scratch; making acquaintances with a volley ball named Wilson' and deal with the inevitable possibility of never returning home.      The third act is in essence a closure to all the events that have occurred in the film. Therefore, we will not go into detail, yet some might find the last act a tad disappointing, yet, it is evident that the filmmakers stuck with the most realistic ending possible.<br/><br/>     As far as the film is concerned, it plays on no other level than human emotion. Zemeckis leaves us no choice but to sympathize with our beloved character as he struggles to maintain his dignity in a world where there is none. We also see our character struggle with an unbearable weight loss as he wrestles with famine in a   place where food is scarce and loneliness inevitable.      The best thing about this film are the subtle, yet present symbolic events or images that convey the notion that although we might seem alone- we never are. It might take a second viewing to notice these, but they are there - and that is just one of the many great elements that compose this great film.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of four)"

I remember there were two scenes, practically back-to-back, with the same melodramatic, distracting music. These scenes probably would have been perfect without any music.

The film could be anything I suppose pending on the character stranded.  Tom Hanks, I feel represented the common suburbanite trapped in the rat race trying to survive, a man who seems to have forgotten about what it means to be alive. I would have rather seen a priest stranded or a prostitute.<br/><br/>The film deals a lot with isolation and the need to have personal contact. I did not care too much for Tom hanks character.  He seemed bland but I guess that was the point, or was it?<br/><br/>It was a nice touch with Helen Hunt's recognition of ""no return but can I have a hug and a deep kiss to remind me."" <br/><br/>Then the finale at the crossroads.  Was not big on it.<br/><br/>But the film's attempt at showing how we can begin again after a long haul in the rat race succeeds and it would be nice to see if the common man/woman seeking comfort with this world might open his or her eyes to an alternate way of thinking should their soul be dying.<br/><br/>The film looked nice at times.

Hanks portrayal of Noland on the island is brilliant, capturing the terror and hopelessness that must be going through Noland's mind.<br/><br/>The moments on the island are truly great for several reasons. Most of our emotion comes from what we see rather than what we hear; Zemerickis wisely halts the score and lets us feel like we are helplessly deserted on a quiet island, completely isolated from the sounds of every day life, such as people talking, car doors slamming, phones ringing, and clocks ticking. This is a brilliant character study of what Noland does to keep himself alive, physically and psychologically.<br/><br/>When the island tidbits are over and Chuck returns home, things continue to mind boggle. How would people react if we unexpectedly returned four years later after being considered dead? What kind of position does this put Noland's fiance in? Although many of the details of Noland's life after the island are completely off and more crowd-pleasing, it is still compelling. Wouldn't Chuck be psychologically ruined after four years of human isolation?<br/><br/>The film is terrific until the last few scenes, which ruin the overall impact.

"giggy3","Null","0","0","8 August 2001"," An almost perfect film
","This is one of the biggest hits of the year, so I'm not going to waste time with a description of the plot.<br/><br/>Let's begin.<br/><br/>Basically, the first twenty minutes are boring, then Tom Hanks gets on the plane, and the moment the plane begins to experience trouble, this film is a technical masterpiece right up until he leaves the island. Yes, sorry, he does get off the island, but this shouldn't come as a surprise since the trailer ruined that shock before the film even opened.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is washed ashore and the next hour and a half results in one of the most amazing pieces of film making ever. Tom Hanks is brilliant in what could have been a one dimensional role; Robert Zemeckis directions with another firm hand; and, above all, I got really attached to that damn volleyball, so kudos to the film makers on that, too.<br/><br/>But, then he gets off the island, and it's another twenty/thirty minutes until the film finally resolves itself - Hanks has to get back to the girl he left waiting for him, even though it's been four years, played by Helen Hunt. Now, I like Helen Hunt, she's a fine actress, but she's terribly overrated. If someone could tell me why she won an Oscar for As Good As It Gets, I would like to know because every character she ever plays, regardless of the film, is the Jamie Buchman character from Mad About You. She's wasted here, with hardly more than a cameo, and the film suffers as a result.<br/><br/>The trailer ruined what could have been a perfect film, since there's no surprise that he gets off. But the film almost collapses on it's own with a weak opening act, and a terrible third. This film would have been far better off if the hanks character had been on the plane in the very begginning, and the movie ending with him getting off. Hell, even though 3/4 of the movie was spent on the island, the film makers could have shot an extra half hour of stuff, slapped it in, rather than the weak first and third act, because everything on the island is perfect.<br/><br/>The rest is weak, contrived, Hollywood tripe.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie, that is great if you fastforward the first twnety minutes and shut it off after he gets off the island. Hanks deserved an Oscar, hands down. And so did that damn volleyball.<br/><br/>I was impressed with how the film makers managed to surpress any shark attacks, since it has become a Hollywood cliche. I would love to give this film a 10/10, but due to the first and third acts, I can only give it an 8. Still, highly recommended, but I recommend having the remote in your hand."

They weren't bad, just not near as good as the middle section. Also I will not give anything away but I was dissapointed the trailor did, which did take some suspense away.

This movie shows that man needs three things for survival: food, shelter, and companionship.<br/><br/>The musical score was only in existence when Hanks was in civilization. This brings to the audience the sense of being there alone.  Often times music enhances the viewing experience, but in the case of Cast Away the lack of music enhances the experience.<br/><br/>There is a good deal of comic relief as portrayed by the volleyball. ""Wilson"" as he is titled becomes one of the audience's favorite characters, and should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor in a Role by the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>It's a great movie to see with friends and family, but there are some questionable scenes for younger kids.  I would advise seeing it first before you take your ten year-old son or daughter to see it; don't make the same mistake most parents made with ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>Helen Hunt's character was not one we learned to love and most people will be apathetic towards her.  She's not one of the main characters; only a main influence.  Hence, the end of her paragraph.<br/><br/>Does Hanks deserve an award for his role and portrayal of the man who is cast aside by nature?  Yes.  Hanks does a great job in this movie and no other could have done it as well.  Do I think he'll win?  No.  Going up against the other actors in his category is a hard battle, and Crowe was better in Gladiator than Hanks was in Cast Away."
"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","9 August 2001"," fascinating tale of survival(spoilers)
","From such established literary classics as `Robinson Crusoe' and `Lord of the Flies' to such products of pop culture idiocy as `Gilligan's Island' and the original `Survivor,' the human imagination has been fired up by tales of ordinary folk being suddenly stranded on a deserted island and forced to survive by sheer wit, ingenuity and the unquenchable human instinct for self-preservation.   Perhaps, those of us who have been softened by all the amenities we have come to rely on to get us through our daily lives wonder if we, ourselves, could rise to such a challenge.   Whatever the underlying motivation, the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal, as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV's `Survivor' and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis, `Cast Away.' <br/><br/>`Cast Away' is a film that works on several different levels at once  but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking. This extends not only to its setting but the fact that Tom Hanks, during the course of the filming, underwent a change in physique matched only by Robert De Niro in `Raging Bull.'  Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance, portraying a character who, for vast stretches of the film's running time, speaks nary a word and, hence, must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one:  Chuck Noland is a classic type-A FedEx exec (one wonders what tidy sum the company forked over for the benefit of this product tie-in to end all product tie-ins) who is clearly too focused on the split-second requirements of his hectic job to stop and smell the roses  or to formally propose marriage to his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  When his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean, Chuck, as the sole survivor, manages to wash up on a deserted island and is forced to make it on his own in this strange, forbidding world.  Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.  We watch the step-by-step process by which Chuck attempts to bring order to his strange new existence  and the equally intriguing ways in which he attempts to cope with the mounting loneliness and solitude that will face him in the coming years if he is not rescued.<br/><br/>`Cast Away' is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality. The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love  even if we have to invest human traits into an inanimate object to get them (children, of course, do this all the time with their stuffed animals or imaginary playmates).  The finale of the film rings true as well, for we know that, in our lives, fate often intervenes in ways we do not expect and that time truly does not stand still for any of us.   The world marches on and, if, for any reason, we fall off temporarily, all we can do is to jump back on and try to catch up, painful as that may be at times.<br/><br/>One might have wished for a bit more psychological depth to be applied to Chuck's experiences AFTER the rescue  an exploration of the stages a man caught in such a situation would go through in his re-assimilation into civilization.   But that would probably require a whole other film or at least another hour's worth of running time.<br/><br/>As it is, `Cast Away' is gripping, moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations."

","At it's heart, Cast Away is simply a survival picture telling the tale of a man's isolation and lonliness for over four years on a desolate island, lacking any large amount of food, or even wildlife, in the tropics. So lonely, in fact, Chuck Nolan (Hanks) spends some time speaking to a volley ball for half of the movie, and even crying for it's loss. This could have been a hilarious situation, something for a Saturday Night Live parody of the 'Survivor' TV series, but Hanks is so convincing and human in his performance, he doesn't hold anything back. You can't help be sad for the poor volleyball's (named ""Wilson"") fate, when really you, the audience are sad for Hanks losing his sanity while adrift in a wood raft (the director, Robert Zemeckis, sure has a good way of manipulating the audience). There are also many special effects in Cast Away that one wouldn't notice, just take for granted as part of the filmming - there are many SFX scenes in Cast Away, but none of them are used for 'eye candy', like many, MANY other films today. You just can't help but root for Hanks throughout the entire movie, so he can get off that stinking island. Also, the bulk of the film, when Nolan is on the island after the plane crash (which is easily the best scene of last year, 2000), will totally immerse you into his isolation, thanks in part to no cutting back to what's going on back where his girlfriend is waiting for him - so many movies have been ruined in part to this, (The Perfect Storm a great example). Instead, the characters tell him what happened later on. And somehow, there is little to no dialogue in the 'survival' bulk of this movie but it never gets boring. NEVER. Zemeckis should have taken a hint while making What Lies Beneath in between Cast Away.<br/><br/>Not that Cast Away is perfect.<br/><br/>The film loses steam when Nolan returns home, but there are still some great scenes ahead, but once again, I am not bought on Helen Hunt in the role of Nolan's motivation for going on and trying to get off the island (there is a short scene involving him hanging himself). Just like in Pay it Forward, she's not too convincing and is best suited for Richard Gere chick flicks like Dr. T and The Women.<br/><br/>And no - the trailer didn't reveal much about the film.

","Initially I thought a film almost entirely acted out by one person would be boring, I was wrong. On top of Hanks' now regular encapsulating performance, the direction is perfect, even managing to make a scene where Hanks tries to start a fire by rubbing sticks together enthralling. His gradual slip into insanity matched by his 'friendship' with a volleyball is not only believable but also touching. The fantastic photography and the Directors awareness to overlook the tempting schmalz of a typically American ending are the finishing points which create an overall perfect film which will no doubt go down as a modern day classic, and deservedly so. And now I'm off to get a cherry coke."

","I was looking forward to an inspiring plot and a unique role for Hanks, but this movie was disappointing. Though the film was over two hours in length, I couldn't help but feel that a lot of content had fallen gracelessly to the cutting-room floor. Time as a concept seemed to flip-flop senselessly, particularly when Hanks' first few compelling and frightening weeks on the island abruptly end and we are informed (with an awkward subtext) that four years has transpired, leaving Hanks lean, mean, and slightly demented.<br/><br/>Some scenes with his ""co-star"" Wilson were touching. Others were contrived. And Hanks' pathetic, throaty cries as Wilson metaphorically drifts away reminded me more of his character in 'The Money Pit' than anything else. It was hard to take him seriously. And I won't even mention the silliness of Hanks' cetacean buddy, who seemed to magically appear when he was needed most.<br/><br/>Finally, there is Helen Hunt, who seems to be the flavor-of-the-moment in Hollywood, but in this film she is poorly cast. Her performance lacked the true grief, desperation and elation her character should have demonstrated.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was disappointing. I expected a more riveting performance from Hanks, but the film's editors and writers should accept a greater share of blame for the oft-contrived shallowness of what should have been the best film of the year.<br/><br/>See it, but wait for the video."

","The difficulty of carrying an entire movie alone must be tremendous... Yet Tom Hanks succeeds in Cast Away.  This modern, high tech retelling of the man on desert island tale is outstanding in every way.  Wonderful acting, excellent direction, and ,despite its simplicity, an engaging story.  Also, some interesting themes about fast paced, modern life. Pretty much everything has already been said about this movie, but I want to recommend seeing this one on DVD!  There are many many extras that add insight to the film.  For example, in Robert Zemeckis' alternate audio track, he tells you that Fed Ex paid nothing to be put into this film, but that it had been a part of the story line from day one because it fit so well with the way they wanted the Chuck Noland character to be...  I found that reassuring after hearing so many friends said the movie was a Fed Ex commercial...  Anyway, go for the DVD version... if you have a good surround sound system, you will really be able to appreciate the excellent sound effects which are another big part of carrying this film."

","First,I think it is one of the best films I have ever seen. Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors in the history of movie. He plays a very difficult character in the film. Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks) is a successful businessman, who always travels to different parts of the world, that is why he sees his girlfriend very rare. But when this man had suffered a plane crash and has been taken to a deserted island, as his life changes his personality changes also. Tom Hanks just speaks a few words in the film, but it's most difficult to play so ingeniously without words."

The scenes on the island were awesome, and the behind-the-scenes footage on the DVD was interesting, especially the negotiations with the native Fijian inhabitants.  I had heard that there was minimal dialogue and soundtrack throughout much of the movie, which I thought worked very well, with Tom Hanks remaining on my list of actors with under-rated ability.<br/><br/>The bad:  The movie dragged too long in the ""post-island"" scenes for my taste, and I didn't feel like we got enough back in the final scene after going through the uncomfortable reunion with his girlfriend. Also, I listened to the commentary track in a few instances hoping for insight into why they wrote scenes the way they did, and was disappointed with repetitive discussion of camera angles and techniques instead.  (My opinion, but I don't like how it could be seen that Tom is ready to drive away with her at the end and then appears sullen that she needs to go back to her life.)<br/><br/>Worth watching, but I don't know about repeated viewing."

He had reached to the heart of the masses that is the beauty of his histrionics.  We know that pain has no language, therefore it cannot be expressed, but Tom Hanks gave a terminology to his pain without uttering a word in it.    His countenance spoke even the words of his heart.  He had really left an indelible mark in us, no doubt in it.<br/><br/>The director really had an audacity to handle this delicate subject and the ending was too hard to bear.  In every moment of the movie, we were able to feel Tom Hanks emotions, which is so captivating.<br/><br/>I always wondered what Love is, I was told that love is sharing, caring and sacrifice, which I always accepted, but after viewing this movie, I understood that love is a journey not a destination with needs lot of faith and endurance.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may have not won his third Academy award, but he deserves a standing ovation, which merits every one's approbation."

","I think this movie was a good one,  because it has some touching scenes in which Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) had to try to get out of the island, he suffered a lot, and also got hurt because of rocks, waves, etc. His teeth also hurt, I was impressed as he hit one of his teeth with a stone. I thought I had my teeth like that for a minute, It hurts me a lot, sometimes I think about somebody who suffers because of the teeth, it's horrible to have a pain like that, so it makes this movie very different and really touching. The plot is excellent, it has a lot of interesting things like a true love, but at the same time it turns like an impossible love. When Chuck Noland finally got to get out of the island, he found out that the love of his life got married to somebody else, and also had a little baby. This movie is very realistic, Tom Hanks really seems older when he got back home, but it's because the film was halted for a year, so it makes it a very realistic movie. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The scene when he thought that he had a volleyball for a friend was touching as well as funny and sad, I think when anybody is alone, they can think anything for having friends, even if the friend was a volleyball.

","I don't think I need to give a plot synopsis; I'm sure you know what it's about. Tom Hanks (as usual) gives another good performance. Seeing him struggle to live on the island, the film generates a good deal of sympathy, and you find yourself really feeling for him. The airplane crash sequence is intense. Helen Hunt was just her usual self, but she's not too bad. Alan Silvestri's score (what little there was, about 15 minutes or so, and none of it heard until the final half-hour) was effective. My only complaints: the final half-hour was a bit overlong, and I wish that instead of cutting from Chuck's early days on the island to ""Four Years Later"" that they had shown a montage or something to let us see what all he went through during that time, especially how he found a way to set up a calendar system using the sunlight in the cave.

"chrisbrown6453","9","0","0","6 July 2001"," Cast Away, directed by Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump), takes the viewer alongside its protagonist to witness a dramatic physical, psychological and emotional transformation
","A FedEx systems engineer, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) has efficiently built his life around the clock. Driven by his commitment toward punctuality, Chuck succeeds in maintaining his company's reputability, often putting on hold his love life with Kelly (Helen Hunt: Pay It Forward). Chuck's priority is reaffirmed when he decidedly interrupts a Christmas Eve dinner, as he is unexpectedly summoned to attend to an important business duty overseas. Chuck's life takes a dramatic turn that night, when his airplane crashes into the sea. Managing to surface from the sea unharmed, Chuck reaches an isolated island. Alone and away from civilization, Chuck is forced to test his adaptability skills, find the drive to survive, and rediscover the timeless qualities of life.<br/><br/>Cast Away relies on location --the extreme nature of its settings, such as the hostile sea and an isolated island-- to create a story that focuses on the mental and physical processes of its protagonist as he confronts physical isolation. Due to the simplicity of its premise (a man who is stranded in an island must learn to adapt in order to survive), Cast Away finds its meaning in the mechanics of its character's adaptability. Specifically, Cast Away focuses on the step-by-step survival, which mostly involves securing food, seeking shelter and making a fire. The camera seldom pulls away to objectify a scene, follows its subject's evolution closely, and resists cutting to scenes outside of the protagonist's new world. (Once the character has reached the island, the only images reminding the viewer of civilization are the objects inside a few FedEx packages that float onto the shore.) In this manner, Cast Away establishes an intimate relationship between its protagonist and the viewer. Cast Away uses an extended ellipsis of time to dramatize the character's transformation, demonstrating that by taming Nature he has learned to satisfy his needs, and that by obeying his imagination he has managed to protect his sanity. In this sense, Cast Away offers an intriguing commentary on modern man's ability to return to his primitive origins. The film's realism is enhanced by the use of natural sounds, which are only replaced by external music one hour and a half into the film.<br/><br/>Aside from these strengths, Cast Away suffers from mawkish sentimentality in those scenes that attempt to moralize its character. In one scene, Chuck finds a card inside a FedEx package, which reads: ""The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself."" In a later scene, when Chuck realizes he must calculate the rhythm of the rise and fall of the tide in order to safely sail away, he is reminded of his company's motto: ""Let's not commit the sin of turning our back on Time."" These advisory proclamations disrupt the more effectively established non-communication between two detached worlds. In spite of this, the film's additional exploration (toward the end) of society's readiness to cast away its absent member, adds poignancy to the overall drama. Due to Hanks' accurate performance and his physique's notable transformation, Cast Away may be seen as a film that carefully constructs its story around character: its most exploited asset."

Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>Not that the plot is something new - essentially harks back to Robinson Crusoe's days (If we except the time reference), but the film is pretty good. The scenes of the plane being blown by the storm are quite realistic.<br/><br/>The parts on the island are good as well, especially when he talks to that little ball he has named Wilson and when he finally succeeds in making a fire and celebrates it by singing ""Come on baby, light my fire"".<br/><br/>To me, the only downside is (As some other people have commented here) the fact of having used the 'product placement' device, with FEDEX.

","Cast Away is a powerful and fascinating movie and one of those kind movies we rarely see today. Despite its long time, it's not boring and every sequences is worth watching. The story deals with issues which is forgotten these days, such as humanity, nature, world. Watching Tom Hanks marooned in a deserted island, confronting the force of nature and talking with his new and only friend Wilson makes me compare early people at the cave age when a piece of stone and two pieces of a wood values as a gold, and today people who have everything but nothing. Sometimes I rather have a stone and a ball as a friend and live in such a peaceful place than have a knife and an enemy disguised as a friend. The movie also wants to teach us some important thing that: Hope is the only thing that keeps you alive when you observe no relief, and with hope you can survive. Really ""The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself""."

I'm not really sure this movie goes twenty minutes without the words ""Fed Ex"" being present somewhere.  When he does become stranded, the movie does in fact pick up a bit.  I did like the lack of much dialogue or soundtrack during these scenes, that was effective in relaying his feeling of isolation.  The fact he does go a little nuts was also appreciated.  When he finally gets home however....ugh.  I don't think the melodrama was needed, nor well done at that.  I also thought Tom Hanks' character took things a little too well, after all, this is a man who earlier risked his life almost drowning trying to save a volleyball.  It's hard to believe he'd take the woman he loved marrying another so well.  This could have been a lot better.  I personally would have wanted something a little darker."

"PlanoCritic","7","0","0","30 June 2001"," Wonderful movie, terrible ending
","This is a great film but falls flat in the ending.<br/><br/>The first problem I have with any movie with Tim Hanks in it anymore is that I cannot forget that it is Tom Hanks I am watching.  Fortunately, Tom Hanks is such a good actor that I find myself watching him as if he were actually in the situation the movie puts him in.  So, in Saving Private Ryan, for me its more like watching Tom Hanks actually being in WWII having to lead a squad of men to save a Pvt. Ryan.  And, in this movie, it was like watching what happens to Tom Hanks when he is stranded on an island in the middle of the Pacific ocean.  Anyhow, his acting is superb here, which is fortunate, since a huge middle portion is almost exclusively of him on the island. How he deals with existing on the island was fascinating to watch.  And the device of having him befriend a volleyball was a great idea!<br/><br/>The depiction of the plane crash was one of the best I've seen of that kind of catastrophe.  I was very impressed with the way the events in the interior of the plane were shown.  It made me feel like that is what it truly would be like if that happened.<br/><br/>The ending, unfortunately, nearly ruins the movie for me.<br/><br/>
*** Spoiler warning! ***<br/><br/>When Chuck finally escapes and returns home, he finds his former fiance is now married with children.  Quite believable; so far so good.  She initially can't deal with even meeting him, which is also understandable given how much her world has just been turned upside down with his return.  In fact, the movie does well in the ending up to and during his visit to her house at night.  You remain on edge somewhat, because they are uncomfortable and awkward with each other.  They wind up in her garage where she gives him the keys to the Jeep they had when they were previously together.  He pulls out of the driveway, begins to leave, and at that point the movie blows it big time.  She rushes out into the rain, calling after him and he, somehow, hears her, backs up and they embrace and kiss, etc.  Yes, their love never died, but circumstances force them apart.  This struck me as so Hollywood, so pandering to the audience, as to be almost sickening.  A far better and more likely outcome would be that they never get over the awkward, uncomfortable feeling between each other and he drives off with both of them silently accepting what they have been dealt.  The film could have even shown each character, her in the garage, him driving away in the Jeep, break down in tears.  But it ruins it that they connect.  The situation is a tragedy and should be shown as tragic.  The audience can tell well enough if they still have feelings for one another.<br/><br/>I can't say how the movie should have concluded, but the last scenes with him at a crossroads in Texas wondering where to go next weren't convincing either.  The ending definitely needs a lot of rethinking.<br/><br/>*** End of spoilers ***<br/><br/>Overall, I am glad I saw this movie and would recommend it.  Just be aware that it breaks down in the end.  But everything prior to that still makes it worth seeing.<br/><br/>-- 7/10"

","Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. He dominates ""Cast Away"" so fully that one doubts it could have made without him. He should have won his record third Oscar, but the Academy, in their usual good judgment (I'm being sarcastic),chose Russell Crowe for ""Gladiator"". Boy, did they miss the boat on this one.<br/><br/>Hanks is pretty much alone for about 110 minutes of this 143 minute feature. I'm not going to spoil it for you since the advertising teams from Fox and Dreamworks have done such a good job already (sarcasm again) Not knowing anything about the film is a major benefit. I don't pay attention to ads and I was able to appreciate the film's surprises.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that it records an existence. So many filmmakers today think you have to have wall to wall action in order to keep an audience interested. But Hanks and the director, Robert Zemeckis, understand that a good story and solid characterization are even more effective. This is another winner from Zemeckis, who has been making one great film after another lately (""Forrest Gump"", ""Contact"", the chilling ""What Lies Beneath""; actually he has yet to make a bad film). The film's Panavision photography (by Don Burgess) resembles Kubrick's ""2001"" and George Stevens' ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" in making wide open vistas claustrophobic.<br/><br/>Just because I really, really liked this film doesn't mean it's flawless. ""Cast Away"" has some problems. One is the ending. While I appreciate the fact that Zemeckis didn't tack on a sentimental, syrupy ending, the final shot of Hanks in this film comes off as forced. This is probably a compromise with the studios and I don't blame Zemeckis, Hanks or even the screenwriter. Another is Helen Hunt. Nothing personal, but she has yet to find a role that can eclipse her Oscar-winning work in ""As Good As It Gets"". Here, she has a nothing part that could have been more substantial. ""What Women Want"" also had that problem and she was the LEAD! Here's to hoping that she'll find a good, juicy role worthy of her talent. If there's one thing I hate, it's squandered talent.<br/><br/>Still, ""Cast Away"" offers many pleasures and is riveting filmmaking from start to finish. This film deserved better treatment from the Academy. But since when does the Academy actually do that? The answer is hardly ever. Shame.<br/><br/>**** out of 4 stars"

","I was very excited to see this movie.  I cursed people at BlockBuster for getting the last copy, and I harassed the clerks there by phone and in person.  I expected an amazing movie, one which would leave me satisfied and content.  And while I didn't hate this movie, I was left very disappointed, and not at all content.<br/><br/>This movie was a Tom Hanks movie.  And, I don't mean he was the leading man, I mean, if you don't like Tom Hanks (my boyfriend doesn't), don't see this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is an amazing actor, and he shows it in this film.  A very many scenes took place without dialogue, and he carries it off by displaying his feelings in facial expression and body language.  This part of the film impressed me greatly.  However, the plotline once Hanks is saved from the island really left something to be desired.  Without giving too much away, I will say that the story seemed to become very tense and not at all what most of the viewers I've spoken to wanted from it.  A movie of this magnitude should carry with it a great ending.  An ending which makes the whole of the movie make sense, and injects the whole project with meaning and resolve. Instead, I felt the ending to this was weak.  I kept saying to myself, ""Don't fade to black, don't fade to black"".  It faded to black.<br/><br/>I just think it could have been done better."

Of course, you'll never want to get on a plane again.<br/><br/>But the third act, is weak.

"imddaveh","Null","0","0","22 June 2001"," Zemekis Owes me for this one.....
","(Warning - contains spoilers, not that there is much to spoil) Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob....what happened?  I truly expected better from the director that gave us the outrageous comedy of ""Used Cars"" and the warm-and-fuzzy whimsy (not to mention airtight continuity) of the ""Back to the Future"" films. I can't say much that is positive about ""Cast Away"", except that whoever it was that got Federal Express to go along with this could sell ice cubes to Eskimos. Tom Hanks is Chuck - an annoyingly ambitious yuppie who trots the globe for FedEx, verbally whipping third-world FedEx employees about time being money. After some scenes with his girlfriend, including a huge family holiday dinner and melodramatic marriage proposal that do nothing to develop character, he hops aboard a FedEx plane to dispense some more boot camp motivational tactics at some far-flung FedEx hub.  You'll notice that I mention FedEx a lot, because FedEx shows up in the movie so much that I think the film muist have been financed by FedEx product placement fees paid by FedEx, when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Chuck's plane encounters a storm on the way to Tahitti and plummets nose first into the ocean, an experience that he miraculously - almost unbelievably -  survives. Chuck finds himself on a small, uninhabited island. For the next hour, we watch Chuck bang cocoanuts on rocks, bang rocks on cocoanuts, develop an unnatural relationship with a piece of sports equipment,  and then we suffer through an interminable amount of failed exposition with Chuck trying to light a fire. When he finally gets that fire lit, the scene is not triumphant...instead, you find yourself wishing that this insufferable yuppie corporate tool would just throw himself on the burning driftwood. Then, in a most flagrant cinematic cheat, the film flashes forward four years. Zap! Just like that! Thank goodness, or we would have spent another hour watching Chuck learn to weave vines into rope. One four-years-later morning, a chunk of a construction site porta-potty washes up that, for the weakest of reasons, makes it possible for Chuck to build a raft and sail it off the island.  He does, is picked up by a passing freighter (surprisingly not a FedEx ship), and is returned to civilization.<br/><br/>Once there, he finds his finacee married and his life literally at a crossroads. Then the movie ends. No resolution, no further character development, no sense that the character learned anything or was changed by his four years of solitude. He comes back, catches up on the missed sports scores, accepts that he's lost the love of his life, and carries on...proving again that the character is nothing more than an insufferably shallow yuppie corporate tool. I hate this man so much that I don't even want to ship things via FedEx anymore. There's not even a scene of him reuniting with his gigantic family, probably because he doesn't care about them, either.  All he cares about is delivering one of the FedEx packages that washed up on the beach while he was stranded....Corporate tool! Corporate tool!  I was hoping the FedEx package contained a ham radio and a flare gun. That would have been great. But no, the film ends with him standing at a crossroads, with no hint of what he might do next, or what he wants to do. Two hours of nothing ending with a big nothing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a fine actor, but he doesn't have much to work with in ""Cast Away"". The film is like taking a vacation by shipping yourself FedEx - there's no time to enjoy the scenery or make friends, you just barrel through to the conclusion. Unfortunatley, when this package arrives, the box is empty. Instead, I reccomend ""The Harlem Globtrotters on Giligan's Island"". The characters are much more likeable, there's  a better plot, and the sports equipment is put to more entertaining use."

","Cast Away was only an average Tom Hanks movie, which does means it was better than a lot of the major studio stuff out there, but it was nowhere up to the level of Philadelphia or Forest Gump.  <br/><br/>I liked the fact that the ending was the way it was...not necessarily happy, not necessarily sad, and I liked the look of the island that Hanks was marooned on.  The one problem I had with the film was that there was no initial indication that a FedEx executive would've had all of the survival skills that Hanks exhibited...but I suppose that there really would've been no way to foreshadow that in the opening part of the storyline.  I would have also liked the film to delve more into what Hanks was thinking while on the island...perhaps digging a bit more into his past.  It seemed his life began and ended with Helen Hunt...there had to be more to what made him who he was than just her.<br/><br/>I viewed the DVD version of the film and found most of the second disc to be pretty lame...the survivalist featurette was interesting at times, but the Wilson featurette was lame...I know why the ""character"" was there and why there was a need for it, but to overly glamourize it like had been done was just dumb."

","One element of this pleasant piece of film or video wallpaper that everybody (even the Russian!) has missed in the comments is that there is a definite anti-communist undercurrent to the film. How so? you may ask. It's simple [ACHTUNG!! SPOILERS AHEAD]. In the rolling pan shot early on where Nicolai gets Hanks' package, one sees workmen taking down a marble plaque of V.I. Lenin (the Soviet state's founder) of the building Nicky has run into. The wheel boot the Moscow militsiya (police) put on the important FedEx truck is red with a yellow hammer-and-sickle (emblem of the USSR) painted on it. The Russian workers Hanks lectures to through interpreter are sullen. What does all of this mean? Literally it means that the cash strapped Russian Fed. is too poor to get new wheel boots or paint them the Russian tricolor, and it is too slowly ""de-Sovietising"" the country (the film is set in 1995). Symbolicly it says that the idea of communism has fallen to the new ideology of FedEx, or more broadly, the world's multinational corporations. The workers, sullen in their aging warehouse are the product of a failed system that could not compete with capitalism. The translator is their spokesman, bring up the fact that Hanks' character once stole a child's bike to make a delivery. Like Thomas J. Watson of IBM, Hanks' ruthless character is the company, it's best architype. Now to the island. Here we see the castaway story as one of individual initiative to survive. Chuck only has his brains, his courage, etc. to live on the island and then get off. And Chuck, the manager, survives, while the plane crew (workers) perish. The island story is similar to the James Bond novels and films, where the individualist fights the collectivisers (in ""Cast Away"" the island ecology itself) in the name of his bourgeoise government. Then, when he gets back, he goes about doing his job, delivering those packages (substitutions, of course) as best he can. He is his job. The rest of the film is about his relationship with another managerial type, which is the ""human element.""

The periods of silence and observance of the character was interesting, and much akin to the 1968 HELL IN THE PACIFIC. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, especially if they're weened on ""bang-zoom, where's-the-bodycount?"" type of entertainment.<br/><br/>

","While CBS's Survivor may be entertaining, it certainly is nothing like being stranded on a deserted island all by yourself, with no comforts of home. First of all, on TV, all the contestants have each other... other people with which to communicate, to fight with, to laugh with, and to cry with. They also receive various trinkets and surprises from the producers of the show.  Survivors?  Yeah, right... more like rats in a cage.<br/><br/>Along comes another superb Tom Hanks film.  Somebody somewhere said that nobody could do this like Tom Hanks, and it's true.  Where else can you find a film that you can watch for 50+ minutes with only a small bit of spoken word, and remain entertained?  I've watched many a film late in the evening, with much more action than this film, and still fallen asleep.<br/><br/>
So what is it about this film?  You want to see what happens next.  Tom Hanks pulls this off beautifully.  The ups and downs, the trials and errors, the good and the bad, it's all in here.  As a high-level FedEx employee, Chuck Noland (Hanks) knows about the passage of time... he lives by it. However, when his plane crashes somewhere over the Pacific, and he finds himself stranded alone on a deserted island, with nothing except his wits, an old watch containing a picture of his girlfriend, a rubber raft, and the contents of a few FedEx packages that have washed up on shore, he has to make the best of his surroundings.<br/><br/>This begins a quest in which Noland learns about himself, his surroundings, and his will to survive and beat the odds.  It is a beautifully filmed story, with superb acting, and an excellent plot.  This is a definite must if you are a fan of Tom Hanks, or if you like to rent movies which draw you into the story.<br/><br/>It is also an eye-opener for those of us who don't know how we would deal with the tremendous obstacle of being alone with little hope of rescue. Most of my time on this movie was spent afterwards, exploring how I felt about the film, and the situation.  That, if nothing else, is worth viewing this film.<br/><br/>My Rating:  9/10"

I thought she had better chemistry with Hanks as a photo than she did in the scenes together (or was that done on purpose?). It did bother me that the movie was a 2 1/2 hour commercial for Fedex, but I suppose it could have been worse (I actually enjoyed the dig that was made at the expense of the US Postal Service). While there may be some that feel that the movie is weak in parts, they would say that Hanks saves the day and keeps this ship from sinking. I suppose if at all possible, I would have cast Meg Ryan instead of Helen Hunt (but then it's too much like You've Got Mail/Sleepless but in reality it might be a bit closer to Joe vs. the Volcano).

(He in fact used them, but much more subtlely)<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is the ending. I real life, it could only end this way and it was film making magic. One thing comes to mind--the winged logo that kept Hank's character going throughout his trials and trevails. (there were lots of things that madfe him keep going, Wilson, a picture of Helen Hunt, etc.) Little did he know, even in search of the packages rightful receipient that another life far removed from the one with Helen Hunt or alone on the island was on the horizon.

"Geofbob","7","0","0","5 May 2001"," Even Tom Hanks can't solve all problems
","What a time everyone would have, moaning about this movie if Tom Hanks weren't in it - too long; too thin; disjointed; inconclusive ending; longest product placement in the history of cinema! But because of his presence most of these criticisms fade away, and in any case the film probably wouldn't have been made without him. The majority of the audience, including me, are happy to watch Hanks, whatever he's doing on screen, because of his charisma and sheer acting ability.<br/><br/>But there are some faults with this movie that Hanks cannot solve, and at least one where he must bear some responsibility. To start with the latter, I just don't think he does enough in the early scenes to make Chuck Noland the time-driven man that the movie needs to make its point that there is more to life than rushing around, watching the clock, and meeting deadlines. Yes, he's a busy, diligent executive, who possibly cares as much for FedEx as for his lover Kelly (Helen Hunt), but on a personal level he doesn't come over as particularly harrassed or obsessive; I don't really take him seriously when he's shouting at the Russian operatives. <br/><br/>
We must blame the producers and director, Robert Zemeckis, for other problems. A major one is that by omitting a proper rescue scene the movie misses an opportunity for dramatic action (and good-feel action to balance the all-too-realistic air-crash) and also cheats the audience of the release of emotion and tension it deserves after sticking with Chuck through his long ordeal. The cut from the moment of rescue to Noland a few weeks later flying home is too abrupt. <br/><br/>Another complaint is that, though I have no quarrel with the ending as regards the plot, the locale where Bettina Peterson lives, which we've also seen at the beginning of the movie, is just too empty, flat and boring. I'm sure Zemickis had good reasons for  choosing this location, but he doesn't seem to have had the visual appearance of the movie much in mind. (If he simply wanted to convey remoteness, why not have her live in the mountains or deep in the everglades!)<br/><br/>Hanks has now become a movie icon in a very literal sense - the audience enters a cinema where he is starring with much the same feeling of veneration as does the congregation entering a church. This near-idolatry is reinforced by the parts he plays - almost invariably men of charm, integrity, and in Cast Away courage, tenacity and resourcefulness. It would do both him and his fans good to play a less saintly role; and this may be the case in The Road to Perdition, now in production, where he's due to play a killer."

The plane crash was extremely realistic and intense and happens quickly after the movie begins. The action on the island is RIVETING.  You are constantly interested to find out what Chuck Noland does next and it is amazing how he is able to use the contents of the FedEx boxes.  Tom Hanks turns in a fabulous performance with little words and big gestures, and also by losing weight for an awesome transformation after his four years on the island.  He was ROBBED to not get the Oscar for Best Actor this year. The movie even made a mere volleyball an interesting character.  You scoff now, but you'll grow to love Wilson and his tree hair extensions.  In any other movie, there would have been typical Hollywood details thrown in... a beautiful mermaid living on the island to keep Chuck company, a shark attack while he is riding on his raft, Chuck managing to have a packet of waterproof matches on him when his ship goes down... ANYTHING unrealistic.  This movie manages to stay true to its cause and explores the dire situation of being stranded out on an island in a simple, yet effective way.  The ending of the movie was a bit overdrawn, but the ""ambiguous"" ending satisfied me, so that I could come up with my own ending for Chuck.

Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt (whose names incidentally are both cockney rhyming slang) were both fine, Hanks particularly effective in the romantic attachment he developed towards a ball named Wilson.'Some have suggested the ball should be given as Best Supporting Actornomination for its inscrutable performance. The plane crash was particularly scary. Hanks survived, but didn't even get a chance to choose a selection of songs, a book or a luxury before being washed up on the island. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead: The ending was truly abyssmal. Hanks' relationship with Hunt had to be resolved in some way but the film seemed to completely run out of any inspiration once he came home (perhaps his plane home should have crashed as well!) Alternative ending: Hanks' apartment: The party over, Hanks  tired and thin contemplates his new life alone. The doorbell rings. Irritated, Hanks goes to answer it. He looks around: no one is there  or is there? Wilson the ball sits on the doorstep. He is wearing sun glasses and a sombrero and has a bouquet of flowers lying in front of him. Hanks smiles a mysterious smile and winks at the camera."

","I'm sure that the grapevine has reached all of you with good and bad about this movie.  Instead of explaining the plot of this fantastic film ,(which are available and excellently articulated in prior reviews) I will explain how I never really left the theater that day.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this film ever since it's trailer in The Grinch. While I was sitting in the theater I was hypnotically transported to the island with our hero.  I was there, making hatchets out of ice skates.  I was there, bawling my eyes out when Wilson passed on.<br/><br/>I commend both Hanks and Zemeckis for their ability to entrance the audience.  I had begun to actually believe that the volleyball was really talking with Hanks' character.  At first the idea was silly to me, but within minutes I could almost hear Wilson talking.<br/><br/>Mentally, I never left the theater.  Sure, Chuck Noland was cast away, but so was the audience.  When I physically left the theater I felt distant.  I felt like one person instead of a member of society.  I believe that's what Zemeckis and Hanks wanted you to feel.  The entire film was about realizing yourself.  It worked<br/><br/>I look at this film not as a drama but more as a fantasy that every human being should wish upon themselves. This movie was indeed a saga.  It was like a trilogy in one movie.  There will be no sequel.  There will be no prequel.  It's done.  The movie opened and closed, stepping to the top of cinema history."

","In Cast Away, Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance which virtually defines the film, a tale of a man literally stripped bare of his societal pretensions.  Hanks is a premiere performer and his work in this film definitely deserved an academy award.  Of course, the ""oscars"" have rarely reflected the ""best"" that there is to offer in films.  Fortunately, Tom Hanks is an artist who surely realizes his best reward is in the work he does.  Comments that the movie is ""boring"" depress me.

"eve6kicksass","Null","0","0","12 April 2001"," A much used plotline doesnt diminish this film's power....
","Rating: ***1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Review:  When I first heard the plot outline for CAST AWAY, I was praying to God that Hollywood wasn't going to go back to Gilligan's Island territory and use a much-respected actor (Tom Hanks) as a way to make viewers not realize their the plot had absolutely no originality (which about 60% of all Hollywood films are currently...and increasing every year!).  However, thanks to a perceptive screenplay by William Broyles, Jr., this film practically made me disappointed with myself for making those assumptions. Even worse, it wasn't until I saw Hanks on the THE TONIGHT SHOW a few months later and explaining that his inspiration for CAST AWAY came when he viewed a documentary on the life and disappearance of Amelia Earhart, as well as the startling theory that she may have lived another 50 years on a deserted island after being discovered missing.  On that note, there will most likely not be another time I will misjudge Hollywood for what I hear before I actually buy my ticket and popcorn and watch the movie and not putting my opinions down on paper before I actually watch the final frame. Director Robert Zemeckis (who helmed the much-loved favorites BACK TO THE FUTURE, CONTACT and WHAT LIES BENEATH) teams with Hanks for the very first time to tell the story of a FEDEX employee who finds himself washed ashore on a Pacific island after a frightening plane crash.  It's now Man vs. Nature as Hanks collects small amounts of water from coconuts and rain, builds a fire to cook crab, make attempts let people know he is there and be rescued, and even creating a companion to talk to---a Wilson volleyball!  I will not divulge what happens to Hanks eventually, for the purpose that this film develops an emotional intensity during the final half four.<br/><br/>Just as it sounds this is Tom Hanks' show all the way; the two-time Academy Award winner has been giving outstanding trademark performances all throughout his career, from playing a 12-year-old trapped inside the body of a 30-year-old (BIG), to a homosexual battling AIDS (PHILADELPHIA), and finally to a sweet simpleton who only is only barely aware of his surroundings and the people in this life (FORREST GUMP).  In CAST AWAY, Hanks makes his character someone to actually care about, which is one of the most important elements in any good performance;  he makes his lost FEDEX worker convincingly go through different emotional phases which results in a strong development in the character.  Academy-Award winner Helen Hunt (AS GOOD AS IT GETS) plays the woman he loves with earnestness and compassion.  Still, the one ""character"" that practically steals the film is Wilson, the volleyball who Hanks creates as a friend in order escape insanity, and as a lesser reason to have something---if not someone---to talk to; Wilson's final sequence is truly moving and unforgettable. In more ways than one, CAST AWAY surprised me and I loved it from beginning to end; if anything, I truly believe that with any other actor besides Hanks the character would be dull and the viewer wouldn't get involved.  The film also boasts a fine score by Alan Silvestri (a regular on many Zemeckis films), as well as gorgeous photography and, finally, William Broyles, Jr's wonderful script, which managed to dodge cliches and make the film overall seem new and fresh.    For that reason, I know that next time I go see a film a famliar story, that I will not print a word until the theater's lights illuminate once again."
"three times tom","10","0","0","10 April 2001"," So many people missed the point of this film
","I've seen Cast Away nine times, and I'm still noticing bits of new information here and there.  Some of the people who missed the point of this film did so because they have basic details wrong.  I wish I had the space to write an in-depth review, but instead I'll just concentrate on one specific area of contention--the ending--and add my general opinion as to why this movie has been so widely misunderstood and misinterpreted.<br/><br/>
*********SPOILER ALERT*********<br/><br/>***READ ON ONLY IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM***<br/><br/>
First of all, Noland is *not* smiling at the end of the picture, although he may be intentionally mimicking Wilson's half-smile.  He is clearly facing in Bettina's direction but it is not clear that he is going to follow her. The point is that he knows that he could follow her if he wanted to; he is back to the place where he has choices about life again.  In the ""ice in my glass"" speech, he says his low point on the island is about having ""power over nothing"".  At the end of the film he has regained that personal power--to go in whatever direction he chooses, to follow Bettina or not. The mere opportunity to make the decision is the resolution, more important than the specific decision itself.  That is a psychologically sophisticated ending, much more satisfying than the typical Hollywood alternative.  If he had jumped in the truck and driven after her I would have thrown something at the screen--it just wouldn't have fit.<br/><br/>Also, although he thought that Kelly was the woman with him on the island giving him the strength to go on during the four isolated years, it is equally true that Bettina was with him on the island--she was present with him through her art and his reproductions of her art even though he had never met her.  Bettina is a good match for Chuck; for whatever reason, she's grown comfortable with being isolated from modern life too: she's living out in the middle of nowhere, she's driving an antique truck in a culture that judges you by the trendiness of the car you drive, she does not recognize him even though he's an international media celebrity (the story of his rescue was thoroughly covered in all those newspapers and magazines on Kelly's dining room table).  Noland thought Kelly was his reason for living, and he lost her, but Bettina was his reason for living too, in some ways more directly responsible for his survival and salvation/escape, and there is still a chance that he could have her (a fairly good chance from the way she flirted with him, and just wait till she hears the story about how her art saved his life!).  I could go on, and that's about the ending alone.<br/><br/>I think that the real problem with people's mixed response to this picture is that you do have to care about Tom Hanks to appreciate this performance. I think he is a great actor, and more than just a movie star, but who says that the two can't be one and the same?  I care about every character he plays (well, we won't mention Sherman McCoy) and the whole point of my moviegoing is to enter into a story about characters I can care about.  But that is a sign of my age and my identity as a student of human nature. Most of us reading this board know that the modern movie going audience isn't interested in caring about characters anymore.  They don't care about Hanks, Noland, any other character, or maybe even themselves, for that matter.  In fact, watching bad things happen to characters no one cares about drives most movies these days.  The vast majority of commercial hits are made for people who can only be entertained by laughing at people doing stupid things (for the price of a movie ticket they get a chance to feel superior to *somebody*); laughing at people being killed, maimed or otherwise physically harmed (how sick is *that*); pat sentimental mush at the level of romance novels or true confession magazines; stuff blowing up; sexual display and innuendo.  How could those people hope to get anything out of Cast Away, or any other serious picture?  They have no frame of reference, no experience of reflecting on the meaning of life.<br/><br/>The other group of people who hate this film are the ""too cool for film school"" cynics who use their art as a distancing tool to keep from feeling uncool emotions like empathy, tenderness and transcendence.  I don't even have space to go into how much I pity those people, for they also have trouble entering into the real meaning of life, and their art is therefore destined to be empty, only appealing to others who have adopted the same cynical worldview.<br/><br/>I do love Tom Hanks, I'll admit that.  I adore him, admire him and respect him.  I love his intelligence, his discipline, his integrity, his dedication to his craft, his interest in history, his liberal politics, his happy marriage (no small feat in this world) and the fact that he shares my vocation as a student of human nature.  Also, he is lovely to look at even with a Buddha belly, a scraggly beard, or wild man's hair (those lips, those eyes!) and he plays the full range of his expressive speaking voice like Yo Yo Ma on the cello.  Some of his critics think that those of us who love him are reading into his work a subtlety of emotion that isn't really there, and/or overlooking his over the top moments because of personal devotion to him.  I only know that I feel bonded to all the people who reacted to the depth of his performance in the same way that I did.  Whether we react to him out of our feelings for him or out of his acting ability is almost irrelevant--how can who he is be separated from the art he creates?  This is what it means to be an icon, a national treasure, and all the other superlatives we use to describe him.  His own self is the only canvas on which any actor can paint; he uses his personality, his access to his own emotional history, even the aura of decency that keeps us from accepting him as a bad guy, he uses all of this to create these unforgettable roles, and in return we care about the characters he portrays and the stories he tells. In my opinion he should have about five Oscars by now; look at Apollo 13 again, look at Saving Private Ryan, imagine them without Hanks, imagine any other actor who ever lived trying to do what he did in Cast Away--how many people would pay to watch Russell Crowe rub two sticks together, especially if he were robbed of the superficial elements of his physical attractiveness?<br/><br/>As some other reviewer said, it shouldn't matter how many Oscars you already have, if you give the best performance of the year (most physically challenging, most emotionally authentic, most essential to the artistic success of your film) you ought to be the winner.  Hanks can easily do without that third Oscar for now.  But one of these days he will get it--and with it the proof that he is the finest actor of my lifetime.  Let Russell have his make-up Oscar; Tom was robbed as surely as Ralph Fiennes was robbed for Schindler's List.  But in 25 years we'll still be watching Schindler's List, and we'll still be watching Cast Away, while The Fugitive will lie on some forgotten celluloid heap and Gladiator will have become as laughable as the Ten Commandments.  So although I'm disappointed, I can wait, because Hanks will be turning in fine nuanced performances and making memorable, emotionally resonant films for another 20 years, long after Crowe has been supplanted by the next alpha male on the block.  Unsolicited advice for Russell Crowe: get over yourself, put your Oscar in a box, send it to Tom Hanks, and shut up!  And anyone who thinks Gladiator was a great film needs to arrange an immediate screening of Spartacus.<br/><br/>I'll stop short of saying that Cast Away is a great film--like many others on this board I think I could have made (or edited) a better movie, both a tighter movie with respect to the set up and a more complete movie with an expanded development of his descent into despair and resignation on the island. It's too obvious that they shot a lot of other island footage that is left out, but I guess Zemekis was right to be concerned about length since people have been complaining about that (as for me, it was 2:23 well spent and I dream of a three hour director's cut).  I would have also made the ending longer, expanding the resolution between Noland and Frears.  But while Cast Away may not be a brilliant picture, Tom Hanks definitely gives a brilliant performance.  It is the kind of acting that makes people think, re-evaluate, come to a new understanding of the world.  It is the kind of performance that changes people's lives.  It changed mine.  I am still stunned that Hanks was overlooked on Oscar night.  I heard the Best Actor race was tight and the voting very close.  I guess too many of the Academy voters fit my description above--cluelessly shallow or smugly cynical.  The rest of us love Hanks, love his acting and loved Cast Away.<br/><br/>I think I'll go see it again tomorrow."

","I love it when Hollywood proves me wrong.  Here I am, a huge proponent of independent cinema as the last bastion of quality filmmaking left in America.  But I have to admit, it is such a good feeling to walk out of a multiplex after seeing a Hollywood movie that is finely crafted by intelligent  professionals, with production value afforded by the financial support of a major studio, and yet so full of truth and love.  By any standards, Hollywood or Indie, Cast Away is a smart movie that is courageous enough to challenge its audience.  I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to pitch this idea to a studio executive.<br/><br/>Exec:  Lemme get this straight, for the whole second act of this picture, we only get to watch one actor?  How are we gonna get dialogue out of that?<br/><br/>Writer:  That's the point, you see?  There won't be any dialogue.  This is a movie about the loneliest guy on earth.<br/><br/>Exec:  Are you kidding me?  The average Joe Moviegoer won't go near a picture that doesn't have any dialogue in it.<br/><br/>Writer:  Um, yeah.... Did I mention that we also don't want there to be any music while he's on the island...?<br/><br/>I'm of the opinion that the only way this movie could have been greenlit is if the greatest actor in the world was attached to star.  And indeed he was. While there are many great actors in the world, none of them have the same Everyman affection, the Nice Guy appeal, or the Movie Star clout as Mr.Tom Hanks.  He's the only actor in the world who could carry a film like this by himself.  And it is such a joy to watch his mind work through challenge after challenge after challenge on the island.<br/><br/>Watching this movie just makes you feel good.  As much as I say it challenges the audience, it is also dramatically satisfying and thematically reassuring.  We are presented with a story of man vs. nature, reminiscent of romantic classics such as Robinson Crusoe.  And by watching his struggles and witnessing the difficult lessons he learns upon his homecoming, the movie delivers one of those universal truths that we never get tired of hearing.  This is Hollywood moviemaking at its best.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","If you love movies, you'll LOVE this! I saw this movie in early January this year and it's still in my mind 4 months later! This movie's made me in to a Tom Hanks fan because it really did give him the chance to shine. Him and his co star Wilson (the volleyball) work brilliantly together, as well as Helen Hunt who was under used but with Tom Hanks there instead......I know which one I prefer. I must warn you though, if you are flying soon and have a fear of it then don't watch this movie for your own sake. The plane crash is phenomonal and leaves you feeling dizzy and shaken. The last half hour of the movie does let the film's interest slip a bit but not much. 2 and a half hours of non-stop Tom Hanks running around on a beach and talking to his Fed-Ex friend?

"kells-4","6","0","0","5 April 2001"," Staring Tom Hanks as...Tom Hanks
","WARNING: SOME MOVIE SPOILERS AND DETAILS ARE CONTAINED WITHIN<br/><br/>CUT TO THE CHASE, well not in this film.  In the beginning, a lethargic and reality-incongruent attempt to propel the emotive elements into viewer consciousness.  But for director Zemeckis, our fodder intellect need not apply to the language used in this film; the links in the build-up are forcibly coerced and the story line can't really get rolling as every notion is too telegraphed.  The audience know the disaster is looming, but it need not have been so auto-cued, even for Hollywood's version of Gilligan's Island meets sociological experiment.  For Helen Hunt, a talent of note, this certainly is not as good as it gets, while Tom seems initially a little lost himself.<br/><br/>Then, the much heralded plane scene, so realistic I almost felt sick. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks is far too close to the front of the plane to have survived, but thats show biz.<br/><br/>On to the next module dimension: Tom is cast away on a small island.  Here we see some cool acting by Tom, playing himself of course, showing us that even though he can be brilliant in films like The Green Mile, he can still be homogenized by an ill conceived dull script.  Tom takes over the movie by himself really, no directorship required.  There's the usual bits you'd expect: arrival, set up, learning of the environment, injury, defeat, craze, fight-back, planning, rescue, and hey presto, he's on a flight to Memphis with tasty refreshments.  And maybe I'm wrong, but I thought it was dolphins who loved helping humans lost at sea, not whales!<br/><br/>
In the final setting: 'the cast away returns', Tom goes round telling those he so callously left behind, just how sorry he is that he wasn't there for them.  I felt a bit squeamish at that point, and it was heightened at the moment I saw my girlfriend crying as she uttered ""he's lost everything"". ""Yes, he has"" I empathetically replied.<br/><br/>Zemeckis seems determined here to paint us each like Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting, the empathy role, because, its not Tom's fault he wasn't there while he was stuck on an island for four and a half years, it's not your fault Tom, it's not your fault Tom, it's not your fault.  The final tease for me (well the first actually), was the best, the scene was set for the cheese ending, and then it had the plug pulled, and I loved it!<br/><br/>To summarize, we paid our money and went through the alphabet one more time. If this is one of the five best films of the year then the world should stop making them.  The plane scene is the savior, but its not enough. Special marks though for casting Vince Martin who is actually famous in Australasia for being a 'know one' and becoming a very successful product pusher! Afterwards, those around me looked bemused, and the guy next to me gave me that look that let me know his girlfriend had been through a rough emotional roller coaster ride too."
"maxbemba","Null","0","0","7 April 2001"," Falling Coconuts
","*** SPOILERS AHEAD FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END! ***<br/><br/>I regret to say that ""Cast Away"" is a terrible movie.  Even the title is a dead giveaway that we are about to be subjected to one of those unforgettable moral lessons that should be cast in bronze for the future generations to behold.  Which is too bad because I like the gentle quirkiness that Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis bring to the movies they do together.  One can almost feel the love they pour into their work: well-thought-out, carefully crafted, professionally done pieces of entertainment.  Humble fables on a grand scale.  They consciously try not to insult the audience's intelligence or offend them in any way.  But the operative word I'm using here is ""consciously"".  And, once we finally recognize what the moral of the fable MEANS, what it is is deeply disturbing.    <br/><br/>Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a time-obsessed overseas manager for Fed Ex whose plane crashes and gets stranded alone in a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean and, when he gets back, he finds that he has lost everything that mattered for him and helped him survive his ordeal.  Now, totally lost and alone, he must decide what road to take to go on with his life.  Not a bad idea for an adventure movie, even if they turned it into a silly no-brainer, which this movie clearly isn't.  Being that so, what happened? <br/><br/>
For starters, there is not one moment in ""Cast Away"" where I felt that anything was at stake.  Not once.  Since we know that at some point he will get back home (those fat exposition scenes at the beginning are ripe for some neat payoffs), we at least expect for something terrifying to happen to him while he is in the island.  And so we sit back and wait for those moments of transcendence to happen, those shocking instants when he suddenly realizes that he is alone, that he is mortal, that he will never be rescued, that he does not want to die.  We just don't want to watch him as he buries a dead body, opens coconuts, makes a fire, knocks out an abscessed tooth, or builds a raft.  We in the audience want to FEEL what is going on inside this man.  Those moments never do come.  Perhaps the most significant episode, where he tries to take his own life, is never actually shown (but rather ""explained"" later in the most naked, and weakest, scene of the movie).  What we end up getting is a gleam in his eye, a volleyball, and the sound of falling coconuts, and that last one is played for a couple of startlers and a laugh.  <br/><br/>Hanks works very hard.  Harder than on any other thing he has done up to this point (production was shut for one year until he lost fifty pounds), and he IS impressive (he is a gifted actor); but he is (still) a lightweight actor, and he is paralyzed by the too-worked-out conception, this goddamned control-freak mania among filmmakers to tie every single loose filament together until there is nothing, not a single open space for us to walk into and rightfully reclaim as ours.  <br/><br/>There is something else simmering under the surface of this movie.  ""Cast Away""?  What it is being casted away?  Is it doubts?  Hopes?  Fear? Jealousy?  Love?  Chuck Noland hated that island and returned to the white middle-class values he was violently torn off; he has ice in a glass again; his work; he lost his girl but still has another chance. <br/><br/>
At the end, we get our moment of transcendence, the conception this movie was working towards from the beginning: Noland, alone in the intersection where the movie started, looks around at the four roads he has to choose from.  His brow is clean.  No words come out of his mouth.  What decision is he going to make?  Music.  Fade to black.  End credits. <br/><br/>
My guess is he doesn't need to make any decision: he is Everyman: we are meant to decide for him.  We witnessed his decency, concern, bravery, toughness, tenacity, and self-reliance.  He didn't really need anyone to survive.  We can do.  <br/><br/>If Tom Hanks doesn't hurry up and cleans up his act he will turn into the favorite poster boy for the ultra conservative right. <br/><br/>
Book burnings and Nazi flags should be the next step."

","This is one of the most unusual and enjoyable movies I've seen in a while. For almost 95% of the movie there's only one actor, two if you want to count a volleyballand in a way he/it does become a very significant character. Why did I enjoy this movie so much? Tom Hanks. Need I say more? Ok, maybe Wilson the volleyball. He was pretty good too; strong silent type. Actor of few words.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive sent to Russia to setup the first courier operation the country has ever seen. His life revolves around the clock and following very specific rules. There is no such thing as basically being on time. You're on time or you're notand you better be on time. He comes back from this trip and we're briefly introduced to his personal life. We meet his fiancé (played by Helen Hunt) and get a very brief glimpse of the life he leads away from FedEx. Shortly after his arrival to the US, he is called away again on another trip. After a hasty good-bye, he's on the plane to his next destination. We all know what happens next and basically for the rest of the movie so I'm not going to go into any more detail about the story. 	 Making a movie with primarily one character in it is kind of a risky venture but this movie proved that it can be done. Tom Hanks is proving why he's one of the best actors in the business with this movie. It's amazing the amount of stress he puts on himself with the physical changes he goes through to make this movie look authentic. There isn't a lot of dialogue either. Hanks has been able to marvelously show the transformation a person goes through when isolated from the rest of society for a long period of time. There are many moments in the movie where Hanks doesn't say a word but is able to communicate so much to the audience. My favorite is when he's sitting on his haunches looking at the remains of a port-a-potty that washed up thinking of how to best use it. It's a very simple scene yet Hanks is able to say so much without ever uttering a word. <br/><br/>The few weaknesses that I did see revolved around the ending. I guess with a movie of this nature, there are only so many ways to tie it up. Either the character remains stranded on the island forever or he gets rescued. They chose the latter for this movie but to me, it seemed anti-climatic. The ending was tied up a bit neatly but they did try to incorporate a bit of a human interest into it by having a problem arise between Hanks character and Hunts character. It's not overly interesting and I won't spoil it for you but trust me when I say that you will be amazed by the portion of the movie that revolves around Hanks time on the island. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth seeing on the big screenand it should be seen on a big screen. There are too many quiet, subtle instances that you will miss if you watch it on a TV. It's worth the price of full admission."

","By far this is the best film of 2000.  Tom Hanks ranks up there with the classic actors of yesteryear.  Just when you thought he could not top his last film, Tom does it again.  This time Tom pretty much has the entire film on his shoulders.  This thought provoking film is incredible, it makes you feel as though you are alone on the island, you only have the knowledge in your head to survive, and a will or reason to live.  Cast Away is a bit lengthy but you never realize it.  Also the movie is filmed beautifully in both Russia and the Fiji Islands.  I would like to see the survivors on Survivor the tv show live out a life like what is portrayed in this movie. This is true survivorship.  Not even the Swiss Family Robinson or Gilligan's Island had it this rough.  This is a must see movie for anyone."

","If Russell Crow weren't so darn good in Gladiator Tom Hanks would be a three time Academy Award winner.  The performance he tendered in Cast Away was honestly better than the two that won him Oscars, especially when one considers his co-star for the majority of the film was a piece of sporting equipment.  This film amazed me from beginning to end.  For a couple of hours I because Chuck Noland.  What more could I ask from a movie?  I liked this film more than most of my friends, and I can certainly understand why it just wouldn't click with some people.  Cast Away is deeply psychological and personal, and it makes the viewer think as much about his or her own life as about the story line.  It is ultimately a story of hope and perseverance, not of one man but of the human race.  Now that it has left theaters I suggest watching this movie alone and free from distractions.  I hope it speaks to you the way it spoke to me."

","After enduring stuff like The Beach, Castaway (the boring TV series), and the hideous Temptation Island, this sand-surf-and-sun drama is more entertaining than the rest of the genre by far.<br/><br/>Mr Hanks was extremely good in this film. He plays his character Chuck convincingly. When he ends up marooned on the island, you really feel for the poor guy. I even asked myself - why didn't he try to make a fire earlier - especially when he's waving and yelling at the light far out to sea - and it's night!! But then we remember he is an urbanite stuck on this small island in the middle of the pacific, and these logical things wouldn't come easily at first to the mind of a city dweller.... <br/><br/>The main story of this film isn't so much his life on the island (and Tom Hanks portrays this excellently), but the way Mr Hanks rebuilds his life once he gets back home. I was rather disappointed, because it would've made more sense to see how he managed to survive on the island for 4 whole years. The long final third of the flick (when he's home again) could've been reduced to maybe 20 minutes. <br/><br/>The plane crash is one of the scariest I've seen in a flick. Also the best action scene in this film. For fans of action, this will NOT be the movie for them. Admittedly, its a sad reunion at the end, and things don't turn out in a typical Hollywood Cliche manner. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION? Wilson the volley ball ROCKS! No, only kidding!!!"

","Cast Away is a great film for the family to see together. Except for being long, it showed the resilence of a human being trying to survive. The movie jumped from Tom Hank's arrival; then, suddenly, it was 4 years later. It might have made more sense if his years on the island were divided up into individual years. In the beginning, he was at a loss as how to survive. By the end, he knew how to use his resources. In between, it might have shown how, with each year, he acquired new skills. The crash scene was really convincing. Tom Hanks managed to inject some humor into his situation. I loved the Wilson soccer ball made into a companion. Toward the end, he showed deep despair over his loss of it. It's incredible how he managed to survive on that raft he made. He seemed like more of an urban guy than some rugged survivalist. Losing his girlfriend to another man was a sad reality, but if he survived a hostile environment for 4 years, he'd survive this too."

Director Robert Zemeckis stages one of the most realistic<br/><br/>plane crashes I have ever seen and the stillness which fills the last frame<br/><br/>of the movie with a crossroads as its focus is perfectly executed.

","After seeing Cast Away, you realize just why Tom Hanks is our generation's finest actor! To be able to carry off a movie on his own with liitle or no dialogue for major sections of the movie is quite the achievement, not to mention the difficult conditions that the movie was shot under and the physical demands of the role as well. Although, there are parts of the movie that feel rather stunted, it is a movie about a man stranded on an island and trying to cope with loneliness and survival on his own. What I loved was the middle part, when he's on his own, but there is no music, no drama, just Tom Hanks, and the sights and sounds of the island around him..Ahhh..I lust after that tranquility..don't get me wrong!! I don't ever wanna be stranded..I think I'd die within days:-)) The Academy chose Russell Crowe instead for Best Actor. Now, I am an Aussie myself(well, Indian born, but true blue at heart) and I was glad for Russell, he's a gem of an actor, but it truly did belong to one guy who wasn't even nominated!!! Michael Douglas for Wonder Boys was my clear choice for Best Actor. But after his non-nomination, I was firmly behind Tom Hanks making it three in a row. Do not watch this movie on a Saturday night with friends!! Watch it all alone and rejoice in the fact that we have an actor of Tom's calibre for our entertainment:-))<br/><br/>Cheers Rahul Prasad"
"Bil-3","Null","0","0","28 March 2001"," *** 1/2 Needs a middle
","Tom Hanks' amazing performance is the best reason to watch this excellent drama directed by Robert Zemeckis. The second of two films Zemeckis made in the year 2000 (the other being What Lies Beneath) this is definitely not the superior of the two but is still a worthwhile tale of a Federal Express supervisor stranded on a deserted island for four years after his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Helen Hunt plays the devoted girlfriend who doesn't know to wait for him back home. The film is painfully missing a middle, so once the scenes of isolation are (quickly) over, one is led to believe that Hanks' readjustment to the so-called normal society back home is really the heart of the story. Sadly, this aspect of the plot is also underdeveloped, leaving a good movie that doesn't quite know what it's about."

I am glad that when hanks washes up on the deserted island they didn't load it up with all sorts of idiotic scenarios like pirates, or savage natives, or predators and such. It is just Hanks trying to survive the best he can all alone. He had plenty of time for soul searching to see what drives you to fight to stay alive. It makes you wonder how you would have done it if you were in his shoes.<br/><br/>The ending was different also from what you might expect.  Its not all tidy happy ever after ending, which I liked. The reuniting of Hanks and Hunt at the end is very intense and touching that definitely tugs at you emotionally."

","This movie has been reviwed by many, and has taken some blows that do not do the story credit.  This is not a story for those who've become accustomed to fast-paced action, although there are moments of that.  This is the story of one who is forced to respond to events - survive - or perish.  And given that it is the story of survival on an isolated South Pacific island, it has a pace that probably does not satisfy some.<br/><br/>It is a satisfying movie, however, for those that would give in to it.  It is missing that last magical integration of elements that could elevate it to a classic, which it is not.  It is, however, a wonderful story that leaves one with an overriding sense of loss, with just the element of hope and survival at the end that brings the loss into balance.<br/><br/>
The cinematography has moments that are breathtaking, especially when the viewer is given the sense of isolation amidst the vastness of the ocean. For one who grew up in that Pacific, these moments were especially effective.<br/><br/>This movie may not be for everyone, but for those who are ready for something other than chocolate and vanilla, this may just hit the spot.  I recommend it."

When you watch a man 'cast away' every major component of his life... one by one... clothes,body fat, human contact, comfort, the pressure of time... a portion of sanity... and then see whats left behind.<br/><br/>The first act plane crash is phenomenal. You will NEVER take your shoes off in an airplane again... or be without a Leatherman tool. :-) When Chuck first lands on the island; i was made to feel like the island itself is a creature... a being... a thing that imprisons... it KEEPS you. On the horizon you COULD be free... but you CAN'T GET there. And you watch Chuck. Chuck is REAL. And so are His frustrations, his pain, his discomfort & his joy in triumph!!When he makes fire... I shouted with him. I, too, find myself wanting to get back to Kelly... to hear a human voice... to be warm at night... to not be thirsty anymore. Chuck's numerous transformations make me feel like i went through them with him. During the second act, after four years has passed... it felt like chuck had crawled into a cave... and what was left was ""all that he couldn't leave behind"" or throw away. Just ... surviving. Staying alive. Then one day the tide brings in his way off. In this film you will watch a man CHANGE. Tom Hanks makes me believe in a character like never before in a film. I BELIEVE him. I BELIEVE he has 'thrown overboard' every thing that was of no use to him in order to survive, in order to LIVE. ""WhatEVER it takes to live"" was what i thought about as i left the theater... and to ENJOY your life, and enjoy every LITTLE thing. Ice. Sheets. A cup of HOT coffee. Human touch. MUSIC! What if i couldn't listen to music for 4 years??? A kiss from a woman! ( again... 4 years? )Savoring every last good thing in my life. In the word's of U2, this film challenged me to, in my own life, throw overboard the worthless junk that will hinder me, and keep ""all that i can't leave behind"" ... and enjoy. Go see it. wait. And then see it again. *** By the way... ( and this is seen in the previews) When Chuck says at the beginning of the film;""We live or we die by The Clock!""... he has a pager with a clock, a digital watch, clocks in the warehouse etc.... and at the end ... notice he wears no watch."

","Spoiler alert, just in case.<br/><br/>I think I may have missed something in the way of symbolism for the ending, but then again, I see a lot of other people who liked it wonder about the ending too.<br/><br/>Misc. Thoughts: First, we start out with about a two-minute commercial for FedEx.  Not bad in and of itself, since apparently it eventually has something to do with the plot.  And I may have missed it (Dad said it was there), but I would have appreciated a line with when we were supposed to be - for example, ""December 18, 1995"" or along those lines.  You only realize that the beginning isn't the present day when you see the older CNN logo and the dead crewman's 'gravestone' end with 1995.  Seeing Chuck and Kelly at the end sparked more emotion than I've had for a movie in a long time. Also, Silvestri is great (he did Back to the Future, after all), but how does music in a small fraction of a 2:15 movie amount to an Oscar nomination?  I'm confused.  Finally: That 2:15 did fly by.  I could not get myself to leave the theater.<br/><br/>What I did not understand was the whole wings thing.  So this lady in Texas makes a LOT of sculptures with this design.  Point?  When Chuck first picked up the package, I thought the wings meant ""rush delivery"" or ""overnight air"" or something, a FedEx mark of some sort. When he didn't open it, I wondered ""What is significant about this package?""  He had no qualms about a ""Dissolution of Marriage"" paper.  Holding on to that package, to me, made absolutely no sense.  Why did this have to be delivered?  What was so sacred?  What about it made him paint that design on his sail?  _Why did it save his life???_  I'm sure I'm missing something, but I certainly am unsure of what.<br/><br/>7.5/10 because the ending, specifically the last five minutes, sucked, and I'd like an explanation about the wings.  Too many unanswered questions and ambiguities.  I don't get it.  I just don't get it."

","Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away is one of the best films I've seen for a long time. Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance as Chuck Noland, a Federal Express worker who leaves Memphis, for a short time to go overseas on business. Before leaving, he tells his girlfriend Kelly ( Helen Hunt), ""I'll be right back"". What happens next is extraordinary filmmaking: Chuck's plane crashes, and Chuck is the sole survivor, finding himself cast ashore on a deserted island. These scenes are the greatest in the film, for we see Hanks trying to adjust to island life, and having as his only companion, a volleyball which he calls ""Wilson"". There are a few funny scenes in Cast Away. I laughed at the scenes in which the Federal Express boxes were cast ashore, which were full of rollerskates, videotapes, and of course the volleyball. But the main point of Cast Away is the drama of trying to adjust to life, both on the island and when he gets back home. Whatever you do, just see this film at least once."

Having said that, the rest of the film is just brilliant !   The casting was inspired, as Tom Hanks is totally amazing !   Solo acting is always difficult, but he pulls it off so well, that you start to feel the range of emotions he goes though.  Hopelessness as he realizes his situation, pain (you just KNOW those rocks were sharp !), despondency, single-mindedness as he sets about his escape and finally bewilderment and heartbreak as he arrives back home only to find his girlfriend has married.<br/><br/>I thought the final scene was great - does he or does he not find love in the end ?   I'll leave that to your imagination, but if you were paying attention then as he is pacing around at the cross roads trying to describe where to go next, you may have noticed that little sparkle in his eye as he looks again in the direction of the pickup truck moving away from him !<br/><br/>And finally, don't you wish you could know what was in the package he left on her doorstep ?

The camera pans up to him standing there..all stoic..nonesense. I realize that some of this is the directors fault, letting Hanks go too far with some of this stuff. But for the people tauting this as ""Hanks for Oscar"" etc. ..no way. Also, the last 3rd of the movie lagged and could have editted to half. Not a great film: too long and too many melodramatic scenes. Also, the whale scene was so fake I couldn't take it. With all the modern technology these days, that scene was pathetic.

The direction was very good indeed. I was let down however, by the last 15 minutes. The story was completely aimless and empty, and i also found it very frustrating to see how the idea of 'hope for the future' was being enforced upon us.

","Not being a fan of either Tom Hanks, Robert Zemekis or American movies in general, I wasn't expecting much from `Cast Away'.  It was an extremely hot day in Adelaide that day, and the closest movie theatre seemed to be the best escape from the heat. I walked out of this film feeling fully entertained, plus taking with me much food for thought.<br/><br/>None of the performances moved me terribly, but I found the screenplay most interesting.  It was obvious to me that the story itself was a metaphor for life, and within this was a strong message to us all.  Whatever message you take away will depend on your basic values.<br/><br/>The story covered the 3 stages of life -       - I know everything, and I can do what I like - Good grief, I don't know everything, and now I have to learn about life from the ground up - I can rejoin the human race, but I'm changed beyond recognition. The catalyst to Stage 2 in the film was the plane crash, and Tom Hanks' character being stranded on a remote and uninhabited island.  For the rest of the human race, this catalyst is generally far more subtle, but it inevitably leaves us feeling that our lives are out of our control.  Feeling out of control is generally a neon sign that change is needed.<br/><br/>Whether the screenwriter intended this film to be a metaphor I can't say, but the result is a sharply and succinctly edited piece, which is so unlike other `big' American movies.

How did he survive looking so well for four years with not enough food and wood for his stomach and fire. How did he avoid fatal infection after being cut so badly and his rescue was most unlikely.  But remembering that it was only a story, the acting by Tom Hanks deserves an award, the direction was excellent and effects well done. I would like to know if many stunt men were used.  The story jumped around and left large gaps.  It would have been good to have these gaps filled and the film longer.<br/><br/>Congratulations to the production team for an excellent and enjoyable film."

","Once again Tom Hanks doesnt disappoint his fans, his work is once again brilliant!  As in all his roles he delivers his lines with sheer genius quality however in this film he spends much of his time alone and not speaking yet his acting touches the audience as if he is verbally communicating.  Just the look of his face, the gestures, everything.....all communicates to us his pain and suffering.  The plane crash scene is just amazing, it is so very vivid and you find yourself in your seat gripping the armrest and holding your breath, as if you are a passenger on this plane as well!!  What the character Tom Hanks plays goes thru in order to simply survive the plane crash is just the nightmare beginning for him.<br/><br/>I personally felt such a spiritual feeling from this movie.  His character's guardian angel is the one who gets him thru this long ordeal and perhaps you will agree with this interpretation once you see it.<br/><br/>This is really a must see film and please dont wait for the video or the television showing of it.....you MUST see and hear it on the ""big screen!!"""

","Cast Away is Tom Hank's latest Oscar-hopeful performance, but rest assured, a nomination will not be garnered.  Though the film is at its best when Hanks is in the drudges of loneliness, it fails to convince us of Hank's relationship with co-star Helen Hunt.  Though their scenes together are few, it certainly detracts from the mood set throughout the film.<br/><br/>Cast Away begins by showing us Tom Hank's character as a man obsessed with time: he has to be, since he works for Federal Express.  After saying goodbye to his wife (Helen Hunt, in a flat, one-note performance), he is in a plane crash that leaves the others dead and himself stranded on an island.<br/><br/>Time apart from loved ones and friends is an essential theme to Cast Away, that is, time should not be wasted - during his ordeal on the island, the pain Hanks feels is not for the loss of food, shelter, or material possessions.  His inspiration for survival is the love of his life, Helen Hunt.  During his stay on the island, his need for a companion grows to the point where he takes to talking to a volleyball.  In fact, the most emotionally stirring scene takes place between he and the volleyball and not the ones with Helen Hunt: when sports equipment makes a greater impression with the audience than a top actress, there's something quite wrong.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' performance as Chuck Noland may not be Oscar material, but it certainly is well-done, and the  long stretches and scenes without much dialogue are enlivened by some funny instances and Robert Zemeckis ironically lush photography of the paradise-like island turned prison for Hanks..  There's also quite a few touches of irony in the film, and also inventiveness that comes in the way of Hank's novel uses of some of the FedEx packages that wash ashore with him.<br/><br/>For all the buzz that's been generated by this Hanks/Zemeckis project, the film lives up to it in the beginning and middle - but the end feels like it was hastily put together - the scenes between Hunt and Hanks feel contrived, the dialogue is flat, and they have zero chemistry.  If only the film had ended 20 minutes sooner, the solitude and meaning of the film would have gained fantastic strength and momentum; unfortunately, it's undone by a rather banal ending."

","The last time we were treated to the Tom Hanks ""State of the Union"" speech was at the 2001 Golden Globe Awards ceremony. You knew something was up when he accepted Best Actor without the usual tears streaming or welling up on his face. Tom Hanks is getting used to this. Hanks is a brilliant actor and luckily for him, a movie has been made that stages his abilities yet once again.<br/><br/>Cast Away is a refreshing adventure movie set in the Pacific (where else when it comes to major routes via FedEx?) Yes, there is a plane crash. Hanks' character 'Noland' survives the crash without injuries and manages to stay afloat in his rubber dinghy until dry lands arrives. I am not giving away much considering most of the spoilers are left to the theatrical trailer.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis is successful at reminding us in this world of technology and plentiful relationships that we really can be alone on this planet. Hanks evolves his character with typical mastery. He uses restraint when necessary and builds suspense as we wonder ""How would I react in a situation like that?"" Hanks answers all of these questions depending on little dialogue while on the island.<br/><br/>In a cinematic impossibility, Zemeckis forms the key element to this film that would have suffered without it...a relationship with Wilson ( a volleyball that washes also ashore).The relationship between Hanks and the Volleyball works. The film might have been boring with unrealistic conversations talking to oneself serving no purpose except to inform the audience. Here, Hanks serves up a memorable performance engaging Wilson and continually validates the drama that unfolds on the island.<br/><br/>At either end of the island adventure exists the real world and Hanks' tether to his rat-in-a-maze existence. His love-interest with Helen Hunt is weak it seems and we are left to wonder how strong their relationship is given the circumstances. Zemeckis forms a series of events where Hanks's courier work stands in the way of any serious love-interest (not the plug FedEx was looking for I'm sure). Unfortunately, there is not a lot of time to evolve any of the other characters and for this reason, this film is not robust enough to be an Oscar winner for Best Picture.<br/><br/>What is effective is the feeling of isolation on the island. Zemeckis is artful in his use of sweeping, panoramic movements with the camera. Few movies have come close in also stranding the audience.<br/><br/>Finally, the scenes back in civilisation pale in comparison to the ordeal on the island. I wish Zemeckis had shortenened the ending dramatically for a more powerful transition in plot. The final ten minutes were disappointing as Zemeckis attempts an epilogue rather amateurishly.<br/><br/>The crash of the airplane is breathtaking. Hanks deserves another Oscar on his mantle. The movie is extremely entertaining despite shortcomings with development of ""non-essential staff"". The morale of this story should be: ""Make every departure a meaningful one. You never know what will happen on your next business trip overseas. That swiss army knife is not just decorative either.""<br/><br/>7.5/10"

It's a two hour plus film, but for 90 minutes it's only him on screen, carrying the film unlike any actor I've ever seen do.  Sure there are movies when the lead actor is in every scene, but Hanks takes it a step further and goes it alone most of the time.  And the director used very little music in the scenes, so it's all on Tom's shoulders to make you feel all the pain that the character is going through.<br/><br/>It's a great film and Hanks proves he's still at the top of his game."

","""Cast Away"" goes down as one of those films that's excellent all the way until the end. There are several films that make that cut. I can't think of any off the top of my head but you'll figure it out. Hanks is Chuck Noland, a workaholic FedEx employee who's married to his job, and about to be engaged to Kelly (Helen Hunt). His job has him travel all around the world ensuring better FedEx services by serving as a hustling efficiency expert who shapes the offices. In one ill fated night, however, after proposing to Kelly, Chuck's plane over the Pacific goes down in a fiery storm and he's washed away to a deserted island. For the next two hours, Hanks finds himself surviving off his natural instincts and his smarts as he begins to salvage what he can in his life. The story is remarkably smooth that fleshes out Hanks' character as a decent man who's good at heart. It's a chronicle of his life as he lives day by day on the island and it's actually fascinating to watch how he lives. Whether it be discovering how to start a fire to gathering food, we watch Noland do it all. However, and there won't be many people that will disagree, the ending really sucks. It's on a so/so basis where you have absolutely no idea what happens to his character. I think part of the reason why the ending isn't good is because audiences want to see Hanks' character live the rest of his life and his re-adjustment to society, something you don't get to see much of. All in all though, Cast Away is a great film to watch."

Basically the film is divided to 3 parts,before the crash,the island and after the island.

The middle part is the best one in the film and the longest,the 2 other parts are simply not in the emotional scale of that part.<br/><br/>I am not a huge fun of Tom Hanks.

","This film just about takes the biscuit for product placement. From the first second to the end take we're under pressure to believe Fedex is the best thing ever to hit Planet Earth. We learn all about the Fedex methods, how packages are rushed from A to B and Tom lends his full weight to getting the Fedex message over, even to those disorganised Russians. The Fedex theme is skilfully woven through the whole film, with presumably Wilson contributing with basketballs ad infinitum. The Fedex packages keeping poor Tom alive. For those who ship by Fedex, UPS and others like DHL, I was particularly amused by Helen Hunt's cautionary references to ""undeclared hazardous goods"" being the probably cause of the plane crash. Heaven forbid, pilot error or some other employee disaster. And of course, Tom at the end shows how Fedex delivers regardless, as he appears on Fedex TV, with Fedex planes reaching as far as the horizon. As usual Helen Hunt is a miserable mess. How she managed to get into movies, well, enough said. <br/><br/>On the other hand, ignoring the Fedex overdose, Tom pulls the whole thing together and makes the movie. I was truly moved when he apologised to his escaping basketball. <br/><br/>Zemeckis must be one of the most talented directors who ever lived and Hanks is going to be a true legend.

People were leaving during the film - and NOT COMING BACK.  This is no slam against Tom Hanks, for he is truly gifted.  But the script clearly had problems.  Several scenes could have brought gasps from the audience, brought suspense, drama to the film, instead, the man beside me started snoring.  Too many set-ups without going anywhere.  This was the very first time that I was disappointed with a Tom Hanks film.  In the cave...a skeleton would have worked.  Maybe during the crash, Hanks could have been saved by the captain, then when Hanks was safe in the raft, the captain could have been washed overboard and drown in the high seas. Of course, this is just my opinion, but I was just so disappointed in this film. I thought the ending could have been more dramatic and Hunt could have brought up the ring that Hanks had given her before he left.  She could have gone back to Hanks, or maybe her husband could have loved Hunt so much that he actually sacrificed his own happiness so Hunt would be happy with the love of her life.  Oh well, Sorry.

How interesting can four years on an island be?<br/><br/>However, I was pleasently surprised, but not overly.  Tom Hanks manages to keep your attention, his subtle but significant characted journey is absorbing.  The various tasks he must carry out to stay alive are interesting - perhaps only academically and not dramtically.  A sense of humour prods the story along.<br/><br/>The direction, for me, is what saves the movie however.  Instead of the bright colours of a dream like island, we see shades, pastels.  Infact the island is rather grim.  Time is used wonderfully, from the fast paced world to the timelessness and lonelyness are expertly portrayed.  Silence, black screens, both forgotten devices are used to great effect here.  Even the 'four years later' although perhaps cliche, perhaps a little lazy, gives the feeling of nothingness that helps us to feel his isolation.<br/><br/>Although a little too long, perhaps not a master piece, this film has a great deal to offer in its details.

The ""Robinson Crusoe""-like scenes which followed were interesting to a point although I thought Chuck (Tom Hanks) was rather slow in discovering a method of catching water from the torrential rains.  While it was necessary for the scriptwriter to introduce dialogue, I found some of the conversations between Chuck and the face on the ball rather silly and even a bit embarrassing, but I came to accept them in the knowledge that Chuck was on the point of madness anyway after years of isolation.  A great piece of cinema followed when the ocean liner sped past an almost dying man face down on his broken raft.  I was so anxious... Would the officers on the bridge see him or not?  The final homecoming was so touching, so moving and with such unexpected consequences.  Yes.. this is the story of a man who through 4 years of loneliness holds a dream close to his heart.

Tom Hanks gives a decent performance as a luckless FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island but his performance lacks any strong distinguishing characteristics that have become synonymous with Hanks roles (i.e. Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan). The most entertaining character in the film is a volleyball named Wilson who Hanks talks to and eventually befriends.

","I finally saw Castaway, and thought it was an absorbing drama of human resourcefulness.   I resisted seeing it for fear that the time spent by the Tom Hanks character in isolation marooned on an island would be boring. It wasn't.  The cinematography is great ... beautiful sunsets and skylines, crashing waves and natural beauty.  The endurance skills he develops are admirable, as are the ways he tackles small crises and shares his thoughts with us.  His survival episodes engage us, including building a fire, searching for water and food, communicating for help, fighting the elements, looking for life on the island, attending to his wounds, simulating a human companion, and maintaining his sanity.  His appearance after an extended period, with a full beard and loincloth, make him look like a genuine prehistoric man.  The film's strength is how Tom Hanks makes it all believable.  It would be hard for a lesser actor to pull it off.<br/><br/>Adding to the movie's appeal is the simplicity of the story.  It's man versus nature for survival; what could be simpler?  An auxiliary but equally straightforward plot is his courtship with Helen Hunt.  There are no complex motives to decipher, nor cruelty or violence.  We can all safely root for Hanks as he battles his loneliness, his environment, and his separation from his fiancÃ©e.  It can roughly be compared to Jaws, with the non-human `enemy' changed from a whale to the forces of nature.<br/><br/>The air crash that leads to his ordeal is magnificently dramatized, but is not for the faint of heart.  Those with a fear of flying may not want to see it, although the plane itself is not a commercial airliner.  Even his romance with Helen Hunt, dismissed as contrived by some, rang true for me. That may be because attractions between people around 40 are rarely shown in films, and are seldom resolved as depicted here. The publicity for FedEx in the film is extensive and positive, and probably merited.  I certainly recommend this movie."

","Cast Away - Life inexorably flows by: whether it's slowing down while we're at work, or speeding up when we're at play, days blend into weeks and into years.  Not surprisingly, few people - especially those who would benefit from it most - ever take the time to engage in serious introspection.  If, however, the opportunity did present itself, what do you think you might learn?  Or would you even dare to try?<br/><br/>Chuck Noland is obsessed by time: it's his job is to ensure that those packages that ""absolutely positively have to get there overnight"" do, and he's willing to do what is necessary to get it done, even ""borrowing"" a child's bike if necessary.  He loves his girlfriend, but their relationship is subject to the whims of his daytimer. Ripped away from yet another Christmas dinner for a quick job he gives his girlfriend a hurried kiss, tells her that he has something important to discuss with her and promises her he'll be right back.  Of course, time is relative.<br/><br/>By now, everyone probably knows that this film is ""different"" in several ways.  First, the concept and movie came before the witless ""Survivor"" phenom, and many people were concerned that the show might taint the movie. Second, many people were hoping for a repeat after Zemeckis and Hanks struck box office gold with ""Forrest Gump"".  Third, after filming the beginning of the movie, the production went on hiatus for a year while Tom Hanks shed almost fifty pounds going from portly to waif (Zemeckis filled his time by filming ""What Lies Beneath"").  Fourth, although there are peripheral characters, the bulk of the film focuses on Chuck's time alone on the island and consequently, dialogue is sparse.  There is also an absence of special effects (with the notable of exception of the superbly staged plane crash), and the soundtrack stops soon after Chuck crawls ashore.  Finally, the initial ending was scrapped after it garnered lukewarm responses from test audiences.<br/><br/>I never dreamed that the cross dressing star of a cheesy sitcom would one day be one of Hollywood's biggest draws.  I'm sure he didn't either.  It is difficult for an actor to give a good performance at the best of times, but when you are playing off a volleyball, water and occasionally adverse weather conditions, the situation is far more challenging.  Hanks proves that he is up to the task.<br/><br/>Even starker than Hank's amazing physical metamorphosis, is his spiritual and mental transformation. As his carefully ordered life disintegrates (whose wouldn't after being jetwrecked?) Chuck begins to understand that what is truly important in life, water, food and shelter not withstanding, is living, not just surviving. As he struggles with desperation, triumph, and insanity, he accepts that he cannot dictate what happens, only his response. Could this have been the subtle reason for titling the film ""Cast Away"" (vb.- to dispose of something) rather than ""Castaway"" (adj.- a shipwrecked individual)?   As I don't think I will be talking with speak with Mr. Zemeckis in the near future, it will remain unanswered.<br/><br/>The location shots are both beautiful and treacherous - paradise with a hitch - and reminded me of some of the islands I visited while in Fiji (thankfully they had places to stay and food I didn't have to hunt down). The cinematography is tight, and Zemeckis deserves congratulations for his simple, understated, yet simultaneously daring direction (if only he'd shown such restraint in ""What Lies Beneath"").  My only complaints would have to be that the beginning and ending feel too artificial when viewed in the context of the rest of the film, but not overwhelmingly so.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful films of the holiday season."
"dbarndollar","10","0","0","20 December 2000"," Thoughtful, brilliant, and original film--a must-see
","I saw the Austin premiere of Cast Away yesterday, and have been haunted by it since.  It is a profoundly moving film about one ordinary man's struggle for survival, not just of the body but of the heart and mind, at the hands of an indifferent Fate.  It is alternately funny, unnerving, gruesome, beautiful, and poignant, and at all times believable.  I cannot recall another picture from a major studio this spare in terms of script and style--it is a daring and refreshing movie.  Tom Hanks as Chuck makes the story compelling, carrying more than an hour of the picture by himself with little dialogue and no soundtrack besides wind, waves, and rain.  The film can be enjoyed purely for the entertainment value of watching Chuck become lost and find his back to civilisation (no spoilers here, folks), or it can be explored for many layers of meaning:  about relationships, about destiny, about ingenuity, about inspiration, and about our basic humanity.  The movie is not heavy-handed with its message; you take from it what you put into it, and the audience is expected to work at it a bit.  Even the title is multi-faceted . . . but don't be daunted.  See this movie; see it many times, as I plan to do."

"Cleo - Brazil","Null","0","0","5 February 2001"," A better end for a perfect movie!
","I went to the movies yesterday evening to build my own point of view about this movie. I had already heard 3 or 4 different opinions about it, disliking ones and `the-best-movie-I've-ever-seen' ones as well. Facing all that, I went there and checked it up with my own eyes.<br/><br/>Zemeckis and Hanks proved once more the amazing acting they can construct together! Tom was perfect, as usual, but with an important plus: he was acting (perfectly) without interacting! I believe he had to double his talent (if we consider a talent like that can be doubled, what I personally doubt about) to act without interacting, at least with another human being! I watched the movie understanding that the main message it wanted to pass was about a man's behavior on the total loneliness, fighting for keeping himself alive even though he had no reason to breath. It showed me how strong a human being can be and for how long we are probably able to stand being lonely without going crazy. The need Chuck reveals creating Mr. Wilson proves that a normal human being has to have someone by his side, especially in the difficult times and when it is about making an important decision. I kept asking myself: what would kill me first: thirsty, hunger or loneliness? For thirsty, Chuck had coconuts and rain; for hunger, Chuck had fish; and for loneliness Chuck had nothing except himself with a bloody face, a teddy bear a children sleeps with replaced by a `friendly bloody face volleyball' that helped him out as long as he had to keep himself alive on the island. Why do children like so much their teddy bears? Because they can feel protected and with company when their are lonely in bad at night. Wilson was one of the factors to keep Chuck alive, such as water and fish! Spoiler alert The movie would have been perfect for me if it could have ended up differently. I went back home imagining what end I would like this movies to have for it to be perfect, but I could not figure what kind of end it would be. Did anybody think about anything? I just know that it was not the one I've seen at the movies, with Tom Hanks in the middle of the road looking at the truck of a strange woman that happened to be the owner of the package he chose to be the one he had to keep intact while he was lost! That end made me so sad! I really wanted to see a better end for such an amazing movie. But afterwards, the movie's end did not jeopardize the majesty of the entire story and the magnitude of Hanks acting. I could feel my emotions coming out by watching Chuck's strength. Until yesterday I was sure about my wish for Geoffrey Rush winning the Oscar (Quills), but I have to admit now I believe Tom Hanks deserves the Oscar more than ever.<br/><br/>Today I have my own opinion about Cast away: a very good movie with a perfect performance by Tom Hanks, but with an end I still have to create in my own mind to make it one of the bests I have ever seen in my whole life."

","The narrative is just fine and Tom Hanks is wonderful as usual.  The film fails in structure.  All too often frame stories fail somewhere along the line.  Either the frame is stronger than the middle, or, as in this case, the middle is stronger than the frame story.  The beginning and end could have been reshaped or deleted and the story would have been all the better for it.  The frame feels tacked on almost.  As I watched it, I felt as if i were watching a great film just screaming to be let out of this miserable structure.  And I am of the opinion that if you are going to cast Helen Hunt, you don't waste her time and ours by only using her for a 30 minute role.  She is too wonderful an actress for such a minor and thankless role."

It's humourous in certain places where the film touches on the black comedy genre (washed up corpse scene).

The real crux of this thought-provoking masterpiece is a truth about how the mystery of life's fortunes can affect an individual in the way events-and our attitude to them-unravel in determining our future.<br/><br/>I missed the first few minutes of the start of the film and when I entered the theatre I thought I was watching a commercial for Federal Express; though the use of a respected brand name product in the film is not only wholly justified but is central to the meaning and equalibrium of the movie.

"OceanicEys","Null","0","0","1 February 2001"," A bright, shiny package with nothing inside.
","There is nothing below the shiny surface of this movie -- what did Hanks' character really ""cast away?""  He finds no perspective on his life or situation other than a similarity to tidal vicissitudes. He discovers no spirituality of any kind - not even when he buries the man who saved his life. He relates to a ball better than he ever did to his girlfriend or to her memory... & what does that teach him?  Nothing that we can see. The strengths he is forced to find in his solitude are a mystery to us (besides making fire) & it's therefore a mystery as to how well or how badly these all-important, basic strengths translate to his ""real"" life, or to his ""new"" self. So again I ask what was ""cast away"" - & what was found? His bland relationship with Hunt's character? That's it?  Seems he should've discovered, & cast away, a lot more on that island - & therefore returned home a richer man. Are we ever asked what is really hidden in every man's heart, underlying ""civilization?"" Or what use or meaning there is in a single solitary life? Oddly, no. I found the film sadly, strangely void. A deserted island is so fertile as a dramatic device, & yet it simply framed a film that itself felt deserted."

We are forever stuck with the hilarious memories of Gilligan and the gang from childhood (if not even today with the eternal reruns).  If you were lucky, you may even remember the time the gang got off the island and returned to civilization.  The rescue was hilarious, Gilligan tried to make a barbeque on the raft.  The fire and smoke attracted a boat and Wham, they're saved.  After returning home, none could properly adjust back to their normal lives, personal, social, and career.  Perhaps that 's my bias with Cast Away, this movie is totally stuck on Tom Hanks the ""survivor"" than Chuck the person.<br/><br/>I know Hanks did a supurb job acting.  Robert Z did a great job directing, the supporting cast did a supurb job supporting, blah , blah, blah.  But what credibility and imagination did this movie feature?  What insight and introspective to the human psyche?  I'd like to make one up, but find myself scratching my head thinking, well at least he survived and he'll ""keep breathing"" (or whatever he said).  Gee, what a shocker, why don't Helen Hunt marry an alcoholic and then we'll see what ""keep breathing"" really means. I mean, she lives in a nice flat with a chance to get a doctorate...that's not ""keep breathing"", it's ""I'm happily married to YOUR dentist!!""<br/><br/>Dealing with adversity is one thing, acting as if it's just an obstacle is another.  If I found out MY girlfriend married another person, I'd go nuts, even if everyone in the entire world thought I was gone.  I'd cry and destroy my 4X4.  But Hanks gave a subverted performance that just displayed a ""wow, you kept my car in great shape....can I have it back...""  Totally cool, totally cold.<br/><br/>I rated this movie a 5.  With ANY actor besides Hanks, it would've gotten a 5.  Leo, Cuba Gooding Jr., Woody Harrleson, etc. , but with Hanks, we all gave it a 7, right??  Admit it, you went to see it for Hanks.

","I'll start by admitting that Tom Hanks does nothing for me as an actor.  In fact, I think his only two decent films to date are Big and Philidelphia - and that's at a stretch.  I went into the film with a healthy dose of skepticism, but was fully prepared to be surprised.  Oh well, one outta two ain't bad!<br/><br/>This is the sort of film where, if someone asked me what it was like, I respond with ""the cinematography was very good"".  Hanks joins Robert Zemeckis for the first time since Forrest Gump (don't even get me started on that waste of film).  <br/><br/>The story itself is one of survival (d'uh!).  Chuck is a jet-setting Fed-Ex efficiency expert who jumps on a plane, and the plane decides to jump into the ocean.  Chuck survives and has to eke out a living on a deserted island. That's all there is to it really.  Oh, he's kept company by a picture of his girlfriend, Kelly and a volleyball named Wilson.<br/><br/>There were some fleeting glimpses of brilliance in the film - how Chuck overcomes adversity living on an island, cooking, fires, home dentistry etc, but nothing too extraordinary.  In fact, boring in parts.  I think the film could have benefited from cuts to what's happening back home while he's on the island - mind you it would have meant involvement from the other actors - which would have spoiled the ""Tom Hanks alone in Cast Away"" effect of the film.  Oh OK, credit where credit is due, Hanks did trim down fantastically for the film, and he looks, well, not that bad!  I think taut would be the word.  But that's enough gushing!  Fed-Ex too, must be rubbing its hands in glee with the free advertising this film has provided for them.<br/><br/>It's a film that I wouldn't recommend highly to people, but at the same time, it's OK and worth a trip to see it on the big screen (because I think it'll lose a bit on the TV).  <br/><br/>Now would someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks keeps winning these damn Oscars, because I'm stumped."

You're not expecting therefore a lot of action such as Crouching Tiger or deep, meaningful conversations on deep and meaningful things. As far as the acting goes, Tom Hanks is very good, portraying the 'time is money' Fed Ex man who finds his whole life literally crashing down.  The island was clever and very beautiful.<br/><br/>The story was a bit long though.  There were points when you thought 'ah yes another 5 minutes and we'll be out' and then an added 15 is shown, with the ending being slightly to cliché.<br/><br/>As for the others, Helen Hunt is good as the wife who lost her husband and especially for Wilson, the volleyball!

","Castaway is a good movie. I just came back from the cinema with my friend and we both liked Castaway. Both of us like Tom Hanks, so this was not surprising.<br/><br/>The story : The FedEx-worker Chuck Noland ( Tom hanks ) is very lucky with his girlfriend and with his job. But after a plane crash he is the only survivor and comes to an island anywhere in the Southern Pazifik. But he finds none on that island. He tries to manage himself with the few things he has : a volleyball ( named Wilson, that is almost as lovable as the mouse of The Green Mile ) , a pair of skates, a few videotapes, a rubber boat and some clothes to wear. There is no plane finding him on that island, because they thought that they are 100 miles north of him. He stays on that island for four years, and then he constructs a raft out of wood. He takes his volleyball and a door of the plane to get off there. On the sea he loses his friend Wilson, but then he is rescued by a ship. Arrived in Memphis, again, he gets to know that his ex-girlfriend has a husband, since she thought that Chuck was dead. Delivering a package that he has not open yet, he finds himself at a crossroads, where he has to make a choice between going west, north, south or east and to start a new life there.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is as good as always , maybe this will be his third oscar ( none can understand why Saving Private Ryan was not ). But my personal fav is Russell Crowe for Gladiator. <br/><br/>The ending of Castaway is a bit too long , I think, but the scene with the crossroads is good and meaningful. Maybe it is a cliché , but who cares? I don´t !<br/><br/>There three two bad things in this movie : the sudden impact before the plane crash, the lines ""Four years later"" and ""Four weeks later"". They do not belong there were they belong. I think it was a bad idea to film at first the first 10 days on the island, and then the last week. I should have been more lengthy. But there are also some good moments : the loss of Wilson, the ending, and the crossing ship. This is definitely not Tom Hanks´ best movie. All his ´big films´ are better ( Saving Private Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia ). But it is a good one.<br/><br/>All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of Tom Hanks or to guys who liked ""Six Days Seven Nights"" ( although that has been more a comedy ).<br/><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them."

I suppose the consensus is split (though I seem to find more positive comments). Some say the film is ""predictable"" and ""nothing happens"". Uhh, what would you prefer? For pirates to take over the island? Tom Hanks (who is extraordinary, by the way) is fighting to survive, and that seems fitting enough for me. Nothing is more moving, terrifying or thought-provoking. You must put some thought into this film to get something out, and it appears some were reluctant to do so. Entertainment value is not what ""Cast Away"" is about. I think it's one of the finest human dramas ever made, and I'll never forget it. The Hanks-Wilson relationship is touching beyond all odds, and despite a minor stumble during the conclusion, the movie retains its power. And I like the ending."

","""Cast Away"" reteams the star and director of ""Forrest Gump"" (Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis), and the final result: a terrific adventure film that's just a few notches down from ""Gump"". Hanks plays a FedEx employee who hitches a ride on a FedEx plane that's flying over the Pacific Ocean until disaster strikes. Flying through a severe storm, the plane suffers major damage and crashes in the ocean. The Hanks character survives the crash, and washes up on a deserted island. It is here where he does everything he can to stay alive, and it's not an easy task. ""Cast Away"" was shot in two parts. When they finished filming the first part, they stopped making the movie for a while so Hanks could lose 40-50 pounds to make it look like his character had been stranded on the island for years. This will guarantee Hanks his fifth career Oscar nomination for sure. He's brilliant in ""Cast Away"". It took alot of guts to lose all that weight. The other familiar face in the cast is Helen Hunt, who has a nice small supporting role as Hanks' girlfriend. In between the two parts of making ""Cast Away"", director Zemeckis went off and made this summer's hit film ""What Lies Beneath"". ""Cast Away"" is much better than that film. It brings Zemeckis back to full form (in addition to ""Forrest Gump"", some of Zemeckis' other great films include a trio from the '80s: ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Back to the Future"", and my personal favorite, ""Romancing the Stone""). ""Cast Away"" has just a few boring spots, but it moves at a brisk pace. It's an exciting adventure. Plus there are a few funny spots (the scenes where Hanks talks to the volleyball made me laugh a couple of times). A very good movie.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"

","MEGASPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING HERE!<br/><br/>I hate good movies with bad endings... and this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Didn't the writer think we would feel really bad if Tom Hanks didn't reunite with his wife? I realise that it's hard to think of an ending with a movie like this, but this movie had the worst movie ending I've seen in a long time. All you see in the last scenes is Tom Hanks' skinny face and then... it stops. Finished. We have no idea of what will happen to this character we've gotten to know. Will he ever be happy again? We'll have to imagine that for ourselves. What a disappointment!<br/><br/>That said, I must say that the movie was worth seeing in a theater. The scenes on the island are very well made and never boring. Actually, the whole movie is never boring. Tom's separation of Wilson had me teary-eyed. The scenes on the island are so extremely well done, in fact, that they single-handedly make this movie better than anything I've seen last year. They are scary, funny, exciting, and heart-breaking. Of course, the plane crash scene must also be mentioned, which can only be described as masterful action filmmaking. This is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen. If the whole movie would've been as good as the first, er... 100 minutes, I would've given it a 10. It's such a shame that it had such a lousy ending. That brings it as much as 3 points down.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","What a disappointment....and waste.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks aka Modern Man, stuck on an island, with no food, water or communications. Its obvious that he will somehow fend for himself and salvage all the bare necessities required. This film shows just that - and ONLY that. It did not portray the more humane (and psychological)side of the situation, that is: How and what does a man FEEL when alone on an island? Hanks displayed little, if not, no signs of fear, despair or disillusion during the initial stages of his strand. He did not break down and was not torn by internal conflicts of loss, hope and reality. Sadly, the producers had to use a volleyball (Wilson) to elicit such emotions from him. The next thing you know, its 4 years later and Hanks has become an expert spear fisherman.<br/><br/>And after being exiled from society for 4 years, we're supposed to believe he could adapt again in 4 weeks?!?! C'mon! Although the film did try to hint at his ineptness and awkwardness ( more reserved, sleeps on the floor, sense of loss over unfinished food ), it never really does hit the correct emotional note. No oomph. <br/><br/>His re-unification with Helen Hunt was a tad too dry. Little emotions were shown from them, as if both sides were suppressing bottled-up feelings; though Hunt seems more likely to be the culprit. <br/><br/>Overall, a film with some beautiful visuals and a great plane crash scene. There were many chances for the film makers to capitalise on for more powerful scenes, but I guess they just didn't know how. ""Survival Skills:101"" seems like a more apt title.<br/><br/>Perhaps Wilson's final scene was its only saving grace...."

","First of all, seeing 10458.5 commercials for this movie completely gave away the ending...HE GETS OFF THE ISLAND.  Where is the suspense?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  There was NONE.  Maybe that's why I didn't like it very much.  Tom Hanks was very good though, I must admit.  It was a very demanding role, and he performed it very well, and I would not be surprised if Mr. Hanks walked away with another Oscar this year.  His wonderful performance almost made up for a less-than-exciting movie."

","I was sorely disappointed by this hyped-up and overrated film that promised to be something enjoyable.  So much was left out in an attempt to squeeze a promising storyline into a few hours.  I can't fathom a man being lost for 4 years and so easily integrating himself into society.  ""Hey, guys, I'm back"".  I was disappointed by the ending.  Although it left the audience with something to think about, I thought it was cheesy and underdramatized. I'm afraid to say that Tom Hanks is losing his touch."

","This is a very well made, intense experience, and for a lot of it's running time, basically a one actor film (though the volleyball Wilson provides staunch support!). Tom Hanks' performamce is stunning, entirely believable. The movie begins slowly, but then comes the crash which leaves Hanks stranded, and, even though I was expecting it, when it came it was terrifying; it was also brilliantly filmed, as was the movie all the way through. There were some gripping and drenching sequences, especailly the scene where Hanks jerks out a bad tooth with the blade of an ice skate. Some other highlights besides Hanks performance included Wilson, who injected just that little more into the movie. The downside was probably the ending, drifting into some romantic scenes between Hanks and Helen Hunt, and a very unfinished final scene! That said, the romantic scenes I just mentioned were very moving; once you've been drenched from your strength by three quarters of the film, then you're drenched from your emotions by the last quarter! The feeling of loneliness on the island where Hanks is stranded is acute. At 2 and a half hours long, this is a very draining movie to watch, but very worth while! Go and see it whenever you can!"
"Soujiro","Null","0","0","26 January 2001"," Predictable With No Real Insight
","Now, the predictable part didn't bother me much, because I was expecting the movie to delve into the psyche of the main character and reveal something profound about humanity. Instead the film is extrmeley shallow. Here is the question the movie poses: What would it be like to be stranded on an island? Now, the average person has certain preconceptions when thinking about this question. The job of the movie is to provide depth and material which forces the viewer to reconsider these preconceptions. No such material exists in the film. It has the intellectual blandness that is typical of popcorn movies, but with most of the action removed. As a result, the movie failed to hold my interest. Besides this basic failing, there are also some minor nitpicks.<br/><br/>The film took the more marketable and typical gender designations with the male being lost on an adventure, and the woman at home. This formula has been around since The Odyssey and I would have liked to see Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks reverse their roles. But, seeing a woman on screen without make-up and perfect hair? A woman who can survive alone? We can't have that now.... In addition, no one spears fish standing twenty feet away from the target. It just isn't done. Tom Hanks also was remarkably chubby and healthy looking during the first few days on the island.<br/><br/>After returning from the island, the movie cheats us by magically producing a Tom Hanks who has managed to reintegrate himself into society in a mere four days. Sure, he's a little reserved, but after four years alone his behaviorisms would take a wee bit longer to disappear. The scenes with Helen Hunt manage to be painfully melodramatic which is quite an achievement considering that the situation would seem to allow for melodrama. Finally, I predicted the appearance of the beautiful woman in the final scene about a minute before she showed up which was depressing. It suggests that all a lost man needs to provide him with some direction in his life is some other pretty girl in too much make-up. So, all in all some nice scenery but not enough to make up for the films inability to inspire thought in the viewer."

","I went to see Cast Away after an awful day and work and it kept me focused on the movie plot for the entire time. The whole crash scene was lengthy but seemed authentic and I was already rooting for Hanks to get away from the plane engine and into the raft safely.<br/><br/>Making fire is at least as hard as it looked on film and I teach firebuilding to Girl Scout leaders! <br/><br/>The ending was also good--not just the woman left at home waiting and doing nothing until his return.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks's acting was great and this is what ""Survivor"" should really be like."

","Great movie.  Even though it will become a commercial success, Cast Away, has this understated edginess to it.  It's by far the most captivating performance by Hanks since his Oscar winning turn in Philadelphia.  He is by far, one of the best actors alive.  <br/><br/>This movie has everything:  Slapstick comedy, drama, action, oh, and did I forget to mention Tom Hanks?  He does a terrific job of making the audience feel what he feels.  I felt like I was on that island with him.  And then when 4 years had passed and I saw his frail body on the screen, my heart ached.  Never in my entire movie going experience had I empathized with a character so much.  You know you're watching a terrific artist when they say and do very little and still seem to ignite the screen.  His subtlety was brillant and so was the film."

","Then as I was driving home and thinking about the movie a little more, I realized that this movie, unlike any other movie I had ever seen) kept me glued to my seat without having a disaster around every corner.  The two movies to which I got dragged this past year ended up being the two best movies I saw.  Gladiator was great, with Maximus's fall from glory and rise to victory once more... and then I went to see Castaway.<br/><br/>Castaway managed to keep my intention without the tenseness of a movie such as Jaws.  It was so refreshing to sit back and enjoy a great movie without disaster after disaster.  Chuck walks through the water on the rocks with blood gushing from his leg...  no shark attack.  He stands on the edge of the rock cliff...  no slip of the toe to send him over.  He sails out to sea once more on his makeshift raft...  he's still laying on that raft when he gets rescued.<br/><br/>Yes, a movie can be refreshing, exciting and riveting without all those movie disasters we've all come to expect.  Two thumbs up to Hanks and Zemeckis for a wonderfully made film.  I would pay $10 to see it again."

"tonygaffiero","8","0","0","23 January 2001"," Gripping, moving, eye-opening
","This film made me understand how art was ""invented"", how man discovered the usefullness of tools, why man gives such immense  mythical sense to the symbols he invents. Cast away on a desert island, alone in the most absolute meaning of the word (no other animate creature (accept fish) ever comes across Hanks' path during his stay on the island), jet-flying, hard-working Hanks is reduced to the state of primitive man. There is nothing around him which can help him survive. His landing on the island is his DAY ZERO. However, fate first comes to his rescue when he is unsuccessfully trying to break the hard shell of a coconut with a piece of what appears to be volcanic rock. The rock splinters, but what remains in his hand is a piece of rock which has a sharp edge...a knife!! From then on he can split open his coconuts with ease. (It seems that coconut and fishes are the only things Hanks eats on the island.)<br/><br/>Hanks seems to be extremely scrupuolous in his profession. He only opens the packages which drift into the island with him after a few days, not at once. In one of them he finds a volleyball, for which he cannot figure out any use.<br/><br/>Sometime later, Hanks angrily hits this volleyball with his hand full of blood after he cuts himself while trying to get some fire burning. The red hand-shaped stain on the ball appears to Hanks as if it were a face...and so it becomes his friend and companion on the island...Wilson! The attachment Hanks develops to this symbol will be very evident later on in the film.<br/><br/>I believe that there are just good films, and bad films, nothing else. This is a good film.<br/><br/>Hanks has reached another dimension in his acting, and really I doubt whether there is any other actor around nowadays who can so easily adapt himself to such varied roles as being a simpleton in Forrest Gump, an astronaut in Apollo 13, and a modern-day Robinson Crusoe in this film. Marvellous!<br/><br/>Well, what can I say? I think this comment is long enough as it is! GO SEE THE MOVIE!"

","I was fairly skeptical that a movie containing a lengthy portion about a guy by himself on an island could hold a viewer's interest. But, wow, it really worked. I was fascinated by all the things that Tom Hanks' character was doing. Also I found myself tempted to talk to the screen to give the guy ideas! A couple of people who I talked to after the movie said that only Tom Hanks could have pulled off that role. Yeah, I think so too. Tom Hanks did a great job. I think that Tom Hanks might receive a nomination for Best Actor (wow, once again) for his role in this film."
"Leviathan_","Null","0","0","23 January 2001"," Great film. Pity about the ending though ...
","... I can't help but feel impressed that a film that spends most of its time just watching a man do things on an island can be so enjoyable.  Without a doubt this can be attributed to Tom Hanks himself, who has the power to draw attention to himself and appear interesting even without the aid of dialogue, and director Robert Zemeckis, who's excellent direction really pays off.<br/><br/>Alas this is not the perfect film.  Zemeckis should have trusted Hanks' abilities and have made his time on the island the primary focus of the movie, rather than simply make it the 2nd act of a 3 act play.<br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>The beginning is pretty much standard but I guess we have to start somewhere.  The plane crash is quite a well-done piece of film making and of course the time on the island is superb.  Unfortunately just as Hanks seems to be getting the grasp of surving on the island we fast-forward 4 years to see him preparing an escape.  Ok, I can accept that.  but then after being rescued instead of the film ending like we would all expect it to we're treated to yet another 30 mins or so of 'finishing up' stuff from the beginning.<br/><br/>Really what irks me the most is not really that they continued on after he was rescued, but rather that they did it in such a boring and obvious way. We hardly get a glimpse of seeing Hanks re-adapting to life in civilisation again (he was marooned for 4 years afterall) and of course the whole relationship thing with Helen Hunt is given as much time as the film makers can wring out of it.<br/><br/>However, even the bad bits don't come close to putting a dampener on the overall majesty of the film.  I'd strongly recommend it, but if you're not to fussed about seeing a film right through then it might pay to walk out just as Hanks gets rescued.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars"

","Hanks' solo role on the island is a great piece of acting and film-making, despite some annoying minor technical glitches - sound out of sync, poor colour timing etc.  The plane crash scene that leads to his arrival on the island is surprisingly gripping as well. However, the script of this film seems quite weak in places and the post-rescue scenes are bordering on unbelievable;  The 'happy' ending appears as it was tacked on, almost as an afterthought.

"andrewvb","Null","0","0","21 January 2001"," Not perfect, but wonderful
","I saw 'Cast Away' last night and must say that I was very impressed.  The fact that I am a fan of Tom Hanks probably helped me enjoy the film, because I doubt anyone who does not like Tom Hanks would enjoy 'Cast Away' being the fact that he is almost the entire film.<br/><br/>'Cast Away' is far from a perfect film, as there are some minor, and a few major, holes in the story and sadly the script is not always up to scratch. To be honest, I was a little surprised that the film has so many flaws, given the fact that the Australian media have been so full of praise.  In my opinion however, Tom Hanks carries the film beyond these flaws and script letdowns, and while Helen Hunt is not given much to do, she is wonderful in the small screen time she has.<br/><br/>The first 25-30 minutes of the film is essentially fairly dull, however it has a certain edge to it created by the viewer already knowing what is install for Hank's character.  The plane crash is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on film.  I was actually not looking forward to the plane crash footage because I figured it would be nothing more than something the audience would have to endure before the real story begun. However, it was so good that I actually felt myself tensing up, which really say's something about the footage because I rarely respond like that to anything on screen.<br/><br/>The cast away' part of the story is equally brilliant, because it could so easily have been unbearably boring.  I think many reviewers on this website are correct in their disliking of the way in which it cuts to four years later', as it does feel as if Zemeckis took the easy way out in this respect.  My only other complaint about the cast away' part of the story is Hank's escape off the island, which did seem a little rushed in execution and generally not as dramatic (with the exception of one moment, but I won't completely spoil it) as the events that had taken place before.  However, this part of the film is by in large incredible, and a work of pure genius from both Zemeckis, but particularly Hanks.<br/><br/>Finally, many reviewers here have complained about the last part of the film, many suggesting that it went on too long.  However, I did not find myself bored or restless during the last part of the film because I was generally interested in finding out what happens to Hank's character as he tries to re-enter society.  My complaint about the last part has more to do with the script lulls, because the film does not answer some of the bigger questions regarding this transition.  However, like all of the weaker spots in the film, Hanks carries the audience past them and it is his presence that makes this one of the best films since American Beauty (released around the same time last year)<br/><br/>I truly hope that Hanks gets his third Oscar for his role in this film, because quite simply, I have not seen a better performance in any film over the last 12 months."

","I saw it hours before I wrote this lines and I'm still feeling exhausted as I cried for about 2/3 of the picture. It's a cleansing, sabbathic and religious experience watching this movie. Not because it mentions the word God or other divine entity (note the funeral) but it has faith and the character believes in itself even when he thinks he no longer exists as a human. Beginning with a crossroad somewhere in the middle of an American desert (instantly reminder of ""North by Northwest"") the movie starts within a minute in a frantic pace of a FedEx box traveling (physically and with the camera) from America to Russia in another well-remembered voyeur-voyage by Zemeckis. Frantic or not, we soon discover the meaning of TIME and SPACE in this multiple-paced well-placed cameras showing the exact spots of what Time and Space are supposed to stand in the castaway's life. Zemeckis' twisting and turning views in this movie are sometimes experiencing what the character does, other times before and after him and we enjoy more viewing this movie as a voyeur (didn't Hitchcock teach us a lesson about the art of cinema?) rather than what's going to happen in the plot which is a bit secondary. Then, there are the boxes. The Pandora boxes, only this time what's inside them loses power for what they are and steps in another dimension of their usefulness. They act as tools and sometimes as characters to solve the problems of one's Cast Away. They expand time (the volleyball ""ball"") and produce space (the blades of the ice rollerskate). Finally, the blood. Lots of it. Not like a sign of death but incredibly, as a flux of life that the castaway uses to generate his feelings (Wilson or Son of Will) or to survive (the blood spill when he's making fire) and, thus returning to the religious thoughts in the start of the comment, he must need to sacrifice his body in order to (re)gain spiritual meaning about being alive. Note detail: he only eats after a long time drinking coconut MILK! Crossroads are exactly where this post-modern urban castaway stands in the beginning of the movie regarding his multiple choices. Career/marriage, workplace/home to name a few. Eventually he'll get to make one in a limit situation: the girlfriend's watch opposed to the lifeguard-waistcoat. It's a nice ellipse when he ends up in the place that was only known by the viewer in the beginning, having to choose a course in the vast desert. And this time he really chooses! P.S.: I hope Tom Hanks will deservedly be the first man to win three awards for leading role in the history of Oscars!"

"tjackson","Null","0","0","21 January 2001"," well up with some tears and experience a moment of passing profundity
","Stories about being stranded on a desert island have an elemental appeal to the human imagination, so it seems appropriate that the premier spinner of high tech cinematic fables  Robert Zemeckis - would step up to the plate with his 21st century spin on the tale. Interestingly the title Cast Away is rendered as two separate words. Could this be a way to emphasize that the cast of the movie is away for most of the film.  Perhaps it's because cast member Tom Hanks is also a producer and collaborator on the film, hinting that `cast away' may be a little like `anchors aweigh' where  `the new' Hollywood launches another tale of Everyman for a politically, morally, and spiritually confused and transitioning time. It's time to take stock of ourselves in our high paced world. Who better to take us through that journey than the common man du jour, Mr. Hanks. Like Forrest Gump, or with anything featuring Tom Hanks or directed by Zemeckis, the film has quality and integrity. Life is struggle, we all go too fast, we don't value the really important things in life, love is powerful and enduring, fate works in strange ways, life is what you make it. Their themes are crystal clear, bordering on painfully obvious. That's OK, too, because great effects and fabulous scenery in service to good commercial filmmaking is virtuous and inevitably appealing, not to mention boffo box office. The three part structure of the film is therefor entirely appropriate. Those who feel the rescue section (I won't say what happens  just in case) doesn't work, miss the purpose of the storytelling. It is not created to make us leave the theater in an existential quandary, but to be entertained, well up with some tears, experience a moment of passing profundity, and briefly ponder a few big questions.  Expecting the film to do otherwise is like having Johnny Appleseed sow his seeds across the America only to find out they never sprouted.  The film's artificiality is part of its appeal. Perhaps that's why I find myself watching the credits until the very end. I needed to find out whether the large crab on the spear caught by the Hank's character at in the beginning of his island stay was real or animatronics. It was animatronics."

","Before I saw this...all of my friends were telling me how great that it was. I had nothing to do so I decided to see it...I mean Tom Hanks has never been in a bad movie, and Robert Zemekis is a good director. I was not disapointed. I think that this is one of the best movies of the year. The movie starts out good and keeps getting better till the end. Some people said that the movie was too long, but I disagree. I think that it was the perfect length; any longer would have been boring, and any shorter and there would have been something left out. Also, some people didn't like the ending, but I thought that it fit perfectly at what Chuck (Tom) said earlier in the film. I really recomend that everyone sees this. It a really good movie that I think everyone will enjoy. After this I am going to get a volleyball  and name it Wilson. hehehe just kidding.  10/10!!!"

","Not knowing if I could endure Tom Hanks on a desert island for an hour or so, I decided to take the plunge and go see this movie - and what a film! Right from the start I was intrigued how the film was going to pan out, waiting for that all exciting plane crash which I'd heard so much about and boy, how that didn't dissapoint. It was terrifying! So much so, that I found myself willing it to crash to get it over with but for 10mins we were subjected to a horrifying rollercoaster of a flight with the end result seeming to take a lifetime to come and when it did it wasn't over. In the sea with just a liferaft, Hanks' life was still in danger and when night finally turned into morning I breathed easy again. The island was beautiful and this must have some of the best filming sequences I have ever seen in a movie. Even though there is only one person on screen for the majority of the film and virtually no music I did not find myself for one minute being bored or losing my concentration - it was fabulous........but then things started to go wrong. The screen went black for no reason and the words 'Four years later' appeared on the screen.....what???? Just as we were settling in to see how he would cope we skipped forward four years and had to endure a bravado escape plot which quite frankly should have happened three years earlier. Putting that aside though, I went with the flow until he was found that is. Ok, we knew he would have to get back and he did but when he did and Helen Hunt decided not to take him back even without seeing him - THAT'S WHEN THE FILM SHOULD HAVE ENDED!!!!! In the lounge of FedEx headquarters NOT half an hour later. We had to endure an extra three or four tacky schmultzee scenes which had no place or need in this film and in my opinion turned this film from a superb piece of cinema history to a absolute sham and cop-out. Thank god though they didn't get back together in a tear jerking reunion. Apart from all this though, I'm awarding this film 8/10 for sheer guts and innovation. And no, I do not think Tom Hanks deserves an oscar for this!!!!!!"

","PLOT SPOILERS WARNING<br/><br/>You have to give it to the man. Bob Zemeckis, who I consider one of the best directors in Hollywood, lost some of my appreciation after the dreadful ""Contact"" (If even he wasn't able to save that script, maybe it's because it was so bad that nobody could have), but he has proved this year that he is well and truly back on track, first with ""What Lies Beneath"" and now with this virtuoso tour-de-force. To keep the spectator glued to the screen for two hours when all you have is one man and a volleyball in a deserted island is almost defying logic, yet Zemeckis manages to pull it off thanks to excellent timing and rhythm, a phenomenal setting (where is this island? I want to go there!), beautifully photographed, and a fabulous, Oscar-worthy performance from Hanks (again... these two were made for each other), portraying the amazing odyssey of endurance and self-discovery of a man who had lost sight of the important things in life. In fact, I was enjoying it so much that I wasn't sure I wanted the poor guy to escape from the island, I wanted to keep watching his adventures...!<br/><br/>I loved the relationship of Chuck with his alter ego Wilson, which becomes as real a character as you could wish for (in fact, I can think of a couple of action movie stars who could probably take acting tips from it...), and was truly saddened when Chuck is forced to abandon him. The fact that Zemeckis could extract so much sympathy from an inanimate object, a face painted on a ball, reminds me of how menacing Kubrick could make a round, red and yellow light look in ""2001.."", or how much Lucas charmed us with R2-D2's grumpy character, even if we couldn't understand anything he said...<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that, in keeping with his character, Chuck maintained his ""integrity"", what he considered his essence, at least for the first few days, by not opening the boxes. It did bug me a bit that, when the circumstances force him to do so, he left one of them unscathed to serve as a symbol, a reminder of his former self and his mission in life (as the note says, ""This box saved my life""). I thought it was a little bit unrealistic, and I was fearing some terrible but daft final revelation about it (""look! a cellphone!""); but in the end it turns out that what the box contains is not important (""Pulp Fiction"" style), but what it represents, which is not only his mission, but his new future, ""brought in by the tide.."" (If he hadn't saved it, he would never had met his future partner... come on, did anybody really not get the hint of where he was going after the final scene?). Nice final touch.<br/><br/>All in all, a beautiful film and a great performance by Hanks and Zemeckis. They were robbed of a bunch of Oscars, if you ask me."
"johanleupen","7","0","0","18 January 2001"," An excellent piece of work
","It was really intriguing to see how this film can succeed using such a basic principle. A large part of the film is carried solehandedly by Hanks, whereas there is no dialogue to speak of, no dramatic tension in the traditional sense, no score to accompany the imagery. Yet Cast Away keeps us completely involved. I'm not exactly his greatest fan, but i think Hanks is to be commended. He really deserved the critical acclaim for this role. I think it is terrific to see such great names (Hanks & Zemeckis) taking these great risks in filmmaking. (Unfortunately) I rarely see this kind of experimental filmmaking in mainstream hollywood. The film's ending leaving us a bit puzzled, perhaps the story could have been resolved in a better way and i never cared much for Helen Hunt, however all in all this is still a great piece of work. The plane-crash sequence deserves special mention, as it is truly spectacular as well as frighteningly real."
"Bob-321","Null","0","0","18 January 2001"," Excellent movie with BIG flaws
","This is an entertaining and visually stunning movie that has something terribly wrong with it.  That something is inconsistency.  I think both writer and director contributed to the good and the bad.  Again and again, ideas of pure genius are mixed with unlikely  even irrational  points that are impossible to accept.  For starters: could a Caucasian spend 4 years in the blazing sun of a tropical island and come away with crusted lips and no trace of sunburn?  Not even a tan?  Tom Hanks is good and likeable, as always.  But he carries the picture only in the sense that for much of it no one else is onscreen.  Although his role calls for him to do lots of unusual things, they're really script stunts, not acting.  He needs that talent only sporadically.  For me, the film's 3 big plusses are the plane crash, the photography and the story's conclusion.  The crash at sea is seen wholly from inside the craft, from the passengers' point of view.  (It's reminiscent of Hitchcock's masterful clipper crash in `Foreign Correspondent' 60 years earlier.)   The photography by Don Burgess keeps us in precisely the right place every second.  His camera is often at water level yet  thanks to digital work, I assume  there's never a drop on the lens.  The movie ends in an ideal location and on a perfect note of indecision and nearly limitless possibilities.  Among the film's best bits is Wilson, Tom's volley ball companion, whose loss is heartbreaking.  For a good and skillful movie, however, far too many questions remain.  The island's beach is littered with FedEx packages from the plane's cargo, yet it seems days before Tom even thinks to look in them for useful items.  Why? (Eventually, nearly everything proves to be valuable.)  He also takes too long to secure the inflatable life raft that got him from the crash site to the island.  And once that's lost in an unsuccessful attempt to get away, ages pass before he even thinks of trying to BUILD some sort of escape craft.  I just don't believe it.  Among the dumber script flaws is Tom's toothache.  With all the genuine crises facing a castaway, this affliction seems contrived and superfluous.  But despite the irritating lapses in `Cast Away,' the splendid good points outweigh the clumsy ones, and best parts are unforgettable.  8 stars out of 10."

"iago-6","Null","0","0","26 December 2000"," A movie that chooses the road of superficiality
","I was very disappointed in this movie. I expected a decent look into the challenges of living in utter isolation, having to survive without modern acoutrements, and a lot of reflection on one's place in the universe. Oh no. This film, whenever confronted with the option, chooses the road of superficiality over depth.<br/><br/>Once we get past the deeply Republican yuppie fantasy of ""ideal existence"" and onto the island, we would expect, at least after a while, a little reflection on the part of our protagonist. But, for a film whose star is so eager to declare that ""nothing happens"" in its middle section, we are treated to unending survival tips and adventures at the expense of any reflection. This is a beautiful island, surely anyone there would have some moments of appreciating the stillness and natural wonder of the island. Well, not here. Surely after four years Hanks would have developed his own ways, his own joys and sorrows, new abilities he's proud of, or good at, but we just don't see them. His emotional range remains, for the whole of the island portion of the film, sad and sadder. We're supposed to believe that after he returns to civilization that there's a part of him left on that island-- well, based on this movie, he never really seems to BE on the island, he's always a yuppie visitor, and doesn't seem to engage in his environment. This movie could have been much more powerful if it chose to really engage in the loneliness and despair that one would feel after giving up on civilization and realizing one may be alone for the rest of one's life. Hanks is a fine actor unhampered by vanity, but here what we're seeing is a movie star dropped off on a set every morning. The movie's depth never rises above the level of ""Dude, what if you were like, trapped on an island? Man, like, what would you DO? That would sure suck."" And that's the one statement this film seems to make: being alone in the universe pretty much sucks. Hey, Thanks Tom, you're giving us pearls.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other details that give the film away as a sham. If I was standed on a tropical island, the first thing I would do is look for the resort on the other side. Tom shouts a few ""Hello's,"" then assumes that there's no one there. At one point he climbs up to the summit--at this point a 360-degree pan could have worked wonders, but uh-uh, not here. I still think there's a Club Med a half-mile away that Tom just never bothered to look for. He also never really seems to explore the island--and after four years, don't you think you'd take a little field trip? Also, after four years, wouldn't you have built yourself more than a few spears? Tom can't get off the island because of the reef off the section of beach he refuses to leave--maybe he could have paddled around to see if there was a break in the reef? Oh, I guess not. This is what I mean when I say this film never really engages with the reality of being on the island, and robs itself of the seriousness it so desperately asks of its audience.<br/><br/>I have read a book of true accounts of people stranded on islands (""Great Shipwrecks and Castaways,"" it's still in print, and it's excellent, so look for it if this interests you), and a book on how to survive if you must drift for days on a raft, and I know that the real problem Tom is going to face once his portasan blows away is exposure to the sun. But that problem is apparently not convenient for this film to explore, so it just pretends like it doesn't exist. This film asks you to reflect only on the problems of nature that Hollywood can easily solve, all others simply do not exist.<br/><br/>A SPOILER IN THIS NEXT SECTION: But the real mistake this movie makes, in which it betrays both itself and its audience, is to virtually cancel out ALL emotional resonance it might have attained by having a hot babe appear out of nowhere in the final two minutes to make everything okay. This development is at once disappointing and disgusting. Disappointing in that all the sadness we've built up for Hanks is INSTANTLY ERADICATED by the convenient appearance of a new ""chick"" to make his life complete, disgusting in the suggestion that Helen Hunt's character, who we've built up such a respect and reverence for, can simply be replaced by an almost identical ""hot chick"" (this one has RED hair though! And besides, Hunt never amounted to much anyway). So, as an audience, we are left to assume that Hank's character really IS stupifyingly superficial, and that the only connection he really had to Hunt, all that time on the island, is that he needed some babe in his life. Hunt, or someone else, it doesn't matter. This puts a nasty taste in my mouth now when I think about Hanks and Zemeckis as PEOPLE. But aside from that, I am surprised that they would so completely betray the film they've obviously expended so much effort on. <br/><br/>All in all, a deeply Republican film. It prods us to look deep inside ourselves and ask: ""What would we do if one day we didn't have an SUV and a pager?"" But, the movie says, don't worry about not having a woman around, they're a dime a dozen, and they're all the same. <br/><br/>Bleech!<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

","I didn't catch it until I looked at the poster after I saw the film.  The director, ""Dr.Z"", is a genius for giving a bizarre quasi-sequel to Forrest Gump.  Tom Hanks as Gump meets all these people through out history with little effort and takes part in the entire U.S. experience - Chuck Noland is a man that has to do with everyone, 6 degrees wise, with everyone in the world (he's with FedEx).  Then is not connected with another human soul. His wonderful kaleidescope of people and places take place on a microcosim of himself.  In the time he is away the things like Strife (Surviving & War), friends (Wilson & Bubba), and redemption (Jenny & Kelly) happen as can be seen on Nolan's appearance.<br/><br/>Dr.Z has always shown us stories of infinite contact and communication of the human spirit whether through time, space, etc. and now the human spirit of isolation.  Surviving one's self is ultimate to the human experience. One who is Cast Away is banished, or forced not into nothing - but onto oneself (for better or worse).  This is what this Movie is at.

","First off, I will agree with anyone who says the performance by Tom Hanks (And most any other actor or actress in this movie) was quite astounding. However, I feel this movie's problems are ""What Lies Beneath"" (To steal the title from Zemeckis' other film this year). Usually, I am the last person to say a movie is ""boring""; oftentimes, my favorite movies are those with a 3-hour+ running time. At times, however, this movie, to be blunt, is BORING. The reason for this is because all the island scenes are strung together one after another; if the movie were to show one or two island scenes and then a scene of what was going on back home (Say, his friends' and families' reactions to the crash or his funeral), and so on, the pacing wouldn't have suffered so greatly. Second, on this island he has food, water, shelter, and so on. So why is he unhappy? Easy - No human contact. This is where Wilson the volleyball's role was so pivotal. Yet everyone in the auditorium, including myself, could not stop laughing. The movie failed on all counts to show Mr. Hanks' character's grief. I kept drawing parallels between the last 45 minutes of this film and David Croenberg's ""The Dead Zone"". Both feature a character who has been removed from society for a number of years and then is thrown back in, only to find that everything has changed. The movie could've succeeded here. It could've shown in detail what had changed, it could've further allowed Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt to show off their acting chops, it could've shown how the characters dealt with these changes, it could've been a better movie. In 1998's ""The Thin Red Line"", Terrence Malick proved to be quite a visionary director by showing silence and serenity and how it can get to a person. This probably would've made him the better director for ""Cast Away"". Alas, we'll never know. All in all, this isn't a bad movie so much as it is a disappointment. It's nice that Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can make exceptionally good movies; it's just a shame this isn't one of them. ***"

When you see Tom Hanks trying to make fire, you notice how we sometimes do not appreciate life as we should, they have to take things away from us to really learn that we only live once.<br/><br/>Something amazing and that you will probably notice is how Tom Hanks really ""workout"" to be able to film the second part of the movie, something similar when he did ""Philadelphia"" with Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>I truly recommend this movie, when I was sitting at the theatre I wanted the story to never end, maybe because I was wishing the end was different, but I guess that´s what makes this movie one of the best.<br/><br/>Rubens (RAPL)"
"smakawhat","7","0","0","9 January 2001"," If it weren't for Hanks, this film would have drowned.
","Tom Hanks gives a VERY good performance in this film and I was never bored. The cinematography of the island, and the shots at end (which are symoblic to the story) are great and Hanks' acting talent is unreal.  I don't know how he does it, here's a guy who was basicaly a stand up comedian and a television actor, until Big hit the screen and then he ended up in great roles in films like Phillidelphia and Forest Gump.  He is the key in this film, if they got some other actor that didn't work this film would have been terrible.<br/><br/>This being said, the film has constant 'What would you do scenarios?', throughout the entire movie, and I am not always crazy about that.  The biggest flaw I think with this film is that the trailer GIVES away the fact that Hanks gets off the island, in short the trailer TELLS you the entire movie.  This is stupid, and the director said he did this deliberatly. Second...  Hanks' return to the real world I think is VERY unrealistic and RUSHED through and perhaps even somewhat unnecessary. Basicaly he ends up back and there is literally a short scene where he is having a welcoming party with his office colleagues.  They all come up to him and say things like 'Well we see you back at the office tomorrow regarding meeting ..."",  ""Hey how about we shoot a round of golf, I am teeing off tommorow at 8"", no no no... How about...<br/><br/>""Let's spend 1 year in psychotherapy, to figure out how to live again after not interacting with humans for 4+ years"" This would be more the norm... and more realistic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
***POSSIBLE SPOILER DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE FILM ***<br/><br/><br/><br/>And thirdly, the meeting with the 'other husband' was done VERY badly, meaning it wasn't acted out or handled well.  That's my take.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
*** END SPOILER ***<br/><br/>This being said it is NOT a perfect film, it is NOT deserving of Best Picture, it is NOT deserving of Hanks WINNING Best Actor, but it does deserve a nomination but I don't think he should win not because his performance is bad, but because I think that other actors in films I have seen this year did better.  Hanks did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>This movie I think is more of a spiritual, psychological awakening movie, than a tearjerking sappy love story film.  Even with all this I did enjoy the film, and was never bored through it's 2 1/2+ hour run time.<br/><br/>Rating 7 out of 10"

","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>With very mixed reviews, ""Cast Away"" is a good and entertaining film, but it is not very thorough and it is somewhat flawed in the timeline department. I was actually very satisfied with the film - I had expected nothing more, and nothing less, so for once, my expectations were met almost exactly.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with this film? In hindsight, I can easily spot the flaws, but sitting in the theater I didn't mind them much. First and foremost, that which most negative reviews and comments focus on, is the 4-year leap. We get to see Noland surviving, adapting and realizing that he will not be found. Suddenly, the action jumps 4 years ahead, to the point where Noland finally gets a chance to leave. It wasn't very frustrating to me - Zemeckis and his crew obviously wanted to focus on the difference between Noland the survivor and Noland the Robinson. I find the stark contrast rather refreshing - because seriously: what should they have filled the intervening time with? More injuries? More reinventing the primitive tools of the caveman? I don't think so. It would have lengthened a film that in the end is not about the life of a Robinson, but about adaptability, strength and resolve. And to that end, the abrupt jump in time is not only acceptable, but necessary.<br/><br/>What I do think is a great flaw, and the only one that actually bothered me while watching, was the carefree way with which the movie deals with his homecoming. Sadly overlooked, the reactions of people around him and the massive amount of attention that he undoubtedly would receive, would have been valuable to the movie in terms of entertainment and clarification: just how did the world go on without him? Then again, the focus is not the world, but Noland. It's his sentiments, his life that has altered so profoundly, and the gap in time between his rescue and meeting with his former girlfriend is also a gap that is functional: how mindblowing mustn't it be to be rescued after 4 years alone on a tiny island with just a volleyball to talk to? How blank would his mind get after finally being brought back to civilization? The 4 weeks after his rescue would be filled with a weak, sleepy Noland without much to say or do. What Zemeckis could have added without much effort, is a sort of media commentary on Noland's story. The 4-week gap feels too much like a loss.<br/><br/>Zemeckis has an eye for human emotions and facial expressions that say more than words and music would. We get to see Hanks perform stunningly (as usual), regardless if he is a crowd-pleaser or not, and his time on the island is void of music and almost void of words. The film is superbly shot, some sequences almost taking the breath away. Some details weight heavily on the viewer - the removal of a bad tooth by way of an ice skating shoe that had the entire audience cringing in their seats, and the realistic and frightening scene where he tries to escape with the rubber raft and injures himself.<br/><br/>All in all, I think the negative reviews on this film are unfair and inconsiderate. I would like to know what should have been done instead. I just have a hard time seeing this film made different without losing focus: Noland and his life before, during and after his stay as a Robinson."

","I thought Cast Away was simply incredible. What I liked most about this movie was the way it handled the situation and its cinematography. First, I believe if someone were to be stranded, there situation would be played out similar to Chuck's. No pirates, natives, snakes, buddies, abundant food supplies, and other plot devices every other movie of this genre uses. It is a man alone on a small island left to himself (and a volleyball). Hanks played this part so convincingly, I felt as if his character was always just teetering on the edge of insanity. Myself and others I saw this movie with felt real sorrow when Chuck loses Wilson. I felt this movie had a very strong ending. I believe it ended at the right point. We see how Chuck adjusts, but what he decides to do with his life is left up the the viewers imagination. I also believed the cinematography was spectacular. Granted, anything filmed in the South Pacific will look beautiful, the filming in this movie captures the feeling of being on the tiny island with Chuck. Four stars!"

","Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis take you on a journey that you'll not soon forget.  When we first meet Hanks' character, he's a time obsessed FedEx employee who lives by the clock.  His entire life has to be scheduled at least a week in advance.  Then, one fateful evening he departs on a plane that crashes into the Pacific.  After surviving the crash, Chuck is washed ashore on an island in the middle of nowhere.  Now, he has nothing but time on his hands.  Slowly but surely, Chuck begins to reawaken primal insticnts that have layed dormant in him, and through this, we see just how resourseful, and resiliant humans can be.  To their credit, Zemeckis and Hanks never resort to anything that would be found on Gilligan's Island.  No pirates, no apes, no nothing in fact.  All that is on island is Hanks, and whatever has washed ashore.  Since humans are a social animal, the need for communication is essential, and one of the best relationships developed in the film is between Chuck and Wilson.  Through Wilson, Chuck is able to express his concerns, his fears, his hopes and this allows him a shred of sanity.  <br/><br/>Once again, Robert Zemeckis shows hi s mastery at the art of storytelling. He makes good use of the visual effects to propel the story forward, and the effects never take center stage.  Even during the very realistic plane crash.  The effects are there to help the story, they are not the story.  Tom Hanks shows that he's one of the best actors working today.  His weight loss for the film has been duly noted in many papers and periodicals but to see him go from a thick, bear like man to a skeletal frame with a scraggly beard is quite shock.  He gives his all for his performance, and there are scenes on and off the island that contain only Hanks, and these scenes are heartbreaking.  <br/><br/>Some may complain that the running time is too long, that the film starts to slow down once Hanks is on the island.  Well, that's the point.  We begin to feel what he's going through. With nothing but time on your hands, and no way to measure it, time seems to stand still.  <br/><br/>
Cast Away is one of the better films this season, and one  of the best films of the year.  Thanks in part to the performance of Tom Hanks and the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis."

","CAST AWAY has gotten much praise as a sort of existential<br/><br/>blockbuster: Tom Hanks, a stick, a volleyball and a crab for a<br/><br/>whole hour! J. Hoberman has memorably described as the<br/><br/>""bleakest vision of human existence in studio filmmaking since<br/><br/>Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE.""<br/><br/>Beg to differ. The key that winds this baby up is the theme that<br/><br/>unites most high-period Tom Hanks movies: the American can-do<br/><br/>spirit. Like the guy using a sock and a ballpoint pen to fix a<br/><br/>spaceship in APOLLO THIRTEEN, like the guy firing a pistol feebly<br/><br/>at a Panzer tank in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Hanks' Chuck Noland,<br/><br/>FedEx work and late-twentieth-century guy extraordinaire, doesn't<br/><br/>so much look into the abyss as kick its butt using technology and a<br/><br/>little bit of Yankee elbow grease. Hanks, a fan of 2001, seems to<br/><br/>have completely mislearned its lessons: no major commercial<br/><br/>film artist, not even James Cameron, seems so enraptured by the<br/><br/>transcendent power of technos.<br/><br/>The director, Robert Zemeckis, lays it on thick at the beginning:<br/><br/>Chuck is a time-is-money type-A geek who sits with his fiancee<br/><br/>(Helen Hunt) and plots out quality time with her as they both peer<br/><br/>into identical datebooks. (Had the movie not been inexplicably set<br/><br/>in 1995, they could zap their Palm Pilots at each other.) Then,<br/><br/>marooned on a desert island...well, you'd think he'd learn<br/><br/>something about stopping to smell the roses. Or his laid-on-thick<br/><br/>emotional blockedness. Or something, other than how to rub two<br/><br/>sticks together. But, as if they studied Bresson and David Mamet,<br/><br/>Hanks and Zemeckis have no time for sticky feelings. It's<br/><br/>procedure, the how-to, that excites them. And though it must have<br/><br/>seemed terribly daring to spend so much time with one guy<br/><br/>onscreen, a static camera, and no music or dialogue, this stuff is<br/><br/>by far the most engaging in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie gets inspirational in its last movements, a tribute to<br/><br/>never giving up, or not letting go of your dream, or love-will-show-the-way, or some other development-world cliche.<br/><br/>The last moments of the movie are staggering in their inadequacy.<br/><br/>The filmmakers seem to have eschewed every possible cornball<br/><br/>ending, every chance for cheap uplift...and then they replace it with<br/><br/>nothing at all. The movie doesn't so much end as stop, as if the<br/><br/>screenwriter, puzzled and disgusted, threw his typewriter across<br/><br/>the room.<br/><br/>The level of drama isn't helped much by the casting of Helen Hunt<br/><br/>as Chuck's beloved. Is there a more unsympathetic major female<br/><br/>star in movies today? Hunt right now has the number one and two<br/><br/>movies in America. What are people seeing that I'm missing? And<br/><br/>does Hanks realize how much of this performance, which some<br/><br/>are touting as among the greatest of all time, is a carbon copy of<br/><br/>his work in a little number called JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO?"

One would think during that time, somebody could have contemplated a better resolution... ""Anybody?!!"". Someone wrote here before me, the lack of transition between the rescue and the return to the real world was a disappointment. I agree. There seems to be a hole in the story that is circumvented by ""4 weeks later..."" Those 4 weeks could have been alot more intriguing than the 3rd act we're given.<br/><br/>
DANGER!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br/><br/>For instance, I wanted to see Hanks being rescued. He wakes up to a ship and then he's on a plane ""4 weeks later"". It would have been alot more interesting to explore his view from nothingness-to-everything during this time. There would be press junkets and a book deal somewhere in the making. Instead, he returns to his job at Fed-Ex and we get a tacked-on ending to resolve a nowhere relationship. It would have been more satisfying for Hanks to return to the Island, possibly with the family of the Fed-Ex worker he buried. Zemeckis was overflowing with ideas for Forrest Gump. Here, it is like he runs out of gas.<br/><br/>Be forewarned, if you are sensitive to a fidgety audience, wait for the video. There is about an hour of near silence that can be deafening in a theater.<br/><br/>I can't dismiss the film as a whole. The plane crash is amazing and the central part of Hanks on the Island is the saving grace. Very thought provoking.

His ability for acting shines in this role.<br/><br/>The greater part of the movie rests in mostly silence, as we watch Hanks' character, Chuck, struggling to live on the tiny island which has become his prison.

Tom Hanks' acting ability turns what could have been a mediocre role into one of depth, making the viewer sympathise with every hardship he must endure.<br/><br/>One thing I've heard many times over is how bad the ending is. Why? Because it's not 'happily ever after?' It is NOT a warm and cozy ending... it's not made to make us feel good inside. It's realistic.

I was completely caught up. The only feeling of letdown was in the ending, it appeared as if the writer did not know where to take it.

A ""movie"" is simply meant to entertain.  In this film, we are taken into the world of Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee.  We learn that he is his job.  Time is his enemy.  He loves his girlfriend Kelly, but to be together, they must compare planners.  Then, his world changes drastically.  He attempts to do things in his usual manner, very quickly.  Time teaches him patience.  We don't learn about Chuck through dialog as much as we do through the lens.  There are scenes in the movie where we feel what the characters in the movie must be feeling, simply by seeing endless ocean and endless prairie.  We also see the might of nature in stunning storm tossed seas and powerful winds.  If you are patient, Chuck will tell you why he survived and then you will learn if he will survive.

Zemeckis kind of leaves the audience hanging here, which provides you with a kind of ""Huh?"" thought in your head as you walk out of the theater. Many of Zemeckis' films leave you with a lack of catharsis at the end of the film, such as Back to the Future III. Otherwise, the film was excellent.

Further, the island (lonliness and separation) feeds, protects and cares for him over time so he can grow strong to meet the challenge of the waves (change/journey). Finally, the raft represents the promise of a new life, the volleyball the old self, the paddles represent letting go and accepting God/Fate/reality, and the whale is the confidence that there is a spirit/guide/guardian/angel watching over us (all we have to do is listen).<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully made and has a beautiful message...

","In many ways, Cast Away reminds me very much of another very good Robert Zemeckis film, Contact.  Both of them had endings that were somewhat disappointing (as one person I heard said it about Contact ""I waited three hours to see the aliens and they're her freaking father?"").  Cast Away's ultimate conclusion was even more ambiguous and troubling, but that does not keep it from being an enthralling and interesting film and one of the ten best movies of the year, just as Contact was enthralling and interesting and one of the ten best movies of its year.<br/><br/>In short, Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a gung-ho Fedex supervisor/trouble shooter/slave driver who travels the world licking troubled Fedex centers into shape.  He loves Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), a Ph.D student close to finishing her dissertation.  On Christmas Eve, and on the eve he was to propose marriage, he is sent on a flight to Asia.  The plane goes off course and then down in an incredibly gripping sequence. Noland (No-land - even his name has meaning in this film) is the only survivor and he washes ashore onto an isolated rock in the middle of the Pacific with nothing to survive with.  He salvages his raft (the survival kit and flares went down with the plane), and some Fedex packages that wash ashore, and sets up camp.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is made up of Hank's attempts to survive on the island, primarily in two episodes - how he acclimatizes and learns to survive, and then four years later, when he at last has a chance to get off the island. The script is really remarkably well done, considering that Hanks has no one to speak to for the bulk of the film (although he does create a 'friend' out of a volleyball with whom he converses).  The Fedex packages that wash ashore at first seem worse than useless, but their uses are very clever and hidden.  Noland does all of the things you think of doing yourself, often at the same time you are reaching the same conclusions, although I have to say he's many times more resourceful than I - I would have died on that island. The drama of surviving, and Hanks' abilities as an actor to keep everything human, are engrossing.  Noland's island is a forbidding spit of sand and rock way out somewhere, and there is no man Friday to help this Robinson Crusoe.  Every problem he has, from making fire to dealing with a rotting tooth with no anesthetic and no tools, are dealt with in a straightforward and realistic fashion.<br/><br/>Zemeckis's direction is outstanding.  The crash scene is tense, frightening and incredibly well done (so well done it deserves mention more than once). Zemeckis (and his cinematographer) strand Hanks on an island that they show is both amazingly beautiful and also barren and desolate.  Hanks' buddy, Wilson the volleyball, is handled so well by the director (and the script) that Hanks' constant banter with it makes you begin to understand how he relies on the volleyball to keep his sanity while at the same time imparting the feeling that the ball really is talking back somehow.<br/><br/>Noland's escape from the island is also very well done, and this should be no spoiler to anyone who has seen a commercial for the film that gives this part away.  The bittersweet reunification with Hunt's Frears is effective, and Hanks has a wonderful speech at the close of the film that encapsulates the film's theme, about the powerlessness and hopelessness we sometimes feel in life and the importance of tides.  Then it maybe goes on a little too long, and leaves with a totally ambiguous and unfulfilling ending.  Oh well. I'll only have to watch this one nine more times before I'm sick of it.

","This movie has many different points which can relate to normal people. The way Tom Hanks acted in it is remarkable. He depicted exactly how someone would respond to the environment alone. I too would have probably started talking to myself and making up friends. The one thing I don't understand about this movie is how it ended, Tom Hanks was just standing in the middle of the road staring off into nowhere. Other than that it was a decent movie, I think Tom Hanks deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role."

Hanks is no superman, just a reasonably intelligent guy who got lucky. Lucky to survive a ""landing on water"" (which for big jets is usually fatal) and lucky to be washed across the reef and onto an island. Lucky also to be able to survive significant puncture wounds that would kill most people through infection. You have to have a strong constitution to survive daily contact with a coral reef. It looks so peaceful and beautiful, but it is very dangerous (the book ""Castaway"" by Lucy Irvine is a good read and may well have been an inspiration to Hanks and company).<br/><br/>The boat escape from the island was pure drama, getting over the big wave was such a thrill.<br/><br/>Remainder of the film was not that interesting but I thought the ending was effective.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10 stars and I would be glad to see it again."

"godfather72","Null","0","0","5 October 2002"," The intangibles make the film and Hanks' performance
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>We are becoming increasingly hard-pressed to find a better actor in Hollywood today than Tom Hanks.  Every movie of his is an event and a must-see, as was this one.  When this film debuted around Christmas 2000, I wondered if this film would hold up to the Hanks tradition of late.  He makes good choices of films to appear in, and doesn't half-*** anything (from Philadelphia through Forrest Gump through Saving Private Ryan through this year's Road to Perdition).  This movie would not be the movie it is in my mind without Tom Hanks and his solo performance.  And let's face it, that's what it is.  I can't think of any other role where one actor was asked to hold for screen by himself for scene after scene after scene like he did in this film.  What's remarkable about the situation is that he did it so well, and in my opinion, was robbed of the Best Actor award for 2000 by Russell Crowe's good but less demanding performance in Gladiator.<br/><br/>The movie begins in Russia, where Chuck Noland (Hanks) is working.  He is a FedEx shipping supervisor whose life is ruled by, in a word, time.  The clock is his enemy, his boss, his friend when necessary, and remains ever-present in his life.  He is about to propose to his girlfriend, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), back home in Memphis, TN.  Before New Year's, he finds out that he has to go on short notice to Malaysia, much to the displeasure of Kelly.  He gives her the ring before he leaves, without much fanfare, and leaves for the plane.  On the way, in a frighteningly scary and seemingly real plane crash, Chuck becomes the only survivor of an awful accident, and becomes marooned on a small, unoccupied island.  There his personal odyssey begins.<br/><br/>At this point, the film becomes something else.  It doesn't dissolve into typical Hollywood melodramatics and awful lamenting; instead, he struggles to survive through body and mind, at once staringly longingly into Kelly's face (through a small, now broken clock/family heirloom containing her picture), and at another instance using his will to find food and survive, with Kelly's face driving him.  As time passes and it becomes clear that almost nobody knows this island exists, you can only imagine his man's internal musings about what life becomes, isolation, heartbreak, beauty, struggle, and so on.  Being able to identify with Chuck Noland and be riveted by his predicament is to thoroughly enjoy the film; for those bored by an utter lack of dialogue for more than half the film will be disappointed, and I personally know many people who fall into the latter category.  Noland's character is not the type to expound on his feelings, and at film's end, he hasn't changed drastically, but it is quite enough to feel for him, as I certainly did.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis's direction is chock-full of subtlety, and the better the film is for it, because scene after scene of over-the-top craziness, good or bad for the characters, doesn't fit the mood of the film (and Alan Silvestri's hauntingly spare score, for that matter).  Themes abound throughout, such as the repetitive feelings about time and its absence on the island.  Some say the ending is disappointing, but I disagree; it makes perfect sense for the film's tone.<br/><br/>Overall:  see this for Hanks and his downright towering performance, and also intangibles of Chuck Noland's thoughts.  Empathy is a huge bonus for the enjoyment of this film.  8/10"

","First of all I want to spank to the people that promoted this movie. The preview featured music from Braveheart. Great, but please don't do it again. We all now that James Horner achieved his maximum in Braveheart but that doesnt mean that everybody has to use the music in all previews. Remember, Titanic also used Braveheart's music in the preview. I guess that because the music is so nice they'll get more people to see the movie. Anyway, for a movie that didnt promise too much, a castaway lost in his pacific island for two hours, I have to admit that Cast Away surprised me. I didnt find the movie boring at all because there are a lot of humor in it, and you get along with Tom Hanks role. But besides from that I don't think this movie is by far the best of the year.

The jets radio black out is also rather implausible. The lack of infection from a major injury in topical (bacteria infested) waters is also at least extremely lucky. One of the things I liked abou it is that its sort of just a story of a guy going through an amazing experience, just s slice of life, not major upheaval and resolution and etc etc, an amazing slice of  life due to the circumstances, but just a guy somehow managing to get thorugh it.

"Han-10","Null","0","0","4 January 2001"," It's c**p, and it'll be a huge Oscar contender
","Here's a great idea gone wrong...SPOILERS AHEAD, NOT THAT TRAILER DIDN'T SPOIL EVERYTHING ANYWAY<br/><br/>It begins by saturating us with the fact that Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) lives his life on a strict schedule.  In a future BATMAN film, they would set-up the Clock King's pre-menacing days similarly.  After the first three lines of dialogue were out of Hanks' mouth, I had the entire exposition mapped out in my head.  I was half-expecting that Hanks would -- after the plane crash -- return to his wife (Helen Hunt) as a snowman.  I should note that as a JACK FROST reference only because I'm not confident that many of you have seen it (obviously, if you haven't, don't).<br/><br/>So after the crash, Hanks floats to the island where we spend a good chunk of the movie alone with him.  Mostly good stuff here, especially when dealing with basic survival.  I was able to completely forget that Hanks was just an actor surrounded by a film crew.  The lack of music and the sustained sequences let you inside Chuck Noland's skin.  It is therefore a dreadful mistake on the part of the filmmakers to pull us out of that skin when we are starting to identify with it.  ""Four years later,"" says the title card.  I would have liked 15 or 20 more minutes on the island, or enough to properly transition Chuck Noland from a baffled plane crash survivor to a suicide-contemplating loon who talks to volleyballs.  And if they showed that damn stopwatch with Helen Hunt's picture one more time, I'd be overcome by nausea.  It was almost as sappy as the use of the compass in Zemeckis' CONTACT.  Same syrupy significance.<br/><br/>Now, if you've been watching this guy rub sticks together for an hour, wouldn't it be interesting to see his rescue and his potentially jarring re-introduction to civilisation?  Let's face it, as horrible as the entire situation would be, it'd almost be worth being stranded to be rescued. It'd be like being carried off home plate after hitting the game-winning home run in Game 7 of the World Series.  What a missed opportunity to skip this emotional rollercoaster and instead plunk down another title card: ""One month later.""  Well, I want to know what that month was like.  Throw in the four years I missed and I'd be even happier.<br/><br/>All of the events shown after Hanks' arrival home are uninteresting.  I really didn't want to know about any of it.  Zemeckis once again chose sentimentality over imagination.  We get a long kiss in a rainstorm and a cheesy ""guardian angel/freedom"" symbol that dumps more sugar on the pile that the pocket-watch started.  There is no transition from rescued Hanks to recovering Hanks.  If you started watching the film from the ""One month later"" title card, you'd barely think that this man spent over four years on a deserted island.<br/><br/>Some great sequences at least make this entertaining frustration.  Less c**p, more good stuff, and smoother transitions; that would have resulted in a better film.  As Hanks would say in the similarly-flawed FORREST GUMP, ""That's all I have to say about that.""<br/><br/>Grade: C"

The earlier poster wrote:<br/><br/>""He was at the last looking down a different road, the one toward California. "" SPOILER ALERT That is incorrect.  Hanks stepped out from his jeep into the middle of the intersection.  He looked forward, then to the left and right, and finally turned back around and faced up in the direction of his jeep which is the direction toward the woman's ranch.  His hint of a smile combined with other factors mentioned by other commenters clearly implies that Hanks goes back to pursue this new opportunity.  When you couple that with the last words of the previous scene where Hanks talks about how his will to live changed with the port a potty shell which ""washed up on the beach"" and that life is about seeing what washes up next it becomes clear to me that Lari White becomes Hanks's next opportunity which ""washes up on the beach.""<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this is a great ending.

","For a film that features basically one actor for an hour and a half, this delivers pretty well.  Hanks is some sort of air courier whose plane crashes in the middle of the ocean.  He manages to find an island and do the old ""live off the land"" thing for awhile.  One of two things I didn't go for was the length of time he supposedly spends marooned.  Others have spoiled it but I will leave it to you in finding out, it just seemed too unreal.  I feel he would've lost his mind after just a few months if he didn't die from the elements first.  Hanks really manages to hold the film together pretty well, as they interject a good amount of comic moments.  The filming style is a bit odd, as Bob Z.  uses a sort of documentary style, using no music and shooting Hanks work activities mostly in close-up.  It's all well photographed, especially a very dramatic plane crash.  But that other thing I didn't like about the film makes a real difference: the totally dissatisfying ending.  After about 90 minutes on the island, the screenplay only dedicates about 15 minutes to Hanks homecoming (yes, that could be considered spoiling, but you probably saw it in the previews anyway).  Not enough of his return to society was explored, and things close out with a dull stare into the camera that doesn't resolve anything.  Also look out for shameless plugs for ""Federal Express"" and Wilson volleyballs, which Hanks actually befriends(!).  That could've done with a little trimming as well, his wacked out love for the ball.  I know he's lonely and needed a ""companion"", but they should've said enough already with the tears after he loses his buddy.  But I would suggest you go for the survival element, which totally shocked me with its pace.  I usually check my watch a few times during a film but was amazed to see it was the 2 hour mark when I first did it with this movie.  Zemeckis directed the most excellently paced movie ever (in my opinion), ""Back to the Future"", and he doesn't fail here, keeping things going with engrossing vignettes of what Hanks goes thru.  The meager other cast members are good, like barely seen Hunt, who found herself in big holiday movies two weeks in a row.  But look out for that ending, which sinks ""Cast Away"" from being great (couldn't resist)."

","I went into this movie just so i would have something to do for a few hours, but came out amazed! Many people misunderstand the whole movie, saying it didn't have enough action or the four years with Tom Hanks on the island was too long. I myself think that the entire movie was well balanced and well done.<br/><br/>The movie showed extremely well how you would try to survive on an island by yourself. It showed the challenge of hunting your food, creating fire so you could cook you food, and mainly STAYING SANE! The one thing that kept Tom Hanks' character sane (or at least some what sane, he does talk to a vollyball) is Helen Hunt's character, but we never really got to know her, because later Hanks finds out(when he gets back) that being with her again, is not possible. Sort of ironic.<br/><br/>Many people thought the ending was horrible, but i think it shows well the many choices that Hanks had to face. By puting him in the middle of the intersection, he must go one way, and that direction may change his life. The women that came and told him what there was each direction, was not a ""replacement"" for Helen Hunt, but merely another choice, and kind of a guide by telling him what each road lead to.<br/><br/>In conclusion this movie was very risky, because of the lack of dialogue and action (after all he is on an island for four years by himself) but Tom Hanks was able the pull it off and give and excellent performance. I could not have chosen a better movie to watch when i need something to do. I'll be sure to get this one on DVD when it comes out! GO WATCH IT!"

","You've read the synopses, you know what the movie is about. Let's get to the meat... skip if you wish no spoilers. Tom Hanks did a fantastic job of creating a believable character. His acting was perfect for the role. Up until his eventual rescue the film is excellent. Sure, we could have seen more of his ""decline"" into more primitive processes, and it would have added to the movie. The roundabout way his suicide attempt is introduced in the movie is effective. The crash is harrowing. His discoveries on the island are phenomenal. His ""transformation"" into the lean, thousand-yard stare, almost-hopeless primate is wonderful (he seems almost neanderthal in his reaction to the porta-potty piece in the water... loved it). The movie _after_ the rescue missed its mark. Hanks discussion with his friend on the private plane had neither the stilted quality one might expect from someone whose sole partner for 4 years was a punctured volleyball, nor did it have the possibly clamouring quality of someone who is finally around a lost friend. I could expect either, but instead we are treated to a rather bland characterisation. In fact, all of the interactions with others (save the rather emotional monologue to the same friend later) have this detached quality that TO ME seems inappropriate somehow. This is almost painfully true in his interaction with his long-lost sweetie, played by Helen Hunt. My problem is I can't seem to be able to imagine any _real_ people, when placed in the same situation, who would act the way that both of them act. Even the ""last chance"" part towards the end didn't have that emotion that one would expect in the situation. Anyway, I enjoyed the film, but am still mildly disappointed with the points above. I will still, however, probably buy it when it comes out on DVD. Go figure."

At the beginning they could have had him talk to himself filling us in on what he's trying to do.  It does get a little better when he talks to Wilson.  They just didn't fill in enough for the viewer, they left too much up to the viewer to figure out. And the ending once again, just leaves the viewer in the middle of nowhere trying to figure it out.

I have been in this state for nearly 5 days now, and this is my homage to that feeling--this is my way of capturing it, harnessing it.  As thoughts flood into my head I desperately try to write them down as quickly as possible, but surely some will get washed away with the tide.<br/><br/>I have just returned from a movie that has altered, or re-affirmed my view of life and the world.  It is my second time seeing Cast Away, and I am undoubtably changed.  Not so much changed, but perhaps intensely more aware of what is important in life.<br/><br/>All my days equalling 22 years to this point, have told me one day I would ""become,"" but as I'm growing to learn, you never finish ""becoming""--as you learn more and more about life and the world you try things on for size and see how they fit you.  It doesn't end--nobody taps you on the head with a magic wand one day and says ""ok, you have 'become', now go and live.""  It is the living that fuels the becoming.<br/><br/>That said, there are definitely defining times or moments when one feels themselves ""becoming"" faster or closer to who they think they are.  This was one such time for me, watching Tom Hanks live out on screen my dream.<br/><br/>I really battle with the idea of who I am.  One day I think I know, the next it has changed without warning.  Identity is so difficult because you can't have an objective opinion about yourself, yet only you know yourself well enough to determine your own identity.  This leads one to the conclusion that perhaps, though moulded by our nurture, it is indeed our nature that is already planned out for us which we reveal piece by piece, with each successive leg of experience and experiences in life.<br/><br/>One think I know for sure is, I am meant for a simple life.  Not simple in that I am a simple person, for I am one of the most complex people I know of, but simple as in that is what I crave, long for and have grown up to appreciate.  Despite my sometime wild dreams of wealth and prosperity, down deep I realize the wealth I seek is wealth of life, the marrow, the experience, and prosperity in making a difference on the world I touch.<br/><br/>The movie Cast Away has stirred something inside of me I need to remind myself of more often--the value of simplicity, the necessity to re-evaluate what is really important, and how much our antibiotic, commercialistic, technology-driven society brainwashes us into thinking that if we buy into it, we'll fill a void that can truly only be filled by God, and self-knowledge that comes from *truly* living.  This kind of living is one virtually unknown to our North American society but it is one based on need and necessity, and not greed and desire.  And when it comes down to it, truly all we need to live is faith, sustenance, purpose and above all else, love.<br/><br/>When we stand at the cross roads of life, there are many paths we could take, and only one we will.  As Frost suggests, I shall embark on the one least travelled.  My life awaits me along the path, not at the end. ****************************<br/><br/>While you may think I haven't told you anything about the movie, this is everything the movie has purged from me.. and so maybe I've told you more than a plot summary could ever do.  If you want an opinion, form your own by seeing it, and experiencing it.  It may cause you to re-evaluate your self, and your life.

The bottom line is:  I enjoyed the movie.  Of course it's not perfect, but it is well done in general.<br/><br/>TOM HANKS:<br/><br/>He did a good job.  I didn't like some of his acting.  For example, during the whole plane crash and when he was in the sea/waves/thunders right after, Tom Hanks didn't make a sound.  Not even ONE SOUND, not a scream, not an ""Oh My God"", not a ""Help"", not a ""AHH!!"".  I do not get it, for me it doesn't make sense.  He must have been terrified during the crash and complete silence does not portray that.  Other then that, I thought he did a good job although once again, the whole movie evolves around him.  It's like he's the big star of the movie, who cares about the others.  It's always like that in his movies, it's always about HIM.  I am surprised the movie wasn't titled ""Tom Hanks"".  But anyways, it's no big deal.<br/><br/>Also, as soon as he landed on the island, his actions weren't normal.  He started screaming for help before even moving one meter and checking where he is.  Anyways.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE:<br/><br/>There's not many scenes that I didn't like.  I was entertained the whole time.  Wilson must have payed huge money for this.  There were some funny moments, some intense moments, drama, action.  It's well-balanced.<br/><br/>
All in all, I enjoyed the movie, and I recommend it to anyone. 8/10."

","Cast Away is a decent film about the survivor of a plane crash.

","Cast Away was a great movie - the emotion of the story of Tom Hanks (Chuck) rushing through every day life as a FedEx corporate Trainer and stating lines like ""You live by the Clock"" is so true.  We all live by the clock in our fast busy every day lives of juggling careers, friends, and relationships.  But life slowed Tom Hanks down in Cast Away - it snatched that clock right away from him and landed him on a deserted island to think about what is the importance in life.  For him it was Kelly (Helen Hunt), his true love.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was superb and his terror and fear ran through me in this movie. The cinema-photography was so vivid!  The airplane crash was so real, the close up of Tom knocking his tooth out and the huge waves that crashed down on him was so real, vivid and placed me right there with him.<br/><br/>I rated the movie 8 Stars - I wanted to give it 10 stars, but the ending left me wanting more.

","I went into this one skeptical because the critics liked it. With the exception of a very few, the movies critics applaud bore me to tears. This one was, in my opinion, a casualty until the crash. Hanks and Hunt walk through their lines in the beginning like they are just punching a time clock saying memorised lines. There is no passionate chemistry between them. In fact they are rather cool to each other not even acting like they like each other really except where it says ""insert kiss here"". The movie does take off however when Hanks boards the doomed flight and soars from then on. The rest of the movie is suspenseful, funny and poignant. Hanks is marvellous in his Robinson Caruso role. Hunt finally finds her emotions at the end and finally the chemistry between Hanks and Hunt is there for the ending. This one fell flat for me in the beginning but soared into the ending with flying colors."
"robertcohn75","Null","0","0","1 January 2001"," Another gem from Hanks!
","I came out of the theater wondering how Mr. Hanks could have condensed so much emotion and depth into what potentially seemed an empty movie. I think it's his best work since Dragnet. People compare his everyman style to the great Jimmy Stewart, and rightly so. Whenever I saw Hanks working his magic, for example in the charming scenes with the volleyball, you could see the mantle of 'America's Actor' being passed from Stewart to Hanks. I have'nt seen that kind of chemistry between an actor and non-speaking prop since Hanks' previous triumph, Turner and Hooch.<br/><br/>The direction captured the isolation of Hanks and his surroundings, whilst keeping an understated feel. Definitely Zemeckis' best job since Death Becomes Her and Forrest Gump. My one gripe being that the most memorable part of the movie was the crash sequence. I had hoped that the director could have matured, and not rely on special effect action sequences to carry his movies. And the dialogue was adequate too. I could'nt decide between this and Boyles Jnr's other standout, Entrapment.<br/><br/>There was support from Hunt and Noth: I thought that their acting on the periphery, provided the necessary distance that enhanced Hanks' realistic portrayal of solitude. The same effect that Tawney Kitaen and Adrian Zmed had on Hanks in Bachelor Party. The 'far-off' co-acting in both films provided the chance for Hanks to shine in his solo star role amongst the driftwood.<br/><br/>The ending, when we find Hanks back in civilization, I felt did'nt keep with the tone and pace of the film. Although we are now used to the heart-warming rousing finales of Hanks' movies, who could forget the close-out of Splash, I would have preferred to have seen Hanks see out the film still on the island, with the volleyball.<br/><br/>In closing I would rate Cast Away quite well against the other 'stranded on an island' movies I have seen. Hanks' project deals with the issues of alienation and survival, whilst not losing sight of the potential of fate that can rescue people from isolation and put them back into a more favorable position. Similar to what $1 million did for Richard Hatch after the Survivor TV series. And not to point all the credit to Hanks, seen in the box-office returns for Cast Away, I do hope that his co-star in Big, Jared Rushton received a few points  after showing Hanks the potential for a 'lost in the wilderness' vehicle, after he starred in a not too dissimilar picture, A Cry In The Wilderness.<br/><br/>A 'twerp cinema' rating of four."

I was sitting in a theater getting ready to watch MEN OF HONOR, another good one, when the trailer for Cast Away came on, and I remember sitting there captured by the clips of the plane crash (I agree with another viewer, they did give too much of the movie away) and saying I have to see this.<br/><br/>Huge credit goes to Wilson, of course, ""someone"" I am sure we can all relate.  I admired Tom's desire to get Wilson back and then making a conscious decision to give up the fight and move on... that was a very powerful momment... a very final momment that was beautifully done.  I am glad Wilson did not wash up on shore, to me it would have decreased the impact of the significant role Wilson played.<br/><br/>All the scenes done without dialogue were excellent.  You could here a pin drop in the theatre.  Tom does a great job at telling a story without words. The shoe scene was FUNNY.. I think it was meant to be funny.  Kind of makes you not want to take off your shoes in an airplane, which goes against Bruce Willis' theory about dealing jetlag (DIEHARD)<br/><br/>Overall a great movie and while I wasn't knocked out of socks about the ending I did appreciate the ""realness"" of it.

"afinklea","Null","0","0","1 January 2001"," What's the point of cliff-notes trailers???
","Why, oh why did they give the whole movie away in the trailers and TV commercials? What could possibly have been the point? To get us to see it? I didn't need that. I was going to see it after viewing the first trailer months ago...you know the one where he lands on the island and yells ""Hello,...anybody!!"" and then it fades to black. That's all I needed. I was hooked right there. Yeah, Tom Hanks was great. Yeah, it was a good story, so what.<br/><br/>My whole experience of this movie was a big let down, because I knew what was going to happen. I'm sure others who say they didn't really enjoy the movie are feeling the disappointment stemming from this knowledge, as well. The only thing I didn't know for sure was what was going to happen after he got back to civilization...but I had a pretty good idea, and I was right, which was another disappointment. Predictability kills a movie for me. I don't want to know what's going to happen before I see it, and I certainly don't want the whole movie laid out for me in the trailer, as this one was...ridiculous.<br/><br/>I still can't believe it. If you've seen all the trailers for this movie, as I did, there was really no reason to see the movie in the theatre...because you've already seen it, in condensed form. Of course, by just seeing the trailers you don't get the full range and impact of emotion and the subtle nuances that drive the plot forward, and of course you miss the cinematography that makes the movie great to look at, as well as the remarkable physical transformation of Tom Hanks' character, but if you want to know what this movie is all about, and I do mean ""all about"", then the trailers are all you need.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for something to happen...some twist in the plot. Maybe he would come back and be unable to re-acclimate himself to civilization, or something...anything. But from the moment he came back, the movie sank into dismal predictability, heart-wrenching, yes, but predictable, just the same.<br/><br/>This seems to be a nasty trend in trailers, lately. Perhaps the rationale is the more they show in the trailer, the more will come to see the movie. Faulty logic, if you ask me. Once you have the fish on the hook, you don't keep throwing bait at it."

","When I first heard that Cast Away was about some guy who was stuck on an island for four years, I thought ""Yah, that's sounds REAL exciting *sarcastic*"" Then, I started to think ""Well, Tom hanks is in it, how bad could it be?"" So, I went to see it, and I was totally blown away. You know you've seen a great movie when you can't stop thinking about it for weeks after you've left the theater.<br/><br/>I still get tears in my eyes thinking about Chuck's will to survive in Cast Away. I can not even begin to fathom four years on an island - ALONE. I mean, this guy's only companion for four whole years is a volleyball. I think I'd forget how to speak English after that long there, but Chuck never loses his will to survive, and makes do with what he has. His memories of Kelly keep him alive, and like he says afterward, he just kept on breathing, kept on living. SPOILERS ALERT Three particularly striking moments in the movie were when he lost Wilson, when he said that he had lost Kelly when the plane crashed, then he had to lose her all over again when he was saved, and third, when he made fire. HE felt like the greatest man alive, and perhaps he was at the moment, or for the next four years.<br/><br/>Chuck loved his volleyball, it was his buddy, he talked to it, he argued with it, discussed with it, and then mourned over his losing it. Although he seems to lose so much in the movie, he has gained a much deeper understanding of himself and is in better touch with his soul and spirit. He has endured just about as much as anyone can, and lives though it.<br/><br/>The audience obviously finds itself wanting Chuck and Kelly to get back together, and we weep with Chuck when we realize that it cannot happen.<br/><br/>Who else is still wondering what became of the Christmas present (presumably an engagement ring) that Chuck gave to Kelly the last time he saw her, just before he got on the plane?<br/><br/>I think that his time on the island could have been a little more drawn out, and his relationship with Kelly more developed, but all in all, this was one of the most touching films I have ever seen. Forrest Gump is first on that list.<br/><br/>I have so much admiration for Tom Hanks. You not only leave his movies thinking for weeks about the plot, but thinking about his characters, admiring them, dreaming about them, relating to them, loving them. I would so much love to be an actress like that, and I have yet to find a female actor that I can look up to in that way. Acting is what I love to do most, and I will strive to do it in the fashion that Tom Hanks does. If I ever make it to the big screen, even for a second, I pray that it is beside Tom Hanks.

","Cast Away is an interesting story that forces us to think.  There are many great shots and nicely crafted scenes in Cast Away, but what I think distinguishes it from most movies today is its willingness to show us a story rather than tell us what we should think and feel.  Although I would have liked to hear more of Hanks' own thought process, we're forced to look inward and see how Hanks' character parallels our life.  Following the movie we are forced to reflect how we would act if we were on the Island, what we would do if our only true love was lost for years only to reappear, and how relationships lived inside our heads are often perfect but rarely play out in reality.  These all happen here and Zemekis wisely enough doesn't show us how they should be resolved, but simply what happens to Hanks' character and how an everyday man copes with extraordinary circumstances both on and off a deserted island."

","Well...hours later and I still haven't come to a conclusion about ""Cast Away"". Though a lengthy movie, it drags only in the last scenes, uncertain about whether a ""happily ever after"" or a more ambiguous ending would be more suitable. In the end, the makers split the difference, not completely satisfactorily.<br/><br/>However, let's deal with the stuff on the island and leave the Hollywood bits (and the incredible FedEx product placement) aside. I was enthralled by the isolation and Tom Hanks' performance and wished that there was more of it. Lots of small revelations, very worthwhile.

","As always, Tom Hanks gives us a wonderful performance. It's really easy to enjoy spending time with him alone on an island talking to a volley ball, but I don't know what they were thinking with the book ends they stuck on the movie.<br/><br/>I guess it comes back to my lack of enthusiasm for Helen Hunt (she plays Hanks' love interest in the movie)... or maybe just that things happen kind of fast. First we're in Russia and we see that Hanks is an enthusiastic Fedex employee. Then he's home for Christmas, then he's on a plane, then he crashes, then it's four years later, he escapes the island and next thing you know he's sitting on a plane going home to Memphis. And what's the point of making him grow that awesome beard when he shaves it off as soon as he gets back to the motherland?<br/><br/>I will say however that it's a good movie in that you barely notice that it lasts 2 1/2 hours, but it could have been so much better (I know it's easy to criticize, but keep in mind that I always extend props to those who work on features. It's a lot of work and they do it well). And please, stop casting Helen Hunt, she really ruins movies for me."

","Whew!  What a film.  I just got back from seeing ""Cast Away"", and I'm not quite able to put into words what I'm feeling right now.  Suffice it to say that it was probably the most uniquely engaging film experience I have ever had at the movies.  I never thought that a film with such a scarcity of dialogue through the central portion of the film could provoke such an emotional response from me, but this film pays off in buckets.  When Tom Hanks' character felt pain, I felt it.  When he experienced jubilation, I was right there with him.  Additionally, the absence of a soundtrack score through a lot of the film enhances the experience that the main character goes through, and this minimalist approach forces the audience to focus on the bare essentials just as he does.<br/><br/>There seemed to be 3 distinct movements to the film, and the final movement I think might have been the most poignant, all due to the previous sections of the film.  Without giving anything away, just know that when the final scene fades you feel a subtle elation that things turned out the way they did.  <br/><br/>Also, the scene in the airplane earlier in the film treats you as if you're a passenger.  Hanks' character never really knows what is happening or why it is happening, only that something is horribly wrong.  Again, no music on the soundtrack, no additional dramatic flair, just a harrowing experience of the sort that I continue to fear whenever I have to fly somewhere.  (On reflection, this scene probably wasn't good for me, and I hope I conveniently forget it!)<br/><br/>This film did not evoke too many tears for me during the actual duration of it (although it had some very real moments that I can't forget), but what it did do was leave me sorting out the details long after it was over.  If a movie can do that, it was more than worth the price of a ticket. This one does, and is."

If you've seen a commercial or a trailer for Cast Away, you basically know everything that happens, including the ending.  This ass-backwards marketing campaign almost ruined what could have been an incredibly suspenseful and absorbing film, but Cast Away is still to be appreciated for the tremendous performance of Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx manager who is so devoted to his job that he spends Christmas not with his fiancee Kelly (Helen Hunt), but on a cargo plane flying over the South Pacific.  The plane crashes, and Chuck washes up on a deserted island as the sole survivor.  The scenes on the island are fascinating, because director Robert Zemeckis and writer William Broyles never cheat the premise.  This is not Swiss Family Robinson, with an elaborate treehouse and monkey butlers; Chuck has only his ingenuity and the contents of a few washed-up FedEx packages to rely on.  To further create the feeling of isolation, Zemeckis includes very little music, and the only dialogue is between Chuck and ""Wilson"" (a volleyball found in one of the packages).  Wilson, in fact, deserves a place as one of the most memorable inanimate objects in film history, alongside Rosebud the sled, the Red Ryder BB gun from A Christmas Story, and Keanu Reeves.   <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is basically asked to carry the film by himself, since if the audience doesn't care about Chuck, they won't care about the movie.  The key to the performance is that Hanks takes it completely seriously; when he is trying to start a fire, you can see the intensity and desperation in his eyes as he rubs the sticks together.  When he finally gets a flame going, he dances in joy and sings an endearingly off-key version of ""Light My Fire"" by the Doors.  The audience identifies with Chuck as an average (if very smart) Joe.  It is no secret that Hanks is a talented actor, but his performance in Cast Away is a step beyond anything that he has done before; he may well win his third Oscar for the role.<br/><br/>The scenes on the island are so good, in fact, that the final act of the film is anti-climactic.  I won't spoil the ending, even though the studio did it themselves, but Zemeckis gets a little too arty for his own good.  Though the point of the final scene seems to be that life goes on, there should still be come kind of finality to the movie.<br/><br/>
Since the ending is common knowledge, Cast Away becomes more like a James Bond movie; you know that Bond is going to win in the end, it's just a matter of how he does it.  Hanks and Zemeckis do such a good job of building suspense, however, it's a shame to see the film reduced to a formula.   <br/><br/>

","Cast Away is sure to nab another Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks, and in a relatively weak year for film he may just win his third.  He would deserve it, and not just for his physical transformation.  Any other actor in the world would get laughs if they recited the dopey dialogue (or monologue, I guess, since he's alone on that island).  I can't imagine Ralph Finnes being taken seriously if he proclaimed ""I have made . . .fire!"" but Hanks somehow pulls it off.<br/><br/>You may be aware that the studio moronically gives away the ending in the trailers and commercials--it is inexcusable and blunts much of the emotion of the situation.  This is a solid film with a fascinating second and third acts, but a flat-footed fourth act.  They paint themselves into a corner with no satisfactory ending, and then fail to come up with a satisfactory conclusion.  But with Hanks' acting and Zemeckis' eye-popping direction, this film is very satisfying."

","Tom Hanks once again proves his superior acting abilities as he holds the audience's attention for the movies entire length.  From Moscow to the remote pacific island the audience was engulfed with truly powerful settings and human emotions.  The only question that was left in the audience's mind was, ""What was in the Fedex box?"".  I believe that the ending would have been better served with a bit more finality.   However, I feel it was a bit too open.  I would have liked more of a climatic ending.

"movieman-46","10","0","0","24 December 2000"," An amazing experience.
","The best way to describe ""Cast Away"" is that it isn't a movie, it's an experience.  It seems like so much more than just a movie, it is almost like you are living on the island with Tom Hanks.  For the duration of the film I found myself totally lost in it. I was also a cast away.<br/><br/>There are a few films which are able to have just one brilliant moment in the whole picture.  ""Cast Away"" contains several, if not the entire movie itself.  The plane crash is one of the most intense scenes in recent memory, and rivals anything in ""The Perfect Storm."" The scenes where Chuck (Hanks) is trying to make a fire have a desperation and perseverance that accompany them.  The raft scenes are also outstanding and incredibly suspenseful.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Cast Away"" is no doubt Tom Hanks.  I have never seen an actor carry a film on his shoulders like Hanks does.  The majority of the film is Hanks, and only Hanks.  It takes an amazing performance to pull something like that off, and he delivers.  His emotional state throughout his time on the island changes, and he doesn't have to say anything.  It's all in the eyes and the body language.  Tom Hanks may not beat Russell Crowe for best actor, but a nomination is assured.<br/><br/>The mastermind behind ""Cast Away"" is none other than Robert Zemeckis.  He directs with patience and maturity.  He allows Hanks the breathing room to make the tedious island scenes work.  I have not seen editing this effective since ""JFK.""  He delivers a movie with a lot of suspense and drama.  The film's end is one of the best I've ever seen, and really is appropriate.<br/><br/>Go to the theater and experience ""Cast Away.""  Remember to bring your beach towel and sun block."

"TRegner","Null","0","0","4 January 2001"," Good, but Disappointing
","What saves this film is good acting. There is no real plot, very little dialog, and the story depends entirely on our ability to believe Hanks's character. <br/><br/>I've heard and read a lot about the ending being disappointing, but little as to why. The reason has to do with the fact that they telegraph the ending near the beginning, when Hanks decides not to open a particular FedEx package because of the hand-drawn design on the outside. That in itself, for me, was extremely hard to swallow. A man or woman fighting for survival will use ANY means, and so many of the other packages (virtually every one of them) had something he could use. <br/><br/>And so, I ask myself, why are we left to wonder at the end what was in the package? Has the screenwriter no sense of irony? Are we supposed to believe that a pair of wings drawn on a package represent some sort of guardian angel metaphor? Thin. VERY thin. <br/><br/>It it weren't for Hanks (and yes, Hunt, whose smallish part was just as brilliant as Hanks's) bringing sheer brute-strength acting skills so this film, it would have little to recommend it. <br/><br/>The fact that I was disappointed by an ending they revealed so early in the film is why I couldn't give it a high rating. Filmmaking, after all, is about story telling, not just about acting. The story suffered, and so by extension, so did the movie. <br/><br/>In summary, I found it, overall, to be emotionally unsatisfying.<br/><br/>-- TRegner"

","This was a very satisfying movie, and Tom Hanks once again shows that he is a fine choice for serious treatments of characters who are alone/isolated one way or another. I should mention that my comments wil l focus on several plot points, so SPOILER ALERT! (as if the trailers left much out.)<br/><br/>The Setup: The movie takes planty of time to show that Hanks character is a type-A go-getter, always zipping around the world, no time for anything, addicted to his cell phone and pager. This makes the isolation and barren local of the island (good for the producers that they found a truely tiny one, as made clear from Hanks first peek from the summit) a perfect contrast. Some other user comments complained that there was not enough 'action' in the film, but teenagers apparently miss concept that it is the boredom and isolation that is the whole point. The interest comes from how he will use his native resourcefulness to cope.<br/><br/>The Crash: there were two aircraft disasters, the storm and the explosion, and that one would have been sufficient. Obviously, the storm is required so that the crash will take place far away from where the searchers will eventually look. The explosion is required so that the plane crashes. The storm cannot account for the crash since the pilots have gone around the worst of it, as they would really do, and this film is trying to be realistic. Same with the explosion...these things DO happen, as we know from ValueJet! The crash seems pretty realistic, and the floating pieces or wreckage are consistant with real plane ditchings. My only beef is that the jet engine would almost certainly NOT still be running.<br/><br/>The Homelife: Some have complained that the happenings back home are not shown concurrently with Hank's island vacation. The movie does it right...Hanks is the character we see the film through, and he obviously has no idea whats going on elsewhere. We find things out when he does...once again, realistic.<br/><br/>The Unopened Package: Beside setting up the final scene, this makes some kind of sense for Hanks to leave at least one FedEx parcel alone. His whole personality is based on getting packages to their owners in a speedy and reliable manner. It was clear to me from the situation and setup of the scene that Hanks views the final package as a reason to survive. He needs to get at least one through in the end. Also, pay close attention to the scene in the beginning where the package from Texas is delivered to an obvious American in Moscow, who is cheating on his wife. Pay close attention at the end where Hanks arrives to deliver the unopened package... notice the change in the sign at the ranch. There is really very little left to doubt here.<br/><br/>The Fed Ex Placement: According to articles, the producers wanted authenticity and a sense of reality for their film. They felt that they needed a real cargo carrier, not a made-up one. UPS said no, they don't like people thinking about packages lost in a crash. FedEx said yes, but was reportedly not paid for this nor did they pay the producers. This does not then qualify as the usual product placement that Hollywood indulges in.<br/><br/>Overall, a well thoughout and realized movie for serious viewers."

","Everyone I saw this with, our group and the rest of the theater, was enthralled.  This isn't a movie that spoon-feeds all its meaning to you, you have to pay attention and think.<br/><br/>Hanks's does an amazing portrayal: from shock, to determination to escape, to frustration, desolation, fear, through despair, a kind of reversion to primitive nature, and bare grip on the edge of sanity (from isolation). The movie really explores issues of humanity, community and human need, without preaching it. It's why I liked Saving Private Ryan better than The Thin Red Line. 'Ryan' had every bit as much to say about war and its effects, but let you figure it out.  I would have to disagree with some comments, such as that Hanks should have had time to enjoy the natural wonders--not when mere survival is your full-time, every waking minute job, and nature can easily be the enemy. Also, Hanks does explore as much as is physically possible, you see everything he can see from that summit, and there is only one beach. I think the intensity comes from the whole movie (except first few minutes) being entirely from his vantage point; I would not have wanted to see what was going on 'back home'.  I also can't imagine why there ever would have been any other human on this volcanic outcropping hundreds of miles from nowhere, so I'm not sure what good a skeleton in the cave would have done.<br/><br/>SPOILER REBUTTAL AND COMMENT It was not the view of any in our group that he replaced Hunt with the redhead.  He was at the last looking down a different road, the one toward California.  The ending didn't *feel* satisfying, but I can't say it was *unsatisfactory*.  Hunt was ambivalent about commitment at the beginning, and still ambivalent at the end. She was consistent in that way.  Hanks was, in a way, still adrift; only knowing that the sun will rise tomorrow."

","We take our lives for granted.  It may be normal and ordinary for us to use the instruments of necessities.  The 21st century man and woman have molded with technology to survive.  But what if all of the daily use of equipment is taken away from you, would you survive?  With Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) he has to escape the modern technology world and survive with very little in the new film, CAST AWAY. Chuck Noland is a Fed Ex employee who has very little time, he dictates some Russians on how speed does make a difference when it comes to delivering a package.  Anc Chuck doesn't even have much time to spend the Christmas holiday with his love, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) since Chuck has to go overseas to help aid another Fed Ex station.  On route back to the U.S., over the south Pacific the jumbo Fed Ex cargo plane crashes killing the all of the crew and nearly killing Chuck.  Chuck then arrives on a deserted island, realizing that a man who was rushing with time, now has all the time in the world as he is isolated from civilization.  Chuck has to find ways to survive, he writes on a giant boulder with a smaller stone, he spears fishes with a sharp bamboo stick, and it is almost a miracle when he starts a fire.  With some Fed Ex boxes from the crash arriving on shore, Chuck makes the best use of them. He uses video tape for rope, a garment for a fishing net, and for companionship to keep his sanity he uses a volleyball as a head and names the ball ""Wilson."" I predicted back in July that CAST AWAY was going to be the better Robert Zemeckis film compared to WHAT LIES BENEATH (don't believe me, check out my WHAT LIES BENEATH review).  And several months later I was right, CAST AWAY was far much better than WHAT LIES.  I really enjoyed the symbolism of CAST AWAY, how can modern man survive in the wild. Zemeckis goes into much detail on how difficult it took the character of Chuck Noland to survive, with eating, shelter, and sanity. Zemeckis also shows some pretty graphic scenes on how Nick gets rid of a bad tooth. The movie is 138 minutes, and a little over a hour has Hanks alone on the island.  And to carry a movie like this, a great actor needs to do a excellent performance, and Tom Hanks does it very well!  Leave it to Tom Hanks to give another brillant performance in this film, which I feel should probably be his third Oscar win.  Along with PHILADELPHIA, FORREST GUMP, BIG, APOLLO 13, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the role of Chuck Noland is a memorable performance in Hanks' career.  Hanks adds humor, sadness, and pain as the role of the sole survivor who goes through a adventure to survive. And what a adventure!  There are plenty of exciting scenes to keep any viewer's attention through out the entire movie.  I would like to see Kelly, Rudy, and Richard from t.v.'s ""Survivor"" to have the same necessities that Chuck has in the film to survive the island for about five years. The only flaw is that there are some scenes that have the adventures similar to a thrill ride, but there are some very slow scenes here and there. But why bicker?  CAST AWAY is easily one of the best films of 2000, and another excellent film to add to the impressive list of Tom Hanks' career.  Just like FORREST GUMP, the partnership of Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks would deliver a great film, and CAST AWAY is another film that delivers.  Don't miss it!  ***** (out of five)"

To ignorant people like these, I suppose Wilson was just a volleyball, not an object to represent Chuck's rational side and will-power survive on the island.  His drifting away signaled that Chuck no longer needed him; he had fought on and now he was to be rescued.  Many griped that Chuck should have opened the winged package.  Why?  Here was his FedEx instincts at work and his commitment to never turn his back on time. Who cares what was inside?!  Anyway, I could go on forever about all the symbolism in this movie, but I'll give that a rest.<br/><br/>Everything in Cast Away was superb: the acting, the script, the awesome cinematography, and of course, Bob Zemeckis's wonderful direction.

"mercury-26","10","0","0","3 January 2001"," The return of the silent film (sort of)
","Warning: this may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>If you watch the current trailer for ""Cast Away,"" you might go in expecting this Indiana Jones-style exotic action/adventure film. Dreamworks is selling something they're not delivering on, which is a mistake. No matter how good the film is, many viewers are going to feel duped. I didn't. Yes, it moved slower than I thought it would. That's only because I've come to expect differently from a major studio. Films that seem to have a lot at stake tend to worry too much about the audience feeling things like bored and impatient. The result is a rushed story that ends up disappointing anyway.<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" actually trusts its audience. That's why at the end I really felt like applauding. I'd just been shown something great and meaningful. Except, to my surprise, no one else clapped (I am by nature shy, so I let the opportunity pass). I can't say I blame anyone either. There is so much bad filmmaking out there and people see so many films, so when a film of true quality surfaces, people don't recognize it. Quality work is so rare, it becomes unfamiliar. What this means is that ""Cast Away"" probably won't be a huge success, unfortunately. Why? Well, because it's (gulp) too good.<br/><br/>I've read that the concept was Tom Hanks' idea, who produces and plays Chuck Noland, the film's subject. But the greatness of this movie really begins with its script, by William Broyles. I certainly hope enough people in the Academy will recognize this. Probably not, because it's not flashy. It doesn't contain a lot of great dialogue. It isn't really even that clever. But Broyles does the most difficult thing a writer has to do, which is, tell a story that doesn't need words. I'm waiting for the day a director makes a silent movie that a major distributor takes a chance on. The motion picture medium was created without spoken words in mind. ""Cast Away"" could be a Christmas present to the hearing impaired. I believe they would see the exact same story as anyone else, with no subtitles.  The words Broyles does write are great. They do what they're supposed to do: stay out of the way.<br/><br/>Many people who see this will wonder what happened to the score. There is one somewhere, but it doesn't show up very often. For good reason, director Robert Zemeckis (who's managed to make both one of the year's worst films, ""What Lies Beneath,"" and one of the year's best), uses music sparingly. The lack of music, especially during the island portion of the film, is just as effective as the best John Williams composition would have been. For this entire island portion of the film, interrupted only briefly when Chuck sets sail on his raft of tree branches, all we hear are the natural sounds of the island and one man's voice.<br/><br/>Hanks has already won two Oscars. Now he's grown even further as an actor. This is such a huge role. I mean, the guy IS the movie.  The odds of him not winning a third Oscar are slim (no pun intended). True, the most demanding portion of the role is spent talking to a volleyball named Wilson. This is one part of the film that really sticks with you, the image of a face painted in blood on a piece of sports equipment. For four-odd years, Chuck is able to keep his body alive through sheer human ingenuity. But it won't mean a thing if his mind doesn't survive as well. That's why he creates Wilson. Many viewers will think Chuck is going insane. On the contrary, it's merely survival. It may be the most powerful performance by an inanimate object ever.<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" makes you think about a lot of things. Chuck's life before he was stranded on the island was controlled by time and technology. He has so little time, he uses things like pagers and cell phones just to keep his relationships alive. He's also a trainer for Fed Ex so, as with most of today's professions, he relies heavily on the advances in technology that human beings have made. When we watch him find ways to survive upon being stranded and completely isolated, it's only then we see what a human being is truly capable of. THIS is how far we've come as a species. It's a not-so-subtle point the film makes very well.<br/><br/>The most important thing that the film has to teach is so great. That thing is this: sometimes the only way to know what you're really living for is to have everything taken away. Only then will you know what you want returned to you. All Chuck wants back is his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt). When Chuck returns to find that the world has moved on without him, that the love of his life has moved on without him, the true test of survival begins. Chuck is now a phantom. He wonders if he even has a place in the world anymore. But how many of us feel that way without the benefit of being stranded on a tropical island alone for four years?<br/><br/>And there it is. Extraordinary. (applause)<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Very good film and very surprising that Hollywood chose to challenge the viewer so much.  This is definitely a film that makes you think ... it sure doesn't present everything up front for the 'lowest common denominator' movie goer as most films do.<br/><br/>I was amazed in reading the comments on this Db that nobody pointed out how much Hanks'character's experience on the island mirrored the centuries of experience of ancient man in the Pacific.  The learning to create fire, the way to get fresh water, eventual speech (notice how long on the island Hanks doesn't speak ... only when some of his most basic needs have been met does he move up Maslow's hierarchy), and the creation of his own idol/god in Wilson.  His own life depending upon fate and the whim of the tides.  The story is that of the evolution of man.<br/><br/>Moreover, take his time on the island and compare it to what he had before he got on that plane.  Juxtapose the two and I think the movie makes a strong comment on how far we've come standing on the shoulders of millions of years of evolution.  We've forgotten how we got here and the movie attempts to remind us.  We're so far into self actualization that we'd all be lost if all our 'stuff' was taken away.<br/><br/>The love story that continues long after the film ends (which is left up to us to create) could be the greatest present this film offers.  Helen Hunt's character isn't developed because the viewer isn't supposed to grow too attached to her.

"abooboo-2","10","0","0","27 December 2000"," Superbly Made (SPOILERS!!!)
","Ordinarily I don't post comment on widely seen films (not that anyone's been holding their breath) because the many reviews that do get posted for the most part accurately and astutely convey the film's quality (or lack thereof). There's really nothing to add that hasn't been said. But scanning over the early comments on ""Cast Away"", I'm amazed at the number of critics that are misinterpreting and overanalyzing this straightforward and excellent film. I'm sure that many of these folks are far more intelligent and perceptive than I am, but I do feel compelled to contribute an alternative point of view.<br/><br/>""Cast away"" is a consistently gripping, tremendously satisfying, old-fashioned tribute to the resiliency of the human spirit, performed and directed with great skill and commitment by three of the brightest talents Hollywood has to offer: Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt and Robert Zemeckis. Reading the criticisms I'm reminded of the man who complains that the square isn't enough like a circle, and that the circle should be more triangle-like. This is a quietly powerful story about love, loss and hope - timeless themes that will always resonate. Don't over-think it, don't read more into it than is there. Don't be like the researcher last week who ludicrously attacked the prevalence of snowmen (as opposed to snow-women) on holiday greeting cards.<br/><br/>Some of the criticisms assert that nothing interesting happens in the middle section of the film. Oh yeah, nothing happens all right. Tom Hanks' workaholic every-man only gets stranded on a deserted island after a harrowing plane wreck, and has to figure out a way to keep himself fed, clothed, sheltered and sane. Not much at all. For the uninitiated, this is what is known as compelling subject matter. No tricks or gimmicks are necessary; just a great actor and director going to work. The audience is right there with Hanks as he experiences each thrilling victory (breaking coconuts open without spilling the precious liquid inside, starting a fire, extracting a rotting tooth) and agonizing setback, realizing of course that the man's very survival hinges on these heretofore mundane tasks. This is man vs. nature and man vs. himself, not man vs. ""routine adversary borrowed from a thousand other films"". Those hoping for Hanks to stumble upon thieving pirates, bloodthirsty natives or a top secret military base will no doubt be disappointed. Might I advise renting that classic ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" instead.<br/><br/>I've read that there is too little sense of Hanks being transformed by the experience, that one doesn't see him fully exploring and exploiting the benefits of isolation as well as the rest of the island. Please. We see a man who, in his job as a Federal Express courier (and spare me the product placement complaints - this is a movie set in the real world, he works for just such a company - it's unavoidable, get over it) is a slave to time and deadlines. As the overnight packages from the plane wreck silently wash ashore, he quickly recognizes the cruel irony and humor in his predicament. This is not someone with an artistic temperament who is going to stare at the stars, scrawl bad poetry in the sand with a broken stick and befriend a bunch of animals.<br/><br/>Here is a guy who we've seen as a decidedly social creature abruptly deprived of the companionship of friends, family, co-workers, customers, clients, competitors and especially the girlfriend he deeply loves. The only thing that keeps him going is the slender hope that some day he will get off the island and see those people again. So while of course the harshness of his new environment dramatically changes external characteristics, internal, non-visible ones for the most part stay the same. Significantly, however, he does adapt and then apply the survival skills he's developed over the years to achieve his goal of getting off the island. That dream never dies. No amount of months or years stranded there is going to snuff out that desire. If anything it would logically sharpen and hone it until it becomes an instrument for its realization.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***<br/><br/>For those who contend that there's too little impact when he does finally make it off the island, I point to the beautifully understated shots of Hanks (and this is after an exhilarating sequence where he braves the giant tides on his makeshift raft) simply looking back at the massive formation in all its stubborn splendor. The shot says it all: for better or worse this was his home for four years (chosen because it's the same length of time that it takes to get a college degree?). It won't be forgotten.<br/><br/>Zemeckis has been criticized for choosing not to focus on Hanks' readjustment to civilization, that it all seems too cut and dried and that again, he seems barely changed. But this is where an appreciation for the art of subtlety comes in right handy. Hanks is changed. He moves slower, talks slower, thinks before he speaks, considers his words. He's taking things in, reabsorbing the world from a whole new perspective. There is no need, especially so late in the story, to show him shaving his scraggly beard, re-learning how to eat with utensils, wearing real clothes and so on. That's been done. The focus is where it should be (and it's always been sort of a parallel, unspoken narrative throughout): on his now deeply problematic reunion with Helen Hunt, the woman he loves who, thinking he had died, has married and become a mother.<br/><br/>And this is where I must really take issue with the many complaints of those who say the resolution of this affair is an indecisive letdown. In fact, Zemeckis has supplied the kind of scene actors dream about and Hanks and Hunt, who have a rare and believable chemistry, nail it. The director stands back and lets the couple feel their way through the minefield of emotions they're experiencing in what is a psychologically and emotionally convincing encounter that is as moving as anything Hollywood has produced in years. Is it sentimental? Sure, but there is a place for sentimentality in movies, as long as it's earned. What makes it work here is the way both Hanks' and Hunt's characters fight it and struggle against it, but ultimately it's no use. Newsflash: Human Beings Are Often Sentimental. In a movie like this, the audience, as well as the characters, deserve that moment where the music swells and the tears flow. It's the only appropriate payoff for what's transpired and it's all beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>The closing scene has also been misunderstood. The pretty woman in the truck is not the equivalent of Helen Hunt or some tidy replacement. The film's major theme is that just as fate dealt Hanks a major blow by stranding him on the island, and he survived, he is also capable of surviving the even crueler blow of losing the love of his life due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. The girl in the truck represents a possibility among many, visually conveyed in the closing shot where Hanks is standing in the middle of an intersection with all roads stretching off into the distance. As an adult, he has done the SELFLESS thing rather than the SELFISH, in letting Hunt go, as painful as it is. All he can do now is hang in there and hope the next day's tide will wash up something worthwhile.<br/><br/>This is a tragic love story, superbly made. All those who want their squares to be more like triangles, by all means see something else."

","Well, Tom Hanks does it again.  He turns in a splendid performance that may very well earn him another Oscar.  I'm not sold on that the film is ""Oscar worthy"" but worse performances and films have won before.  Expect his popularity to help him to another victory.<br/><br/>Following the outstanding plane crash sequence -- which my wife leaned over to say ""Wow!"" -- Zemekis and crew do a great job.  Tom, as Chuck Noland, flounders through the beginnings of abandonment and provides with a laugh here and there.  One minute I'm ready to scream out ""Use the belt"", the next, I'm giggling at his cave scribble.<br/><br/>Even his physical transformation was amazing and I wish I had never seen the trailer, for this gave away too much information.  It's during this sequence, ""Four years later"", that Hanks reaches that performance excellence which is similar to ""Philadelphia.""  Absolutely great.<br/><br/>
Lastly, the film really hit the home run ball when it didn't try to spoonfeed me an ending.  Just like Tom's character, we are struggling to know how to feel.  The comments I've read say that the writer didn't know how to end the film and they felt slighted by the ending. I disagree and ""get"" the ending.<br/><br/>So, in closing, ""continue to breathe and see what the tide brings in."""

","I went to see Cast Away not knowing what to expect. There were many things that were said about the film that made me apprehensive about going to see it. People told me the film was boring and that there was not much dialogue. True, there is not much dialogue, but if you think about it, why would there be. He is stuck on an island by himself. The things that make this film interesting is the sheer fact that you feel as if you were there with you. I don't believe that the title refers to him as a ""Castaway"" on an island, but in fact ""Cast Away"" from the world and his friends and family. Tom Hanks is remarkable in this role. If he does not win an Academy Award for this role then there will be many upset people out there. Something that made this movie feel all the more intense is the fact that there is no music. All you hear are the waves, the wind, and the coconuts falling. It makes you feel like you are truly out on the edge of the world alone with nothing except some rocks and an old soccer ball named, Wilson. Cast Away is a an exceptional movie experience like none other.

Hanks' character is stranded on a deserted isle and we experience his efforts to survive. This portion of the film IS interesting, but I thought it went on too long.<br/><br/>Now what follows may spoil the outcome, something the trailers (in uncharacteristic fashion) have not. The most intriguing portion of the film is the last third, when Hanks' character returns to modern society and then is forced to confront being cast away (two words). This is the portion of the film where we really begin to empathize with the main character. Most of us have not had to face nature one-on-one, but all of us have had to face some form of rejection, or being cast away. Zemekis could have made a truly Oscar caliber movie (though I don't doubt that this will receive a nomination) if he had focused on this all too human experience, rather than the intricacies of raft construction."

"unscathedicarus","9","0","0","23 December 2000"," Paradoxical and Beautiful Filmmaking
","As I left the theater after seeing Cast Away, I had a strange mixture of emotion in my mind. Perhaps this was due to the disappointing quasi-Hollywood ending that followed the terrible yet surreal ordeal of a man who grasps at hope of escape from the island he has been physically imprisoned on after a plane crash. But I have a feeling that Robert Zemeckis, an accomplished and innovative director, inserts this incredulity for a purpose. And the more I consider it, this weakness complements its powerful central segment in which actor Tom Hanks grapples with the forces of Nature. Upon his return to civilization, he finds that his former life dissipated and thus the audience's hollowness resulting from the film's frail ending analogously parallels the protagonist's tumultuous emotions and uncertainty about how to proceed. I recommend Cast Away because it is a wonderful film in many respects; these achievements far outweigh any regrets about its finale. The lavish photography of Tom Hank's solitary struggle against his island prison and the beautiful yet harsh Pacific Ocean brings a humanitarian spirituality to the film. This brought me an appreciation for the seemingly petty elements of civilization that we frequently see and ignore (in a manner quite similar to American Beauty in my opinion). The hidden element of film of sound really contributes to Cast Away by pounding each and every wave that hits the protagonist's weak little raft deep into the audience's mind, expressing the brute power of the ocean wonderfully. And of course, the darkly humorous acting of Tom Hanks plays the key role, seeking to mask his desperation by introducing Wilson the volleyball, a ""character"" that he converses with freely. Enjoyable and intriguing, Cast Away has been quite possibly the best Hollywood film of the year, in my opinion."

I was disappointed the movie did not really deal with Hanks mental strain and scarring that no doubt would accompany living alone for 1500 days talking to a volleyball, and I was also disappointed with the movie's nonchalance of simply reinserting Hanks back into society after his 1500 days alone.

Nothing in a movie terrifies me, but I have to say that was about as terrifying a scene as you will ever see. The most amazing thing is that it held you in terror for what must have been 10 minutes.<br/><br/>There were a number of other times that the movie caused you to cringe in perceived pain. And, each time set a new standard. Half the audience hid their head and the other half closed their eyes. We all knew what was going to happen.<br/><br/>But, that aspect of the movie was only a part of the overall experience. It was also a powerful movie about the human spirit - about courage - about endurance. It is impossible to fully appreciate what it would have been like, but CAST AWAY did a pretty good job of helping us to imagine it.<br/><br/>Also, it was a rather moving love story as the Hanks character was in love with the Hunt character all the years he was stranded on the island. When they were reunited, it was truly one of the great scenes ever in movies. The conflict between desire and reality was extremely intense.<br/><br/>No pat endings, but definitely symbolism - and a sense of coming full circle. You felt sorry for him, but you also wish you could have the freedom that he obtained after he escaped the island. And, I don't mean just the freedom from being stranded. I mean the mental freedom of knowing who you are and knowing what is important."

","`Cast Away'     (2000)<br/><br/>** Â½ Out of ****<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reviewed by Matt Doolittle<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a movie about Chuck Nolan or was it Jack I don't know because different people call him different names. At one point he is Jack and the next he is Chuck.  Anyway he is married to his job and is about to get married to his girlfriend.  He is then called to South America for his job. He gets on a plane and later the plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean.  He is the only survivor and he floats on a raft until he finds an island.  The island has nothing on it except for the FED X packages from his plane.  He later opens them only to find a pair of ice skates, a volleyball and some other seemingly useless items.  He lives on the island for 5 years and goes somewhat insane until he figures out a way to get off.  By this time the volleyball is his best friend named Wilson and they talk to each other all of the time.  He makes it back to his home and he finds out that every one thinks he is dead.  Actually they have already had a funeral for him and everything, so he then has to decide how to start his life over.<br/><br/>	Although a funny movie it is pretty pointless.  The plane crash is no big surprise because he says goodbye so many times that you know something is going to go wrong.  Also there is no chemistry between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt, so their relationship is pretty unbelievable.  The volleyball is an attempt to be funny but just gets annoying after a while.  Over the period of Tom Hanks' stay on the island he seems pretty crazy but yet he knows exactly what day it is and he practically does Calculus in his head to achieve his plan to get off the island.  <br/><br/>	Tom Hanks does a good job with his role, but I was a little disappointed with Helen Hunt's character.  Although she does a good job with it, there is not much she can do.  She is supposed to be a main character, yet she has about 10 lines in the whole movie.  This movie is not horrible but is not great either, but if you are one of those people who like  happy medians, this is your show."

There was a major problem with it, however and that was the last half hour.<br/><br/>From the time he got onto the island, I was enthralled.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and it was simply beautiful.  His developing friendship with a volleyball named Wilson was brilliant and I loved how he coped and adapted to his surroundings. (the tooth scene was a real cringer).  Now, as the typical Hollywood market would suggest, he will, of course make it off the island, and the ""great escape"" was also astonishing - especially when he lost Wilson.<br/><br/>When the big tanker pulled up beside him, then it immediately cut to a scene with him in an airplane clean shaven with the words ""Four weeks later"", a voice inside my head was shouting ""Wait a minute!""  I desperately wanted to see what happened during those four weeks.  After four years on an island, how does he react to the first human contact?  How does he respond to a warm meal? An ice cube? A toilet?  WHAT HAPPENS?  Instead, it decides to focus on his relationship with Helen Hunt (typical Academy Award fluff), which I really couldn't care less about.<br/><br/>A local movie critic describes it best when he says that it was a fat juicy steak surrounded by bland pudding.  I really should have left after seeing ""Four weeks later"", because in my mind that is where the movie should have ended.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it 3.5 out of 4 stars.

""Cast Away"" is remarkable for its power to make you think about isolation away from everything you have. Isolation from your loved ones, human contact, and even the everyday things we all unknowingly take for granted. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Chuck Noland, a man so obsessed with not wasting time, that, ironically, his whole life is passing him by. Chuck is a troubleshooter for FedEx who has to check his schedule before he can even schedule family events or a date with his fiancee Kelly Frears (a sweet, affecting Helen Hunt). While on a Christmas Eve emergency trip to Malaysia to save a FedEx operation, Chuck's small plane crashes and leaves him stranded on an island in the South Pacific where his only companionship is a volleyball that washed ashore. Chuck's emotional and physical journey begins on that small island. Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances ever.

","Cast Away is not a fast paced movie. Rather, it is a picture blessed with delicate forms of pristine scenery and stunning environments, all which invite the camera to slowly creep through an array of long, extended takes. In this sense, the film invites the audience to revel in simple beauty, even when cast away to a remote island, in the middle of nowhere, in a desperate quest for survival.<br/><br/>Yet, the survival presented by the movie is not one reminiscent of Golding's Lord of the Flies. It is a different brand of individual exploration, in which a brilliantly prepared Hanks guides the audience on a dramatic journey from the high ground of establishment, to absolute desolation, and back up again...with several surprises on the way.<br/><br/>Again, this is a rather slow paced movie. But it absolutely hinges on the acting prowess of Hanks, who will keep you glued to the screen, as he illustrates a transcendence back to primal nature - struggling to adapt at the most basic level of existence.<br/><br/>In what is essentially a one-man performance, Hanks (with the obvious help of Zemekis' brilliant direction and Burgess' elegant cinematography) creates an uncanny relationship with a lush, tropical island. You will undoubtedly forget, nor be able to refute, the powerful, metaphoric similarities to the glaring realities of modern life that exist on this island. Not only do they prove to be dramatic, but charming and hilarious as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I should admit that no other group of filmmakers and actors could have made me so emotionally attached a volleyball!

And work it does; Hanks did a lot more than lose 50 pounds to make this a convincing performance - he reached the very core of the transformation from a human surviving in the information age to one that must survive on primal, animal instinct. He is so convincing that when he loses a completely inanimate object (a volleyball - his only companion throughout the mid-section of the movie), he moves the audience almost to tears.

Tom Hanks' character finds himself on a deserted island after a plane crash.  From then on he acts as a man with no brain.  Upon finding numerous FedEx packages washed up on shore, he stacks them up and opens them days later, including one that he NEVER opens!!!  Upon finding a flashlight, he sets it down, while on, and promptly falls asleep, letting the batteries burn out. Left with a small rubber raft, he takes it out into the obviously huge waves, puctures the raft and his leg in the process.  He does manage to produce fire, but is then seen four years later eating raw fish.  I guess the fire thing got old, huh?  After being on the island FOUR YEARS, he gets the idea to BUILD A BOAT.  Only four years to think of that.  Intertwined in all this is an ongoing conversation with a freaking VOLLEYBALL.  He finally builds the boat and gets out into the open sea.  He loses the volleyball and weeps uncontrollably, and then decides to throw away his oars and lay there and give up.  (Funny how the volleyball is everything, but those oars don't mean a whole lot.)

","*** POSSIBLE SPOILER REGARDING MOVIE SCORE***<br/><br/>Just coming back from seeing this movie on Christmas Day.  I think Tom Hanks has another Oscar nomination coming.  One of the most interesting things is that there is absolutely no movie score or other music for the first 75 minutes of a 143-minute film.  It works.  Music would get in the way.<br/><br/>Hanks is a FedEx ""motivator"" for problem offices.  The film opens with him telling Moscow workers that wasting time is a sin and unforgivable, all the while starting the official office timer which counts down the time remaining before the truck has to leave to take the packages to the airport. We also learn that Hanks one time stole (he claims ""borrowed"") a bicycle to get a package to its destination on time.<br/><br/>A trick he uses to pressure the employees is that he sends himself a package from Memphis, TN (his home and FedEx HQ) to Moscow.  It's a digital timer, running.  It shows 87+ hours lapsed.  Hanks yells at the employees that that is disgraceful.<br/><br/>It is ironic (and to me, very satisfying) that Mr. ""The World on Time"" not only gets his clock cleaned, but his world turned upside down and is cosmically told ""Here, make sense of THAT.""<br/><br/>The comic strip ""Sally Forth"" attributed to FedEx this trend (and corresponding time pressure) and called it ""artificial urgency"".  How many<br/><br/>things are done just in time (more accurately know as ""at the last minute"") not because it is necessary, but because the capability is there?   There are a few people I know--worshippers of ""just in time""-- who I think should be ""cast away"" as a lesson."

","First of all, let me register my agreement with nearly all of those who wrote before me in that Tom Hanks should and probably will win an Oscar for his performance here.  That aside, I feel very cheated in that the movie completely failed to show the viewer what they want to see: the transformation of Chuck Nolan over 4 years on an island.  The issue in this movie is not ""will he get off the island?"" for the trailers and previews and press releases have all told us that he spends four years there before being rescued.  Okay -- now that we know that, the real issue then becomes ""how does he transform himself over the course of those four years?""  How does he grapple with desparation, depression, loneliness, sickness, weather, hope, fear, spirituality.....the list goes on and on.  Certainly the movie need not go into every intrinsic detaila bout his life -- but the audience, I think, wants to SEE how he transforms himself -- not just be told, ""Four Years Later"".  That is lame!  All in all, even Hanks' stellar performance cannot save this film.  Too many questions, too many plot holes, too many ""huhs!?!?!"".  Thumbs down from me."

","Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks have teamed up again to bring us a thoroughly entertaining new film in `Cast Away'.  While `Cast Away' does not bring us the magic that `Forrest Gump' did, but in all honesty what really could, it does however show us the incredible range of actor Tom Hanks. It is hard to believe that this extraordinary actor got his start in such TV shows as `Bosom Buddies'.<br/><br/>Hanks in `Cast Away' spends much of the film alone so very little dialog is used, except in moments of frustration and brief `insanity' where he talks to his new best friend, Wilson, Hanks must rely on his actions to convey his emotions and he does this beautifully!  In scene after scene he had me believing & feeling for what he was going through.  Even in scenes that could have been ridiculous, i.e. risking his own well being for a volley ball, Hanks made me see the importance of saving this ball and pulled at the heart strings when he was unable to do so.<br/><br/>The movie itself falls short of a classic, with an unsatisfying ending and a wasted Helen Hunt as the girlfriend he left behind, but the real heart of this movie is Hanks and his fight to stay alive and that alone was worth every penny!"

","Although the last meeting between Chuck and Kelly was a bit manipulated and manipulative, their confrontation was essential for the underlying theme of the story: the film's title is ""Cast Away"", not castaway.  And this part of the plot does have psychological truth for anyone who has suffered a traumatic, life-altering loss or change: despite how overused the term is, there is a strong hunger for ""closure."" This is a very satisfying film , for its acting, direction and camera work, and for its ability to largely escape the usual, degrading interference of Hollywood."

","I went into this movie with very high expectations.  Reuniting Tom Hanks with his Forrest Gump (one of my all time favourite films) director should be a formula for a surefire success.  And it was. This movie far exceeded anything that I thought it could be, and the film's weight was carried in large part on Hanks' considerably slimmer shoulders.  <br/><br/>Tom Hanks' performance alone is reason enough to see this film.  I felt everything that his character felt, right along with him.  How he could create emotion of this magnitude while being on screen totally alone for more than half of the film's length speaks volumes for his talent as a performer.  He portrays all of his thoughts and feelings with very little dialogue while playing off nothing but a volleyball.  He moved me to tears on numerous occasions.  This is to say nothing of the rigorous weight loss program he must have gone through to lose the 50 lbs his character required - he is truly dedicated to his craft.  <br/><br/>The screenplay was very clever.  Once Hanks meets his fate and ends up marooned on the island, we are immersed solely in the events of his life. There is no music, very little dialogue and no other ""back at home"" scenes for us to see what has happened in the aftermath of his disappearance.  We see Hanks struggling to survive, all the while never losing sight of the one thing that will give him the strength to get off the island - Kelly, the love of his life.  <br/><br/>Hunt does well in her role as Hanks' love interest.  Even with her reduced screen time, she develops her character into someone that we can care about and empathize with.  <br/><br/>While many people have complained about the film's ending, I thought it was perfect.  (Possible spoiler)  It is nice to see that the screen writers didn't cop out and go for the unbelievable ""Hollywood-style"" fairy tale ending.  There is a real emotional dilemma, completely realistic, considering the circumstances.  Anything less would have been a great injustice to a perfect film.  <br/><br/>Another great success for Zemeckis and Hanks - kudos to all involved!"

In my opinion the best movie since Fight Club. A truly great story about the triumph of the human spirit.<br/><br/>This movie is seperated in to four acts. The first is the set-up, where Noland becomes a person to us, we know who he is and understand what his life is about. The second act is his first couple of months on the island, where he starts learning the key to survival with out modern tools or technology. The third act is him four years later where we find him the master of his domain, and his leaving on the raft. The fourth act is him when he returns home and finds things much different than they were before. We see that he feels like a Cast Away again because of what happens while he was gone.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is Noland while he is on the Island. Without any musical score, we feel isolated on this small island. We get to see him show what it could be like to really be stranded. My two favorite parts are 1. where he finds the dead man and buries him and 2. When he writes on the rock if anyone ever shows up there again. Truly great moments.<br/><br/>If I ran the Oscars, I'd say: Best Picture and Best Actor. But it won't happen.<br/><br/>BTW: Wilson Rules."
"Ranger-30","8","0","0","1 January 2001"," A New Stage In Film Making (Small spoiler included)
","When I heard that half the film is Tom Hanks staring left and right, not saying a word, I was somewhat sceptical. But what I discovered was not only a film with 3/4 of it devoted to a speechless Hanks, but also a new stage in film making all together. I'm not only talking about the silence and the reliance on facial expression, for a large part of the film, to convey Hanks's emotions in crucial scenes (things like that have been done before, the best example I can think of, being Das Boot and its focus on the desolation of silence within a crippled submarine and the focus on the faces of the sailors to help the audience understand the situation as it stood), but I'm also referring to the filmming in two halves. In the beginning the audience encounters a plump and jolly, upperclass Hanks. He's focussed, confident, and exudes an air of upper class ease. He then is stranded on the island and still seems quite out of place. He may be wearing tattered clothing and trying his hardest to become Robinson Crusoe, but it still seems that he is nothing more than a man torn away from the world he once trusted. But after the movie's split, when Hanks is reintroduced to us as a much thinner and naturally experiences man, the audience encounters a completely new situation. No longer is this the overweight executive that we knew from before, he instead has become a full fledged survivor, unlike anyone on that syndicated island that captured the hearts of America during the summer. We then see this new man put back into the world he once was part of and now he doesn't seem to fit in here. The audience is almost as uneasy seeing ""castaway"" Tom back in suburbia, as they were when ""executive"" Tom found himself on the island. It is amazing to have seen Tom Hanks completely transform his entire body and persona within a movie. This being said, I can't think of any other film where this happens so naturally. Hanks is a master, Zemeckis is fantastic, and the film is great."

","The TV spots really did give too much away, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>Despite this, the movie was quite solid. Hanks impressed me with his work on the island, watching his struggles and successes during the ultimate test of survival skills. The mood of the film was nice -- I appreciated the quiet diligence that surrounded all the mundane tasks Hanks had to master shortly after being stranded .... I felt immersed in the solitude Hanks' character was thrust into following the crash.<br/><br/>Not only did his behavior seem ""right,"" for lack of a better word, but his survival of the brutal plane crash (what a scene!) didn't seem too outlandish. His behavior upon returning to civilization was perfect, too -- the silent nods and gestures given to all the well-wishers who welcomed him back, the impression that he felt crowded -- can you tell I was impressed with his work?!<br/><br/>I will agree with the naysayers on one point: Hunt and Hanks have zero chemistry. The best part of their relationship seemed to take place when he was on the island and she was a still picture inside his watch. Well, OK, here's a second point: The ""I'll be right back"" line was .... ick. Why bother?<br/><br/>Amazing how well (and to such depth) a story can be told without much dialogue. My favorite segment of the movie started at the crash and lasted until the birth of Wilson. I connected with the feelings Hanks was trying to convey through his actions .... very satisfying!<br/><br/>I do wonder this: Did you or the people you watched this movie with laugh much during this movie? There was laughter in the theater that I felt was misplaced .... maybe I respected the film too much? Whatever. A good movie in a bad year, but not because it was a bad year. This movie would have held up in most years."
"Chasuk","Null","0","0","31 December 2000"," Boring & Trite
","I am not playing devil's advocate, but I cannot in good conscience read all of the hyperbolic praise for this movie without making a dissenting comment.<br/><br/>First, Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks is not an actor.  He is a star, perhaps a superstar, and a comforting presence (much like Harrison Ford).  I am not an actor, and yet I could have easily done as good a job portraying Forrest Gump as Hanks did.  Tom Hanks is appealing in every film in which he appears, I acknowledge.  However, I find myself suffering from a Hanks-allergy.  This is certainly my loss, but I find Hanks too cloying to endure.<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart frequently portrayed the same sort of character as Hanks, but Jimmy Stewart had more than one facial expression.  Tom Hanks, unfortunately, comes from the Clint Eastwood/John Wayne/Harrison Ford school of acting - which means no acting is required at all, but only looking into the camera and quoting your lines with virtually the same emphasis on every word.  Of course, I know that these stars have more talent than that, but not much more.<br/><br/>Second, Robert Zemeckis.  Has he really directed a good film since Back to the Future?  That film had a few surprises, but Cast Away had none.  Was anybody really surprised how it ended?  Was there a single element in the middle which surprised?  Indeed, if you took out the plane crash and the (admittedly humorous) roleplaying with the volleyball, was there anything about the film which even involved?<br/><br/>Helen Hunt was, well, Helen Hunt.  If you are a Helen Hunt fan, then you were probably pleased.  If you find her plain and uninteresting (as I do - although my father finds her hot), then she added nothing to the movie.<br/><br/>I have seen worse movies this year, but not many.  I hope that this review persuades a few people to spend their money on more worthy efforts - Before Night Fall, for example - and to reconsider the near-veneration that likeable, though not particularly talented, Tom Hanks inexplicably recieves."

","For FedEx manager Chuck Noland, played by Tom Hanks, time is everything. It's the unforgiving taskmaster that enforces order in his life, and adhering to that order, making sure packages get where they have to be when they have to be there, gives Chuck a sense of control -- a false sense, it turns out. It's not until his FedEx plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific, stranding him alone on a deserted island, that Chuck is forced to confront the difficult truth that we all are merely at the mercy of the ebb and flow of fate. <br/><br/>This involving examination of how a modern man, stripped of his pager and cell phone, might react if left to survive on his own in the wild comprises the premise of ""Cast Away"".<br/><br/>Being alone on screen for nearly an entire film would be an immense challenge for any actor, but Hanks proves he's more than up to the task. The actor also deserves extra kudos for his dedication. Production on the movie halted for a year while Hanks shed 55 pounds and grew a long beard for the movie's second half which takes place four years after he was originally stranded. Guys with two Academy Awards who make $25 million a picture don't have to do that sort of thing. Helen Hunt is also very good as the girlfriend Chuck leaves behind. <br/><br/>As bleak as Cast Away can be in its darker moments, the film does leave us with an uplifting message -- it's the philosophy that ultimately motivates Chuck to survive: One tide of fate may land you on a deserted island, but the next tide might just deliver you home."

I see no dramatic storyline, no depth of character, no development, only a captain's log of things the stranded fellow does to survive, none of which is even original apart from the dental operation (Don't try it at home) Imagine the great monologues the main character could have given in the depth of the Pacific night elaborating with newly gained wisdom like an Indian hermit.<br/><br/>Helen Hunt does a fine job creating a character though but the exhaustion of blowing life into the shallow script takes the better of her and she faints.

While Forrest Gump is a testament to how ridiculous the Academy Awards are, Castaway is a monolith marking the turning point where feature films become just a vehicle for product placement. Like the Daniel Defoe novel it was based on (the first novel in the English language) it is a homage to capitalism. The Puritan ideals of Robinson Crusoe, where man's worth in the world is determined by his wealth, is modernized in Castaway and gives us a glimpse of the worthlessness of American values and the films made there.

","CAST AWAY has an interesting start.  Tom Hanks can carry a romantic drama. But this movie is not a romantic drama.<br/><br/>Soon there is a jumbo jet plane crash in the Pacific Ocean.  The crash as depicted would truly splinter the aircraft and kill all, but anyway Tom survives.  Not only is he fully conscious and makes it to the surface of the water, but a lone jet engine remains high above water during the crash and begins to chase after Tom.  Tom escapes.<br/><br/>There is a special effects problem here.  When Tom first makes it to the surface and while he is being chased by the jet engine, the ocean has small white caps.  But then after Tom escapes from the jet engine, the ocean instantly has giant swells.  First the ocean waves are too small to reach the bottom of the jet engine, then next they are three times bigger than the engine.  There is no continuity. <br/><br/>Tom washes up on the shore of a small tropical island.  On the wide screen it might be fine, but on TV there is never a single shot showing the whole island.  The movie is spent on a beach always facing in the same direction. There is a strong sense that the ""island"" is only 180 degrees, and not 360 degrees around.<br/><br/>To be honest, if I were lost on a small tropical island, I know I would starve to death within a couple of weeks.  Still, any person would do their best to try to survive.  There are some obvious things any person would do.<br/><br/>A person would make a home base at a dry shaded location high enough to be far from big storm waves.  A person would take stock of everything they had. All man made items would be saved as being rare and precious.<br/><br/>In CAST AWAY, Tom Hanks digs a hole and puts the dead pilot inside with all of his cloths on, and then covers him.<br/><br/>In real life, most anyone would take the cloths off of the pilot and keep them because the clothing has high value.  Also, most men I think would use pieces of the dead pilot's body as bait for fishing.<br/><br/>In CAST AWAY, Tom completely wastes the batteries to his only flashlight, and in general he acts like his ""frantic guy"" character from his MONEY PIT movie.  Too often, Tom is in ""frantic guy"" mode but it is not funny enough to be a comedy.<br/><br/>The island portion of CAST AWAY does not ring true to life.  The unrealistic aspects make this movie very difficult to enjoy."

For a good ship wrecked movie try the original 1974 version of Swept Away (""Travolti da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto"") or if that's too heavy for you, just catch an episode of that classic microcosm ""Gilligan's Island"".

","I gave this movie a ""2"" only because Tom Hanks is superb.  Otherwise, this film has no redeeming features as far as I'm concerned.  It's one big yawn, and poorly written to boot.<br/><br/>One of the pivotal things that enables our hero to survive is that packages wash up with items he's able to use.  Yet he deliberately leaves one package unopened and at the end delivers it.  Aw, c'mon!  We're talking life-and-death here!  In the end he delivers the package to it's proper destination -- 'cuz that's what FedEx is all about, I guess.<br/><br/>The movie crawls along showing Hanks' adjustment to the island.  Some time passes -- we see he's started a beard, but his hair hasn't grown too much -- maybe two weeks?  Then, bam! four years have passed.  Now the first thing that crossed my mind when it was announced that he'd been there four years was, ""Why hasn't he committed suicide?""  Well, it crossed his mind, too and we hear him tell about it -- twice.  But we don't see it!  This crucial scene occurs off-camera!  Bad story-telling.  I'm not saying that we needed scenes of every day on the island, but some showing his adjustment and time passing would have been appropriate and made a smoother transition into the escape sequence."

"punchp","9","1","2","12 January 2019"," An awesome movie.
","A man stranded on a desert island has served as the premise for classic literature like Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson, and has even figured into the recent fad of wildly popular and intellectually barren TV shows like Survivor. In Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, it's two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks learning to crack coconuts and spear fish; he'll doubtless acquire another nomination for this intense work. Hanks has been stranded in outer space, behind enemy lines, and even in an evil toy store owner's office, but this performance, done with no other actors present during the majority of screen time, tops all the others, reaching the emotional level he acquired in his first Oscar-winning role, Philadelphia. If only his supporting cast measured up.
Cast Away, written by William Broyles Jr. (Apollo 13), is presented in three acts. The first section, which takes place in 1995, introduces us to Chuck Noland (Hanks), a Federal Express executive from Memphis whose job is to instill in his trainees his own slavish reverence for being on time. ""Never commit the sin of turning your back on time,"" he preaches. Although he loves his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) very dearly, he must leave her at Christmas for a business trip halfway around the world. As they quickly exchange gifts, she gives him a family heirloom pocket watch with a picture of herself inside the cover. ""I'll be right back,"" he says, kissing her goodbye. Hours later, his cargo plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, washes up on the shore of a tiny, uninhabited island with no provisions or supplies except the clothes on his back, his tiny picture of Kelly (in the stopped watch), and the contents of a few FedEx packages he manages to rescue.
The middle portion of the film, following Chuck's adventures from his first day to his rescue four years later, is the longest and most engaging part. With virtually no dialogue except for the occasional comment to himself or to a volleyball he names ""Wilson,"" Hanks pulls off an amazingly real performance. Acting is much more difficult without a script to suggest emotions or the direction of events; Hanks and Zemeckis say with pictures what could not be said with a thousand words.
The final section involves Chuck's return home after having been thought dead by everyone he knows. Kelly, now married with a daughter, has understandably conflicted feelings about Chuck, having already gone through the grieving process and moved on.
It is wise of Zemeckis, who led Hanks to his second Oscar in Forrest Gump, to devote such a large portion of the film to Chuck's solitary exploits in his hellish paradise, because the scenes which feature other actors are noticeably less effective. Hanks and Hunt don't connect well enough before his absence to make their strained relationship afterward appear in stark contrast as it should. It is effective on the part of Broyles's script that the film is presented completely from Chuck's point of view rather than switching back and forth between him and Kelly, so we don't see her for the entire time he's on the island, either. Apparently, filming was halted for a year in order for Hanks to lose 50 pounds and grow his hair and beard; Zemeckis used this time to film What Lies Beneath. The change in Hanks's appearance is surprising, though some will recognize a similar look during one portion of Gump. Don Burgess's cinematography, supplying dazzling views of Chuck's tropical prison, highlight the irony of his situation, and Alan Silvestri's distinctive muscial score, although used sparingly, also underscores the sweeping beauty of the surroundings.
If all of Cast Away were as gripping as its long midsection, it would be overwhelming; still, even with its flaws, it marks another milestone performance for Tom Hanks as well as for Robert Zemeckis."

","I didn't like the time jump in the middle of the film, and I think it was pretty obvious the scenes after he got back from the island were shot before some of the ones on there, and at the beginning the camera angle on the parcel was terrible, but I enjoyed 90% of this movie and it's definitely a must watch if you're looking for something to do. The acting is spot on for the most part and the film really makes you think about the gap in time. By the time Chuck is stranded on the island is a perfect change of pace and by the time he gets back is a welcome change in pace. Solid 8/10

It's when the story is told visually that it's at its most compelling, with the central performance remaining captivating throughout and the sense of isolation feeling palpable. It does have some pacing issues, though, including a slow opening that struggles to make you care about the character and an off-pace third act that takes the focus away from survival - placing it on living instead, which works thematically but does seem a little dull compared to what came before it. A film that can create a compelling relationship between a man and a volleyball has to be admired, though. 7/10"

"grantss","8","1","2","16 March 2014"," Much more than I expected
","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>Much more than I expected. Disaster-adventure movies are generally quite predictable. Plot = disaster, survive, rescue. That's it. Hard to rate a movie highly that just follows that formula and has very little room to stray from it.<br/><br/>That's what makes Cast Away so good. Yes, there are elements of that formula in it, but it has so much more than that. <br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis carefully sets up the background of the lead character, especially the romantic angle. The survival part meticulously details how he works out how to survive, and how he survives. The movie doesn't end with a rescue, it goes beyond that, showing how the lead character has to restart his life.<br/><br/>Great performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role. Good support from Helen Hunt, but the best supporting performance has to go to Wilson the Volleyball. Solid stuff...<br/><br/>Not perfect. The ending feels like it was drawn out too much, and the director tried to make something profound out of the unprofound. The movie should have ended a few scenes earlier than it did."

It's very brave to offer so little dialog. But I just didn't feel it. I saw what the film was doing, I appreciated what it was doing, but I did not connect viscerally with the story. I'm not sure if this is because of my feelings about Hanks or because of the direction, which to me seems a little too Hollywood to really capture the pain and struggle. <br/><br/>People love this movie, and I can see appealing things about it, but I gave up after an hour of just not caring."

Because when I only imagine staying on an island that long, I wouldn't give a damn about the whole society thing and just go crazy and enjoy the life that I'm lucky to have back.<br/><br/>The characters emotions are also lacking (no extreme joy, sadness, anger or going crazy in the head type of thing) when he is finally back again, which for me makes it a little unbelievable.

","We often find ourselves at crossroads, wondering where to go and what to do next. The ambiguous expression on our faces probably would not be any different than Tom Hanks' when he stares right at us before the screen fades away, thus leaving things to our own interpretation. It is also up to us to conjure what could have been inside that FedEx box that supposedly saved Tom's character Chuck Noland's life, which he leaves at the door of a house in rural Texas. Could it have been a satellite phone?-what an irony it would have been had it been revealed.<br/><br/>An open mind and a sense of adventure is what Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks expects the audience to bring along to this movie. In a way it is a thinking man's movie because it is a little slow for a generation fed on YouTube clips, has no dialogs or music for several minutes, and the ending is not the dessert that an average moviegoer would like after such a lengthy feast. My qualms, however, are with the part when Chuck rejoins civilization after living on a deserted island for four years. His interaction with people, especially Kelly (Helen Hunt) is, for the lack of a better word, average and mirrors the humdrum of life, which is the last thing you would expect from a character that has put the taste of such a sweet performance in your mouth. The writing here is not at par with the golden second half. The soliloquy that Tom's character deliver, however, is a gem and it captures his state of mind after suffering in isolation for years and the pain that he felt after losing the love of his life all over again.<br/><br/>Interestingly, for the time bound Chuck Noland (No-Land – get it?), a systems engineer for Fed Ex, no thought of a life altering event or the fear of losing his girlfriend had probably ever occurred except the fear of running out of time. And in a bid to beat time, he ignores his health and even proposes to Kelly in the car en route to board a last minute flight to Malaysia, which unexpectedly crashes (a very scary and a believable plane crash) and he finds himself marooned on a deserted tropical island with nothing but a broken watch and all the time in the world to ponder on his future. The scenes featuring an overweight workaholic's struggle to survive on an uninhabited island are by far the most intriguing ones ever recorded on film. And Tom Hanks fails not once, not even by chance. Very soon his struggle becomes our struggle as he learns how to use day-to-day objects as tools of survival, how to crack coconuts, how to fish, how to build a shelter, how to light a fire, and most importantly how to survive the odds without any human contact. A volleyball named Wilson fills this gap for him and becomes as real to him as Kelly was in his past. His faith in his love and a strong desire to see Kelly helps him survive on that island.<br/><br/>Cast Away benefits mainly from another amazing performance by Tom Hanks. He, right from the beginning, has us believing that his character, a typical worker bee, will probably continue to live like this forever and never suspects a life altering event to strike him ever. But once this event strikes and takes it toll, it leaves him at a crossroads; his conscience, once a mere cog in a massive clock, becomes ambivalent because it now holds the wisdom of what time can do to you and constantly reminds him of how uncertain his life has been and that his future or rather his notion of future will never be the same. And this wisdom, disguised as an ambiguous expression, is the reflection of our own dilemma of never knowing what he would do next"

The basic concept lack originality, but the depiction accounted for it. Emotionally it depicts struggle, love, and underlying depressing themes with a splash of comedy at the beginning to lighten the feel a little (well chosen, otherwise one of the main themes may have been depression). As for the acting, Hanks is brilliant and clearly breaks free of his stereotypical extroverted, anxious character. Very good emotional depiction considering the fact that for long stretches in the movie he has no lines to work with whatsoever.

","I won't say that this is a ""desert island"" favorite, this is about the last thing you want to see if you got stranded! It's really a major accomplishment for the director Zemekis and Hanks making the film seem vast and isolated without bogging down. If Forest Gump didn't convince you that Tom Hanks is one of the most skilled and credible actors in modern history, if not of all time, then you need to watch this picture to set you straight. Little details build up in this film to add to the realism. The story involves Hanks' as a corporate worker-bee becoming stranded on a small island in the Pacific. The depiction of his day-to-day survival and acceptance of circumstances with occasional moments of great learning prove a crucial element in the pacing of the film. His gradual mastery over his environment also increases the audience's sense of participation in the drama. He learns how to help himself survive.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a low-energy emotional performance for most of the picture, but the weight of the film is all on Hanks and the shoot looks pretty physical. In fact, they shot part of the film and then went back a year later, giving Hanks enough time to drop weight to look sufficiently half-starved.<br/><br/>The audience can clearly see his early mistakes in prioritizing his survival tools on the island. His delay in learning to build a signal fire costs him dearly, like his poor priorities in ""real"" life cost him. The film is a rewarding survival story and comment on modern life. If nothing else, this film encourages the examination of your life and may make you want to learn how to build a fire or carry a multi-tool with you at all times."

","I don't feel there is any need to describe this movie too much or to emphasize its meanings, since anybody who has read or seen the story of Robinson Crusoe has a pretty good idea of what this movie is about. I'll just focus on the differences here and on some things that I found charming and some not so charming: <br/><br/>1. I don't know if it was done intentionally, but Hanks' character is a typical workaholic of our day and age, a yuppie and someone totally dependent on consumerism. So I found myself feeling a slight satisfaction when he was cast away. I was kinda going: ""Let's see what you do now, Mr. Career-Driven Corporate Employee CEO of Fedex Wannabe"". I am sure the makers of this movie had no intention of creating such a blunt statement to the extent I am suggesting, but I felt it that way.The question here is: What do you do if you have nothing except yourself? When you're not Mr.X, with a social status and every bit of your outer world disappears and you are left with nothing but yourself? Now the ""solution"" of our hero, going through pain, anguish and suicidal thoughts is to hold on to his past. Here is the major difference to Robinson Crusoe. Robinson finally adapts. Our hero never really does, even though he does manage to create some kind of inner balance not without the help of one of the most beautiful characters in movie history: the volleyball Wilson. Their relationship is extremely touching.<br/><br/>2. The emotions of the character are strong and presented eloquently and in an elegant manner to the viewer. You really feel with the character. The only flaw of the movie, in my opinion, is that it's just a bit too picturesque. Sure, some gritty realism - like the pulling the tooth out scene,but sometimes too picturesque. Fortunately the incredible versatility and excellent casting of Tom Hanks covers most of that and really touches you.<br/><br/>3. As for the coming back sequence and the ending...very very nice. Lots of great acting and storytelling here and the conclusion is definitely appropriate and consistent with the character development. Great final frame with the crossroads. Only one observation (in the sense of ""What would I do in the same situation?""): I would have definitely have opened up the package and adapt like Robinson C. (at least I feel so). The fact that our hero never manages to really adapt is a statement of our fragility as a social animal.The fact that he needed that unopened package to be finally delivered as a way to keep his sanity all those secluded years is a sad reminder that it is extremely hard to be really free from your outer world. Robinson Crusoe was written centuries ago, in the classical/pre-romantic period of literature, in a time when, it seems, there was a lot more confidence in the ability of man to live at peace with himself. I am not sure whether I am more like this Fedex guy or Robinson, but I would definitely prefer Robinson.<br/><br/>Anyway, Bravo! Tom Hanks and let's hope Zemeckis will make THIS kind of movies as opposed to his usual obnoxious content-free block-busters."

This all changes, as the FedEx plane he was on crashes in the Pacific. He is the sole survivor, and has to adapt to a new life, cast away from civilization on a deserted island. The movie accentuates the physical and psychological hardship one must go thru in order to adapt to a new life, in this case in communion with nature. The FedEx executive undergoes a transformation, passing thru the suicidal, angry and finally resignation stage, and adapts in order to survive, but cannot leave his social ties fully behind, so he creates a friend out of a volley-ball, Wilson(I found this friendship to be very touching), hangs on to the picture of his fiancé, and, most important, perhaps, in order not to go insane, and have something to live for, keeps a package in order to deliver it someday. This element is very important, because at the end it becomes everything that drives him (his fiancé married another instead, as he was presumed dead), all purpose in life, if you will, and this is why the movie ends with him at a crossroad, disoriented, because he didn't dare think he would come so far, and didn't plan anything past delivering the package.

""Cast Away"" of course portrays Fed Ex employee Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) getting stuck on a Pacific island after a plane crash and having to use his own ingenuity to survive, even after he ends up looking like a cross between a beggar and Moses. I personally think that they could have just left it at that and not had any of the stuff about his relationships with people. But Wilson made an interesting character. Of course, a particularly unpleasant scene portrays his dental work. Overall, I guess that there's not much here that we haven't seen, but Hanks's performance keeps everything afloat, especially in the fire scene.<br/><br/>And I guess that Gilligan did forget to tell us about the coconuts."
"fizixrox","10","1","2","19 March 2006"," Wilson should have gotten Best Supporting Actor
","This movie has fantastic emotional highs and lows. Nothing in this movie ripped my heart out more than when Wilson washed away at sea. Even if he was just a volleyball, he really deserved best supporting actor. The other fascinating prop in this movie was the package he never opened, the one with the wings painted on it. I always wonder what was in it. And it inspires his escape raft, which has got to be the best moment of the movie, when the ""sail"" whips up and he escapes the reef that has trapped him. This movie really is a fabulous exploration of how a man can change. It seems to touch people on many levels. Rent it with a box of tissues."
"aldavies-1","10","1","2","7 March 2006"," Another example of the excellence and diversity of Tom Hanks acting ability.
","This is a movie definitely worth seeing, and for myself, watching about once a year. I have enjoyed Tom Hanks in a number of movies, this one being near the top of his list. The scenery is spectacular in a confined environment. His struggle and his evolution to primitive being shows the determination to live, where many would simply lay down and die, wallowing in their own self-pity for being stranded seemingly without hope. And his recovery from devastation when he realizes he has lost the love of his life for the second time, shows a similarity to the persona he had to bring out, simply to survive the adverse conditions in which he found himself when he crawled out of the ocean. An absolutely excellent film."

","I have never met anyone who enjoyed Cast Away as much as me. I think it is a masterpiece, one of the best films of the past decade, but I admit you'd be hard pressed to find many people (especially among those who know much more about film than myself) who agree.<br/><br/>The first time I saw it, I thought it was enjoyable, but rather long. I saw it again years later, and I found the movie truly powerful. His transformation and perseverance, Wilson, everything that happens on the island is believable and well paced. More importantly, the images when he comes back to Memphis- bottled water, the lighter- I know Zemeckis kind of hits you over the head with it, but for me it worked.<br/><br/>I think Tom Hanks is a truly remarkable actor- for all the crappy, ""You've Got Mail"" movies he's made, when I watch Cast Away or Forest Gump I have difficulty imagining him as anyone else. His performance is great. This movie is great. For me, like most great movies, it was even better the second time. If you have seen it once, I wholeheartedly suggest a second viewing."
"wvmcl","7","1","2","29 July 2005"," Quibbles with ""Cast Away""
","I was quite impressed with many aspects of this film, but I have to point to a couple of quibbles which helped keep it from being the fully realized work of art it could have been:<br/><br/>1)The first 15 minutes of the film contain as many product placements as I can remember seeing in that short of a time. This is a MAJOR negative to me, as it destroys the suspension of disbelief and immersion in a cinematic world which is so important to the enjoyment of narrative film. The profusion of FedEx logos was comical at times, as in the Moscow airport scene. The film would have been far more effective, in my view, if Hanks has worked for a fictional delivery firm rather than the real-life FedEx. My teenage son argues that use of brand names makes the film more ""realistic."" I firmly disagree. The use of brands and logos is a constant reminder that you are watching a commercial enterprise backed by labyrinthine financial deals. I thought this was a major problem with ""ET"" as well. (I would give them a pass on the ball called ""Wilson"" - that was a pretty good joke, but overall far too many product references.) <br/><br/>2) The filmmakers make the same mistake that Defoe made in ""Robinson Crusoe"" - the ending is too long and anticlimactic. If you've read ""Crusoe"" in its original text, you may remember the superfluous episode of a race over the mountains to Lisbon after Crusoe's return. In ""Cast Away"", judicious editing could have shortened the denouement by at least 10 minutes and still made all of its points. The result would have been a better film."

","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br/><br/>My review will be short and sweet. This is a beautiful movie and though I didn't see it in the theater, I pretty much knew the story by the time I did see it, so there weren't many surprises. That Tom Hanks was incredible was definitely not a surprise as he is one of my favorite actors and with the exception of ""You've got mail"" I have never really seen a hanks movie I did not like. Here Hanks is in another haunting film playing another unforgettable character.<br/><br/>This is the best I've ever seen Helen Hunt. This movie contains so many bittersweet moments and scenes (one word-Wilson) and the ending is so absolutely bittersweet and realistic to a degree, it s both touching and brilliantly acted.<br/><br/>As good as Castway is, don't see it if your in a bad mood(or if you don't like Tom Hanks.) There is no doubt that Tom Hanks is one of the most talented actors we have working today and I think all involved did a great job with this movie."
"jboothmillard","6","1","2","11 March 2005"," Cast Away
","One of the most interesting and compelling films ever, with most of the film occupied by one actor. Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex worker, who on a Fex Ex delivery flight has a plane crash into the ocean. Chuck is the only survivor, and when he wakes up the next morning he is alone. He finds himself on an empty island with nothing but sand, coconut trees, and rock. Throughout the film he continues to try and survive. He finds boxes from the crash on the sand bank. The things inside the boxes help him in his survival. He even befriends (talks to) a football/volleyball called Wilson. This film does have some emotional moments, but it does have some feel good moments too, e.g. watching Chuck make fire. Hanks had to slim down for four months before finishing the film and he could have got an award for it. It it slow before the crash, and when he goes back to the normal world after four years, and Helen Hunt as Kelly Frears hardly does much, but watch Hanks. One of the only films to have a nearly one-man show. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor. Good!"

","If you haven't seen the movie, don't read this discussion, because my discussion might give a hint to the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>The real message is you shouln't treat your professional life more importantly than you personal life.<br/><br/>When Tom Hanks was having a joyous dinner with his girlfriend, family, and close friends, he was interrupted by a telephone call from his company. He was told he had to leave and travel half way around the world to fix a problem for his company.<br/><br/>Next thing he knows, Tom Hanks was stranded by himself on a island. He couldn't leave the island for years.<br/><br/>When Tom Hanks finally got back to the real world, the love of his life (Helen Hunt) has already married to another man. (Ironically Helen Hunts was married to a dentist, and Tom Hanks had to remove a bad tooth when he was on that island)<br/><br/>I was so touched by the scene when Tom Hanks went to Helen Hunt's house for the first time, after Hanks came back from the island.<br/><br/>They had soooo much love between them. But so much has changed since the last time they saw each other, when they were having that dinner when that phone call came, and when they exchanged Christmas presents in that car, just before they said good bye. Helen Hunts has already married to another man and they already have a baby.<br/><br/>They still love each other so much. And they know they were meant to be husband and wife. But they know that they couldn't turn back the clock.<br/><br/>Remember the scene when they remove the baby seat from the car?<br/><br/>The message of the movie is your love ones are more important and precious than your job and career. <br/><br/>I was so emotionally touched by the last 15 minutes of the movie, I almost cried."

","You only truly get one shot at experiencing this movie.  The first viewing is important.  It is a very satisfying and intriguing plot that develops slowly and steadily.  You may think this has all been done before, but stand corrected here and now:  what a difference Tom Hanks makes. <br/><br/>
This is an emotional rollercoaster ride through a series of events, and just when you think you can't cry anymore, along comes Helen Hunt to further reduce you to tears of love lost through no fault other than time.  Absence not only makes the heart grow fonder, but it makes the heart lament the lost time that can never be recovered nor the bridges broken be repaired.<br/><br/>The movie has my respect, because I fell in love with an inanimate object; Wilson.  I am not ashamed to admit I cried over Wilson!  I dare anyone to say they didn't feel a tug over that one!  You are lying!  Wilson was an involuntary symbol--I won't embellish further, but a symbol none the less.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks reportedly lost quite a bit of weight during the filming of this movie--the whole things was put on hiatus for a long time period to facilitate this feat.  Amazing!  He shines bright in this one, but in my book, Hanks is always shining."

","i do like this film very much, because it does concentrate mainly on the expected and natural acts that people do in the emergent situations they are put in. For example, Tom Hanks in the film didn't have any tool to burn fire; so, he insisted on using two pieces of wood and touching them strongly together in order to make fire, which at the end had happened after a very big effort of him. This shows us how simple we might find things, which in real had gone a long way of improvement before reaching their last figure and appeal. At the same time i do also like this film very much, because it takes into consideration the human feelings and relations, like when Tom Hanks lost William, you can notice how bad and lonely he felt, as if William was a real personal. What i like also in this film is how Tom Hanks has insisted on getting out of his problem, which is staying on the island, by preparing for making a boat and taking into consideration all the troubles he might face and putting a timing for all what he is doing... All of this shows how human creativity and intelligence can be used in any situation, either a known one before or un unexpected and unknown one."

","Recently viewed this film and was amazed at the great photography and how beautiful the Island was, Monuriki, Fiji; the beautiful waves and terrifying heights in which the waves towered over poor Tom Hanks (Chuck Nolan),""Catch Me If You Can"",'02, who played an outstanding role as a man stranded on a lonely island except for a ball with a face painted on it with his own blood!  This film started out in a nowhere place and kept your interest to the very end with travels to Russia and remote areas unknown. Helen Hunt(Kelly Frears),""What Women Want"",2000, played a very brief role but important and her acting with Chuck Nolan was very dramatic and drew lots of tears.  Kelly gave Chuck her grandfather's watch from his days working for the Southern Pacific Railroad with her picture and it appeared quite often in the film.

","After he tackled (with panache) the fantastic cinema with ""What lies Beneath"" (2000), Robert Zemeckis decided to shot an adventure movie. The result was ""Cast Away"", a simple and bald movie. This film is also the occasion for reunion between Zemeckis and Tom Hanks.<br/><br/> After ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), Hanks puts himself in Chuck Noland's shoes who is all the contrary of Forrest Gump. He's a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life's tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It's especially worth for Hanks' awesome performance. He's all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator's attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he's doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don't get bored.<br/><br/>""Cast away"" is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks's face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.<br/><br/>This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis' best movies."

","`Cast Away' is a less than average film overall and it certainly is nowhere near as good as it set out to be. There are only two stars in the film that are noticed, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks does fairly well and you can see that he has prepared for the role, but you can also see that he's not very happy with the material he's been given. Helen Hunt doesn't get enough screen-time, given the plot of the film. She is convincing as usual as a loving housewife but only has one scene in the movie in which she `jumps off' the screen.<br/><br/>
`Cast Away' blatantly shouts out `Give me an Oscar'. The material sets out to be gripping and humane but I found it to be hollow on the inside and some of the scenes were unintentionally hilarious. Come on, one man's friendship with his football?????? At 145 minutes `Castaway' is overlong and surprisingly little is covered in that space of time. <br/><br/>The film ends on a question mark and suddenly stops without any satisfying conclusion. Most people, including myself would probably feel cheated out of our money instead of engaged and satisfied.

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The theme of the cast away goes back long before Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) or The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss (1781-1830); indeed it probably goes back to a time when people first set out on the open sea in boats. It is a wonderfully romantic genre, employing the classic ""man versus nature"" theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization.<br/><br/>Here we have Tom Hanks as Chuck Nolan, a Fed Ex executive whose plane ditches into the South Pacific ocean. He washes up on a tiny, desert island as the sole survivor of the plane crash. (Incidentally, both ""des-ert island"" and ""de-serted island"" are correct, the words ""des-ert' and ""de-serted"" in this context meaning the same thing.) His four-year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie, but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie-goers is what happens afterwards.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was excellent throughout, as usual, and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr. was compelling. Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck's beloved (Helen Hunt) while he is gone. This has been done before (but I forget where), and is the kind of heart-wrenching development that could have been pure saccharin but instead came across as thought-provoking, veracious and very affecting.<br/><br/>Zemeckis also directed the excellent film, Contact (1997), made from the novel by Carl Sagan. We can see here (and there) that Zemeckis's work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense. Zemeckis, like Spielberg, can be cloying at times in his effort to secure the audience's identification. We can see this in the beginning with Chuck cutely trying to sell efficiency to the Russians with the help of a little boy. But splendid was the plane crash sequence, the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid, and it was. And later the startling sight of the huge cargo ship, like a sea-going skyscraper, recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). The Fed Ex packages flying out all over the world engendering a kind of corporate ""we're all one world"" feeling like something from a Coca-Cola commercial was pure Spielberg.<br/><br/>But what I like to do when I look at a movie like this is to lean forward and scrutinize it for authenticity. Did the cast away lose weight? Yes, as a matter of fact, Tom Hanks must have dropped about ten pounds, or perhaps he fattened up for the first part of the film (or was that body cosmetology?) and then fasted for the scenes showing him four years later. But did he lose enough weight? For those who have been watching TV's ""Survivor,"" we know he didn't. And was he tan enough? His hair was little lighter after his ordeal, but he really needed to be baked a dark brown, which he wasn't.<br/><br/>I also look at how he ate. What was his source of vitamin C? Do coconuts contain Vitamin C? I don't know. But showing him eating seaweed, which does contain vitamin C, would have worked. Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch. Learning to spear fish with a wooden spear is plausible, but spearing a fish with a wooden spear in the open ocean is unlikely. Notice there were no birds or bird eggs or bird guano on the island. An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds.<br/><br/>This last observation reveals that the setting was not in fact a tiny island but part of a larger body of land. Notice there was no clear, encircling shot of the island (as from the air). In fact we never see the other side of the island.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see how he got the fire going (again ""Survivor"" fans--and boy scouts--know how hard that is to do), but I was thinking that maybe he could have used the glass on the watch face or from the flashlight as a way to concentrate sunlight to make a fire.<br/><br/>I also watched to see whether he did what I would have done. Of course what I would have done doesn't mean that much, but I would not have left the island for the open ocean (which seemed almost suicidal), unless there was out there on that ocean a ship's corridor, so to speak, which is possible. Of course, who can say what a man might do after being four years entirely alone on a tiny island? I also would not have tried to cure my toothache, regardless of how bad it hurt, by breaking the tooth off with the ice skates. After all, that might make things worse. Trying to pull the tooth would have been my strategy--but how?<br/><br/>I liked the irony of finding the ice skates in a washed up Fed Ex package, and then Chuck's use of the blades as mirror and knife. I know why he didn't take the dead man's clothes, but I think he should have plugged his nose and peeled them off anyway. The washed up metal ""sail"" was a nice inspiration, and there were many others: the ""discovery"" of tool-making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle; burning the base of the trees to make wood for the raft; the petroglyphs he made in the cave; sleeping on the floor in the hotel room, etc.<br/><br/>Best no comment scene: Chuck looking at the Alaskan king crab legs at the buffet."

","I was warmly looking forward to this movie since I love the ocean and I generally enjoy Tom Hanks movies (such as Forrest Gump and Sleepless in Seattle).  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in Cast Away. <br/><br/>
The movie opened with a variety of global snippets creating a sense of speed and excitement.  After a while (and a few borrowed scenes from airplane disaster movies of the 70s), we found Hanks in a predictable marooned situation on a tropical isle doing all of the things we would expect: finding water, food, shelter.  The plot drearily and ploddingly followed each step of the way.<br/><br/>The only freshness and creativity was the introduction of the new star, Wilson.  I admittedly cried when Dumbo's mother was locked up in the Disney movie, ""Dumbo,"" but I just couldn't get into this ""Wilson"" thing in Cast Away; I was dry-eyed the whole way through.  Call me crass, call me hard-hearted, but I never cried for poor, enigmatic Wilson.<br/><br/>Perhaps my greatest disappointment was the movie virtually ignoring a gut-wrenching issue throughout 95% of the film.  Sure, Hanks was lonely on a deserted island, but what about his love interest, Helen Hunt?  She faced a very difficult issue: give Chuck Noland (Hanks) up for dead and start a new life or cling to the chance that he might still be alive?  Watching a great actress like Hunt grapple with this tough decision fraught with emotional drama and trauma would have been much more interesting than watching Hanks fishing and losing weight.  And what is more relevant to most of us - getting cast on a deserted isle or having a loved one disappear - kidnapped, killed, a runaway?  The questions facing Hunt were, by far, the most relevant and engaging ones to be touched and indulged by the film.<br/><br/>Alas, it was not to be.  Helen Hunt's role was almost a cameo in comparison to Hanks.  And for the little time she had, she should be given the Charlie McCarthy award for the wooden delivery of her lines.<br/><br/>Strangely (and sadly), Wilson was the best supporting actor in this movie. I give Cast Away a 4 - only for the upcoming star, Wilson, and for the island and ocean surf which actually were quite lovely.<br/><br/>(By the way, the symbolism of the ""crossroads"" was lame, too.)"

","Seeing the likes of Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan gave me the impression that this would be another outstanding performance by Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The acting was very impressive, but the plot seemed to be non-existent. They show him when he first became stranded on the island, then they show what happened four years later. What on earth were they thinking? Before that, I was very impressed, but afterwards, it was just completely ruined. A little too far-fetched and way too long for my liking. I left the cinema in great disappointment."

","Zemeckis and Hanks sure know their audience as this movie has pulled in a gross totally out of proportion to the films quality.  I am just glad that I saw it for free and didn't contribute my $9.50.<br/><br/>As many other reviews here state the cheesy ending when he finally returns to Memphis (some four weeks after he was rescued) spoiled even further an already mediocre film.<br/><br/>For those of you who want to see a film that accurately portrays life as a cast away then rent ""Castaway"" (1987) starring Amanda Donohoe and the late Oliver Reed.  That film may not be the greatest but provides a more realistic portrayal of life on an island and may help you fill in the gaps in what Hanks may have gone through during those ""missing"" four years."
"lsd_reality","3","1","2","8 January 2001"," FedEx: The Movie.
","I rarely find myself going so far as to comment on a film here, yet after seeing the rave reviews this film has been getting, I found I could not help myself.<br/><br/>What people see in this movie, I am not really sure. Perhaps it is just the casting of Hanks and Hunt, or some bit of hype which has built up....<br/><br/>From the start one of the most annoying things was the MASSIVE product placement of FexEx through out the movie. Half of the movie was basically a giant advertisement for FedEx. You could see logos everywhere. The scene when Hank returns and is waiting to see Hunt and looks out the window to the parking lot to see her in a fit---with about 20 FexEx planes strangely in the background was especially bad.<br/><br/>And one knows since FexEx most surely paid a lot of money to get their name and logo everywhere and anywhere, that not a single harsh word (or should I say harsh even? perhaps not even a Realistic word) would be said against them.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it seems the whole film is basically given away in the title: Cast Away. It is almost as if someone came up with the title and then proposed they make a film about it and some how found some way to Cast him away and bring him back, all nice and neat and pretty.<br/><br/>The period of time which Hank spends on the island is basically meaningless, and while he does struggle and learn, in the end nothing has really changed. He finally makes it back home, and some how returns back to ""normal"" life quite quickly with little readjustment. (if one was on a stranded island for 4 years, coming home would be one hell of a bizarre proposition).<br/><br/>The love interest seems to be included very much for the sake of simply having one, or at least giving Hanks something to DO when he gets back, with out which there would be nothing to show us.<br/><br/>So the film tries to give us the passion, but showing how much they still ""love"" each other-- yet god forbid they make an ""immoral"" movie where a woman runs away from her family to be with a previous lover-- So they attempt to show us that the desire is still there, but desire is grounded by practicality, and so life moves on (now that sounds pretty dull to me.)<br/><br/>In any case, there were a few scenes on the island I thought were interesting, yet over all I hardly feel this movie deserves the reviews it has gotten."

"baumer","7","1","2","8 January 2001"," The last act makes this a disappointment
","I remember the day I was going to see this film what I was thinking to myself.  I was driving to wherever, and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued.  It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia.  I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first.  Would my eyes bulge from their forehead?  Would I look like I had just seen a ghost? Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on?  Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape?  These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film.  Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film?  Well if you have seen the film, you know exactly what happened and if you haven't then you'll just have to read a little further to find out.  But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9.5 that it should have been.  And that is a shame.<br/><br/>Cast Away is a very good film, it's just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it.  Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours, it deserved to be three.  When you go to great pains to have a story of this magnitude then why can you not close the deal and make the last act just as good as the middle one? <br/><br/>
What is good about the film is the first act and what is even better is the second one.  We are introduced to Hanks as a guy that lives and dies by his watch.  He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year's.  It is a promise, he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year.  So far Hanks's character, while a little intricate and obsessive, seems like many of us. We all live by the clock in one way or another.  It's just that he is a little more serious about it.  But in these times that we live in, we are all bound by deadlines, we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another.  So again, we can relate to his character quite well.  Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere.  Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted, almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere.  It is here that the strength of the film is presented. And this is the most amazing thing about the film.  We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself, but we want more.  We are captivated.  At least I was.  The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation, loneliness, despair, hope and a plethora of other feelings in between.  Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen.  He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life.  It's name is Wilson, a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into.  Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times, it frightened me and saddened me that it was.  I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island.  And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island, I was completely engulfed in his time there.  When he eventually did get off, I craved for him to be back on that tiny island, with Wilson, his coconuts, his caves, his fire and all else that was there.  Up until his rescue ( and you knew that was inevitable, from the trailers ), this was easily one of the five best films of the year.  But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor.  There was so much more that they could have done. There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him.  There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued.  It just happened.  I wanted to see everyone's faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home.  But not once did we get that. And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long, hell it could have been 3 and a half, that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty.  As it stands, it is a good film, but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks, it could have been so much more.  And that makes it disappointing.<br/><br/>7 out of 10- Still a good film and a fantastic journey, but it lacked once he got off the island.  However, Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins, there should be no complaints.  It is an incredible performance.  This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year."
"frankcaruso47","3","1","2","31 December 2000"," Bad, pointless film
","CAST AWAY  - MINI REVIEW<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF MY COMMENTS MAY GIVE AWAY CERTAIN PLOT LINES OF THE FILM.<br/><br/>Cast Away could have been a great film -- but it turned out to be a real disappointment for me. The plane crash and the subsequent challenge of surviving on an isolated island was quite fascinating. The problem was that the relationship between the Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt characters wasn't well established. It seemed forced and rather phony. One minute Hanks' character is calling his lover from Russia, in a rather matter-of-fact tone, telling her he loves her. He barely turns off the cell-phone and he's back at his high-stress job. If only the director had given him even a few seconds to dwell on his recent conversation with someone he is supposed to be madly in love with. I just never bought the love story aspect of it, so when he returns after being stranded on a tiny, deserted island for over four years I just didn't care about her or their relationship. Far too much time had passed, both in real life, and in the movie. Having Hanks stare at tiny fading photo of her just didn't work. I think Helen Hunt is a fine actress, but her tom-boyish looks don't do much for my libido. And if the audience can't feel what the protagonist is supposed to be feeling, well -- it just doesn't work does it?<br/><br/>I also couldn't understand why the movie dragged on for so long after his rescue. The film would have been much better if it had ended at that point.<br/><br/>The scene when the freighter glided by his raft was fabulous.<br/><br/>
There were a lot of great scenes in this movie, but they didn't lead up to anything dramatically. His relationship with Wilson, the volleyball provided the most tender moments in the film. Wilson should be nominated for best supporting actor. Sure his acting was a bit stiff at times, but it was better than the mushy acting that preceded Hank's disappearance and certainly much better than the absurd acting and dialogue we had to endure in the aftermath of his rescue.<br/><br/>Maybe I was expecting too much after reading all the great press.<br/><br/>All in all -- a real disappointment."
"Mojnmand","3","2","7","24 March 2007"," Weird!
","This is a weird story. Tom Hanks is a time neurotic guy who is very busy. Then he gets on a plane, and the plane crashes. Okay, fine! Then what? Unfortunately the island he finds himself stranded on is unpopulated. So far, so good. Now the story turns into a classic man versus nature- story. That's fine and dandy, because this theme is very relevant since Mr. Hanks is portrayed as this time neurotic guy, who always seems to be hung up on what time it is and how much he has to do before this and that, and now he has to go back to basics and live off the land... ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.......... Now the weird part starts. He turns into a madman!!! He becomes indeed VERY friendly with a volleyball. A BALL! This is not natural!(Unless somebody has paid good money to promote Wilson- volleyballs.) He is more attached to that one ball than to his own very naturally attached balls, and that's just weird! I don't care that he is lonely and has been so for 4 years. You just don't make friends with a ball, and you certainly don't name it! I only want to give it 3 out of 10 because my mates and I once had a laugh about that best- friends- with- a- volleyball- part. Other than that it was just plain boring. If you like Hanks, watch something else. I recommend ""Turner & Hooch""."
"erniemunger","5","2","7","9 January 2006"," Cavernous apology of transcendental consumerism
","Replete with blatant contradictions, Cast Away serves as a highly interesting case study of Hollywood's dominating mood and the psychological repressions of mainstream American (and, by extension, so-called western) society. Its main tag line being that you need to free yourself from the material world in order to achieve true personal freedom, it paradoxically links all emotions to objects from the material world (volleyball, soda drink, ice cubes, skating shoes, football franchises, car etc.)  hence the shameless product placement that has rightly spurred harsh criticism, though cause and effect are certainly hard to disentangle. The plot itself illustrates this inherent struggle between materialism and spiritualism: the part dedicated to the protagonist's inner developments, devoid of musical score and with little dialogue (monologue, in fact), is squeezed in between two very talkative and, to say the least, corny accounts along the lines of before/after. However, what Zemeckis and Hanks attempt to achieve in the long run is no less than the reconciliation of both worlds. At the end of the inward journey stands the morale that consumerism and personal emotional fulfillment are only seemingly opposites. They can be pacified provided the individual, precisely by identifying with the objects he produces  by humanizing them, as it were (Wilson)  gains detachment from the the material world and, more prosaically, transcends the ugly things in life. And what better way to hit that home than to use real, existing brands that every movie goer in the western hemisphere can relate to? (In a way, the question as to whether or not the makers of the film should have preferred imaginary brands has no incidence.) In this perspective, Zemeckis's tale is the diametrical opposite of Robinson Crusoe, who chose to live as a free individual, distrustful of what he perceived as civilisation, whereas Chuck Noland's sole aspiration is to return amidst his peers after an incidental cathartic incursion into the cavernous shell of his inner life. In other words, where Defoe outlines utopia, Zemeckis casts dystopia. As such, the metaphor spun here constitutes a deliberate attempt to rid the sphere of culture of its persistent, though mostly latent or repressed, bad conscience when it comes to financial issues getting in the way of artistic license. Similarly, it exempts audiences at large from having to resolve the negative equation of art vs commerce, of spirit vs money, etc, thus consolidating the conservative liberal economical stance so well embodied by Tom Hanks and FedEx alike. Quite openly it says that you shouldn't feel guilty for liking products as they are part of your emotional fabric  a semantic twist more commonly known as branding. The other dominating theme in Noland's emancipation is masculinity. The character's deep psychological turmoil is chastely symbolised by the island, with its moist cavern and erect mountain. The underlying assertion is that Noland needs to crawl out of his allegedly safe hole and climb the phallic hill to restore his deficient masculinity, the very premise to reintegrate a self-assertive modern society. Ultimately, his restored maleness allows him to let go of his former love, who returns to her new family and thus reinstates (Christian) moral order embodied by the institution of marriage. In line with this bigot mentality, sexuality is alway only addressed in germ-free metaphors. Have you noticed that the lush atoll is practically devoid of animals other than meaty crabs and the occasional fish? Where are the birds, snakes, worms, spiders and the armies of undefined crawling species that you're entitled to expect in the wild? Artistically speaking, the film has a handful of redeeming qualities, one being obviously its sheer length, the freedom it takes to deploy its story, thin by modern action standards, while nonetheless omitting or merely evoking certain episodes or riddles, a choice which runs counter to current cinema viewing habits. (Incidentally, that is precisely why so many people on this site have complained about the missing suicide attempt, the undisclosed content of the parcel and the open end; it would seem that today's movie goers can no longer bear that something is not explained to them didactically, explicitly.) But all things considered, the contrite redemption theme used to validate a consumerist society and its ethic corollary, fundamental religious values, makes Cast Away a disturbing illustration of a dominant (white male) ideology. As such, it is clearly propagandist, in all senses of the word."

Was it for the money ? As virtually the only actor in it, did he get the entire acting purse of 3 trillion dollars and a promise of all the cream filled donuts he could eat for life ? Otherwise, surely he would rather have died in the plane crash early on - the only good moment: Perfect Storm meets Airplane 17 - than appear in the credits of yet one more movie written and produced by People Who Have Had Their Brains Removed, or Lost Them on the Cutting Room Floor.<br/><br/>Hanks is a great actor, but there is a limit to how long you can watch even him rub sticks together to make fire or talk to a volleyball. Through a deadly awkward sub title we are informed that Hanks's character apparently did this for four years ; it certainly felt a good deal longer. But matters worsened when he returned to the enthralling offices of Fedex and engaged in conversations which proved that if you dedicate your life to getting parcels there on time you cause yourself severe cerebral damage.<br/><br/>His best friend's wife has died of cancer. Hanks says `I should have been there, I am sorry, I should have been there'. He doesn't go on to say, Indeed I would have been there if I my plane hadn't crashed in the Pacific Ocean. His friend could at least have said, don't worry ,Tom, I understand why you didn't make it. SPOILERS AHEAD Hanks returns and his beloved's new husband meets him and says ,""Hi remember me I once gave you root canal treatment."" This must go down as one of the all time greats alongside Hamlet saying to Laertes in Act Five "" Hi, remember me ? I once resprayed the side panels of your Dodge Durango""; or Jesus to Barabas: ""Hi, remember me ? Each of these nails they're putting in was hand turned on a lathe and coated with an  environmentally friendly anti-oxidant.""

At this Hanks forgets about falling forty thousand feet into the ocean and spending the best years of his life communing with stones and becomes as happy as any Walmart shopper stumbling across a bargain.<br/><br/>I have to admit that was the moment when I expected the oxygen masks to fall from the ceiling and save us & when they didn't I had to make a break for the air outside.<br/><br/>So I don't know what happened at the very end. But there could be no miracle great enough to redeem this cynical movie.

What makes this film so absurd, is that Chuck Noland seems to possess near expert survival skills. He knows the proper wood to use to try and start a fire, he knows how to make rope, and he manages to salvage everything else he needs to survive from the FedEx packages that float to his island, from the crashed plane. He can't catch fish, so he finds a dress with netting on it to use as a fishing net. He can't open his coconuts, so of course, he finds someones birthday gift ice skates!

He of course loses his girlfriend who is now married to another guy. When he goes to visit her after being rescued, she calls him the love of her life, and claims she knew he was alive all along, which makes about as much sense as the rest of this movie, because nothing says you are the love of my life, like marrying another guy!!!

Those films were enjoyable, even though they lasted WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to long. In this case, however, there is very little to enjoy and a lot of time to be bored. <br/><br/>I think the premise of this movie certainly left room for a very interesting movie, but hardly anything ever happens. We see Chuck do some very basic things when he first arrives on the island. Then we make a four year jump and find out that Chuck has hardly done anything in the mean time, and then again he does nothing for a very long time. It's not funny, it's not a good psychological study into loneliness, it's not exciting, it's just plain dull.  <br/><br/>Also, after Chuck finally gets rescued, we get a totally pointless half hour episode in which Chuck re-discovers the inhabited world, filled with very hollow symbolism (the unopened package). <br/><br/>Also, the movie looks like it was paid completely by FedEx : the name of this company appears so many times during the course of this movie, that it gets really irritating? Did they use this movie as a two-hour commercial ?<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" is boring, pointless and full of hollow symbolism and nonsense. Avoid or be bored to death.<br/><br/>* out of **** stars"
"tfrizzell","Null","1","3","14 March 2002"," Tom Hanks' Performance Is the Calling Card Here.
","""Cast Away"" is an interesting concept that has been done before, but never quite like this. The film follows a FedEx man (Hanks, in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is stranded on a tropical island in the middle of the ocean after a terrifying plane crash. What follows is his journey to survive with minimal supplies (what he has on the island and a few packages he was to deliver) and no human interaction. Hanks gives a stunning performance and basically the film is little more than a way to show off his amazing versatility as an actor. However, Hanks lacks the material and of course the supporting performers he had in greater films like ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". Helen Hunt is only present in limited screen-time as Hanks' love interest. In all ""Cast Away"" is worth a look for Tom Hanks, but do not expect much more than Tom having conversations with a Wilson volleyball. 4 stars out of 5."

","'Way too long' is the first thing that comes to mind..<br/><br/>If you're going to have a one-person movie, no matter what else you do, don't let that person be annoying, and boy oh boy, does Tom Hanks annoy me!<br/><br/>From a logistic point of view, I find it incredible he could live that long. It seems impossible, but then again if he died there wouldn't be much of an ending, and what's shocking about that ... Even when he gets back home, HE'S STILL BORING!  He's just not a fun guy. <br/><br/>I felt sorry for the volleyball and was glad when he escaped.  I would have done a lot to get away from Gilligan..sorry, I mean Tom.<br/><br/>Seriously, there was good cinematography.  The island probably would have been paradise if the population were more agreeable.  <br/><br/>Now I can see why Russell Crowe won Best Actor for 'Gladiator'. Having seen all the nominees (except Geoffrey Rush) I can honestly say the Academy made a right choice for a change."

","For a start you've got a premiss for a movie that pretty much gives the whole story away before you've even sat down to watch - you know this guy is going to get trapped on a desert island and you know he'll escape (this being Hollywood). So where's the surprise? Where's the hook?<br/><br/>Secondly, you realize this is a weak idea for a movie, pretty soon after Tom Hanks washes up onto the island. See, the beauty of a novel like 'Robinson Crusoe' is that it has the ability to express one man's loneliness on an island through the power of provoking images in your mind as you read. Of course film can't do that, at least not mainstream Hollywood film, so it's left to the director to patronize the audience because he believes we couldn't possibly cope with watching one man never talking, so he makes him talk to a soccer ball. Unbelievably, the director convinces us this is rational by displaying this as some kind of coping with loneliness and the onset of madness.<br/><br/>Another sign of its weakness is the incredibly bad fact that about three quarters of the way through there's a fade-out and the hugely weak concept of a ""FOUR YEARS LATER"" caption appears on screen, and suddenly we're transported to a long curly-haired bearded Hanks who somehow has survived all this time with no account of how.<br/><br/>Worst of all, this movie is disgusting in terms of the intense amount of product placement for FedEx, where their logo is shown in pretty much every shot. Is it a movie or merely a commercial? It doesn't even attempt to do this in a tongue-in-cheek way.<br/><br/>Also, the moment where Tom Hanks struts around banging his chest and shouting ""I have made fire!"" is possibly one of the most unintentionally horribly comic things I've ever seen.<br/><br/>'Cast Away' does score a few points in the fact that it's well shot, the plane crash is great, and it kept me watching, but it's a little too long, and frankly a pretty weak idea with a horrendous amount of product placement."

","A new twist on an old theme stretched to an agonizing two-and-a-half hours. If I had never viewed foreign films that combine intellect, humour grace and spectacular scenery, I might think that Cast Away is a stellar performance.<br/><br/>Sadly, it comes off as the usual white-bread Hollywood mediocrity. It excels at nothing except hype.<br/><br/>If you like movies of men who are stranded on an island, look for the Italian film ""Mediterraneo"" -- warm, funny and you won't even have to look at the FedEX logo a thousand times."

""I can't believe Tom Hanks was on the screen by himself for soooo long""...well I can't believe so many people watched this garbage for soooo long and actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>From what I understand Hanks has wanted to do this movie for a while.  If it meant that much to him he really should have waited untill something better came along from the Hollywood script dept.  Yes he performed a great physical transformation for this movie, but others have done just as well and for much better movies (DeNiro, Raging Bull).  <br/><br/>Tom Hanks has done a great job in some great movies...he now has to try to keep himself known as a great actor...he now has the power to wait untill the next 'gump' or 'private ryan' comes along.  But Hanks answered our question when we asked ""what do you do after playing a role that great in saving private ryan?""  You sign yourself up for ""You've Got Mail"" that's what you do.<br/><br/>They should have stopped after Gump...if ever again I hear the names Zemeckis and Hanks in a trailer I'll run like hell.<br/><br/>If you're interested in seeing some of 2000's best stay away from this highly overrated film.  <br/><br/>""I Have Made FIRE..."" and now I will toss a copy of Cast Away into it..."

","This really is a great film, in which Tom Hanks succeeds again in starring in one of the best intro's to a film ever after Saving Private Ryan. The intro was so good, I almost got sick man and that means something. It really was heavy and much better than The Perfect Storm's disaster scenes. The Island part of the movie was also good and the return to home part was good too. Some people hated the ending though, but I liked it. It could have been longer, but it was still good, although I do not like having to make up my own ending. By the way, for people who think that after Chuck gets home, the movie stops, that ain't so and this can never be, bearing in mind the beginning and the fact that the director is Robert Zemeckis.

","I have heard many people call this Fed-ex add, and i have to agree with them. It seen Fed-ex bosses abuse their workers,they have no lives, their jobs consume them, their family life suffers and even then the packages still go out late. Their planes aren't safe , their pilots are poor , and if they do 'loose' a package, they have no problem opening it to see if there is anything useful inside.<br/><br/>Very exciting start when the plane went down, laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survive the crash from 25,000 feet. Anyone who works in shipping has to wonder why a package being delivered to Texas would have ever been on a Fed-ex plane going over the South Pacific. It wasn't logical.<br/><br/>Last of all,i couls not accept the fact that his girlfriend could turn her back on ""the love of her life"" only one year after he disappeared and married someone else.It actually made me quite angry at the end"

We even held our bellies in belly laughter; it was hysterically funny to us for some reason that I've forgotten this 18 years later.<br/><br/>The next evening I was reading the newspaper at my night shift gas station attendant job when I saw an editorial in the Ottawa Sun about the movie.

","Cast Away has to be the most boring, uninspired movie of 2000. Going into the film (from the previews) I knew that Tom Hanks was going to be involved in a plane crash and stranded on a deserted island. And seeing that Helen Hunt was the supporting star/billing ho, it was pretty obvious that he'd be back to his Memphis home town (where seemingly, a'la Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, everyone has a southern accent except Hanks).<br/><br/>So what happens between that time? Everything you'd expect. He aims to survive. Food, clothing, shelter, Fed Ex shipments... But there is no tension, no drama, no suspense, and despite what Hollywood is hyping as some 20 minutes of gripping silence, there is no good acting. So you end up not caring, and it doesn't get much worse when you don't care what happens to the star of the show.<br/><br/>I felt sorry for Gilligan, he was too inept to rescue himself. But I won't feel sorry for Tom Hanks. Especially if he makes ""Cast Away II.... And the Harlem Globetrotters."""

I distinctly remember one scene where he found a cave for shelter when a sudden storm hit.  He lay exhausted with his newly found flashlight left on.  It wasn't enough to know that the batteries would be dead by the time he woke- they must have wasted a whole minute (seemed like five) showing him sleep with the flashlight on, slowly dimming near the end.

I feel the best way to judge a movie is by who is in the supporting roles.<br/><br/>This movie casts Helen Hunt who herself has made good (As good as it gets) and not so good (Sexual Healing) but also cult favorites (Trancers 1,2,3). A reliable choice but I am sick of seeing this woman this year she was in 1. Dr. T and the Women 2.Pay It Forward and 3. What Women Want all released in the last quarter of the year. We saw so little of her since As Good As it gets and then it seems she took every role that came to her.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast really do not have any drawing power.<br/><br/>So the whole movie rests on Tom's back. Yes he can carry a movie. But can he carry it to the awards any more? I think not.<br/><br/>Tom did a DeNiro by changing his weight. (As many others have eg. Vincent D'Onofrio for full metal jacket) Which is hard to do and losing to look like he did in the movie is much harder then gaining.

They must have paid a fortune for the movie and in the credits - no FedEx to be seen! Thus mark 3 out of 10. Otherwise, it would have been a higher mark! They could have gone for a fictitious parcel delivery firm and they just about might have made it for an Oscar. It's also surprising of Zemeckis to have allowed this... I remain quite puzzled.

","Cast Away tells the not true story of a Fed Ex manager who lives by the clock who has a big plane crash and washes up on a desert island where, get this irony, he has loads of time in which to do nothing! Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex company man through and through, pager in one hand this man thinks, breathes, godammit sweats Fedex. And he's all wrapped up in the chunkiest knitwear possible highlighting his equally chunky frame. He's such a company man that when his pager goes he leaves his big family Christmas dinner because he absolutely must fly to wherever in a Fed Ex Tristar. So this guys a real can-do kinda guy. We see him shouting at his Muscovite employees, and we see him shouting at them in Red Square as they do an impromptu open air Fed-Ex parcel sort to make the last flight out. The next time he's shouting because coconuts are falling off the trees. More of that later. Back to Fed Ex because you can't move for Fed Ex in this film. Its omnipresent. There are even some postal jokes. 'Take 5 days to get there and we'll be US Mail' and 'you wanna be on time, fly UPS!' says the pilot of the doomed plane. The crash is karma for his irony. The ironies on him as all the parcels are late so he may as well be US Mail. There are loads of laughs here. They keep on coming when Chuck Noland has his fateful crash where everyone dies except him. Indeed he doesn't suffer a scratch. He's then washed ashore on a South Pacific island. What to do next? He doesn't find any water for a day which was a nice touch, and he eats a coconut. He finds a torch on a dead pilot, and cuts his feet and hands and legs on coral and doesn't get infected. Its amazing. Its as though he has antibiotics or something to ward of the sickeningly rapid infection that usually occurs in the tropics from untreated coral cuts. You see coral is often living when it cuts your skin, and then it gets in the wound, and the air is hot and moist and before you know it your foot is the size of, for want of comparison, Wilson. Not Chuck. He's so confident in his natural healing process that he uses some bubble wrap as a dressing and his legs don't drop off and he can still walk and doesn't get gangrene. The bubble wrap comes from the parcels washed up on the beach. And as this is a non-stop thrill fest we just can't wait to see what's in the parcels. There's Wilson the ball that becomes his best mate, and some ice skates that form a cutting/dental tool and a ballroom dress with a mesh ideal for fishing (who'd have thought) and ice skates! Ice Skates! On a desert island you see how ironic that is? But these skates look sharp and and then when we watch him trying to light a fire for 10 minutes (36 hours in the film). Four Years Later  and he's Stig of the Dump, and all that chunkiness is now skinny, and he has a caveman beard and curly hair. Ha-ha! His cave is daubed with neanderthal paintings and what-not. All in all he's regressed quite a way. In the end he builds a raft, and loses Wilson (oh no, I ruined the one interesting plot line) and obviously gets rescued. In a nice twist his wife has remarried and had a child and so that relationship is dead. But this is a Robert Zemickis film so you just know there's some schmaltz coming up. You see good ole Chuck didn't open all the parcels on the beach. No, he was a good employee and kept one sealed and the thought of delivering it 'kept him alive for four years'. Any sane man would have opened it. After all, there could have been a solar powered satellite phone in it which would have saved us all a load of bother. So in the final frame he's delivered the phone to some bird we saw at the beginning of the film who's a sculptor who coincidentally created a sculpture just like the logo of Fed Ex and incredibly didn't infringe their copyright. Chuck sees this and likes what he sees and he's now standing on a crossroads literally in the middle of nowhere wondering what to do next though hints have been dropped that he'll be heading back up the dusty track to the sculptress who we know is divorced because we saw her Fed Exing her divorce papers at the beginning of the film which like the beginning of this sentence really does feel like it was four and a half years ago. Tom Hanks takes method acting to a new level in this epic tale of boredom. When a basketball has more character than the star turn then you know there's trouble ahead. Zemeckis has taken the desert island formula and turned it on its head. There's no sex so its not the Blue Lagoon. There's no nudity or drunkenness so its no Castaway, and Tom Hanks is no Brooke Shields or Oliver Reed. All there is is a man going insane in a mildly amusing but ultimately tedious manner. Perfect Sunday night viewing then  undemanding and unintentionally amusing."

Example: people (uh, women) were actually in tears when ""Wilson,"" started to drift away. Am I crazy or was that a ball with a face painted on it?

Grunts and groans, mostly, because, I suspect, these writers or the director knew not to trust Hanks (basically an awful actor) with lines of any meaning.<br/><br/>Look, just stay away from this insult to film making, art, and all of us."

","This was one of the most overrated movies ever, how can anyone have enjoyed this is beyond me. Sure Tom Hanks is a terrific actor, but even he could not ""rescue"" this flick. The scene which he was stranded was as exciting as a Tom Green movie, long, boring and made no sense. I was  hoping for one good note to end the movie on. Well will he get the girl ? No. (too bad). Well how about: WHAT WAS IN THE DAMN PACKAGE THAT YOU KEPT FOR 4 YEARS, That you had to deliver yourself. What was so difficult about giving us an idea to it's contents ? Could the director at least given this a good ending? Well there is hope about this movie, there is not going to be a sequel.

A man's plane crashes into the Pacific. He washes up on an island and is marooned there.
He paints a soccer ball; he found in a Spaulding box; with a Face so he will have something to talk to.......
But I think this part is ridiculous and wouldn't have been done in real life. a person would more likely have found some way to play ball with the ball......like Steve McQueen in the cooler with the baseball in the great escape.<br/><br/>Joe Versus the Volcano is a much better film.

Because it could have been done in a shorter amount of time. The whole movie was just completely depressing-his girl, the only thing that basically kept him alive, turns out to be married and has a kid. And I can't help but think if the schmucks had looked harder for him, or if the plastic thing had floated up sooner, the poor guy could have been spared so much more. Yes, yes, he wouldn't have ""learned,"" but truthfully what did he learn? That his girl wouldn't wait for him, that he wasn't there for his friends, that he could make fire? Yay.

He lives for years on an island, finds his way to live, eat, and survive in ways that we never would have dreamed possible. He befriends a volleyball named Wilson...it's the actual name of the ball. We become so emotionally attached to this character ( played by Tom Hanks), that we feel his every emotion. We feel his pain. We sense his isolation. We see his loneliness. And more then anything, he just wants to get home to his wife. The ending surprised me, and the final scene is extremely haunting, but altogether, I found this movie no less then perfect in every aspect, and Hanks does a great job handling the sensitivity of such character.

","Cast Away is an incredibly beautiful film, boasting one of the best performance's that Tom Hanks has ever given us. The majority of the film takes place on The Island, and the whole film could have fallen flat if Hanks hadn't been believable in his role.<br/><br/>It's really difficult to talk about Cast Away without delving into spoilers. The film is almost twenty years old, but I still don't want to risk ruining it for anyone who might not have seen this masterpiece yet. This means that I can't talk about my favourite scene in the film. It's towards the end, and if you've seen the film then I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Cast Away is riveting, emotional, full of depth, and has a beautiful musical score to accompany it.<br/><br/>I have one extremely minor nitpick to do with the script and Chuck's behaviour after he's been on The Island for four years. He doesn't seem to be as crazy as he was when he first got to The Island, and I would have expected him to be borderline delusional after spending all of that time alone.<br/><br/>But this is one very minor flaw in an otherwise breathtaking movie. It even got us to care about the relationship between a human and a ball (Wilson).<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis hasn't directed anything on this level for a while, but between Cast Away, Back to the Future, and Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has created some of my all-time favourite films and I will be forever in his debt for that.<br/><br/>SCORE: 96%"

","It is a nod to Tom Hanks talent that for the majority of Cast Away the only other object or thing in the movie is a volleyball. I'm sure there will be wags who will glibly compare Cast Away to the likes of ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""Survivor"", but, in tone, approach, and overall accomplishment, this atypical Robinson Crusoe tale bears a strong resemblance to one of director Robert Zemeckis' earlier efforts, Contact. No, Cast Away isn't about space or messages from another planet, but, at its core, neither was Contact. Both films ask the same crucial existential question, one that Shakespeare pondered for years: taking all things into account, what does it mean to be human? How do we cope with loss, hopelessness, and isolation, and still find the courage to face the next day? The love and dream of a dead father sustained Jodie Foster's character in Contact. For Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland in Cast Away, it is the promise offered by the smile of his equally absent - and equally beloved - wife-to-be. A magical experience."

","This movie is about a man who gets stranded on a deserted island. This character is named Chuck, played by Tom Hanks. Chuck works at FedEx flying from country to country making sure that packages get to their destination in the shortest amount of time possible. A couple of days before Christmas he was forced to go on a business trip. As everyone knows that it is always when things are going well that they are bound to go wrong sooner rather than later. Right before he boards the plane he proposes to his girlfriend Kelly, who is played by Helen Hunt. It is on that flight that things go bad. The plane gets trapped in a storm and the pilots are not able to communicate to others through the radio. Somehow after the plane crashing into the ocean, Chuck miraculously survives. Unfortunately the pilots were not as lucky. Eventually while floating on the planes emergency raft, Chuck wakes up to realize that he is on a deserted island in complete loneliness. He then makes a very strong effort to stay alive using every survival skill known to him. He gathers all of the FedEx packages that are washed up onto the beach. At first he plans to keep all of them closed until somebody showed up. Later in the movie he realizes that he might never be found. So he opens up all of the packages except for one and in one of those packages was his new friend: Wilson brand volleyball that he named ""Wilson"".<br/><br/>This movie does an excellent job with the picture and sound. The writers and editors do a great job in making this movie interesting since it is all about one man stuck on an island. Tom Hanks does a tremendous job playing the role of Chuck. It is especially challenging to play this part since there is barely any dialogue. Because of this the writers and editors has to emphasize other aspects. For example, the sound of nature took the biggest role in this movie. There was not one second where you could not hear the sound of the waves crashing into the sand. In this movie Chuck grew as a person and fought for his life every single day. What kept him motivated was his fiancée Kelly. One of the most brilliant aspects of this movie was Wilson. The volleyball that kept him company, kept him motivated, and eventually became his best friend. Apart from adding more to that story, Wilson also helped bring in more dialogue into the movie. In the end of the movie there is an interesting romantic twist that you would have never imagined. This is all explains why this movie is one of the best movies ever made."
"film_riot","6","0","1","6 November 2007"," Cast Away
","The ""Forrest Gump""-team tries another film together and it's not bad, what a surprise. In this first sentence I yet tried to include also the reason why it's not really good. This film takes no risk in nothing. I mean if you have Tom Hanks, you could at least take some risks in your story or in the way you shoot your movie or in the themes you choose to treat. You have Tom Hanks, people would still come and watch it. But instead, Zemeckis is satisfied with pure mediocrity, and delivers us a movie with a little bit of action, a dominating love story, a sad end, a whiny score, and Tom Hanks. To cut it short: A little bit for everybody. I hope Zemeckis is not surprised if someone accuses him of making boring movies some day. Boring through their volitional mediocrity. I repeat: It's not bad what we get here, some parts (the first 20 minutes on the island) were actually good, but who cares? You won the predicate: Film for the whole family."
"TheKurgan65","7","0","1","19 February 2007"," This movie is misunderstood
","Cast Away is probably the most misunderstood movie of the last seven years. It has been called a FedEx commercial, boring, overlong, poorly written, with a terrible ending. All of this misses the point.<br/><br/>First, the movie was not sponsored by FedEx in any way. Zemeckis has stated this from the beginning. FedEx is not the main thrust of the movie anyway. It is merely the means whereby we come to see Chuck's transformation from time-obsessed employee to a deep, introspective thinker who is more emotionally mature than before his time on the island. Additionally, the schtick about the package being delivered ""at all costs"" is wrong. He wasn't delivering the package to its intended destination; he was returning it to sender.<br/><br/>Also, the claims that the movie is poorly written are off base. Part of the reason there is little dialogue is that Chuck has been alone for a long time and has developed the ability to convey meaning and communication with very subtle changes in expression. The main complaint about the ending is that Chuck simply stands in the middle of the crossroads with a stupid expression on his face and doesn't do anything or go anywhere (nor, even know where he is going). This is not the case. If you notice at the beginning when he picks up the package (and first sees the angel wings), there is a sign over the entrance to the farm that says Dick and Bettina. When he returns it to sender later, check out the sign. Dick's name is gone (he's either died or been kicked to the curb). After he drops off the package and Bettina gives him directions (he is at first clueless about her identity), he is still thinking about what to do. He then sees the wings on the back of her pickup truck and, through the enigmatic Mona Lisa smile on his face, remembers that Dick's name is missing from the sign. I just KNOW he follows her down that road to begin a new life after Kelly.<br/><br/>The boring tag simply comes from people used to movies like True Lies and The Bourne Supremacy where there are practically no stretches of more than two minutes without some action sequence. Watch Cast Away again and you'll notice the little things Hanks does to communicate his feelings and emotional scars. His eyes are especially good.<br/><br/>Why did I give this film only a 7? Well, it's because the other characters in the film are just cardboard cutouts meant to further the story around Hands. None of them are memorable (except maybe Lari White in tight blue jeans...almost worth the price of admission herself!!!)."

The setup and delivery of his relationship and the effect his plane crash has on him and his friends life's is well done and how the island is viewed by Noland is very well handled as it comes across that he hates the island for trapping him there but grateful that it's the thing allowing him to stay alive. His escape to sea on his raft and as he looks back on the island the films score marries with he imagery perfectly, and of course Wilson, an Oscar worthy performance from a prop, and luckily the producers didn't go with initial idea of casting Paul Walker in the role of Wilson, they even had a large costume of a volleyball made up."

","I liked the movie. It was thoughtful and adventurous. It was done in a real-time basis that many people can relate to these days(how we get caught up in things like work, time management, etc). Question for movie buffs? what was spraying Chuck while he was on the wood raft? The first time it happened was at night - when he saw the whale. It happens twice more during the day - once when Wilson disappears and once when the ship passes. But it doesn't show what's causing it. Is it just normal ocean spray or is the whale back? Was the whale ""helping"" Chuck? if it was the whale, I think they should've revealed that fact more - it could've been a cool touch."
"Florida2","Null","0","1","9 October 2006"," Thoughts About ""Wilson""
","I did see the movie in the theater, and, did watch it twice on TNT over the weekend, but, the part about Wilson bothered me in the theater, and, it still bothers me - since this was just a volleyball, and, even though I like volleyball and play it often (my serve is just okay), I hope that I'd never make a volleyball into a companion.<br/><br/>My point - in ""reality"", he did bury a man that he knew - aside from saying, ""Well, that's it"" on burying the man's body (without even a decent prayer), it would have made more sense for him to do something that I did just yesterday on visiting my parent's graves (it's their anniversary) - even though in your heart you know that they are not there, another part of you, deep down, does feels comfortable talking to them when standing at the graveside.<br/><br/>In my mind, it would have given Chuck Noland much more comfort if he had talked to this man as often as he felt the need to stand at his graveside, during his time on the island (again, since many people do that every day in real life), and, this brings up another issue - many in real life talk to God every day when alone (I've done this more than once) - why didn't he resort to this, instead of using a rubber ball as a confidant? It gave me the impression that Chuck might not believe in God, since, during the entire film, he never mentioned God once, except as an exclamation (which isn't very useful to anyone), though, sadly, it might have been the filmmaker's attempt to remain ""politically correct"".<br/><br/>I did have to chuckle at the ""4 Year Chuck Noland"" - who looked very much like the ""3 Years Running Forrest Gump""! <br/><br/>Talk about life imitating art - as I typed this, the FedEx truck just pulled up, and, I signed for one small (but dry) FedEx box, and, one FedEx envelope - the man didn't look like Ramon, Fyodor or Chuck...<br/><br/>Take care, <br/><br/>Frank <br/><br/>P.S. Did anyone notice Joe Conley's (Ike Godsey from ""The Waltons"") in the role of Joe Wally, in the Christmas Eve dinner table scene? Apparently, the Director even gave Joe the courtesy of having a line that everyone could hear, since all went silent during his comment to Chuck - on checking on this site, sure enough, it was Joe Conley..."
"aliceboy","7","0","1","25 September 2006"," Cartoons run the world!
","I have to give more credit to cartoons for my cinematic education than I tend to like to admit. If it hadn't been for my early love of Warner Bros. cartoons, I probably never would have seen many of the films from the '40s that I have, and almost certainly wouldn't have entered my longtime infatuation with filmmakers like Welles and Hitchcock. 'The Simpsons' got me to watch more current classics to get their injokes, and now 'Family Guy' has brought the trend up to the newest films. So, that's why I watched 'Cast Away' when it came on television, though I otherwise had no other interest in it. And once again, I have to thank cartoons for broadening my horizons just that bit farther. I won't rehash the story of 'Cast Away,' since it's surely been done enough on this site and even if it hadn't it's pretty much in the title! I will simply say Tom Hanks has done another surprising job while staying within the confines of his nonacting (the only time I've seen him be other than 'Tom Hanks as...' was probably 'The Road to Perdition'), and that's fortunate since he has the responsibility of carrying most of this film himself. The story is another 'Robinson Crusoe' kind of affair, with a volleyball standing in for Friday. If I have any issue with this movie, it's that it didn't follow more truly the formula of such films: too much in-society, not enough cast-away. And that's IF I have an issue with it... This is not a great film. The direction is utterly straightforward and the writing is only as good as it needs to be. The ending is a little much after what is a fairly simple concept tale, but I'll leave it at that. So, see 'Cast Away' if you've nothing better to do. At the very least, it'll give you a leg up on the latest parodic cartoons. At the most, it's a decent enough picture that won't make you feel like you've wasted the last hour and a half...like 'Coyote Ugly.'"
"wsanders","3","0","4","19 August 2006"," What went wrong?
","What, exactly, went horribly awry in this film? Was it the hideously inappropriate corporate product placement? Was it the studious solemnity of Tom Hank's performance, and the resulting uncomfortable laughter at dental procedures and love for volleyball? The sheer obviousness of the film's attempts to grab at our heartstrings? Was the ending much admired in France? The whole caboodle looked great ""on paper"" I am sure. Robinson Crusoe! Rip van Winkle! Tom Hanks! Somewhere, in committee, were the makings of something that looked fine, yet, in its execution, went terribly wrong. No discredit to Broyles or Hanks, but the rest is left at as an exercise for film students and fans - excellent fodder for - what the heck happened with this? Like a fine wine, corked."
"PeterJordan","4","0","2","9 August 2006"," Should have been called ""Survival"" if only for the effort to get through it
","Cast Away strikes me as a movie that Hollywood decided predominantly to make to cash in on the huge success of the ""Survivor"" type reality TV programs which began in the late 90's which, to me, seems a fairly lame and mercenary reason to make a movie. Of course it also gives rise to the natural survival instinct question ""what would I do if I was in his shoes?"" and this however was a reason to approach this movie with anticipation.<br/><br/>Much was made of Tom Hanks preparation for his role in this movie which at the time put him in contention for another Oscar - If he had won, then I think his main co star for much of the movie - a character called Wilson should also have received the award for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>The basic premise of Cast Away introduces us to FedEx Problem Solver and Logistics Man, Hanks who at the beginning of the film in a typically condescending American way, enlightens both us and a pitiful crowd of Russian Fed Ex employees of how important time is and how ""we live and die by the clock"" Meanwhile, while our hero Hanks is shooting round the world in air freight jets, his patient, and it seems long suffering fiancée Helen Hunt waits uncomplainingly back in Memphis, USA. Of course he jets home in time for Christmas only to be beeped off again on Christmas night leaving only the shortest time for exchange of presents before he flies off again promising faithfully to be back for New Year.<br/><br/>Of course we know that he won't be.<br/><br/>After the plane crashes our hero Hanks emerges relatively unscathed as the only survivor from the plane wreck onto a tiny volcanic island jutting out of an expansive Pacific with no population save for a few coconut and palm trees and the few Fed ex boxes that wash up on his private beach. Being a man of the modern world to whom time is of the essence, the survival instinct in our hero takes quite a bit of time to click in and even when it does it tends to manifest or reveal itself in the most basic, juvenile and pathetic of ways.<br/><br/>Eventually Hanks begins to show a bit of initiative by utilizing what he can from the salvaged Fed Ex boxes, but even here on this futile desert Island, his illogical enslavement to corporate America and time remains when he retains one of the parcels un-opened so that he can deliver it ""some time in the future"".<br/><br/>In at least something of a nod to other much better thought out ""survival type"" pieces of literature and movies, Hanks sets out in a quest for fire and companionship.<br/><br/>The companionship comes relatively easily in the guise of the aforementioned Wilson which manifests itself in the shape of a volleyball which bears a crude face when he accidentally smears it with his blood. His quest for fire of course is a considerably more involved and convoluted procedure.<br/><br/>In that context, whilst it is very irritating, it's not altogether surprising to have the movie very suddenly jump on a whole four years, and to discover that, save for losing a lot of weight and growing a lot of very shaggy hair, our ""hero"" Hanks has in fact moved on very little from his first few days. Indeed the growing incredulity of the film at this stage is further established when then, after four years, a piece of a Portaloo washed up on his island suddenly seemingly overnight finally inspires Hanks to try and get off the island.<br/><br/>His survival instinct and initiative which seems to have little progressed or developed in the intervening four years then suddenly kicks into gear again and he does display some encouraging enterprise in building a raft from logs and video tape and a rope which we learn he'd contemplated to use in his suicide sometime in the four years (It could have been a much better movie if we'd had more time to find out the specifics of why he didn't).<br/><br/>Of course it's no real surprise to reveal that he does succeed in his escape and is delivered into his rightful place back in the civilized world again, though in another bit of appalling continuity his undoubtedly required psychological and physical rehabilitation is compressed into a simple and casual but very irritating ""Four weeks later"" flashed across the screen.<br/><br/>Back in the real world however, life and also unfortunately, his fiancée, has moved on, so Hanks is confronted with a new set of realities, in addition to the added trauma of merely trying to readjust to normal life. Of course, out of its more comfortable and familiar setting on the island, the movie again begins to lose its way and even threatens a sickly sweet Hollywood ending but even fumbles that ball and ends up pretty inconclusively really which the malicious or cynical part of me might speculate could have ""Sequel"" or ""Prequel"" or even ""Interval - The intervening four years"" written on it.<br/><br/>This was one of those movies that had its wonderful potential most irritatingly buried by getting such things as too many story lines and a striving towards ""Oscar status"" again for Tom Hanks get in the way of writing a concise and tightly knit story of survival in the face of awful odds and more especially the psychological effects of loneliness and isolation and a study of the primeval instincts of survival in man. This movie only briefly flirted with any of these subjects and if it had even chose to concentrate on one of them it could have been great."

","I do like Tom Hanks. He puts in a fine acting stint here, almost a tour de force.<br/><br/>But why don't movie-makers, especially Directors, take remedial classes in Basic Physics? Usually I am quite forgiving of trivial mistakes, but this one in ""Cast Away"" rather spoiled the entire film for me. As the doomed FedEx jet heads, in what appears to be a damned steep dive, into the Pacific Ocean, our hero is facing the cockpit, watching, through the pilot's window, the ocean's surface rapidly approaching. At impact, any non-secured object (e.g. our hero) would experience, with the plane's interior as our reference system, a tremendous acceleration FORWARD (basic Physics), i.e. towards the water. Yes, virtually instantly accelerated to maybe 125-150 mph, depending on how fast the jet was moving. This would quite quickly be followed by a similar DEceleration as this moving thing (our hero) hit some immovable object, e.g. the pilot's window, now buried in the water.<br/><br/>But these basic laws of Physics apparently do NOT apply to our hero; he gets propelled BACKWARDS, at a velocity that is definitely not death-dealing. All the other guys in the plane die, probably due to that instant acceleration / deceleration, but NOT our hero!<br/><br/>I tend to rate movies highly I can watch over and over again. I just can't watch this one more than once, at least until maybe a month goes by. Our hero's suffering is just too darned interminable...<br/><br/>*Sigh*"

","It is a great movie. Much of my feelings have been shared already so won't repeat.<br/><br/>It is however very unfortunate that the shadows of the Sun at the end don't reflect what the the body language seems to indicate.<br/><br/>One is given the impression that Tom will be reaching out to the stain-glass artist but the shadow of the sun is ""Casted"" over Tom's right side of the face. In the previous footage when the car stops at the crossroads, it is facing South -according to her indications of the roads later on- and the sun casts the shadows on the right side of the car. It seems like it will be around 9:30 AM in a Texas morning but then when he decides where to go, his face is logically looking South. Therefore he is not going North emptiness all the whole length to Canada.<br/><br/>Is this an error in the movie, or is it intentional, meaning, he loves Kelly so much that he is going South no matter what?

"rar2","10","0","1","3 August 2005"," I'm not one to give out a ten; however . . .
","""The Oscar goes to . . . Russell Crowe."" Honestly the only man that could have beaten Hanks, or at least could have contended with him (no pun intended) did. ""Gladiator"" was amazing, as was Crowe, but come on. How much dialogue did Hanks have? And yet three hours felt no more than a breezy and tight hour and a half movie. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Hanks was just plain fat to start this movie and admits it was done purposely. He and Helen Hunt make an abnormal couple initially, a bit awkward, but solid acting by both makes it very, very real rather quickly. Frears reluctance amidst Noland's patience in union, ironically because it is usually the other way around, gives substance to their relationship. Both are passionate individuals who want each other more that they need each other. I believe they love each other.<br/><br/>Chuck's best friend in the movie is very sincere and earnest. Hanks' realizes how time obsessed he is with his job, then realizes he has let his best friend down. He has an inability to really offer emotional support. That gets tested and amazingly and intimately delved into later in the film.<br/><br/>During Christmas Noland's job calls him and one of the most amazing wreckage scenes (in terms of believably and realism, not morbidness) ensues leaving Chuck to float aimlessly, like his structured life, to a deserted island. A simple idea already used; however, Hanks is outstanding here.<br/><br/>His first instincts are pretty natural for he is not trying to survive, but merely hold over. We see him slowly give up hope of being rescued and turn over to staying alive. Noland finds some FedEx pieces and they literally, figuratively, and emotionally keep him alive, but for how long? Isolation is a killer and that is where Hanks co-star comes in. Hanks goes from outstanding to who will beat me for an Oscar (which was Crowe of course)? Time passes and Chuck's exterior is concurrent with time elapsed, including the makeup. Chuck's sun lesions to his bleached hair gives Hanks tremendous grit and believable desperation. Noland's mind remains very sharp and trivia on this site allow for some of the implausibilities, but certainly not impossibilities, from taking this movie down a notch. Also it is obvious Chuck is knowledgeable, learns continuously through observation, and travels enough that observation seems to occur quite a bit.<br/><br/>The best part is when Chuck is forced to give us backfill. It is an organization tool that doesn't detach or break up the movie. My credit is to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for keeping this movie sharp until the end. The whole crew was meticulous and brilliant as seen in the ""making of special"" at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The beauty of the island, of spiritually, of fate through choice is all explored here. And personally only Tom Hanks could have done it: which is the definition of Oscar."
"beantaro","1","0","11","4 July 2005"," Movie stinks
","I felt like I cast away my money on the ticket. Very little happened on the Island. Tom Hanks was probably more interested in getting to his next feature film instead of doing a quality job of acting in this film. This is a problem with top tier actors. Too many films to star in and not enough time to spend doing a quality job in all of them. The producer thinks that having Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in a film is going to get people into the theater no matter what quality film is produced. The funny thing is that both actors are ""A"" list actors. This film lacks originality, creativity, and is boring. This is more of a drama, than an action film. Tom Hanks is great in Saving Private Ryan and Forest Gump. If you read this review try checking those out."
"The_Void","8","0","1","5 June 2005"," Engaging and very powerful
","Cast Away is the sort of film that filmmakers should be striving to give their audiences more often. While it's not wholly original, and influences from the classic Robinson Crusoe story especially shine through, we haven't seen all that many films of this nature in recent years and therefore this is a refreshing yarn. Tom Hanks stars as the businessman unlucky enough to find himself stranded, all alone, on an island in the middle of nowhere. Completely cut off from any kind of society, our hero must do all he can to survive the elements that he has found himself in. Unlike most films that we've seen Hanks in before, this performance is very much of a physical nature, and his lack of dialogue gives the actor a very different feel to what he usually evokes from the audience. Tom Hanks had to work hard to give this performance, as the role requires a lot of hard work; but he's risen to the challenge excellently, and this movie has given me more respect for the actor I, at one time, didn't have any respect for at all.<br/><br/>The way that Robert Zemeckis draws us into the protagonist's plight is really well done, and throughout the movie you almost feel like you are marooned on the island as well. I was sat transfixed with the action on screen, and my viewing of this movie marks one of the most engaging I've ever had in my film watching career. It's amazing how Hanks can be sat talking to a volleyball with grass stuck to it's head and have the audience engrossed in the action. Ironically, Hanks talking to a volleyball was much more interesting than any conversations he had with real actors in movies such as Philadelphia and Apollo 13. The film is very realistic throughout, and this helps the movie no end when it comes to drawing the audience in as this could very much be a documentary feature of a true story; such is the realism of the picture. It comes across most evidently in the scenes that see Hanks writhe in pain after gashing his leg on a stray rock in the ocean. We actually FEEL his pain, and that is testament to the power of this movie. It took me five years to finally catch this film, and even then it was only by accident. If I was you and I hadn't seen this film yet, I'd do so ASAP."

","Like a Shakespearean play, the different layers of the story cannot be taken in from a one-time viewing of Castaway.

I ended up watching it again with my five year-old son. When Wilson floated away, my son began to cry. Then I began to cry! Damn, my kid got it, and I had missed it. My son understood how ""real"" an imaginary friend is because he was still a child. Hanks has a rebirth on the island and is stripped down to an infantile state. He becomes a child once again. His entire re-evolution is fascinating. I have watched it at least 8 times since and pick up little pieces that I had not caught before. Like a Shakespearean play, there are layers to this one... Just because the film isn't obvious does not make it ""slow."" It's amazing what we expect from movies. I expect a story! This is a story of becoming a human being and learning to live a genuine life. I love it, and still tear up. Give it a second viewing. Look at the symbolism, gestures, and expressed emotions. Pay attention to the details (like the ""birthday card""). Almost a perfect story! Some people simply won't get it. I think even the main character (Nolan at the beginning of the film) would be too ""deadened"" to understand it... It is only through his ""tragedy"" that he becomes a true observer of the gift that life is. That might even be one of the layers. Bravo!!!"

Tom Hanks plays a distraught man experiencing a tragedy. he spends years alone on an island, and returns to find the love of his life gone. the casting is perfect, and all the acting is wonderful. although, i found this movie could be a little long and boring. some have said ""nothing really happens"". this movie isn't very action-pact, but i strongly recommend this movie."

","Robert Zemekis and Tom Hanks pull off this magnificent film seemingly without much effort. The movie stars really one man, and takes place really on one island. So what makes it so good? For starters, this movie is very original. At first, who wants to see a movie about a guy stuck on an island? No one. BUT then you ask... who wants to see a movie about a man who struggles against his environment forces to make friends with a volleyball and desperate to escape to see his long lost wife after five years... well everyone! Tom Hanks should have been at least up for an Oscar for this performance. It was truly remarkable. Not only was this movie very good, but it was also popular. Wilson volleyballs will never seem the same after watching this movie. :)"

","Any one reading my comments will quickly notice the common denominator - Mr. Tom Hanks. This might make people think my comments would be biased as I am clearly a fan but then there was SPLASH, enough said.<br/><br/>I have seen the film about 5 times but the last time was the best. Not only did a few loose bits fall in to place (two names above the ranch entrance at the beginning then ...) but i seemed to experience all the emotions of every character as they played out. I nearly cried when he cried on the raft over Wilson ( OK I actually did) and when Kelly was beside herself at the Airport reunion I wanted to reach out and help her do the right thing. (for us anyway) The jeep/taxi scene at the end was magnificent and the rain made all the difference. Then the way he spills out his emotions at the realisation of losing Kelly again was just superb. <br/><br/>As always see the film for yourself and make up your own mind. <br/><br/>For me, 10/10 Top of the class Mr. Hanks, Ms. Hunt a close second."

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Cast Away"" is a concept that could not have possibly been imagined without some of the most brilliant and touching acting talent around, as the audience would otherwise be bored to tears in watching an ordinary man stranded on an island for the duration of about two hours. Luckily for us, the wise and gifted Robert Zemeckis decided to re-team from ""Forrest Gump"" with one of the best actors in Hollywood, to produce a film that is propelled by emotion, engagement, and enthrallment through acting. This is a simple story about a man constantly in a haste (he's a Fed-Ex manager!), who is about to get engaged to his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), yet before he proposes to her, must venture around the globe on one last delivery stop before Christmas. This is when we find Hanks stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere, as his plane suffers from turbulence and is shot down from the sky, the pilots killed instantly. It is difficult to adapt to the conditions of solitude and living the life of a productive castaway, but Chuck Noland (Hanks) manages to find coconuts (albeit struggling to crack them open), catch fish, build fires, rafts, and ""rescue me"" flags, and apparently survives for four years on the island, living the same routine every day. His survival is stemmed from his hope, in his remembrance of his love Kelly (Hunt) (through observing a Rolex watch with her picture inside), determination (promising to deliver a lost package when he leaves the island), and companionship (he befriends a volleyball, which he appropriately names, Wilson, as ""somebody"" to converse with). Hanks delivers one of the most human, convincing, and heartfelt performances you will ever behold, proving here that he is just as brilliant in playing a castaway as he is a mentally-deficient savant. My complaints of the film bely in the resolution. The initially endearing premise of romance between Hanks and Hunt becomes particularly wanton and confusing, and unfortunately, amounts to virtually nothing. We understand that life has changed dramatically after four years of desolation and survival, and by the end, we would rather see Chuck Nolan back on the island, living adventures with Wilson, and making the best of life, rather than confronting an apathetic and ungrateful society who hardly cares about him after four years of estrangement. Absorbing direction, excellent acting, decent enough screenplay, weak and tarnished resolution; ""Cast Away"" is focused near shore, lost back on land, yet overall, a decent, engaging experience. *** out of ****"

","Just as i began watching this movie, firstly i had no idea that at the end of it, i would feel emotion towards it. For me, it quite simply showed what an amazing and influential actor Tom Hanks is when he was the only character viewed for most of the movie (along with Wilson). It was just Tom for a long period of time...and that was bliss. Towards the end just as tom is escaping from the island leading into his now, Re-married wife Kelly..it made me so sad in parts such as him losing Wilson (how i got sad at him losing his ball i have no idea) but, him losing Kelly and accepting that she cannot be with him, really brought emotion towards the film.

Aside from this, I have been able to connect with the underlying theme of the movie with Hanks' character having to struggle with, not only survival, but solidarity as he fought to get off the island to return to a woman already gone.

But one night when Chuck was delivering packages during a nasty thunder storm, lighting hit the plane and it crashed! So then Chuck gets abandoned on this island and spends the next 4 years surviving on a island!

"DanB-4","Null","0","1","28 February 2004"," Two Movies In One
","Cast Away was two films - one that I very much liked sandwiched between two that I found dull.<br/><br/>As it opens, Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a time obsessed slightly rotund Fed Ex executive. He has everything is life - a good family, a good job, a nubile girlfriend (Hunt). He leaves on Christmas eve for an undefined emergency and has to fly overseas. The plane goes down and the meat of the movie begins.<br/><br/>The second act of Cast Away is brilliant. Hanks is marooned on a island after the plane crash and director Robert Zemeckis makes some very daring moves to strand us with him. No music. Noe other characters. No animals to befriend. And most importantly, no flashbacks to life back home without him. The only other cast member is a volleyball that Hanks uses to maintain his sanity.<br/><br/>The acting here is particularly great, since it is so isolated. We get to sense the various stages that he goes through - shock, desperation, survival, a touch of insanity. This is a performance that truly draws you in.<br/><br/>From this point the movie slides down a rather slippery slope of mediocrity largely due to the performance of Hunt. I have seen Cast Away a few times, and I am so exhilarated by the second act and so let down by the third. See it for yourself and you can judge.<br/><br/>Still, the Cast Away's middle act occupies the lion's share of the film and makes the entire experience more than worthwhile. *** out of ****."

We are with him from the beginning and we find ourselves caring for the character so much.

","First things first - to that guy from Ireland who claimed Hanks was 'still fat' after four years on the island, i suggest you go get your eyesight checked. He looked very much NOT fat, he looked as a person would look after four years of a coconut/crab/fish diet. If you expected him to look like gandhi, then you're out of your mind - he DID eat out there. If you expected him to look like some track and field athlete, you're again out of your mind - people who don't partake in an excercise program coupled with a balanced diet don't actually look like that, didn't you know?<br/><br/>As to the movie, well made, brilliant acting by Hanks, the first half hour was a bit too long, 20 minutes would have sufficed. As to the ending, I don't buy the 'love of my life' talk. If Chuck was the love of Kelly's life, she could have full well dumped the dentist. People get divorced over issues far more trivial than the love of one's life returning from death. Abandoning one's husband doesn't mean abandoning one's child. And speaking of the child, from the pictures around the house, she looked to be about 3-4 years old. Seems she got pregnant rather hastily after the crash and subsequent shacking up with Chris Noth. Okay, would be wholly plausible, but Zemeckis directs, and Hunt acts in a way to make the character a person for whom Hanks WAS the love of her life, so she just lets it go 'for the children'?"
"gro","7","0","1","29 December 2000"," Well, Hanks is good.
","There are movies that are part very good but in the whole unsatisfying. This is one.  The plane crash and struggle to the island are well shot.  Hanks is great in his struggle to survive on the island both physically and mentally. Wilson as a companion and primitive god is a good device.  Unfortunately the love story that surrounds the action in the movie's construction is too thin and doomed from the outset to eliminate any reasonably ""happy"" or meaningful conclusion. Two people pretty well absorbed by their respective careers, Hanks a Fedex exec and Hunt working on a PhD, cannot quite find time or the full commitment to formalize their relation. A dramatic accident that creates the action and one person show for Hanks. Finally, rescue after 4 years and confrontation with Hunt who has moved on. Hunt however does deliver both a ""you are the love of my life"" speech and a ""I had a really hard time after you were lost"" line.  Please.  How could Hanks have a meaningful relationship with Hunt if she honestly believed that her hard times had any comparative aspect to being lost on an island for 4 years of near Hellish suffering? Who can believe that Hanks would want or expect Hunt to leave a husband(why cast ""Big"" from Sex in the City?) and child?  The three items that kept Hanks going were Wilson ( a mixture of god and inner values), the package ( a commitment) and the picture of Hunt (love interest).  In the end he's left Hunt, delivered the package and lost Wilson.  Yes he can wander any of the roads open to him as in a new life. No, it doesn't make sense or pull the movie together."

","Watch the ads for Robert Zemeckis' new movie and you'd think that this is a movie about a man stranded on a deserted island, a la Robinson Crusoe. So did I, but Tom Hanks' character doesn't wind up on the island until a good 20 minutes of filler material have been used. Filler material, in most movies, is the kind of plot information that seems superfluous at first but is later tied into the plot itself. So we're 20 minutes into a movie and finally see Chuck Noland (Hanks) on the island. You can see where this review is headed, can't you? <br/><br/>First off, there's the title. Cast Away? Why not Castaway? Why make it into two words? A puzzlement, to be sure. I know, I know... nitpicking! No, it's not! If it's two words, it says to me someone has been cast away - but Chuck hasn't been cast away, he's been marooned. Maybe the makers didn't want anyone to confuse it with the Survivor TV show. I think they should have gone with the one-word title, but hey - that's just me.<br/><br/>The movie is a little over two hours long, and in the bulk of that time we follow Chuck's exploits on the island. We see his trials, his failures, his successes, and his thought processes. And it all really is mesmerizing, as long as you suspend some of your logic processes. This happens with a lot of action/adventure type movies, because the focus is on what's happening, not why it's happening. Sometimes you'll see an illogical chain of events in an action movie, and you'll dismiss it because you're there to see the action, not to be bothered with the plot. Well, friends, I am bothered by it! I wondered how Chuck survived the plane crash and why he got out what looked like everything in his pocket just before the plane hit turbulence but once the trouble started he only grabbed his precious pocket watch. I wondered if I was watching a long commercial for Federal Express (see how many logos you can spot). <br/><br/>I've seen some people say this is one of the top movies of the year. Sorry, I can't see that. It's fun to watch, but the compelling stuff in the middle is surrounded by a beginning and an end that slow down the pacing of the film immeasurably. Sure, I care about Chuck's beau Kelly (Helen Hunt), and I know that setting up their relationship at the outset is somewhat important. But it's more than a little contrived when his last words to her before jumping on the plane are ""I'll be right back."" Come on! All of the supporting plot surrounding his adventures on the island seems to be horribly contrived, as if someone said, ""Great, love the whole island thing, now throw in some more stuff  so we can get over 2 hours out of it."" I mean it all seems almost tacked on, and it's all too pat. I will say this much, though: the ending is NOT cliched.<br/><br/>Hanks is better than I expected. He's not really the adventurer type, is he? In some scenes, with his scraggly beard and makeshift clothing, he looks like Lawrence of Arabia or maybe Moses from The Ten Commandments. He effectively shows emotion, determination, perseverence, wit, and ingenuity. I'd also say he ages well, too, but then you have to remember Robert Zemeckis filmed this movie in two installments so he could do What Lies Beneath; this layoff allowed Hanks to transform from girly man Fed Ex dude to strapping strongman (sort of). Everyone else is just extraneous. This is Tom's game."

"shaun98","6","0","1","13 April 2002"," Two-thirds of a good movie (major spoilers)
","In my opinion, it's Tom Hanks' performance that makes the film work, at least up until the third act. When we first see him, he is a modern, civilized man. He is concerned with doing his job smoothly and on time. He romances the woman he loves. In other words, he is much like any normal person.<br/><br/>However, that one fateful night changes his life forever. A storm downs his plane in the ocean. The only survivor of the disaster, he must learn to adapt to solitary life on a small island. Tom Hanks does an excellent job in making the transition believable. Before seeing it, I was worried about how the scenes with ""Wilson"" the volleyball would turn out. However, I now realize that given the circumstances, it was about all that he could do to prevent his own insanity. (It's not like he had to worry about how others would perceive him)<br/><br/>With this in mind, the first two acts are often effective. However, just when I was getting into it, ""Cast Away"" takes a wrong turn and descends into predictable melodrama. Helen Hunt does a decent acting job, but alas, most of her scenes should have been written out of the script. In fact, it would've been better to end the film with a long shot of Chuck adrift on his raft, which would've lent it an air of ambiguity.<br/><br/>**1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Dreamworks Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox"

","I was sure that I'd like this picture because it had a Robinson Crusoe feel to it, and because I love Tom Hanks.  Sad to say, it didn't do much for me. Part of the reason has already been said by others, but in addition to those comments [the last third of the movie being not very engaging, the other characters being too flat, etc] I had a bigger problem.  There were two major actions for which I didn't understand the motivation [more later] and [POSSIBLE SPOILER!] I felt gypped by having 4 years cut out of the middle. I was really getting involved with the character, his frustrations, the coping-methods he was discovering, etc. and then he is replaced by a bearded stranger who can do anything, preceded by the words ""four years later"".  His coming to terms with his aloneness in battling the semi-hostile elements was the best part of the film.  So why did the director fast-forward the film to hurry to an unsatisfactory conclusion? But my big objection was that two pivotal actions were never explained. Why did he leave one package unopened, how did he choose that particular one, and how did it save his life?  I'm not normally obtuse, but I could only guess at the reason. I would have appreciated a little more of a hint. The other enigma was the ending.  There is a verbal exchange between Tom and the person to whose house he has just left the package, and they have this brief verbal exchange delivered like lines from King Lear, full of portent. Was that supposed to be a metaphor for something I didn't get? This movie left a lot to be desired -- and explained."

"jlkeene","5","0","1","25 December 2001"," Superb Acting, Thin Story, Great Portrayal of Memphis
","As a native of Memphis, I am thrilled that my hometown was (accurately) portrayed as a modern city where people don't live in manufactured housing nor talk as though they'd walked off the set of ""Hee Haw"".  Contrast that with the treatment of Memphis in John Grisham's ""The Client"" and ""The Firm"".<br/><br/>
I enjoyed the first section of the movie -- the scenes set in Russia and in Memphis.  Director Robert Zemeckis gave an adequate overview on the fast-paced lives and dreams of Chuck (Tom Hanks) and Kelly (Helen Hunt). <br/><br/>
For the first part of his island stay, I was interested in watching Chuck survive using the various items at his disposal.  While some scenes were quite interesting, many of the island scenes were very tiring to watch.  I am normally appreciative of a good long film (Kubrick's 2001 is a favorite of mine), but there were many scenes that could have been cut out without abandoning the plot.  My wife and I deliberated on hitting the fast-forward button on the DVD player many times during the island scenes.<br/><br/>The ending portion of the movie was indeed emotional, but largely a waste of film.  Zemeckis put forth too much effort in exhibiting the emotional sides of the characters in the final 20 minutes, and didn't bother with the task of actually coming up with a conclusion.  From the beginning of the Memphis homecoming scene to the end of the movie, the story is at a standstill. Zemeckis could have better used this time to give the audience a better insight into what Chuck plans for his future instead of turning it into a big pity-party.  Zemeckis could have even tacked on an extra half-hour to show Chuck's reimmersion into life in Memphis.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, this was the Tom Hanks Show and Hanks was outstanding.  Helen Hunt was her usual mediocre self -- slightly better than Wilson the Volleyball -- and nowhere near her excellent performance in As Good As It Gets.<br/><br/>On a personal note, one message I gathered from this movie is to not take what you have for granted.  Chuck had to re-invent fire and become friends with a volleyball to cover his basic needs for warmth, food, and companionship.  Always be appreciative of your loved ones.  Instead of putting in that extra few hours at the workplace, spend that time with your family.  You'll be very glad you did."

After completing the movie, I thought to myself, ""Was it really that good?""<br/><br/>*spoiler*<br/><br/>""Cast Away"" surprised me a little. The acting was questionable in some scenes and the special effects did not seem to par, due to some of the unimpressive CGI effects during the plane crash. I didn't find some of the scenes to be too interesting either. Let's face it, Tom Hanks talking to a volleyball is not exciting. Neither is him wondering around an island getting injured once and a while and then finally finding some dumb and unbelievable method to find his way to sea and become rescued.<br/><br/>The ending had its moments and was a twist that relieved the strain off my eyes from staring at a beach and water for an hour and fifteen minutes.

","Good Points:  About the only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was, overall, well made.  Robert Zemeckis makes a good movie any way you slice it, and no one can debate Tom Hanks' acting prowess.  The rest of the cast did well also.  <br/><br/>Bad Points:  But there it ends.  There's nothing in Cast Away that hasn't been done already.  You've got your typical 'stranded on a desert island' theme coupled with the 'trying to return to a life after years of being out in left field somewhere' idea, and it just makes for a rehash of old plot devices.  And, I'm sorry, but ANYONE in their right mind would have ripped open that package in record time in case anything it held could aid in survival instead of keeping it intact so that it could be later delivered (you know...on the off chance you DON'T starve to death) with a burst of pride for a job well done.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  I swear, every time Hollywood uses some idiotic plot device just to do something tear-jerking, the heart of creativity dies a little more.  Tom didn't seem to have a problem ripping open the rest of them now, did he?  A REAL Fed Ex man would have kept them all!  (Sh'yeah...and pigs might fly outta my butt!)<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  Unless you're a Tom Hanks fanatic, don't waste your time.  And if you are, broaden your horizons for pity's sake.

First of all, the trailer gives way too much of the plot away, including the fact that Chuck is rescued, and he ends seeing Kelly again (the trailer has enough sense not to give away what Kelly did for the time he was gone).  I got that Chuck, being a control freak about time, has to reevaluate when he realizes what little control he has over anything.  I even picked up on the use of the Elvis Presley songs in the movie.

So it's a little hard to be tugged by a MOVIE(not reality)when something sad happens. But even this, at the end tugged me, yet also made me happy at the same time. I've never had the same experience before. I've only had a little tug by the perfect storm, but I wasn't happy at the same time..it's weird, but when you watch the movie you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>(some minor spoilers) The plot is a fed ex employee played by Tom Hanks, has everything going well in his life. right before he boards a plane to go on a business trip for fed ex, he gives an engagement ring to his girlfriend(Helen Hunt), so after he gets back, you get the feeling she'll probably say yes. The plane he's on get's offline, and hits a storm, and they end up crashing. After surviving a very realistic crash, he awakens on a deserted island. Being the business man that he is though, he walks around and pickes up the fed ex packages that washed ashore(there are only a few). Later in the movie he opens them, and uses a pair of ice skates to open coconuts, a dress I think to use as mocasins, and Wilson the volleyball as a friend. It's a very realistic movie, of what would happen to you and your life being on an island for four years, and how much your life would of changed back home. And for those who have seen this movie, the Wilson's death scene, for some reason makes you sad, because you realize at that point, that that is what kept him going the whole time. Or else he would of gone insane. You realize, what it would be like to be with some ball 24/7/365 four years, and then have it just float away. It's like losing a family member. I think anyone who's seen this movie can admit that. I really enjoyed this movie and it's definitely in my top 50 favorite movies(although it would be about half way, no farther) I for some reason just really like this movie.

","The last time Tom Hanks teamed up with director Robert Zemeckis the result was `Forrest Gump'.  I can safely say this is no `Forrest Gump'.  FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting.  This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.<br/><br/>The initial premise was intriguing.  A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive.  At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment. However, after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits, the film begged for a cut to somewhere else.  There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles.  There was the search and rescue, and Kelly's (Helen Hunt) coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected.<br/><br/>Instead, Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time, which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance, became just a bit more Tom than I could stand.  Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances.  Unfortunately, the film became one-dimensional and began to bog down.  The ending brought no relief from the drudgery, leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was in top form.  He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth).  It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt.  She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months.  This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.<br/><br/>The film grossed over $200 million, which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough.  I rated it 7/10.  The one-dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks."
"sddavis63","7","0","1","15 July 2001"," A Good Movie Marred By A Very Weak Ending
","I have to confess right off that I find the basic premise of this movie difficult to believe. I just really do not accept that with modern satellite technology, etc., there could be very many unknown islands anywhere in the world. True, the reason that Chuck Noland, played by Tom Hanks, couldn't be found was that his plane had veered off course, and no one was looking for him in the area he was found in. OK. Maybe. But I still find it hard to accept.<br/><br/>Setting that aside, I enjoyed most of this movie. Tom Hanks showed again why he is one of Hollywood's best in what for most of the movie is a one-man show. He manages to hold the attention of the viewer as we root for him in his struggle for survival. Noland, a hard-driving FedEx executive obsessed with time and his work suddenly, after a plane crash leaves him stranded on an island, finds himself with too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The island becomes for him a school of hard knocks as he learns how to survive on his own with just the basics. Hanks does a great job with this part, and especially compelling is the relationship Noland develops with ""Wilson"" the volleyball - a relationship that brings forth both laughs and a few tears from anyone watching. Humour in a largely difficult movie is also brought forth by Noland's obsessive decision to sort the FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. I think this movie would have been much stronger if Noland had simply stayed on the island, and we had been able to watch Hanks work more deeply with this part of the role.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he has to be rescued. And here's where the movie starts to unravel. Even after all the time he has spent on the island, Noland doesn't strike me as the type who could build a particularly good raft, and the raft he does build doesn't strike me as one that could stand up to the storms and wind and waves of the South Pacific. But it does. He gets rescued by a passing ship after being watched over by a huge whale. Noland then makes what to me seemed to be a very fast (4 weeks) transition to life after 4 years on his island, except that when he gets home he is absolutely transfixed by being able to turn an electric light on and off. (They had no lights on the ship for him to experiment with?) Noland returns expecting to be reunited with his fiancÃ© Kelly (Helen Hunt), only to find her married and a mother. Hunt does a decent job of portraying the confusion that would be felt in such circumstances, but the entire last half hour of the movie just seemed to be a pitifully weak ending to what had been a pretty good movie, although I get the point: just as Noland was cast away on the island, so is he cast away (by the woman he loves) once he gets home. (I have to confess that I was grateful that the movie didn't go for the sappy ending that we seemed to be heading for after Noland delivered his package.)<br/><br/>In the end, this strikes me as no better than a 7/10."

Once they're at civilization, they could live together and have adventures. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Instead, he pretended a volleyball was real and it ended up getting lost at sea. I'm also angry that the guy does'nt get the girl at the end. Instead, he leaves her with her family and might go after the girl he met at the crossroads (SPOILERS OVER).

","I thought this movie was very shallow.  I had just finished reading Robinson Crusoe.  When Crusoe was stranded on the island, he ponders many deep subjects- the meaning of life, his standing with God.  He learns to cultivate crops, tame animals, and eventually frees a savage from cannibals. Hanks's character, by contrast, talks with a volleyball.  Give me a break!"

"Spleen","7","0","1","26 June 2001"," The good side of mediocre
","In contrast to most people I found the quality even and unremarkable throughout.  Would someone explain to me, for instance, what was so great about the plane crash?  Yes, the moment when the cabin de-pressurises comes as a real jolt, but shock tactics are easy.  It's like the moment in horror movies when a skeleton hand suddenly shoots up out of a grave.  It's startling, not frightening.  All in all the crash/storm sequence is humdrum and badly shot.  What was the point of those intermittent blackouts? They're irritating; besides, Zemeckis has it backwards: a storm isn't light punctuated by darkness, it's darkness punctuated by light.  If anything the plane crash was a low point.<br/><br/>That's the movie as a whole: decent but lacking, marred by poor craft throughout.  Among the questionable decisions: computer generated whales (straight out of ""Fantasia 2000""), FedEx (they could so easily have used a made up brand name), and too much editing on the island.  The last really destroyed our sense of the passage of time, and with it any idea we may have had of how well the Tom Hanks character was faring.  How long did he go before finding enough water to live on?  I don't know, but I suspect it's longer than Zemeckis tried to lead us to believe, with his frequent cuts. All the small sequences before the `four years later' caption (itself a cop-out), good though they may have been individually, collectively come across as mere montage rather than a sustained assault on the problem of survival.<br/><br/>-On the other hand, what was so bad about the third act?  ""Cast Away"" is at heart a gently optimistic story of survival: its message is that mere survival - MERE survival - isn't really so bad as all that when you get to know it.  Some people wanted Tom Hanks to feel utterly bleak, to fall to pieces, when confronted with civilisation again.  Why would he?  Living in a city again after four years would be like re-adopting a half-forgotten habit - riding a bicycle for the first time in a decade.  The truth is, there's nothing much to say about what happens when he rejoins the larger world.  I found the concluding section the most honest part of the film, if a little aimless.<br/><br/>All in all, not bad.  I remember a reviewer writing that the Oscar Zemeckis won for ""Forrest Gump"" would destroy him as an artist.  I remember thinking at the time: ""Well, how could it not?  He's just been rewarded for creating something terrible.""  And, it must be noted, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was Zemeckis's only masterpiece.  But it was also an unrepeatable accident.  The kind of zaniness it exemplifies so easily turns sour in his hands (as in ""Death Becomes Her"" or the entire Back to the Future trilogy); on the other hand, if he keeps plugging away in an attempt to create something grand, he may one day succeed."

"TxMike","Null","0","2","13 June 2001"," It is ""Cast Away"", not ""Castaway.""
","The title is significant. We normally think of the word 'castaway' as a noun, referring to the person. But this film is ""Cast Away"", a verb and its adverb, which literally mean ""to throw, fling, or hurl from a place or position"", and that is precisely what happens to Chuck (Tom Hanks). He is thrown from his time-controlled life, and into one with a totally different set of priorities.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow;<br/><br/>This movie project was conceived by Tom Hanks, inspired by an account he heard of someone who actually was stranded on rocks at sea, and the experience so terrified him that he never wanted to see that place again. Hanks and his writer enlisted the help of survival experts, and much of what is depicted on the island is plausible. The project spanned about 5 years, and actual filming was done in 2 phases - before and after Hanks lost 50 to 60 pounds.<br/><br/>Chuck is a ground ops expert for FedEx and his whole life is governed by the clock. When he goes to Russia, he ships himself a digital clock to show them how slow their delivery is. He has to fly around the world on short notice. A cargo explosion over the Pacific causes the plane to ditch and only he survives, washing up the next day on a small island. (Several surrounding islands were removed digitally.) He has been 'cast away', far away, where no one will find him. Suddenly time becomes unimportant, and that is reinforced over the next 4 years on the island.<br/><br/>As survival experts tells us, the 4 things for physical survival are water, food, shelter, and fire. For emotional survival, someone to share things with. For the latter, Chuck finds ""Wilson"", which started out as a volleyball in one of the FedEx packages that washes ashore. Opening packages was a defining moment for Chuck, since it goes completely against what his job stands for. Opening the packages is a first acknowledgement that he may not be found.<br/><br/>He learns how to open coconuts for water and food, by accidentally splitting a rock which gave him a sharp 'blade.' He learns to take rain runoff from large leaves. How to spear fish. A hatchet from a pair of ice skates. A net from a dress.  Wood friction and kindling to make a fire for warmth and cooking. And a cave for shelter. A 'calendar' from a beam of light entering the cave. This element of ""time"" becomes a tool, rather than a captor, as it allows him to calculate when winds will be favorable for sailing out to sea.<br/><br/>The writers initially wanted a ""discovery and rescue"" on the island, but Zemeckis (director) said that wouldn't work. Chuck had to reach for himself the point where he would ""make"" his rescue by risking death at sea. A familiar theme, ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Matrix"" come to mind. So Chuck makes rope from bark, and builds a raft with a sail from half of a portable toilet that washes ashore.  Another defining moment was when he cleared the waves, saw his ""home"" disappear, and knew it was now a new game, him against the sea. <br/><br/>Back home after a Russian ship rescue, for Chuck it is like a resurrection. Nothing is the same. His girlfriend (Helen Hunt) is married and has a daughter. FedEx and ""efficiency"" are no longer important. In the very last scene, after he delivers a package that had been with him for 4 years on the island, with a note ""your package kept me alive"", we see him meet the beautiful redhead sculptor in rural north Texas. As he ponders which fork in the road to take, we see in his face that the sculptor may in fact be the beginning of his new life, his second chance, that will be totally different.<br/><br/>I am glad that the writer and director took the moral road, in having Chuck tell his old girlfriend, ""you need to go home"", rather than any hints at splitting up her marriage, even though they were obviously still in love with each other. Life gives us choices, and we have to make them wisely and with integrity.<br/><br/>Why was this film made? I believe, to show what it is really like on a ""desert island"", and how coming to grips with aloneness and survival can have such an impact on a person and his priorities.  The experience is not at all like what may have been depicted in older films like ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Blue Lagoon"", or the TV series ""Gilligan's Island"", which each come off like a pleasant, long vacation. And, to perhaps show us how easy it is to become wrapped up in a ""time-controlled"" rat race without soaking up what is around us.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and the DVD ""extras"". I found the Dolby Digital track slightly more interesting than the DTS track. The optional commentary track clarified some points about the story, but mostly addressed location challenges and techniques for sound and film. I rate this one ""8"" of 10. It was difficult to make and was made well, still the story is not particularly groundbreaking."

","We're going through another puffed-up time in film making. This is a good story, with a good cast - all brought together by a good director... who's had too many hits. In this film, after 25 minutes, we've learned about as much as good writing and editing could have shown us in 5 minutes. But it just might be that we have a situation where no one can tell this very successful director, ""Hey, we need to chop this thing.""<br/><br/>It's a terrific story with a survival segment sandwiched in the middle. The structure is valid (we see how the protagonist loses his obsession with time), though I'm probably in the minority in saying that the middle third is just another man-stranded-on-island story. <br/><br/>It's the relationship story that I loved, and it would have been even more effective if it could have been condensed. For example, we start with an entire segment in Russia. But why? Just to show the humor of trying to teach Russians the value of time? <br/><br/>I hope the reason for this movie's 148-minute length isn't to teach the audience not to worry about time.<br/><br/>Then we have a long Christmas dinner scene with 16 people at the table. A bit of gabbing, some holiday cheer... How does this help the story? What do we learn? Mainly that Hanks has a tooth-ache. <br/><br/>Instead of a trip to Russia and a big dinner scene, I would have loved getting to know the Helen Hunt character better. It could only have made the final third even more poignant. <br/><br/>As it is, we have a good flick that feels it needs to give you more minutes for your money.

So.  Good points? An impressive air crash with an underwater ballet reminiscent of Tom Hanks trying to reach a Normandy beach.  A wonderful sense of the power and beauty of tides, both in their height, as Hanks battles against them, and their omnipresence as beautifully portrayed from the island mountain top panorama.

There are scenes that show his progression, but what about his family, friends, FedEx and the Federal Government?  It didn't even show the flight central (or whatever they call them) losing the plane from the radar and conducting the notifications.<br/><br/>They did a great job showing the transition from being Mr. Busy to Mr. Twiddle-My-Thumbs, but there was a lot left out that would naturally be happening that could have had the audiance reacting or wanting to react to the scenes after the crash.

","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>
Robert Zemeckis had a brilliant idea for a film... strand Tom Hanks miles from civilisation on a desert island. The only down part is he decided to bring him back.<br/><br/>Bobby Zee does well with the directing duties, though still lacks the sufficient maturity to carry it off to its full potential. Witness the opening scenes where a rather obvious point of view shot follows a parcel from site to site... fine for a fast-paced, cartoon-like actioner, but incongruous in a film like this. But a genuinely unsettling plane crash takes us fairly quickly into the main objective: the desert island.<br/><br/>Despite their being no women on the island, Tom still manages to catch crabs. In fact, that's probably one of the better effects, as surely animal rights activists would prevent a real crab being skewered on film? The film also gives us a whale, though neither is as groundbreaking as Zemeckis' achievements with product placement. Instead of all that pesky putting them slyly into a scene, he simply makes Federal Express part of the plot. Though this full-bore advert doesn't stop Bobby Zee sneaking in a can of Dr.Pepper, the little tinker!<br/><br/>Some of the first things Hanks comes across are a rotting corpse and a football, which he respectively buries and hurls away. Presumably in a jealous rage in case they act him off the screen. Hanks' much-touted weight loss reminds you of one of the most famous actors to attempt such a feat, albeit in reverse: Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. The comparison isn't favourable. Can you imagine Tom Hanks in Taxi Driver? (""You talkin' ta me? Cos if you are I'll buy you a lovely soft teddy bear and some sweets"") But mickey-taking aside, Hanks does do commendably well in what is largely a one-man film, highlighting his character's madness without ever taking it too far into the realms of comedy. And his winsome, helpless expression is quite endearing... you know, sort of like a baby seal before you're just about to club it? Hanks spends a lot of the film looking at his watch, which is a nice post-modern touch as, by a curious coincidence, that's exactly what the audience are doing.<br/><br/>There's a striking lack of incidental music, so that when orchestral sweeps do emerge they seem overly sentimental and out of place. In fact, they mark Tom's return to his old life, which is where the film falters slightly. While Hanks is watchable on his own, he fails to generate any real chemistry with Helen Hunt. Hanks philosophises to a friend in a chair, where he strings more trite clichÃ©s together than C.J. in an episode of Reggie Perrin. We then follow him driving his van, while the vague Elvis theme running throughout culminates in ""Return to Sender"". What would they have chosen if he were a priest? ""Devil in Disguise""?<br/><br/>A garishly unsubtle religious reference wraps up a film that ain't bad, but is worthy of no more than... 6/10."

I mean, we got a guy with no one to talk to 4 years, with no courts or people judging his actions, that's stuff you can make a great movie out of (something which also challenges the actor instead of just having him lose 50 pounds). Ok, we will not see what he did during this 4 years, the story carries on. He now decides that 4 years are enough and that he wants to go back. And then, there's another situation that could have been interesting, but he also finds back into real life after 4 days or a similar period. I have no problem with his decision to go on with his life without his wife, but his period of inner struggle is so short in this movie, so that you can not appreciate his decission as much as it deserves. Besides all this, imagine the movie would have had all that stuff. Could you the have enjoyed it? Not me, as long as half of the time I can always read Fed-E... on the screen.

"Anonymous_Maxine","7","0","1","29 January 2001"," Even the great Tom Hanks can't make Cast Away live up to its expectations.
","Yes, Cast Away is a good movie, but it is not nearly as good as it was expected to be, especially with such big names as Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, and Robert Zemeckis, director of excellent films like Romancing the Stone, Forrest Gump, and the great Back to the Future trilogy.<br/><br/>
However, the problem doesn't have anything to do with the director or any of the actors. As far as I'm concerned, they all delivered great performances. The general bad aftertaste that the movie leaves comes more as a result of the pathetically weak story that is thinly disguised by the big budget and the big names associated with the film. Think about it, a hard working and fairly successful man goes on a business trip, leaves his beloved soon-to-be wife behind, the plane crashes, he gets stranded on a desert island. But who cares? The only way that we are able to develop any feeling for the character is that he's Tom Hanks. Cast Away is little more than an updated (and much improved, I'll have to admit) re-telling of the old desert island story. <br/><br/>You have the obvious comparison to Gilligan's Island, but there are countless other places where this general premise can be found. In 1987, Christopher Walken starred in a film called The Dead Zone in which he plays a man who falls into a coma for several years after a car accident, and when he regains consciousness, he finds himself in exactly (emphasis on exactly) the same situation that Tom Hanks was in at the end of Cast Away. There's even a short story by Stephen King (who also wrote The Dead Zone) called `Survivor Type,' and you can guess what that's about. Except that in `Survivor Type,' the guy trapped on the island gets so desperate that he amputates his own foot (he had fractured his ankle trying to catch a seagull for food) and eats it, but needless to say, a Hollywood film would never get as graphic as that. <br/><br/>(possible spoilers ahead) The timeline of Cast Away was also a little too blocky. The film up to the point where Chuck Noland became stranded was very smooth, and then we get a good look at his realization of what has happened to him and what he does to adapt to life on the island, but then the film jumps four years into the future! I don't expect every one of Chuck's exploits to be shown onscreen, because then the movie would be four years long, but I think it was too early in the film to jump ahead that far. The rescue was probably the worst part of the film - they might have done better to just start the end credits when Chuck raises his hand to the passing ship, because to skip the entire rescue sequence and jump straight to Chuck' re-entry into civilized life is disorienting and disappointing.<br/><br/>
There's really not much left to be done in the desert island area, but despite Cast Away's effort to resurrect the theme, there is a lot to be said in defense of the film. For example, there was clearly a lot of thought put into the content of the film, almost making up for the lacking story. Noland's relationship with `Wilson' was a crude but interesting and often amusing statement about the human need to interact, although their eventual separation was not very believable. Why didn't Chuck go get Wilson and then swim back to the raft? Did he really need to bring the raft with him? Maybe the audience was left to assume that an unseen ocean current rendered that obvious solution impossible, but I failed to see the conflict in that particular scene. <br/><br/>Another thing that was very successful in the film was the portrayal of Noland's predicament. Sure, it's funny at some points, but that's because it's Tom Hanks and he's just a funny guy, but that also fits perfectly with the film. Here's this guy from the big city who, judging from his substantial gut, has little experience in the outside world. Suddenly he's stuck on an island in the middle of the endless ocean, and he has no idea what to do. Nevertheless, the instinct of self-preservation kicks in and Noland finds tools for survival left and right, which was one of the things that made the film so interesting. Maybe this will teach that foolish Chuck Noland never to say, `I'll be right back.' Didn't he ever see Scream? Hanks' total physical transformation was absolutely astounding, and it magnified the effectiveness of the film at the same time as it demonstrated his dedication to the cinematic medium (you don't think he agreed to go to all that trouble because he needed money or publicity, do you?). While it is far from Hanks' best film (or Helen Hunt's, or Robert Zemeckis'), Cast Away was just about as good as it could have been, given it's tired premise and it's occasionally jerky presentation."

","A survival story of an average guy stranded on a deserted island. Tom Hanks is the perfect actor to play this part and the audience is only too happy to spend an hour with him alone on an island, cracking coconuts and making fire. I was impressed with how the screenwriter avoided the cliches so common in survival stories -- for instance, when Hanks crashes at sea during a storm he doesn't simply wake up the next morning, washed ashore on the beach. Instead, during the middle of the night and the storm, he has to crawl on top of a coral reef.  The story should probably have ended with Hank's rescue, because the audience's interest runs aground once he makes his way back to civilization. The resolution with Helen Hunt, his former fiancee, is overlong, fitful and unsatisfying. Worst of all, the ending where Hanks delivers the FedEx package he refused to open in his 4 years on the island was downright absurd.  (Newsflash to Hanks -- there might have been food in that package!)  The big winner for this movie has to be Federal Express. Next time I send a Wilson volleyball to Russia you can be sure I'll use their service."

I thought that a lot of the dialogue in this section (especially in the plane before the crash) was poorly timed and delivered, and didn't really contribute much to the story.<br/><br/>The crash scene itself is excellent, and the middle section of the movie (on the island) is enjoyable.  The use of an 'imaginary friend' to allow dialogue on the island (and to show the character trying to cope with the loneliness and avoid madness) was novel and effective.<br/><br/>However I felt it went downhill when he returned to civilisation.  There were many unanswered questions (why try and tow the raft when he had oars? If the package was so important to his will to live, why leave it unexplored until the end?) and an unsatisfactory examination of the effect of Chucks return on the relationship between him, Kelly, and her new husband.<br/><br/>In all I felt it was a fairly average movie, with some missed opportunities and fairly good performance from Tom Hanks.

On a positive note, Zemekis does provide us with a wonderfully executed plane crash sequence.  I felt like I was THERE as Hanks struggles for air.  Hanks has developed into a remarkable actor.  In the few scenes with other people, his skills overwhelm every one of them - including Helen Hunt.  Why the need to skip FOUR years?  The cheap stunt to make us feel Hanks' desperation from the previous year could easily have been a remarkable scene in the movie.  My tidbit on this one involves Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx playing himself in one scene.  Was this his price to have his company's brand stamped all over this film?

","We live in a world in which the latest technology is taken for granted on a daily basis, and the `Fast Food Generation' is in charge; everything has to be done yesterday, and there's literally not enough hours in a day to do what `must' be done.  In `Cast Away,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it-- seemingly at random-- and given something new to ponder:  Life.  Life, in it's most basic and primitive form; where all he has for survival are his two hands, his wits, and whatever nature, in all her glory, can provide. Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland, a supervisor for Fed-Ex who lives and dies by the clock; a world traveler whose time at home and with loved ones is calculated to the minute.  On Christmas, he exchanges gifts with his intended, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), in the car before boarding yet another flight that will spirit him away to oversee the job in yet another city, another country. But this time, somewhere over the ocean, elemental forces take charge, his plane is forced to ditch in the sea, and Noland's life-- in a few seconds-- is changed forever.  He survives, only to be washed ashore on a small, uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere, where he must confront Time-- and himself-- as never before. 	Though comparisons to `Robinson Crusoe' may spring to mind immediately, tuck them away in some back pocket of your memory, because what Zemeckis and Hanks give you here is anything but that.  You learn enough about Noland and Kelly during the time leading up to the ill-fated flight, that by the time Noland lands on the island you know who this man is, what makes him tick, and also about the life and the love he leaves behind and what it will mean to them both.  And knowing what you do, his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival; it's an intimate portrait of a man coming to terms with himself and learning the hard way-- with the core of his existence, the clock, negated-- what it is that really matters in life. Among the invaluable lessons he learns is that, indeed, no man is an island; for he sorely lacks the one thing nature cannot provide:  Companionship. <br/><br/>	Hanks gives a tremendously subtle, yet powerful performance as Noland; if there is any doubt, consider the fact that he carries the film for more than an hour by himself without allowing the tension or the drama to lag. Zemeckis, of course, must be given credit for keeping it all on task, including what his star is doing, and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled, not only by what is happening in the present, but by maintaining a sense of anticipation; that something is just around the corner, about to happen.  The real strength of the film is in the way it's presented, and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place; understanding that sudden regard for all the things that are taken for granted every day:  The simple creature comforts; a book of matches; water; having someone to share a laugh with.  And most importantly, knowing that alternating sense of hope and despair Noland must live with without respite.  A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe.  The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before, but never like this; with a nod to Zemeckis and Hanks, there is a purity to their treatment of the aforementioned theme with this film that is unparalleled. 	The supporting cast includes Nick Searcy (Stan), Lari White (Bettina) and Geoffrey Blake (Maynard Graham), all of whom add so much to the success of this film.  But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt, who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart-felt, memorable character.  It's an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  `Cast Away' is an engrossing film that-- make no mistake-- is about so much more than how a guy survives on a deserted island; it's about enlightenment, and taking stock of the things that matter before it's too late.  A wake-up call, one could say, for a generation mired in technology, and governed by Time.  I rate this one 9/10."

Hanks' character just wasn't really believable and the script leaves us hanging.<br/><br/>For one, in the script, we seem to make a huge jump in the film when Hanks is stranded on the island. We jump from the first couple of days that he is there to four years later! This leaves a huge gap of time that seems to be forgotten. Sure, we see Hanks now, four years later, looking a lot thinner, bushy hair and a huge ""Harley Davidson"" beard. His survival techniques are a little more skilled, but that's pretty much it.<br/><br/>The second thing that needed a little more work was Tom Hanks' character. He just didn't seem like a man that was stranded on an island. He didn't seem like a man that has left his wife behind. I must say that I was rather shocked to find a Tom Hanks character unbelievable. I thought he was great in the GREEN MILE. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was terrific! He had one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen in FORREST GUMP. Just about every movie Hanks has done is extraordinary! But he just didn't have me believing that he was actually there.<br/><br/>And lastly, the ending (and I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the film) could have used a little more work as well. It just seemed rather tagged on and very short. Instead of wasting 15 minutes of film on what I thought to be unnecessary footage of Hanks floating in his raft on the ocean in the storm, elaborate on the ending! Don't leave us hanging! We were on that island with Hanks for about over an hour!<br/><br/>I walked away from the film with the same feeling that I did when I saw James Cameron's TITANIC.

Those who like to watch other people suffer will find plenty to enjoy, as the gore factor is unnecessarily high.  The dentistry by ice skate scene is particularly gruesome.<br/><br/>People into tearjerkers will find this a good 2-hanky movie.   I tried (very!) hard (unsuccessfully) not to laugh at the sobbing woman across the aisle at the end of the movie.  Luckily, she couldn't hear me over her own applause."

","Although another very good Hanks performance, Cast Away leaves the viewer with a disappointing lack of closure.  All of my family thought that the movie was well made, but not overly entertaining.  Of course, about halfway through the movie, I'm thinking...""It's a movie about a deserted island, how exciting can it be?""  It wasn't.  I guess that I was spoiled by Gilligan's Island as a kid, but I remember these kinds of places as a lot more fun.<br/><br/>When Hanks finally does get home, the storyline is unremarkable at best. We see very little of Hunt and Hanks seems to have nothing to teach us from his time in isolation.<br/><br/>Overall, we were just expecting a lot more from Hanks/Zimeckics"

","There is one positive in this movie: It solidifies Tom Hanks as not only one of America's most beloved actors, but also one of the best.  There is a sequence in the middle of the movie where Hanks begins to figure out exactly how far away from everyone and how large the search area for his crash is that is simply heartbreaking.  Hanks stunning acting on the island, however, is muted by the opening where he is surrounded by cardboard cutouts of stock characters, the brilliant island footage, and then he returns right back into cardboard cutouts and forced situations.  This movie is worth seeing, worth thinking about for a moment, and that is about all...."

","I really enjoy Tom Hanks films and was eager to see this one, however, I am still waiting for something to happen. That is the only way I can describe this movie.  We all know from the trailer and the title that Tom is marooned on an Island and this story is about how he dealt with it and how he deals with life when he finally comes back. Well having seen the movie, I still feel I cannot answer those questions. They showed how life was tough and that is it. It was tough on the island and it was tough when he got back. That is how it ended. I was waiting for something significant to happen 2:20 into the movie. Maybe in return to cast away Island? ha ha"

","At times I felt as desperate as Hanks' character to get out of the movie theater. I checked my watch no fewer than six times. The attempts at literary symbolism were glaringly obvious, although not well-executed. There was some suspense with no surprises. Perhaps the book is worth reading, but I would not recommend viewing this film."
"APanther83","5","0","1","27 December 2000"," I didn't get it...
","OK, originally I thought that maybe I was just incredibly dumb, but as I read the other user reviews I see that I'm not the only one. I didn't get the ending. Just didn't make sense to me. Why didn't he open the package on the island? What's the deal with the wings on the package and the truck? Didn't get it... And also, I thought that they should have showed more of him on the island. I know that wasn't the primary focus of the film, but rather his battle with control and time and such, but that was the most entertaining part of the movie. I thought we were kind of cheated when we saw the text ""Four years later."" I would have enjoyed seeing how he survived for four years. Instead, we go from him being on the island for about 2 weeks to 4 years later, and I wondered, ""How did he survive that long? What did he do?"" It was too big a jump.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pretty much disappointed. 5/10."
"amateurcriticted","6","0","1","28 December 2000"," A fascinating failure, less than the sum of its parts.
","If ever a movie was less than the sum of its parts, this is it.<br/><br/>This feels like three separate films within a movie, and as the trailer makes it clear that the Tom Hanks character gets off the island, I don't think I'm giving anything away to say that this trio consists of pre-Island, on-the-Island, and post-Island.<br/><br/>The first segment is the best, with Hanks giving a charming and relaxed performance as a Fedex employee on the job in Moscow and at home in the States with friends.  The plane crash that ends this preface to the story is brilliantly done.<br/><br/>The middle segment is itself divided once again by a ""Four Years Later"" flash-forward where we see the formerly chubby and clean-shaven Mr. Hanks now svelte and hirsute, and with his island companion Mr. Wilson.  There's a memorable scene in a cave that rivals Marathon Man in its depiction of the horrors of tooth pain and rudimentary dentistry.<br/><br/>But the final segment just doesn't pack the emotional wallop it's supposed to, and the casting of Helen Hunt, perhaps the most over-exposed, over-used, and over-rated of American actresses doesn't help.<br/><br/>Ironically, for a movie whose central theme is time, it is time itself that ultimately seems to defeat this film.  That is, two hours is not sufficient (or wasn't with this approach, anyway) to do justice to the beginning, middle, and end of this particular story. As a result, the ending feels a little tacked-on.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie I'm glad I saw, but ultimately a disappointment given its pedigree."
"hometim","5","0","1","27 December 2000"," How many endings does one movie need?
","Zemeckis and Broyles deserve credit for a truly original version of a tired concept:  Robinson Crusoe, Gilligan's Island, Survivor, etc.  The middle (greater) part of the film, set on the island, is extremely watchable, never boring, and often moving.  Tom Hanks is so acceptable to all of us as a sort of ""everyman,"" one can't help but fully identify with this character in these circumstances.  (Also, I have to mention the plane crash is the most unsettling and, I assume, realistic I've ever seen.)<br/><br/>The one problem with the movie, and I think it actually fatally mars the whole thing, is the ridiculous ending(s) meant to spin some sort of sentimental closure.  I counted 5 possible endings, and the thing kept going for 15 more minutes.  I think the studio was probably afraid of ending on an uncertain note, so they just kept adding on until they reached the level of maudlin sentimentality they felt appropriate.  In actuality, uncertainty would have perfectly matched the tone of Hanks' character at that point in the film."

","Definatley NOT a ""Forrest Gump."" Hanks performance was excellent as always but the script was weak. A disappointing ending that left you hanging in the end. It was about as satisfying to me as sanka to a caffene jones. I felt deserted by the writer. The movie suffers greatly by a lack of an ending..but that was maybe his purpose to leave you feeling a little like nolan.  it's just two sceans short of a ten."

","This movie had the potential to be great, but it wasn't...if you don't want to see a spoiler, stop reading, otherwise....why didn't they SHOW Chuck Noland at the peak with the noose around his neck thinking about jumping, then after some conversion with Wilson, deciding to test it first. I think the movie would've been much better if it would have actually shown his ""low"" point of ultimate desperation, rather than just talk about it a couple of times---that was the crux of the movie and they skipped it!<br/><br/>I also would've have like to have seen Noland do more talking to himself or talking to ""God"" or whoever, trying to sort out why this happened, why was he spared, why couldn't he leave, why couldn't he be with his girlfriend, can he be happy alone, who's really in control, etc.  That's what I wanted to see.<br/><br/>It's still good, but not great."
"Cowshark-3","6","0","1","26 December 2000"," A real heartbreaker
","This movie had a lot going for it and I might have liked it a lot more if not for the trailer giving away too much of the plot. Hanks and Hunt are fantastic, their scenes together are touching and once they are reunited, their awkwardness toward each other is felt throughout the audience. It was incredible.<br/><br/>This film had fantastic scenery and cinematography, especially the plane crash. What I did not like was the ending. What I wanted to know was what was in the one package that he never opened. Wouldn't it have been nice for him to actually see that? Maybe talk with the artist instead of their meeting at the crossroads. For a second I thought I was watching the end of Thunderheart.<br/><br/>For a movie that opens on Christmas weekend, I was hoping for a something for a little more uplifting. This movie hurts you because the actors are that good. This is not something I'll add to my DVD collection because the emotional content was too heavy. Plus, some of the scenes were drawn out a bit with a lot spelled out for you. See it once, expect a sad ending, and you'll enjoy yourself."
"hotmofo69","6","0","1","25 December 2000"," A classic case of interesting story turned commercial
","Riding on the coattails of Survivor, comes the movie Cast Away.  I had the same complaints with Cast Away as I did with Survivor.  Everyone wants to see a person sent to the naked edges of the Earth, and observe the actions, instinctive, animalistic, etc...   There needs to be more motivation than just ""survival."" In Cast Away, Tom Hanks is stranded in the South Pacific (which doesn't happen until well into the 30 minute mark- a signature-Zemekis move of not getting to the point).  The story, if we disregard all that has happened prior to this, is still interesting as hell- Man against Nature in its raw-est form. Still, Tom Hanks did a pretty good job.  It's not as good of a movie as I had hoped for, but it's not without it's charm. 6 of 10"

","Not that bad of a movie.  After the initial crash and about one-half hour of being stranded, it became a very dry movie.  The sappy ending didn't do that much for me either.  I think that the plot of the movie could have been better, and they could have done a great deal more with it.  Special effects and everything were excellent, however, which makes it worth one watch."
"cvdbpm","3","0","1","25 December 2000"," A fairly poor movie overall
","I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. The story not being original (see the book ""Robinson Crusoe"" by Daniel Defoe) I expected much more from the playwright than was offered. I could honestly say that I haven't learned anything from this film that I hadn't already known. Even the moments that were intended to be dramatic and thought-provoking were usually long and cliche; as for the adventure side of the movie, apart from a scene or two at the beginning, the adventure and the thrill are missing almost completely. Far from being a ""suspenseful thriller"", the movie leaves viewers wanting for more most of the time and eschews improvisation and the potential for action.<br/><br/>In short, if you've read ""Robinson Crusoe"" or even if you are a little familiar with the story then don't waste your time on this movie. It really isn't worth your time and Tom Hanks's acting cannot make up for the lame scenario."
"michaelRokeefe","8","0","1","1 January 2001"," Great human drama!
","Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive that survives a plane crash in the ocean and drifts upon an uninhabited island. He is finally given up for dead as he spends more than four years on the island. There are some  moments of humor mixed with the sullen sadness of solitude. The human spirit is fortified by positive attitude and determination.<br/><br/>Hanks, being the skilled actor he is, makes you feel his pain and sense of fulfillment. Mother nature fills the bill as special effects. This is a wonderful movie to watch. Another masterpiece for director Robert Zemeckis.<br/><br/>Also starring are Helen Hunt, Lari White, Nick Searcy and Christopher Noth."

","Once again the hype is better than the film.  The movie did keep my interest, but I thought it was a little slow.  I enjoyed watching how he survived the island, and the emotions that went with it, but that was the best part of the movie.  I felt that once he got back, the movie fell apart. Way too shallow there, and not very realistic.    And how many times can a guy say he is sorry about stuff that isn't his fault??????  The ending was way too pat and dry."

","The premise for this one intrigued me, then I went and saw the darned thing. Hanks gets stranded and we see his ingenuity as he figures out some survival skills and befriends a volleyball; this seems to take place over a period of maybe a week, maybe a month.  Cut: four years later, and he's the master of the universe, Crusoe-style.  It's a jarring leap, and I felt a little cheated.  Sure, I could fill in some gaps and surmise this or that, but... Then he's off the island on a treacherous journey and loses his volleyball.  Sorry, but I never fully bought that, and when he's screaming furiously and choking sobs over this loss, I had to wonder why he never developed a similar affection for the photo of his fiance.  Just a thought. His return and reconnection with the fiance (Helen Hunt) are absolutely awful.  Hollywood and Hanks are actually expecting her to break up her home to run off with him; when Hanks realizes she won't, his tone is accusatory. Not to worry; there's another dame, another tide rolling in, so he can trade off.  Yech."
