"Hermit C-2","10","211","228","7 July 1999"," Kubrick--a fully-formed genius in 1957.
","At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.<br/><br/>This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.<br/><br/>The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.<br/><br/>You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best. Or simply one of the best, period."
"Steffi_P","9","87","92","15 October 2006"," ""Let the men have a few minutes more""
","Although Kubrick's films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone, one theme that crops up again and again is a strong anti-war sentiment, and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.<br/><br/>In contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick's other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.<br/><br/>The light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers' headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.<br/><br/>The use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn't a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.<br/><br/>Throughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier's bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it's quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions."
"WriterDave","9","108","118","28 July 2007"," Stands the Test of Time
","An arrogant French general (a superb George Macready) orders his men on a suicide mission and then has the gall to try to court marshal and execute three of them for cowardice in the face of the enemy. A former lawyer turned colonel (Kirk Douglas in his prime) is the voice of reason against gross injustice. This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.<br/><br/>Kubrick displays a great control of sound effects and camera movement in the brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict the controlled chaos that was trench warfare during WWI. Things get juicier during the ensuing courtroom battle where the deafening disparity between the elite who propagate and profit from war and the common citizens who suffer and die in war is shown with great lucidity.<br/><br/>Unlike later Kubrick epics, this runs at a crisp 90 minutes, though suffers briefly from a slow and awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick's craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering. ""Paths of Glory"" is more anti-arrogance than anti-war, and is unapologetically sentimental and pro-soldier. As such, much can still be gleaned from its message."
"bmaclach","10","137","152","3 November 2000"," An anti-war movie hitting closer to home.
","I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the ""real"" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies."
"bkoganbing","10","161","183","2 July 2006"," They Couldn't Take An Ant Hill
","Almost one hundred years later the concept of that static war of the trenches that was the Western front of World War I is almost unfathomable. After the French army stopped the German offensive at the Battle of the Marne, the French and British armies faced the Germans in a line of trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland. About a quarter of France was occupied for four years in that time. The casualties ran into the millions in that stalemate that gains were only measured in meters.<br/><br/>It was always just one more offensive over the top charging into automatic weapon fire that would break the other guy. Just such an offensive was planned one day in 1916 against a German stronghold dubbed the ant hill. <br/><br/>General George MacReady, promised a promotion by his superior Adolphe Menjou, orders a beaten and tired battalion to charge the ant hill. The attack flops and MacReady looks for scapegoats. He decides after coming down from shooting 100 men to a selected three drawn by lot. The unlucky three are Joseph Turkel, Ralph Meeker, and Timothy Carey.<br/><br/>The commander of the three Kirk Douglas asks to serve as their counsel and he makes a good show of it at the kangaroo court martial they have. But the fix is definitely in.<br/><br/>Except for Spartacus, Kirk Douglas rarely plays straight up heroic types in film. Even his good guys have an edge to them, a dark side. But as Colonel Dax, Douglas is at his most heroic. He may be one dimensional here, but he's great. Especially in that last scene with Adolphe Menjou when he tells the man off in no uncertain terms, mainly because Menjou has misread Douglas's motives. <br/><br/>Menjou and Macready portray two different military types. The arrogant MacReady as versus the very sly Menjou. Not very admirable either of them. Menjou was not very popular at this time in Hollywood because of the blacklist. He favored it very much, his politics were of the extreme right wing. Nevertheless he was a brilliant actor and never better than in this film, one of his last.<br/><br/>The enlisted men are a good bunch also. They're kind of like the posse in The Oxbow Incident, just an ordinary group who become ennobled in martyrdom as they go to the firing squad for the sake of politics.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is one of the best anti-war films ever made. It ranks right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front which showed the war from the German point of view. Both will be classics 200, 300, a thousand years from now."
"hptaylor","10","232","270","15 February 2004"," The most realistic, most emotionally draining, and most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare in WW I.
","I think that Stanley Kubrick is the greatest of all film directors, and in my opinion ""Paths of Glory"" is Kubrick's best film because:<br/><br/>1.  It is FAR AND AWAY the most realistic, most emotionally draining, and most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare in WW I, which has to be considered to be one of the significant episodes in all of human history.    The story is fiction, but the events are patterned after some actual mutinies in the French army that took place in 1917.<br/><br/>2.  I first saw this film 46 years ago, and it not only made me an avid Kubrick fan for the rest of my life, it made me want to watch it over and over again -- more than 250 times over the years, and every time I see it, I cry at the end (when Kubrick's future wife, and the only woman in the film, sings ""The Faithful Hussar"", causing the audience of French soldiers to change from a jeering crowd to a hushed, teary-eyed group of lonely men).<br/><br/>3.  Everything about the movie is PERFECT!!  There are no flaws in the acting, the pace of the movie, the photography, the dialogue, etc.  Scene after scene is more powerful and ironic than the preceding one, building to a shattering climax.  It is simply a gem.<br/><br/>4.  Try as I might to think of actors that could have been substituted in their places, I think the casting for each and every part in the movie really could not have been any better.   No one could have been better in their respective roles than George Macready, Adolphe Menjou, Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, and all of the others.   Many of these actors appear in Kubrick's other films.<br/><br/>5.  Has there ever been a better scene than the one in which one of the condemned soldiers (Ralph Meeker) stares at this cockroach and cries that tomorrow that bug will still be alive and he will be dead.  Whereupon one of the other condemned men (the fatalistic Timothy Carey) squashes the cockroach and says ""Now you got the edge on him"".<br/><br/>6. You could probably change a few things in most of Kubrick's other masterpieces to slightly improve them, but I DEFY anyone to single out anything in ""Paths of Glory"" that could be improved upon.  I could go on and on raving about the beauty and pathos of this film, but I think I will stop here."
"kamerad","10","93","107","7 June 2002"," Kubrik's First Masterwork
","""Paths of Glory"" (1957) (and this is personal opinion of course) is Stanley Kubrick's first real masterpiece in what would be a long line of subsequent masterpieces.  I know that Kubrick had a reputation for making cold, unemotional films (which is a false impression, but that's the subject for another essay) but I don't believe there are many people who can deny how powerful this film is.  Through the editing, camera movement, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a now more fully realized use of irony, Kubrick creates an unforgettable anti-war parable.  I realize that my love for this film is incredibly obvious, but I'll try to focus on an analysis of the film rather than a review, but the movie is just so good!  <br/><br/>     Francois Truffaut once said that there is no such thing as a true anti-war film because the battle scenes make the war look exiting.  ""Paths of Glory""'s scenes of battle are certainly gripping, but gripping in the way that a nightmare is gripping.  There is no way a person can see these scenes and wish they were participating (like the action scenes in say, ""The Dirty Dozen"").  I vividly recall the scene where three men try to sneak behind enemy lines in the middle of the night.  The battlefield is cloaked in darkness.  Someone shoots a flare.  Silently, a brief burst of light illuminates the field, revealing several corpses strewn over the ground. Darkness quickly covers them up again.  Kubrick uses silence and sparse sound effects in this scene like a musical score.  Any actual music would be intrusive and rob from the moment, a flaw found in too many otherwise good films of the nineteen fifties (personal opinion of course). <br/><br/>
     Point of view is used very well in the film to illustrate the inner concerns of the major characters.  We see General Mireau's Point of view when he looks through the binoculars at the ant-hill he wants his men to take.  When he hands over the binoculars to Colonel Dax, we don't see his view of the ant-hill.  Later however, when Dax walks through the trenches before the big battle, we do see his point of view looking at his men.  This contrasts with an earlier scene when Mireau walked through the trenches and we did not see his point of view.  This clearly illustrates what is important to each man.  For Mireau, it is victory at all costs; for Dax, it is the welfare of his soldiers.  <br/><br/>     For me one of the most impressive things about ""Paths of Glory"" was it's realistic, yet still poetic, and sometimes even chilling dialogue. This is in sharp contrast to the clever yet purposefuly stagy dialogue of ""The Killing"".  <br/><br/>     One scene sticks out my mind where a soldier is nervously rambling about what it would be like to get shot: ""Most guys say that if they got shot they'd want to die quick.  So what does that tell you?  It means there not afraid of getting killed, they're afraid of getting hurt.  I think if you're gonna get shot and live, it's best to get shot in the rear than in the head.  Why?  Because in the rear its just meat, but the head, that's pure bone.  Can you imagine what it's like for a bullet to rip through pure bone?""   When I first saw this film in a theater, there was some nervous laughter in the audience during this scene.  It's true, the scene's dark humour helps illustrate the insanity of the situation. <br/><br/>
     In my introduction I stated that there was great use of irony in the film.  Perhaps the greatest irony is the title.  In the end no one finds glory.  Dax, although he nobly fights to defend his men wrongly accused of treason, loses the fight.  Even though he is later offered a promotion, he turns it down because of his disgust for the army.  Mireau is found out to be the cad that he is for ordering his own troops slaughter, and is court marshalled.  The film successfully states that in a war even the supposed victors lose something as well."
"ch-o-jsch","Null","78","91","11 July 2004"," another point of view
","I've read some of the last comments and all I can say is that I think most of you missed the point in this film. No offense to everybody, but I've never regarded this movie as an antiwar movie or something like that. The fact, that my interpretation is not corresponding with most of the others lies in the simple truth that 50% of work is done by the ""author"" and the rest is done by the audience.<br/><br/>Kubrick used his films as little pieces of the great image of mankind. In all his movies one can see one or multiple depictions of individuals or groups and their feelings and actions, which are not only typical for the protagonists, and antagonists, but also for the viewer.<br/><br/>In the Paths Of Glory this special feeling is perhaps the most ordinary of all: hope.<br/><br/> From the beginning there is no hope in this movie. The battle is lost before it even started. Those three poor creatures are sentenced to death before even the trial had started. And still the audience hopes for a happy end, that the general may stop the execution in the last second. But nothing happens. At this point the viewer is as hopeless as the figures in the movie. The following breakfast scene leaves everybody in a state of paralization, nothing changes.<br/><br/>And then at the end. this helpless and beautiful girl begins to sing a German folk song, which none of the present soldiers knows what it's all about. But the mood of the mob changes away from hate and anger and they all begin to cry like babies. In this very moment hope is reborn and comes back to the battlefield of feelings as the glorious winner. This is when we regain our hope.<br/><br/>Many people wrote, that the last scene didn't fit in the film at all. I would say, that without this scene the movie would have never become the classic it is now. Of course the filming and actor performances are brilliant, but this specialty of the last scene makes this movie unforgettable."
"gbheron","10","90","112","19 January 2000"," Gripping Anti-War Film
","Paths of Glory is one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the best ""war"" movie, period. Paths of Glory does not portray war as conflict between armies or individual soldiers arrayed against one another on the battlefield.  Nor does it portray the acts of great leaders and heroes of war. No this film takes a different tact. <br/><br/>The setting is the Western Front of 1916 in the trenches with French soldiers faced off against an invisible German force across a barren No Man's Land. The German's are never seen and the dramatic ""combat"" is between vain French officers as they vie for prestige and honors.  The victims are the innocent French soldiers under their command who suffer miserably because of their arrogance and ignorance.<br/><br/>Brilliant, gripping, and definitely a ""must see""."
"claudio_carvalho","10","103","130","11 May 2004"," An Anti-War Masterpiece
","In France, in the First World War, the insane and ambitious general Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) orders Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to lead his men in a suicide attack against Germans in the unattainable Ant Hill. After a massacre of the French soldiers, Gen. Mireau orders his artillery to drop bombs between the French front line of attack and the trenches, to avoid the soldier to return to the protection of the trenches. The commander of the French artillery refuses to accomplish the order. Gen. Mireau asks his superior, Gen. George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), to send three men to Court Martial and execute them for cowardice through shooting, as an example to the other soldiers. Colonel Dax, a former lawyer, defends his men in the unfair trial. Yesterday I watched this outstanding masterpiece for the first time and certainly it is among the best movies of the cinema history. The disgusting story shows the insanity of a war, where men are treated like numbers and not as human beings. The reality of the battles scenes is amazing. The cast has a stunning performance, highlighting the trio George Macready, Adolphe Menjou and Kirk Douglas. The lack of sensibility and respect for the human life and the cynicism in the dialogs of the two generals are fantastic. Two other points that called my attention are the fancy reception for the general staff, while their subalterns are fighting in the front and the misunderstanding of the real intentions of Colonel Dax by Gen. George Broulard. A must-see movie! My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Glória Feita de Sangue' (`Glory Made of Blood')"

","The end sequence is beautifully symbolic.The soldiers in the bar watch as a frightened German girl is brought before them. As the poor lass struggles to sing her song (it really doesn't matter what song), they begin to realize that this hapless creature is enduring what their three executed comrades had endured themselves. Their three comrades were brought before the military tribunal as a formality before their execution. Now these soldiers are the tribunal for this pitiful girl who now stands before them awaiting their judgment. But unlike the cold inhuman justice that the French military machine has dealt to their compatriots, they watch intently as this German girl strives to sing in spite of all their cat calls and hoots and hollers, realizing that she is trying her best in spite of overwhelming opposition, just as they and their three dead friends had tried in attacking the ant hill. They cry because they see themselves up there on the stage.........a poor frightened soul that finds themselves in a situation they'd rather not face but is compelled to do so. Colonel Dax realizes this and allows this brief respite of humanity to engulf the troops before they are sent back to face the horrors of the war. This film is indeed one of the best war films ever made it simply overpowers the viewer with emotion."
"danm99","Null","160","209","26 February 2003"," KUBRICK'S GENUINE CLASSIC MASTERPIECE
","What to say that hasn't already been said. This astonishing cinematic work of art (no kidding) unquestionably is the GREATEST FILM EVER - bar none.  I deeply and passionately LOVE this brilliant early Kubrick production. Congratulations to expert screenwriters (and unique pulp writers of the 5O's) Calder Willingham (who also penned his own excellent adaptation of ""The Strange One""; highly recommended) and Jim Thompson (""The Grifters"" ""The Killer Inside Me""; which strongly influenced Tarantino), who both present a superbly incisive script with powerfully effective dialogue that really rings more than true.  If only we had more real writers and scripts like this remarkable achievement, we'd be writing far more favorable reviews. ""Paths of Glory"", alone, would serve as anyone's lifetime achievement award.<br/><br/> I don't care how much you HATE B&W films - put this one on your MUST-SEE. Compelling cinema-verite photography creates astounding visuals from a varity of incisive angles; like the famous mobile wide-angle tracking shot of Dax (probably Kirk Douglas's most stirring and important performance) moving through the squalid and horrifying trenches as the battle begins with explosions breaking out all over.  The suspense and tension is frightening, but almost beautifully eerie in the most compelling ways as Kubrick takes us through the deadly limbo of no-man's land - the 'paths of glory' which finally leads to the grave.  The action, skillfully combined with powerful moral and existential themes are amazingly conveyed through the bleak yet articulately stunning visuals.  THIS IS A FILMMAKER'S FILM!<br/><br/> The moral outrage of the sadistic injustice of the military courtmartial never fails to make my blood fully boil.  The hypocrisy and corruption is degradingly infuriating.  If anything will make a cynic out of you, it's this appropriately pessimistic and depressing cinema chronical based on a true stupid incident in WWI.  What's even worse is how POG, in many perceptive ways, serves as an allegory for all the B.S. in real life: Pig-headed leadership in the parasitic hands of the superior greed freaks, two-faced deceptive manipulations, double-standards, backstabbings, social bigotry, arm-chair warriors, egotism, corrupt politics, the militaries's abuse of too much power - and it's destructive desire at satisfying it's lust for vainglory (sounds a little like Hollywood) - Did I leave anything out?  You name it, POG has it - and I'm not being sarcastic.<br/><br/> The entire ensemble cast is superb with special mention to George Macready as the utterly pompous power-mad glory-seeking ""soldier"", General Mireuo (who thinks nothing about ordering his troops to open fire on his own men for not charging out of the trenches and dying for his ""country""; which smells a bit like ME ME ME).  Don't worry, you'll throughly hate his guts. It truly is true method acting.  Again, kudos to Macready,  a fine actor who was always too good at playing highly unethical villians. (Incidently, this was a favorite film of a young 195O's Marlon Brando and old salty Winston Churchill, who praised Kubrick's incisive authenticity in the exciting battle scene, which does resemble news footage).<br/><br/> Timothy Carey (also ultra-offbeat-cool in Kubrick's other exceptional early flick, ""The Killing"") is morbidly humorous and gut-wrenching as one of the poor fools coldly picked to be executed; all in the ruthless 'patriotic' name (and amoral game) of 'glory'. ARE ANY OF OUR LEADERS LISTENING?  Too bad that Carey's memorable talents were so underused by Hollywood, but that always seems to be the unfortunate norm.  A little like what ironically happens to him in this intriguing but downbeat story.<br/><br/> Ralph Meeker (who was also memorable as the brutal and ruthless Mike Hammer in the 5O's cult gem ""Kiss Me Deadly"" - a complete opposite role that shows a true range of his acting abilities) delivers another wretching performance as the true brave soldier unjustly sentenced for ""Cowardice in the Face of the Enemy"".  (Maybe he should have turned 'about face', but it would have still been 'damned if he did and damned if he didn't' - another grim moral theme here).  His breakdown scene right before he is to be taken out and shot is terribly heartbreaking, for I felt so wanting, but helplessly unable, to come to his help.<br/><br/> Take my word for it, everyone else is awesome; a true actor's dramatic show with dark satirical overtones.  POG goes beyond the mere preaching anti-war diatribe (though it does convey that almost naturally, like going without having to say).  It's a great classic morality play that will really make you stop (many, many times) and truly make you think (many many times). Airheads not allowed.  Moreover, this haunting and disturbing masterpiece is top entertainment, something too many art films aren't.     ><br/><br/> It will really make you question things about our troubled, convoluted world and how things are to often immorally and inhumanly run all in the sick name of greed and destructive power. Not too lovely, for the director pulls no punches.  This film really has grown more profound (and currently pertinent) since its initial release.  Also the editing is taut and concise; there isn't a single wasted moment.  Count the number of films on one hand that has accomplished that miraculous feat; that most critics and user commentators are always rightfully harking on.  I'll shut up now.  Go see this one-of-a-kind film, then see it again - and again, etc.  >"

This is just one of his many masterpieces, but Paths Of Glory is probably as good a film as any of Kubrick's other best works. I have seen tons of war films in my life, many great ones. Honestly, this is my favorite of them all. When I first saw this film I didn't expect it to blow me away. After all it is an early Kubrick film, however it blew me away constantly, and completely. This is not only one of the greatest war films ever made, not only one of the greatest black & white films ever made, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made bar none.

The arrogance and total disregard for the welfare of the soldier as beautifully portrayed by Menjou and McReady, in opposition to the care and concern of the Colonel so humanly portrayed by  Douglas adds to the reality of what the world was like in the days of the ""Great War."" Additionally, the roles played by Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker and the self serving aide to McReady add to the greatness of this memorable motion picture. There is no ""Viva La France"" here."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","17","22","31 January 2005"," Scary.
","It really is a testament to the power of the story told by this film that it stars the French army and they all speak nothing but English, and yet it is still be incredibly moving and compelling. On the other hand, the movie is not really about war but about the soldiers, kind of like Full Metal Jacket. It is structured almost exactly the opposite, with the first half of the film taking place on the battlefield and the second half off. Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax, whose platoon is ordered to take a hill called the Anthill against staggering odds, almost surely a suicide mission.<br/><br/>As the men rush out of the trenches in an attempt to complete the mission, I was reminded of Gallipoli as they were all mowed down within feet of exiting the trenches. It becomes clear that the mission is, ahem, impossible, and is abandoned. Where the movie is truly great is in its characterizations and the complexity of their relationships with one another. Watch, for example, the roles that certain characters play at the beginning and where they end up near the end of the film, such as the General who ordered soldiers to fire on their own men and the man who abandons two of his men on a watch, resulting in one of their deaths and the subsequent court martial and trial of the other. The situations that they end up in are what make the movie powerful.<br/><br/>Clearly, the accepted forms of punishment for failing to accomplish a mission are frightening. I have no idea how accurate they are as to French military practices at the time, but for three soldiers to be taken at random and tried and sentenced to death because their entire platoon failed in an impossible mission is scary indeed. I wonder how they would have handled a few soldiers who refused to go on a mission to deliver contaminated gasoline because the vehicles had almost no armor on them whatsoever.<br/><br/>What is truly amazing to me is that Kubrick was able to make a movie about massive military injustice and still make the audience laugh at certain times. The cockroach scene, for example, is wonderful comic relief. You get a good laugh without losing sight of the drama and the importance of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>It is not uncommon to read that this is the greatest anti-war film of all time, and while there are other anti-war films that I think rank right up there with Paths of Glory, this certainly is one of the greatest ever made."

Intelligent screenplay based on a Humphrey's Cobb's novel has been well adapted by Stanley Kubrick and Jim Thompson . It depicts a brooding study about futility and insanity of war , making a shattering accusation against the military ruling staff who cares on promotions more than the soldiers . Kirk Douglas is very good as compassionate French Colonel who commands his troops in some spectacular scenes on the trenches . Stunning support cast beautifully performed by notorious secondaries as Emily Meyer as the priest , Wayne Morris as the lieutenant , Richard Anderson as the Major prosecutor , Ralph Meeker , Timothy Carey and Suzanne Christian , Kubrick's wife . Special mention to the two selfish Generals exceptionally performed by George Macready and Adolph Menjou . Excellent cinematography in black and white by George Krause filmed on location in Schleissheim Palace, Munich, and Bavaria Film studios, Geiselgasteig, Grünwald, Bavaria, Germany (studio). The motion picture is wonderfully realized by the maestro Stanley Kubrick and lavishly produced by James B. Harris , his usual producer by that time . This magnificent film along with ¨ All quiet on the Western front ¨ , ¨Westfront 1918 ¨, ¨ Captain Conan ¨ , and ¨King and country¨ result to be the best films about powerful antiwar theme . Time hasn't dimmed its power , or its poignancy, a bit and remains untouchable the critique to the military hypocrisy in an ultra-lucid exposition . Rating : Phenomenal and marvelous film , above average . Essential and indispensable watching ."

","I watch about 100 movies per year, but I NEVER heard of ""Paths of Glory"" until I recently saw it on a list of great movies.<br/><br/>It is the BEST movie that I have never heard of and one of the best movies I have ever seen!! I'm stunned that I knew nothing about it.<br/><br/>As an anti-war movie, ""Paths of Glory"" rivals ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""Dr. Strangelove."" It has one great scene after another. Most of the scenes consist of two- or three-person conversations that include very smart dialogue, sharp character portrayals, and conflicts that induce viewers to root for some people and root against others.<br/><br/>During the movie, I became depressed when something bad happened to the good guys and happy when something bad happened to the bad guys. I can't think of too many movies that were written so well that I reacted this way.<br/><br/>I know many people, including myself, don't like military movies with so much action that you can't follow who has been killed and who is winning. This movie wisely has only about 10 minutes of (World War I) battlefield scenes and the result is crystal-clear.<br/><br/>Instead of scenes of mass killings, the writers and director Stanley Kubrick focus on the confrontations between high-level and low-level officers, an unfair court martial, and a farcical trial. The results of the action convey vividly how military leaders care more about themselves than the heroes who fight for their nation.<br/><br/>The movie also wisely has one central character played by Kirk Douglas. He is outstanding as a very principled and strong mid-level officer who essentially represents the perspective of viewers like ourselves. Like Douglas, we want to express moral outrage as the plot unfolds.<br/><br/>I almost gave this movie a 10, but I thought the ending was too sudden. I wanted it to continue. I'm also on the fence about whether I preferred this movie to either be about English soldiers or French soldiers with French accents or left as is with French soldiers who are clearly not French.<br/><br/>I swear I'm not normally a cheerleader for movies.

"Snake-666","7","9","12","31 January 2004"," One of the great anti-war movies.
","In an attempt to enhance his own reputation, General Mireau (George MacReady) orders his troops to advance and seize the heavily fortified `Ant Hill' from the German army. Despite realising the hazardous nature of the order, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) reluctantly agrees to lead the charge. As expected the attack goes badly and many French troops lose their lives which results in a large number of men refusing to leave their trenches. General Mireau sees this from his safe position and, refusing to admit that the attack was suicide from the outset, blames the cowardice of those who refused to fight for the devastating outcome of the battle. As a result Mireau demands that three soldiers from the regiment be held accountable and face an immediate court martial followed by death by firing squad. Dax seeks for the French military hierarchy to admit the truth.<br/><br/>This dramatic condemnation of the politics-over-people attitude of military forces during World War I is an all too accurate portrayal of how the conflict resulted in one of the largest and most pointless losses of life in all known history. Taking place in the trenches amidst the height of the futile conflict between France and Germany, director Stanley Kubrick (in only his second feature film) seeks to press home a fiercely anti-war statement backed up by actual historical facts rather than the typical embellishment that can be found in more modern war films. While the story itself is somewhat fanciful, the portrayal of the morally corrupt military leaders that sent hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths for no more reason than to satisfy their own expanded egos and enhance their perfidious reputations is, unfortunately, all too accurate and a powerful indictment of not just the French army, but all those who participated in one of the most bloody conflicts in human history. What makes the film so stinging in its approach is the flat out lies told by protagonist Mireau, who claims that one man's life is worth more to him than a reputation, yet when presented with the opportunity for political acclaim and honours is all too willing to send troops to battle when freely admitting that four thousand will probably perish in no man's land. A quick glance through history proves such on-screen bald faced lies to be inherently and tragically true off-screen, even in relation to Britain's very own Field Marshall Hague. The French government found the representation of their military too close to fact and banned Paths of Glory', eventually lifting the ban in 1970.<br/><br/>The film does not stand out in mere message alone. For those familiar with Kubrick's later work such as 2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), A Clockwork Orange' (1971) and Full Metal Jacket' (1987) the director's soon-to-be trademarks can easily be spotted. As with many Kubrick films there is a remarkable ability to portray to the viewer what is not seen on the screen. The full carnage of the war is displayed in a darkly amusing, yet chilling scene where one soldier questions another on whether he is scared of death or merely getting hurt. As this precedes the actual battle scenes by a matter of minutes the viewer becomes rapidly acquainted with the carnage, fear and suffering these men faced despite a distinct lack of on-screen bloodshed. One could argue that the short, virtually bloodless battle scene in Paths of Glory' is even more powerful than the bloody, disturbing and prolonged beach scenes from Saving Private Ryan' (1998). Kubrick wonderfully crafts this movie around the composition of the filming rather than relying on any sort of special effects or visual trickery. Throughout the movie, particularly during the battle scenes, the viewer is given a third person perspective of the struggles of men to come to terms with life and death under such harsh conditions. Incredible acting performances from Kirk Douglas, George MacReady and Adolphe Menjou attract the viewer's attention and become the central focus in a war film with scarce amounts of action. Kubrick condemns the politics of war through the use of the politics that control war.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to write about this film and fully do it justice. The pre-Vietnam anti-war sentiment is easily the main focus of the movie and it is through competent acting that the movie is made great. It becomes somewhat irrelevant that the movie is set in WWI as the same message applies to every major war, particularly the following decades Vietnam War. It wasn't until Oliver Stone's Platoon' (1986) that viewers were again treated to an historically based condemnation of war that focused less on heroes and more on the way things really were in battle. Wisely, the movie opens with a narrated epilogue which informs the viewer of the absurdity of WWI and then ends with a melodramatic and almost tear-inspiring scene which, although not in place when compared to the sombre and melancholy feel of the previous eighty minutes, ends the film in such a way that the film itself must be contemplated. Paths of Glory' is easily one of the most powerful films of all time and a pejorative anti-war statement where the only real failing is the short length of the movie and occasional poor performances from the supporting cast. My rating for Paths of Glory' - 7½/10."
"tieman64","Null","8","13","30 January 2009"," The paths of glory lead but to the grave
","""All Stanley's life he said, 'Never, ever go near power. Don't become friends with anyone who has real power.'"" - Christiane Kubrick<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"" begins with the playing of the French nation anthem - an ironic touch - and then quickly introduces us to its key players: Colonel Dax, a well intentioned military man, and General's Broulard and Mireau, two elderly careerists who treat the soldier's under their command with callous indifference.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, director Stanley Kubrick will use two recurring visual motifs - men in trenches and men affixed like mere pawns to a chessboard - to hammer his dour view. The film's soldiers are always trapped, not only constrained by duty, class and national responsibility, but by physical, political and cosmic forces. When they try to rise above or beyond the filth, they're promptly shot down. <br/><br/>Dax, the film's hero, is himself ultimately impotent. All his protests mean nothing. Whether he leads his men to success or failure, they still lose. The end of the film has Dax standing helplessly on the sidelines, watching as his men are executed for failing to take an insignificant Ant Hill. This is WW1 in microcosm, aristocrats, monarchs and burgeoning ""democracies"" risking lower class limbs for land and hoping desperately to cling onto whatever power is available come the 20th century's new order.<br/><br/>Even as far back as ""Paths of Glory"", Kubrick's form reflects content. Plot and character coalesce into a very concrete, very formal image of the world. In ""Killer's Kiss"" and ""The Killing"" this was strictly a generic world, but ""Paths of Glory"" launches itself in a different field, that of history, warfare and army politics. <br/><br/>The film's subject is unambiguously visualised in its main setting: a huge château converted to an army command post. Because the decor becomes the story, Kubrick's actual story is not simply told, but barely told. Given a narrative context that is so simple, characters are also defined in very basic ways. The pawns live in the mud, the kings in the ornate château. The kings scapegoat and shift responsibility, the drones take the blame and bullets. Everything else becomes a manifestations of decor or camera movement. Characters are imprisoned, parodied, paired off and squared away. The prime examples are the generals, Broulard and Mireau, lookalikes in uniform, two ruthless men who toy with each another and who lead each other on in the guise of concern for their troops. Luis Bunuel, himself fond of satirising the ruling elite, would adore the film.<br/><br/>Whilst discussing taking the Ant Hill, a series of brief tracks follow our players as they pace marble floors. Each character pursues a different path, but they all arrive at the same end. Broulard proves to spin the more effective web because he is the more clear-sightedly cynical. Mireau in the end becomes a zealot of self-deception. Dax is the liberal-humanitarian shuttlecock passing between them, he has no double but is himself ""doubled"", negotiating his superiors' ambitions first as a commander on the battlefield then as a lawyer in the courtroom.<br/><br/>Dax, as officer and battlefield soldier, is also a hero of two worlds, the château and the trenches. As ""hero"", his function is to serve as the meeting point of two perspectives: the objective vista of history and the subjective confusion and terror of trench warfare. Significantly, Dax is Kubrick's only conventional hero outside of ""Spartacus"" (also starring Douglas). Kubrick's later films would abandon conventional protagonist/antagonist dualities.<br/><br/>Camera movements are clear but subtle. When Mireau inspects the troops in an early scene, Kubrick's camera tracks backwards before him, down an interminable trench. When Dax later tours the trench, the same objective track is inter-cut with one from his point of view as he passes through the ranks. Kubrick's point is clear. Dax sees outward and is aware of, or empathises with, the men around him. Mireau sees inward, fixated on himself and his own goals. Later, he will fire upon his own ants.<br/><br/>This interplay reaches its zenith with the execution of three soldiers. Here the anguished perspectives of the victims, one of whom is played by the always brilliant Timothy Carey, are inter-cut with a tracking shot which itself seems to shift in intensities as it passes in front of a hierarchy of observers: from the indifferent troops to the press corps to Dax and the guilty corporals. Kubrick's extended tracking shots have usually been put down to the influence of Ophuls (to whose death Kubrick dedicates one scene in ""Paths of Glory"" to), but the articulation of point of view through tracking - an emotional montage - is closer to Hitchcock. <br/><br/>This form of emotional dialectics is present throughout the film. Watch how the generals play number games, tabulating the statistics of probable causalities before battle, bargaining over how many ""examples"" should be shot, whilst the men below them cry in the trenches and prison houses, vividly aware of their own fickle lives. <br/><br/>Unlike Kubrick's later works, ""Glory"" is resolutely unambiguous. His dialogue is caustic, blunt and his images likewise, impeccably composed, with stark lines and fluid but muscular tracking shots. Elsewhere, the film is almost robotic, marching towards its climax like a relentless machine. ""Glory"" was also the first feature to utilise an all percussion sound-track, a fact which lends Kubrick's imagery an even greater sense of foreboding.<br/><br/>10/10 – Masterpiece."

","Stanley Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' is the ultimate anti-war film. Rather than simply showing us the horrors of warfare and declaring that 'war is hell,' this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate and anger, revealing the sheer folly and uselessness of combat. There are heroes in war, of course  namely Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and his brave fighting soldiers  but certainly not the generals, who sit back in their comfortable armchairs and send thousands of their men to certain death without a trace of guilt or remorse.<br/><br/>In the treacherous front-line trenches of World War One, a regiment of soldiers is ordered on a suicidal mission to seize the German-occupied ""Anthill."" French General Mireau (George Macready) is at first hesitant about the attack, citing the unacceptably high fatality rate and his duty to his loyal soldiers, but he is very quickly swayed in his convictions when his superior, General George Broulard, (Adolphe Menjou), hints at the possibility of a promotion. And so, led by a doubtful but loyal Colonel Dax (Douglas), the soldiers  in perhaps the most realistic war combat scene this side of 'Saving Private Ryan'  proceed with the attack, suffering immense losses and ultimately being forced to retreat. Furious about the perceived ""cowardice"" of his troops, an enraged General Mireau orders his artillery to open fire on his own men, but the artillery commander refuses to obey without a confirmation of written orders.<br/><br/>Rather than taking the blame himself for the failed attack, Mireau decides to execute three men to set an example to the soldiers. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is chosen for execution because his commanding officer has a personal vendetta against him; Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), one of the most courageous soldiers in his regiment, was chosen randomly; Private Ferol (Timothy Carey) was chosen because he was something of a social outcast. Colonel Lax passionately defends the actions of his men during the court-martial, but, despite the utterly ridiculous cases made against them, all three men are inevitably found guilty of ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"" and sentenced to death by firing squad.<br/><br/>Later, in one of the most suspenseful sequences ever committed to film, accompanied by the slow steady beat of an army drum, the three condemned men are lead to their place of execution, tied to posts and shot down by the weapons of their own army. Any other film from this era would have baulked at the final moment, offering its prisoners a last-minute reprieve, and the swift persecution of every general in charge of the original attack. Kubrick reportedly toyed with this option at one point, but it is to his credit that he stood firm on his daring and controversial ending. Indeed, French authorities considered the film such an offence to their army's honour that it was banned until 1975."
"theowinthrop","10","7","11","3 July 2006"," The Mutinies of 1917 - a fictional variant
","Although he did the wonderful crime film THE KILLING before he did this, it was PATHS OF GLORY that brought Stanley Kubrick's talents forward. After PATHS OF GLORY he would make all types of films, but he would basically make them as he wanted to (although when working with his star here, Kirk Douglas, on SPARTACUS he would have such friction with Douglas that they never made any other films together afterward). So if it had not been for PATHS OF GLORY there would not have been LOLITA, DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001, BARRY LYNDON, and the other films. The Kubrick stamp of film artistry was born here.<br/><br/>The plot of the story is simple. Due to the system of trenches on the Western Front (that have France and Britain on one side and Germany on the other) the war has bogged down to a mutual bloodletting. It shouldn't been this way, but nobody that was sent to the Western Front through 1917 was a good commander. Von Falkenheyn, the German Commander at Verdun, was unable to hold onto early gains in that long, long battle. The best French General was Joseph Gallieni, who won the First Battle of the Marne by commissioning the famous ""taxicab"" army that drove the French troops to the front. But he retired. The actual Commander, ""Papa"" Joffre was popular with the men, but had a tendency of falling asleep at military strategy sessions. As for the British, Douglas Haig was saddled with planning global strategy for British forces in Africa, the Middle East, and India. His acceptance of the stalemate on the Western Front bordered on the criminal - he reduced the monstrous casualty rate to a simple war of attrition. With Commanders like Von Falkenheyn, Haig, and Joffre the war was hopeless. The suggestion of one more push ""over the top"" was repeated endlessly - and bloodily. <br/><br/>In 1917 units of the French Army had enough. The French Mutinies were long known, because of the trials and executions of hundreds of mutineers. One good result was the arrival at headquarters of General Henri Petain. His reputation is besmirched by his treason in leading the Vichy Government in World War II, but Petain was a senile old man when made a figure-head (a fact his old friend General Charles DeGaulle knew, so that he reduced the death sentence against the old man to life imprisonment). One generation earlier, Petain saved the army and France - a debt that really should not be forgotten. Yes he tried the ringleaders, but he also improved the lot of the poilu (common soldiers) so that they were not living like moles or rats all the time. The regeneration of the French armies that Ferdinand Foch would lead (with Haig and Pershing and their men) to eventual victory began when Petain took charge.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>PATHS OF GLORY looks at the situation that led to those mutinies, and to one of the drumhead courts. Adolph Menjou is a leading general, who realizes that a victory is required for appearance sake (i.e., the politicians are breathing down the back of the French High Command). He invites his old friend George Macready to lunch and drops a hint that if they could find a nice victory Macready may get promoted (Menjou says this very carefully - no fool he if he has to deny it). Macready can just taste the promotion. He promises the men will do the job.<br/><br/>They don't. The job is to capture a well protected salient called ""the ant hill"", because whenever men are fighting over it they look like ants fighting each other from a distance. The leader of the men who are to charge is Kirk Douglas. In peacetime he is an attorney, so he has enough brains to question the intelligence of the so-called army brains.<br/><br/>Macready is watching the attack from a bomb shelter, and notices the men will not leave the trench. He orders an artillery barrage on his own men, forcing them to face the Germans. This will turn out to be a disastrous mistake on his part. <br/><br/>After the disaster Macready picks three soldiers to be representative of the troops. One of them is selected by a Sergeant who is a real coward, and who is aware the enlisted man knows he is a coward. Douglas defends them, but the court is controlled by Macready and his flacks. The three are convicted. We watch their last night , with one (Timothy Carey) certain that a pardon will come for him at least. Another gets badly injured in a mishap. When the time for the three to be shot occurs (they are set up like Christ and the two robbers at Calvary), the wounded man is slapped out of unconsciousness to see the firing squad getting ready to fire.<br/><br/>Douglas has been discovering what Macready did - and reveals this to Menjou. He hopes to do this to force Menjou to overturn the death sentences. But Menjou holds back, and lets the executions go on. We see him dancing at a dinner party while this is going on. The next day, when Macready is having breakfast with Menjou (and Douglas shows up), Menjou brings up the illegal act of firing on his own men. Instead of a promotion, Macready is being thrown out of his command, and probably prevented from getting further ones. Pulling his shredded dignity together as best he could, he pointedly states that at least he was a soldier (unlike the courtier - general Menjou). After he leaves, Menjou offers Macready's command to Douglas. And Douglas tells him off very memorably.<br/><br/>PATHS OF GLORY is a fantastically good look at military incompetence, corruption, and those shafts of decency that the common soldiers and Douglas represent. Although set in time and place in 1917 France, it's message is universal. It is a great movie."
"TooShortforThatGesture","4","35","76","24 December 2004"," Not what it used to be.
","I was very disappointed by this film, given the accolades it generally receives.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible film, but it seems to me that it probably gained its reputation by dint of the fact that it had an original and very daring take on the military for its day. Obviously it is a matter of personal taste, but for me, I think it wrong to call a film ""great"" when its ""greatness"" is closely tied to the particular period in which it was first released. Some films are very much of their time, and ""Paths of Glory"" seems to me to be one of them. In this day and age, a movie that basically says ""war is hell, and many of the men involved in making war are immoral and commit evil acts for selfish reasons; these men appear particularly awful when compared with those courageous men who behave nobly in the face of war"" doesn't have the shock value that it did 50 years ago.<br/><br/>Given the lesser impact of this larger message, it is easier to see the seams and flaws in other aspects of the film. To a great extent, the story seems simplistic. The villains are terribly villainous and the victims are terribly noble. We know from the first 2 or 3 scenes everything we are every going to know about the nature of the primary characters. No one really grows or changes. Instead, the story plays out mechanically. The acting is not bad, but it's a bit old-fashioned and stage-y. Similarly, the technical aspects of the trench and battle scenes, while very good for the time, have a dated quality that undercuts the viewer's involvement in the film. Even for a kangaroo court, the trial scene is silly in the grandest tradition of bad, illogical Hollywood trial scenes. (For example, the defendants are being tried for retreating in defiance of their orders. Yet, when one defendant mentions that he retreated because he was ordered to, no one, not even the noble Colonel trying to defend him, picks up on that fact, i.e. that he was, in fact, OBEYING orders.) In the final scene, a captured German girl is paraded and sexually demeaned on stage in front of a group of rowdy soldiers who seem likely to jump her; instead she's asked to sing a song and the soldiers begin to cry and hum along like the nuns backing up Maria in ""The Sound of Music."" I recognize that this is a movie and that perhaps it was a more innocent time, but in a movie that purports to show us the nasty reality of war, I found it more silly than affecting for Kubrick to suggest that this scenario would end in choral tears rather than assault.<br/><br/>I'm not taking issue with the themes of this film, which are as relevant today as they ever were. Nor am I saying the movie is worthless today. But I am simply unsure that it deserves an on-going reputation as a GREAT film. Some films are born great and stay great, other become great over time. But some films may be born great and then gently fade away -- like old soldiers."

"SubterraneanHomesickAlien","10","5","8","11 July 2010"," A Great Cinematic Experience
","www. ourfilmreviews.com<br/><br/>With classics like ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Stanley Kubrick was long ago canonized as a filmmaker of the highest skill and intelligence. One of his greatest skills is not allowing his films to be watched passively. He forces his viewers to respond both emotionally and intellectually. ""Dr. Strangelove"" does so with its black, disturbing humor and its comical treatment of one of modern man's most penetrating fears: nuclear warfare. ""2001"" does so by immersing us in its sweeping visuals as it follows mankind from the dawn of time to a place beyond time. ""A Clockwork Orange"" does so by forcing us to confront the inescapable violence and evil inherent in human nature and society's casual indifference and at times subtle encouragement of such. ""Paths of Glory"" is Kubrick's first masterpiece and while it is often forgotten in comparison to the three films mentioned above, it is just as compelling as any film he or anyone else has ever made.<br/><br/>The film's running time is only 87 minutes, yet it is deeper artistically than most films that carry on past the 120-minute mark. The reason for this shows Kubrick's superiority as a filmmaker. Every scene and piece of dialog is instrumental in forming the film as whole. Nothing is wasted. Every aspect of the film coalesces with every other aspect. This is seen in the coming together of the overall narrative of the French army's suicidal mission and the storyline of two individual soldiers within the army. Before the failed attack on Anthill, three men embark on a reconnaissance mission to scope out the territory. The subordinate officer, Paris, witnesses his commanding officer, Lt Roget, accidentally kill the other soldier. After the failed attack on Anthill, when the commanding officers are forced to pick one man from their troop to be tried at the tribunal, Lt. Roget chooses Paris, in an attempt at silencing the one man who knows his secret. But after Paris, along with the two other soldiers, are condemned to be shot, guess who Col Dax assigns to lead the execution? Roget.<br/><br/>Roget cannot hide from his guilt. He is forced to face it. When he asks Paris if he wants a blindfold for the execution, he cannot look him in the eye and asks for forgiveness. It is a powerful moment. This smaller narrative of Roget and Paris is interwoven then with the greater narrative. A lesser filmmaker might have had the Roget and Paris subplot remain a subplot with its own separate conclusion. The Kubrick, the conclusion of Paris and Roget is wedded to and made more powerful by the larger narrative.<br/><br/>Roget needs to be forgiven by the only one who knows his secret. His guilt is genuine and his desire for redemption private. Roget's private guilt is contrasted by General Broulard's complete obliviousness to the blame he deserves (taking the Anthill was his idea to begin with) and his desire to set things right only in the eyes of the public. He does so by telling General Mireau that he will be investigated for misconduct. After Dax tells Broulard of Mireau's order to fire on the battalion, Broulard must investigate Mireau not out of any sense of justice, but because Dax threatens to go public with the information. Boulard offers Dax Mireau's position, implying that Dax revealed Mireau's misconduct only to further his own career. Dax is outraged that Broulard is incapable of comprehending the injustice and his indignation. Thus, the one who is most responsible for the failed attack and the numerous deaths is also the one who has the power to blame and punish others for his failure.<br/><br/>The scene of Dax's indignant outburst against Broulard shows the nature of true evil. Mireau may have ordered his own army to shoot at the battalion and he may have vehemently argued for the battalion's execution, but he was acting on a set of principles, albeit a very twisted set or principles, but principles non the less. Broulard has no principles, only a desire to elude blame and preserve his own appearance and position of power and respect. This is the truer, more subtle evil.<br/><br/>Kubrick's screenplay and direction and Douglas's perfect performance make Dax's indignation our own. The injustice is painfully felt. We understand so clearly that these soldiers would have died if they left the trenches and are condemned to die for not leaving them. As we see the three condemned soldiers walk to their execution in a wonderful and classically Kubrickian tracking shot, we realize that the only two options these soldiers had were to die by the bullets of their enemies or by the bullets of their own countrymen. Either way, bullets will pierce their flesh. The nature of war makes living impossible<br/><br/>The movie ends with one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in any film. In a tavern full of rowdy French soldiers, a German girl is brought on stage to be mocked for the entertainment of the soldiers. She is ridiculed because of her sex and nationality. Terrified, she begins to quietly sing a song in German. The whistling and hollering of the soldiers slowly abates and we see in their faces a look of such anguish, regret and sadness. A few of them wipe tears off their faces. Not knowing the words or the language, they begin to hum the song with the German girl. They are reminded of their humanity and it hurts. After showing us the darkest side of humanity, Kubrick ends his film with this scene of hope. Even in the midst of a war, these soldiers are capable of overcoming their brutishness and acknowledging their own humanity and that of the opposing nation. Kubrick allows us to see the entire range of what humanity is capable of, from the cruelest of injustices to the most beautiful of moments"
"Don-102","10","5","8","13 April 1999"," Madness, Cowardice, Glory - War in a Nutshell Kubrick Style...
","There is no glory in Stanley Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY, a devastating anti-war film that looks at the Generals who command soldiers as cowards themselves.  How dare these pampered men who will leave the war without a scratch practically order their soldier's slaughter?  This is the conflict posed by Kubrick with the help of Kirk Douglas, who quite frankly is mesmerizing as the Colonel of the 701st Division ordered to take an anthill they probably have no chance of taking.  Adolphe Menjou is the sadistic General who Douglas must fight for the right of his soldiers' souls as well as his own.  We are able to take an introverted look at the madness of war. Cowardice is frowned upon by governments, but how do you decide what it is in such inhuman conditions.<br/><br/>Kubrick shows his talents as a master of atmosphere and looming death in this classic of WWI.  The French are the symbol and a possible execution is the tool with which Kubrick stirs our emotions.  Unlike his later films, we have some pretty realistic characters here.  Douglas is the only man with a head on his shoulders and is so passionate about the cruel injustice proposed by the spiteful General he seems willing to die himself. The court scene contains some of the movie's most memorable emotional moments, but check out the 1957 war sequence.  Kubrick had a definite vision as to how he was going to pull this off.  Shot in Germany, the French soldiers go through a frightening, revolutionary experience.  Deep explosions pulsate the soundtrack, soldiers are blown to bits, and cowardice is nowhere to be found.  The mere possibility of a soldier's ""recollections"" under such hellish conditions cannot be taken as gospel.<br/><br/>The attempt on the German anthill is truly something to see, another feather on the cap of Kubrick, who would create the most amazing boot-camp sequence in film history roughly 30 years later in FULL METAL JACKET.  Compared to that film, PATHS OF GLORY is much more effective at portraying a precise vision of the abomination of war.  Whether its the French, or the Russians, it is all the same.  Worthless when unnecessary, tragic when waged.  Ralph Meeker is great as one of the Corporals on trial for ""cowardice"" in the face of the enemy.  At one point, he asks a priest to leave him alone and basically betrays the thought of God in the face of what he is going through.  Pretty deep stuff, I must say.  PATHS OF GLORY is one of the best war films ever made.<br/><br/>RATING: 10 of 10"

","Usually I don't comment or popular classics or war movies, but I absolutely wanted to leave a review for ""Paths of Glory"" for two principal reasons. First, as a sort of small homage to Kirk Douglas. This great gentleman of Hollywood passed away early 2020 after reaching the more than respectable age of 103. Nevertheless, he will be sorely missed. Secondly, and most important, because not any other movie ever made comes even close to depicting the pure madness and hypocrisy of warfare as accurately and truthfully as Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"". The three words in the subject line of this user-comment represent the widely known moto of the nation of France. Logically interpreted these words imply that all French people are free, equal and live in brotherhood. Well, this moto certainly wasn't yet put into practice during the horrible World War I. During the most shocking sequences, Kubrick masterfully juxtaposes the wealth and luxury of French military generals (fancily dining and waltzing with aristocratic ladies) versus the daily agony the ""ordinary"" French soldiers are confronted with (suffering and dying in the trenches). These same hypocritic generals give the command for downright impossible attack raids, and then subsequently accuse their troops of cowardice and blame them for their own strategy-incompetence against - around that time - much better organized German army. Douglas impressively portrays the honorable Colonel (and attorney of law) Dax who puts his career and reputation at stake to defend a trio of soldiers put on trial ""as an example"".<br/><br/>Powerful and extremely compelling war classic, based on a fantastic source novel, but brought to an even higher quality-level thanks to the meticulous directions of Stanley Kubrick and the dazzling performances of an all-star cast. The dialogues in the script are often astonishing and the atmosphere is so intense that you'll find yourself gasping for air. More than sixty years old, but still as effective and breath-taking as ever, ""Paths of Glory"" is a cinematic classic in the purest definition of the term."
"ironhorse_iv","9","4","6","3 October 2019"," Director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film 'Paths of Glory' was indeed on the right path. It was a masterpiece.
","Like the tagline for this classic says, 'it explode in the no-man's land, where no picture ever dare crossed'. No wonder, why Kubrick's film was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry in 1992. It was a very memorable movie. Filmed in black and white and shot on location in Germany, the movie was based on the novel of the same name by author Humphrey Cobb tells the story of a French military lawyer and colonel, Dax (Kirk Douglas), having to defend a group of soldiers charge of cowardice in a life or death court martial case during the Great War. Without spoiling the motion picture too much, while the book is graphic and gory, told from multiple points of view, the film is indeed as bleak as it can be as well with its titular main character. Unlike 1930 'All Quiet on the Western Front' & 1937 war movies 'La Grand Illusion' which critique of the romantic idealization of duty only to show the violent battle scenes where countless waves of men are slaughter like cattle. This picture doesn't even bother painting any part of the war in a positive light. There is little to no camaraderie between soldiers and the officers see them as nothing, but cannon fodder. I kinda like that approach to the material, because having brotherhood within the military does undermine the whole anti-war message. Besides the mise-en-scene ending with soon to be Kubrick's wife, Susanne Christian singing ""The Faithful Hussar' & the snare drum in the beginning, the film has little to no music to force emotional feelings. You rarely see that in these types of movies at the time as everything has to sound epic & patriotic. Another great thing about this motion picture is the way, it was filmed. Kubrick's vision allows the audience to feel stuck and trapped along with the troops in the ever-so dangerous confined trenches with tight pov and close ups. We see the dirt, the mud and blood in detail. Also we don't see the enemy visual at all; making every scene on the front seem more haunting and suspenseful, because any minute, a soldier might get picked off by a sniper or artillery. As for scenes for high ranking officers like Major General Georges Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), we witness the opulently from both exterior and interior wide shots of the huge mansions in which they're living in. You see all the riches & grandeur. While this approach makes all the officers seem stereotypical like greedy elite aristocrats born into privilege with no knowledge of hardship. In truth, some of them were from the working class whom stumble upon power within the ranks through tough service like Brigadier General Paul Mireau (George Macready). They just lost their moral way while getting there. A heartless shallow of a man that war brewed and needs. A type of a person that Colonel Dax hopes not to turn out to become by the end of the film. Douglas acting in this, is astounding as his facial features show the dilemma, his character has to go with. You really do feel the struggle that he has to do his duty for his country, but also his wiliness to protect his men from unreasonable harm. Honestly, all the performers did a hell of a job. I think the director was a little too harsh on veteran actor Adolphe Menjou. He was fine. I doubt he needed to redo the same scene 17 times. The same can be same with the doomed men 'last meal' scene. It didn't need 68 takes. Stanley Kubrick was just being a semi jerk perfectionist. However, he did made the right choice with firing actor Timothy Carey. He was indeed disruptive as Pvt. Maurice Ferol. The whole faking his own kidnapping for personal publicity was outrageous uncalled for. Anyways, due to the movie's offensive critical assessment within the hierarchical military. The government from France & Switzerland banned the movie for almost twenty years following its release. The film was also withdrawn for many years within countries like Germany and Spain. Even in the United States, the motion picture was banned in military establishments, both at home and overseas, due to its content for some time. It was also denied an Academy Award nomination. Regardless, the fact that the movie has alienated a lot of audience members at the time. In the long run, the film loosely based on the true story of the Souain corporals affair during World War 1 has gain a strong following after Vietnam War era when together with the Watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence within the post-war militarism lifestyle. It's now considered as one of Kubrick's best. I just glad that the director took the risk with making the film and didn't make it more commercial to the general public. The altered happy ending, they filmed could had ruin the message. The same with Paramount Pictures who proposed changing the army to that of Czarist Russia, due to being afraid of offending the French government. Thank goodness, the changes were reversed back more closely to the original novel at the demand of actor Kirk Douglas. In the end, he saw this movie for me. Despite some heavy handed moments, the film is a bombshell of a movie that needs to be seen. It's one path worth taken."
"ccthemovieman-1","Null","7","13","26 August 2011"," Early Treat From Kubrick
","I thought this was an interesting film, albeit agenda-driven, but one that kept my attention. The characters are interesting, the story moves along well considering its mostly talk, and it's nicely directed by a young Stanley Kubrick. Looking at this on a high-def DVD, it was magnificent in spots. Kubrick's camera angles and photography, as usual, were a treat for the eyes.<br/><br/>Although Kirk Douglas gets top billing, I thought George Macready was the unofficial ""star"" of this film, playing the obsessed ""General Mireau."" Douglas' picture dominates the cover of the DVD and is featured in most of the stills seen here on the IMDb home page of the movie. He was good - don't get me wrong, but Macready deserved at least equal billing.<br/><br/>Whatever, the movie flows nicely and is sure to invoke an emotional response from any viewer. The only problem I saw was that it was a bit too manipulative. Kubrick's obvious hatred for those in military authority (see ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"") is so blatant in here that the ""bad guys"" are almost cartoonish, uttering statements that are so ludicrous it strains credibility. Speaking of credibility, if this film was re-made today you wouldn't have American actors playing all the French roles.<br/><br/>Some supporting actors in the film, were either famous actors like Adolphe Menjou, Ralph Meeker and Richard Anderson or ones with faces you don't forget, such as Timothy Carey and Emile Meyer. Their characters added a lot of tension to this story.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest surprise (at least to me) was discovering that the German singer at the end of the film was Kubrick's wife! Overall, a recommended film to watch."

It is a very good film, with the beginning of the fluid camera he would later develop.

"buzzerbill","2","22","55","22 October 2005"," Overrated? I fear so.
","Kubrick is one of the really great film auteurs of the 20th century, and Path of Glory is admired by many as a work of early maturity. Indeed, there is much to admire. The clinically sharp black and while photography; the use of long tracking shots; fine performances, particularly George Macready as an ambitious general and Adolphe Menjou in perhaps his finest work in a career filled with portrayals of reptilian manipulators; crisp editing; effective use of sound. Indeed, it bears many of the hallmarks of Kubrick's more mature (from Dr. Strangelove and Lolita onwards) style. One particularly uncanny stylistic element: the tracking shots and interiors in some ways prefigure Resnais's great Last Year at Marienbad--which in turn seems to be the source of much of Kubrick's style from 2001: A Space Odyssey onward.<br/><br/>And yet this film feels flat. It's arguably the emotionally chilliest of all of Kubrick's films. Its unending succession of military stupidity and venality (even for the French army) is oppressive. It is a classic war-is-hell-and-the-commanders-are-the-ninth-circle polemic--and all its technical polish cannot disguise its formulaic hollowness. It lacks the most distinctive thing characteristic of all of Kulbrick's mature films--sardonic humor. Even the most touching moment in the film--the café scene--is somewhat forced.<br/><br/>Kubrick was obviously fascinated with war, from his very first film, Fear and Desire (which is even flatter and more formulaic then Paths of Glory)to Spartacus to Dr. Strangelove to Full Metal Jacket, with growing maturity and mastery. Of Kubrick's early films, The Killers stands out; but it is not until we reach Dr. Strangelove and Lolita that his full genius is apparent.<br/><br/>For the Kubrick fan, see this film to understand the arc of his career. I can't really recommend it to others."
"onepotato2","1","29","79","25 November 2009"," Morality for simpletons
","The b&w cinematography for Paths of Glory is very crisp, reflecting Kubrick's background as a magazine photographer, but I wish I'd never watched this. I admire some other Kubrick movies, but this movie suggests that the simplicity one observes here and in all subsequent Kubrick films, might just be shallowness; as it is here.<br/><br/>This script is dross, and hopelessly naff with its dumb sermon. The whole thing is overdetermined. What possible idea in it could a viewer disagree with? I felt like I was being led by the nose, because there isn't one syllable of ambiguity to be found in it; like a children's storybook. All you need is a morality detector with two settings, 'good person' and 'bad person.' George MacReady is over the top as a one-dimensional villain. One prisoner (Pierre) chews the scenery when offered a last drink; overacting at it's finest and pure hambone comedy. The extremely bad acting of the sobbing prisoner (Maurice) made my mouth hang open. The way his exit march is handled is utterly obtuse and unaffecting. Less important but odd, the attitude of the production has nothing in common with 1915. Never once does this feel like anything but 1957.<br/><br/>The ending in which an entire room full of soldiers all have an epiphany at the exact same moment is dramatic rubbish. Show me a room full of fifty men who all have the same emotional response to anything, and I'll show you a corny dramatic lie. Everything in this movie (and I mean everything) is amateurish except the cinematography."

","War films are a Hollywood staple starting somewhere back when All Quiet on the Western front gained prominence for being a great adaptation of the famed novel by Erich Maria Remarque. This 1957 film continued that great tradition with another look at the insanity aroused by war. In this instance it explores the insanity that can be aroused within an armies own ranks and the blind obsessions and principles of some individuals. Kubrick is never one for pulling punches in his films and with a classic star at his disposal in Kirk Douglas; he goes for the jugular of the issue. The humanity of the issue and corruptness, but the great aspect of the film is that it never loses site of the fact that everyone can make mistakes and that humanity of everyone in the army is necessary.<br/><br/>The backdrop of this film is based in fact. A certain General George Broulard, played with his usual air by Adolphe Menjou, comes to another commanding officer whom he manipulates into ordering a suicide run on the enemies' position. General Paul Mireau, played with a particularly hateful attitude by George Macready, then carries down the orders to his brilliant Colonel Dax, Kirk Douglas. Mireau in turns forces Dax to ready his men for the insane attack run. This is the setting, what follows of course is the utter failure of the attack and the anger of the superiors especially Mireau. Mireau wants to kill some hundred troops as an example of the men's cowardice, because during the attack he sees about roughly half of Dax's troops refusing to advance out of the trenches.<br/><br/>The film's strength is not in the message so much as the human face Kubrick gives the soldiers zeroing first on a moment of true cowardice committed by Lieutenant Roget. The Lieutenant is ordered to go on a reconnaissance mission the night before the attack by Dax, and, whether out of fear of going into No Man's Land or just a bad drinking problem, he gets drunk before going out with two of his men. As the trio goes out, he makes rash decisions, splitting up the party and fleeing at the first signs of trouble in the process letting fly a grenade that kills one of his men. The other man on the mission stays behind to see this and makes it back alive. This seemingly smaller story inside the big story is key though I think because it shows the humanity of the issue. What gives the commanding General up in his safe booth the authority to call his men cowards? He cannot possibly have a feel for the issues of the moment as Colonel Dax does in seeing his men bottled up in the trenches because they will be slaughtered upon going over the top.<br/><br/>The last third of the film is devoted to the court-martial of three of Dax's men over the issue of cowardice because Dax has managed through his form weight of being a premier lawyer to get the Generals to agree to settle for just three men's life at steak instead of the hundred originally discussed to show an example. The three men in question are either chosen by the commanding officers by random of because they are generally in disfavor as is Corporal Philippe Paris, the man who witnessed Roget's cowardice. Each falls apart as the date of their never in question execution approaches.<br/><br/>I will not reveal much more about the plot and the ending, but I will say that this film stands as a stellar war film dealing with great issues of warfare and the horrors it creates. The performances are gripping and the story gives a fair tone to the whole issue although as is usual of a Kubrick film the protagonist is generally in opposition to the authority throughout the film a effort that Kirk Douglas does with his usual ferocity, nobody can quite getting as seemingly hot tempered as Douglas. He is a yeller of extraordinary talent. Despite being roughly 51 years old this film still holds up quite well with great cinematography work and art direction."
"MaxBorg89","10","5","9","21 July 2007"," Anti-war cinema at its most powerful
","Paths of Glory is one of the two war movies Stanley Kubrick directed throughout a splendid career (the other being Full Metal Jacket). And though at first sight these films may seem very different, they share a vital key theme: the futility of war and the monstrous effects it has on the human psyche.<br/><br/>In the case of FMJ, the monstrosity is shown through the actions of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D' Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine), both mentally scarred by the teachings of sadistic Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). In Paths, however, the dreadful actions do not take place on the battlefield, but in a courtroom: it is in that courtroom that three randomly selected French soldiers (the context is WWI) are to be court-martial-ed, the charges being cowardliness and refusal to accomplish the mission assigned to them. What the prosecutors don't know is that the mission in question (attacking the Anthill) would have resulted in a bloodbath on the French side and that Gen. Mireau (George MacReady), who ordered the attack and also insisted on holding the trial, was so disappointed he actually asked one of his men to shoot the retreating soldiers. The only person who seems to understand what is really going on is Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas), and it is his difficult job to convince his superiors of the necessity of the squad's behavior.<br/><br/>Anyone who is even vaguely acquainted with Kubrick knows this is not going to be a fairy tale: Paths of Glory is one of the most effective anti-war films ever made because it is not afraid to expose the more rotten aspects of what happens in these situations (and it invites comparison with the M*A*S*H episode where Alan Alda makes a documentary and says :""This is no way to end a movie, I know that, but war is no movie""). The director openly criticizes the very nature of conflict by immediately taking Dax's side, showing that he, unlike Mireau who admires the size of the trenches (one of the most beautiful of Kubrick's many tracking shots) and only wants to be remembered as a great general, is more concerned about bringing his men back home as unharmed as possible, putting glory aside.<br/><br/>One scene in particular supports the filmmakers'point more than anything else: the trial. While the prosecutor just wants to have the three soldiers sentenced to death and barely pays attention to them, Dax (played with solemn authority by Douglas) allows them to explain what actually occurred during the attack and uses this to openly express his contempt for what the war has done to everyone around him, depriving them of any reason and consideration for human life. That one powerful and upsetting sequence proves beyond any doubt that any war, no matter how noble it may be in its organizer's intentions, is totally and utterly incapable of bringing any real profit: all that results is hatred and greed.<br/><br/>Kubrick directed nine more pictures after this one, and all of them dealt on some level with the frailty of humanity and its inevitable decline. Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket aside, though, none of them, however perfect, resonates with as much anger and relevance as Paths of Glory."
"MartinHafer","10","5","9","15 November 2006"," A marvelous film about the STUPIDIST war in history with a dynamic performance by Douglas
","This is a wonderful film and for those who are looking to see a Stanley Kubrick film that the average person can relate to, this is a great initiation to the director's work. Some of his films are a bit hard to understand or frankly make my head hurt (2001 is a great example), but this one is much more straight-forward and conventional than most of his other films while still being a great film.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a real incident in WWI. When a squad of French soldiers were ordered ""over the top"" (i.e., to crawl out of the trenches and charge across the battlefield while being shot down like dogs--the standard way of fighting on the Western Front), the men were so sick of the pointless fighting that they refused. As a result, the officers (who are shown sitting many miles behind the lines sipping sherry and living a life of opulence) order that some soldiers randomly be taken out of the group to be executed as an example to the others! The complete unfairness of the punishment, the futility of the war and the fact that the leaders were a group of soul-less fiends were the focus of this intensely interesting film.<br/><br/>The lead was played by Kirk Douglas. His job was to defend these poor men, but it soon becomes obvious that the trial is a show trial--the men are doomed from the outset. In some films, Douglas' style of acting is not very appropriate, but his bigger than life acting style and the way he ultimately explodes at his superiors is a wonderful addition to the film. He single-handedly acts like the conscience of the nation--something that was clearly lacking. A wonderful and intense performance on his part--perhaps only surpassed by his lead in the film LUST FOR LIFE.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film about this war--a wonderful film to be seen along with ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. Any true fan of film should see this movie."

","I had read all the hoopla about this being one of the seminal anti-war films of all times and, upon finally seeing it, was astounded at how overrated and poorly done it is. The movie is less a drama than a Victorian melodrama. All the generals and officers are the mustachioed villain and all the soldiers are the sausage-curled maiden tied to the railroad tracks. The dialogue is farcically unrealistic; General Mireau's lines, in particular, are of the ""Aha, my pretty, at last I have you in my clutches!"" variety. One almost thinks that the director is trying to make the audience hiss. Character development is non-existent, as is subtlety. The ballroom scene, in particular, with the grandly attired generals dancing to Strauss waltzes in luxurious surroundings with elegantly attired women is - get it? - supposed to be a contrast with the misery of the soldiers; the point is made like being hit on the side of the head with 2-by-4. Kirk Douglas does the best he can with a limited part. The denouement with the German girl (a prisoner? a prostitute? a lost civilian? just who the hell is she?) singing is both baffling and unconvincing. One keeps waiting for some kind of closure and - bam! - 'The End' comes up. <br/><br/>This is not a quarrel with the theme of the movie, just its execution. For a truly brilliant treatment of the same theme - the scapegoating of soldiers by an uncaring and expedient power structure - see 'Breaker Morant,' a movie with complex, fleshed-out characters, realistic dialogue, and true emotional and dramatic depth. And, for good measure, a court martial that puts the one in ""Paths of Glory"" to shame."
"YohjiArmstrong","Null","4","7","24 November 2011"," The Great War before the hysteria of the 1960s
","Plot: During the Great War the Colonel of a French Regiment defends the lives of three of his men, sentenced to be shot after a failed attack, in court.<br/><br/>Like most Kubrick films this is a peculiarly inhuman film. I can never escape the conviction that he is more interested in the technical aspects of the film than in the story or the human beings. Nonetheless the novel on which this film is based has enough plot and character to sustain the film.<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting aspect of this film is that it was made before the 1960s reduced the First World War to a parody, best exemplified in ""Oh! What a Lovely War"". So whilst there is an evil château general it is also made clear that he is no coward or shirker. Instead his most noticeable feature is a battle scar and he spends some time in the trenches. Similarly the punishment is not entirely undeserved. One company did refuse to attack, albeit because of the cowardice of its commander. This adds a realism and a moral complexity often missing from films dealing with similar subjects.<br/><br/>The film isn't bad but neither is it great. Like a lot of 1950s war films based on novels it is slightly stiff. There are only really two scenes of any greatness. The first is the attack, which is brilliantly, if inaccurately (much talk of a barrage but none is ever shown) portrayed. The second is the final scene, where the French soldiers realise that the song being sung by a captured German woman is the same as one they sing. It's a cliché - we're all the same - but the careful pacing, the magnificent faces and the genuine feeling shown by the extras makes it work."
"gary-444","6","4","7","4 July 2010"," Strong Early Kubrick Anti-War Film
","I watched this, some 53 years before it was made, without knowing anything about it. It transpires that this was a huge advantage in making an objective assessment of a film which has historically divided opinion. The context is important. Made in 1957, it was part of the double feature era when people went to the cinema to see two films, both under 90 minutes. The demand was that a full story be told in that time meaning that far more storytelling ground was often covered then than in modern day films. Certainly here, a longer running time or reduced content would have been a benefit.<br/><br/>It was also made forty years after the end of the First World War in which the film is set. The mass slaughter was being objectively assessed against a backdrop of a ""just"" second world war, and a futile Korean War which had ended where it started, but at a cost of a million miles. Although essentially an anti-war film , it does not succeed in having universal sentiments which transcend the time.<br/><br/>The first awkwardness is that although the story is set in French lines, a stoutly English and American cast speak and act English. There is always a debate to be had about sub titles, but here the problem is greater than that. Virtually no attempt is made to make the characters, and their setting, feel French. This is so acute that on occasion it is easy to forget whether we are in French, British or America lines.<br/><br/>George Macready is good and well cast as General Mireau, but a donkey leading lions. Yet the opening act offers a crude short hand of a venal, incompetent self-seeking command prepared to sacrifice their men for personal advancement. Kirk Douglas then appears as a more junior commander, Colenel Dax who is cajoled into undertaking an impossible assault on German lines. Dax's lines have no French reference at all, they are the words of an American Hero juxtaposed against a seemingly corrupt, ineffective French Military hierarchy, a narrative which would probably have played well at the time.<br/><br/>The battle scene itself is well handled and convincing as the French launch an attack which is beaten back by the German positions. Yet the pivotal moment when x orders his gunners to fire on their own positions as troops refuse to leave their trenches under withering fire is crassly handled, and a little naive. The tradition of men refusing to follow orders facing death by their own side dates back at least to Roman times and was well practised in the first and second world wars by the Russians and Germans. Absolute obedience to orders IS a military imperative, yet instead we are invited to sympathise with those men who cowered in their trenches letting down those of their comrades who DID follow orders. The artillery officer refuses the order.<br/><br/>Mireau orders that a body of men are summarily shot in the interests of discipline, and Dax, a qualified lawyer, provides his services in defence of the three accused. This act is undoubtedly the strongest as the folly of war is forensically dissected, transcending the moment. But then it falters again as Mireau is threatened with exposure by y for ordering French Artillery to shell their own lines to the Press. The reality is that there was no mass French Press then, the press that did exist was strictly establishment, and there was no chance that the story would have found its way into the paper. Late 1950's mores of American Press practises is superimposed wrongly in time and place.<br/><br/>The summary execution of the token ""Cowards"" is grandly set, and poignantly portrayed and perhaps the story should have ended there. But instead there is a denouement ( the only thing French about this film!) where Dax's soldiers take some rest and recreation to be entertained by a captured young German woman, later to be Mrs Kubrick in real life. Initially there is a suggestion that she will be gang –raped, but then she sings and unifies then all in a cloying, sentimental ending at odds with the ambitions of the film , but wholly consistent with a commercially acceptable close.<br/><br/>The story is well told, and well acted, and is satisfying with numerous hints of the greatness to come. Its shortcomings, as only Kubrick's second feature are wholly excusable. But the madness of war is more completely explored in ""Dr Strangelove"", it's visceral side more effectively explored in ""Full Metal Jacket"" so this is no masterpiece, but a strong part of the Kubrick canon nonetheless."
"chaos-rampant","Null","4","7","15 November 2008"," A young Kubrick delivers a stonecold war movie classic
","Who'd have thought that at such a young age, and coming after the decent but largely unremarkable heist noir of THE KILLING, Kubrick had it in him to deliver a flat-out, stonecold war movie classic? Had Kubrick decided to renounce the aesthetic grandeur and epic scope of his later films, he could always have had a brilliant and successful career as a genre director. His visual sense is certainly competent at this point but his directing is still very much that of a genre director.<br/><br/>He's not trying, possibly not even caring or daring to at this point, to break the norm but rather work inside it the best he can. It is however the mark of a director well on his way to greater things that he nails the themes, conflicts and most striking images of the movie with just five tracking shots - General Mireau inspecting the shellshocked soldiers inside the trench, Col. Dax moving through the trenches before the attack, Col. Dax and the division moving through the wartorn battlefield full of ditches and old fenceposts, the guests of General Broulard dancing, and finally the three soldiers being escorted to their deaths.<br/><br/>Interested more in the moral dilemmas pertaining to war and those who wage it as opposed to the physical act of war itself, emphasizing the absurdity and futility of sending out men to die by the thousands for a couple yards of shellshocked dirt, perhaps the best observation on the human nature Paths of Glory has to offer is that idealism has no place in the act of war. War is so far removed from notions of decency and common sense that bringing idealism in it as an afterthought appears out of touch with reality.<br/><br/>Although Kirk Douglas portraying Col. Dax, and doing a formidable job at it, is presented to us as the hero in a conventional sense, the selfsame idealist in the heart of darkness that has been the driving force of many a war movie, and he does raise some interesting questions, he is essentially a man deeply contradictory to his own nature and his own choices within it: can a man sworn to service in the army call issues of a moral nature? At what point are any and all such questions deemed completely irrelevant? Is for example Col. Dax in the end any less responsible for the deaths of his men than the generals who ordered this futile attack? <br/><br/>I believe some answers are to be found in the philosophy of Judge Holden from Blood Meridian, perhaps the most frightening of literary antagonists ever to be summoned on paper. What this gnostic archon, war everlasting, tells us is that war is the ultimate form of divination because it allows for the individual to be completely susbumed in the whole, the obliteration of will and ego. Reading the scanned pages of an old book from the Civil War-era, written by a Confederate army surgeon, I remember coming across a passage that referred to amputations to be carried out at the field of battle; as the surgeon explained from his own experience, not only are even the most coward of men consumed in the pandemonium of battle and capable for the most heroic deeds, but wounded soldiers will more easily sit through amputations when the battlefield is sight or the sounds of battle can be heard."
"markbellamy","9","3","5","26 July 2010"," Not really a war movie
","In reading other reviews I see a lot of them saying this was one of the finest ""war movies"" ever made. I agree that it is one of the finest movies but I do not believe it is a war movie. The war is merely the backdrop for the drama that is human politics, selfishness and greed. The backdrop could be a corporate board room, any place in government, anywhere in which a bureaucratic system is in place with little accountability at the top. The lessons in this film extend far beyond the battlefield. I would say it is a must see to anyone interested in movies about moral inconsistencies, abuse of power, and the realities of the way the world operates."
"ritchie-10","10","3","5","24 November 2006"," Don't Normally Comment- BUT!!
","I must say that I don't normally comment on movies on this site but with ""Paths Of Glory"" I must make an exception. Where do I start - the opening scene between the two General's is an exceptional piece of character study- George Macready is brilliant in his role as the unwilling but then fanatical leader. The scene's that follow have been analysed many times but the scene that I think stands up so well is the final scene between Col Dax and Gen Broulard where Dax is accused of engineering the situation for his own personal gain. Kirk Douglas is excellent in this scene and further enhances his reputation in the final scene which is probably the most moving scene in movie history.No dialogue is required but Douglas's face tells a story from initial disgust to hope in the human spirit to finally resignation to what lies ahead."
"houndtang75","10","3","5","24 September 2006"," One of the greats
","'Paths of Glory' is one of those rare films that you can come across on TV halfway through and be gripped to the end no matter how many times you have seen it. Easily Kubrick's best film, his later pictures were brilliantly shot but emotionally empty, it also features career-best performances from pretty much everyone concerned. Even Kirk Douglas, not the world's greatest actor, is highly effective in his role as the compassionate Colonel Dax. George Macready and Adolphe Menjou, two fine actors who were only rarely given worthy roles, are excellent as the two despicable Generals. Of course the film is unsubtle but with a story such as this subtlety is not really possible; the message is obvious but no less moving for that."
"Drezzilla","Null","3","5","19 January 2004"," Kirk kicks butt!
","The film was remarkably quick, not even 90 minutes in length, but being a very young director at the time, I'd say Kubrick filled it well. It almost reminds me of the earlier ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (1937) with Paul Muni because of the corruption that exists in the French army, and how someone like the character played by Kirk Douglas can stand up to it even in the face of death itself. I work at a video store and some of my customers that watch numerous classic movies like I do said that they thought this was Kirk Douglas' finest hour (and 26 minutes). They were right. But this isn't his only great picture, he's got plenty to offer in just about every film he's been in right from the beginning of his career. If you are a newcomer to Douglasania, this is a great movie to start off with."
"DocBlink","10","3","5","29 September 2003"," I apologize...for not watching this sooner!
","Let me preface this review by stating that if anyone has seen Paths of Glory and afterward is unable, for whatever cockamamie reason, to give the biggest kudos to Stanley Kubrick's writing and directing work, then he/she quite simply is swine before whom those of us in the know ought not to cast our pearls.<br/><br/>The film is a masterpiece.  From the brilliant choice to shoot in black and white cinematography (thus giving a gritty, darker feel to the entire story, and refraining from sugarcoating the absolutely hellish experience that trench warfare must have been), to the effective use of zoom-ins, to the short, poignant dialogues, and to the generally minimalistic approach to the anti-war message of the screenplay--it all mixes together incredibly. Kubrick could have spent hours of celluloid on the finer illogical points of military court martial trials as well as on the horrors of battle. Instead he wrapped the total package in some 87 minutes, credits included.<br/><br/>
Though there were several memorable scenes (the battle in question itself, the kangaroo court, the priest's trite comments while administering last rites to those sentenced to execution, the conversation between Col. Dax and the commanding General), the shot that sticks in my mind occurs soon after the lovely German acquisition has very reluctantly and almost inaudibly began to sing ""The Faithful Soldier"".  Kubrick cuts back to the previously heckling, boisterous crowd of French soldiers.  On their faces the spirit of superficial revelry fades away to a much stronger force--that of human understanding and compassion--and the appreciation of innocence and beauty. The things good and true for which these men thrust their lives on the line to defend.  Such evocative images are what make the many sins committed by the modern motion picture industry tolerable--perhaps even forgiveable."

","'Paths of Glory' confirms what a great director Stanley Kubrick was early in his career. This and 'The Killing' from a year earlier are just a one-two punch. You can just feel Kubrick sharpening his knives on this one in preparation for 'Dr. Strangelove.' While this is a drama, you can't help but laugh at the complete absurdity of the situations. I kind of doubt (or at least *need* to, anyway) that an officer would be allowed to go as far as he did, but I think Kubrick wasn't necessarily going for a literal lesson here and was instead trying to make a larger statement about the lives of soldiers being in the hands of madmen. At any rate, Kirk Douglas does a wonderful job of portraying quiet, white-hot rage, and I especially liked Ralph Meeker, who reminded me a little bit of a young, goateed Orson Welles.<br/><br/>The black and white really stood out as well-I really liked the scenes in the basement of the chateau.<br/><br/>If I had to criticize anything about the movie, I suppose the very end with the German girl and the men didn't really work for me. It might have been powerful in another film, but I think it took away from the final showdown between Douglas and Adolphe Menjou. It's a trivial complaint and shouldn't dissuade anyone from seeing this."

This film shows the devotion of a simple colonel, Colonel Dax interpreted by Mister Kirk Douglas himself, trying to defend French soldiers who listened to their instincts of survival against French seniors officers thinking only of their careers, Kubrick shows the human (and maybe the French, who knows?) stupidity to want to make examples where those who should be killed are those who send their troops to die without any mercy and not those who are sent as cows to the slaughterhouse. The film is animated by special effects of time, but neither the latter nor the black and white are disturbing, on the contrary, it brings authenticity to this masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick who deserves his 9/10, almost a 10 !

"Aditya_Gokhale","10","2","3","14 October 2010"," A strong anti-war statement
","Stanley Kubrick's 1957 war film, ""Paths of Glory"" based on a novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb is more of an anti-war statement. Hence, calling it a 'war film' wouldn't be right, as it does not lie in the same category as other war films, plot-wise.<br/><br/>The film is set during World War I. The story focuses on the war between the French and the Germans. General Mireau (George Macready) sends his division headed by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) on a suicidal mission to take over a prominent German position called ""Anthill"". Initially Mireau is reluctant to carry out this task, but is enticed by an offer of promotion from his superiors. With this in mind, he practically forces Dax to begin with the mission. Col. Dax, also aware of the danger associated with the mission, points the same out to Mireau but Mireau does not relent.<br/><br/>Sure enough, the mission ends in disaster and what follows next is the crux of this powerful story.<br/><br/>What happens when these men in the very same army, defending the same country, from the same regiment turn against each other? What happens when some superior officers get greedy and selfish and stop valuing human life, more so, the lives of their own soldiers? ""Paths of Glory"" goes deep in the psyche of these men, both superiors and subordinates and makes a strong statement on what war does to them.<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"" was just a modest success commercially, I've read. It comes as a surprise, considering the screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson is spell-binding, to say the least. Kubrick directs with his touch of genius and creates a tremendous impact. The first scene of attack on Anthill is so masterfully shot, you actually feel you are in the field of battle! Ditto for the rest of the film when things take an unexpected turn for some of the less fortunate soldiers. Every frame of this picture is gripping, right 'til the final one.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas delivers a fabulous performance as Colonel Dax. His helplessness and the growing frustration about the greedy and corrupt army officers and the overall futility of the system is so convincing, it creates a lasting impression. This is one earnest and unforgettable performance by the legendary actor.<br/><br/>George Macready lends a great supporting act as the selfish, cut-throat General Mireau. So do others, including Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel and Timothy Carey.<br/><br/>A special mention here, of Mrs. Kubrick (Christiane Kubrick) who makes an appearance for a short scene to sing the haunting German folk song, 'The Faithful Hussar'. She appears in a scene towards the end in what could be one of the best and most haunting endings I've ever seen in film.<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"" may not be as popular as some of Stanley Kubrick's later films, but it is definitely one of his best."

In 1916 in the French trenches, three soldiers are court-martialled for cowardice by officers who want to use their case to instil discipline into the ranks.<br/><br/>Paths Of Glory is an incisive melodrama chiefly depicting the corruption and incompetence of the high command; the plight of the soldiers is less interesting.

","'Path of Glory' would not have happened without Kirk Douglas. He not only makes here one of the deepest and most human roles of his acting career, but also put all his influence and some money into determining the great studios to make this anti-war film, which became the first in a series of great anti-war films of Kubrick. The story of the first world war French soldiers sent to an almost sure death by their corrupted generals and then randomly court-martial-ed and sent to death for cowardice when they face the predictable failure is turned by Kubrick into a splendidly built and beautifully filmed pledge for humanity. And it is humanity that prevails despite the tragic destiny of the soldiers. The final scene in which soldiers join a German prisoner girl into humming a simple German love song is a scene of redemption and of pure shaming of nationalism. Kubrick was still, at least at that point in his life and career an optimist."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","2","3","8 April 2009"," Kubrick's ""anti""-war film is to-the-point, powerful
","War is a horrible thing. That's the general message of Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory,"" but it's not meant in the sense of people killing other people is bad, it's because war makes us dehumanize ourselves, make poor decisions and devalue human life. This is a war story told on one side. The antagonist in this film is not the other side, it's the people in power and our inability to see clearly because our judgment is clouded by ideas we claim to be greater than ourselves. The film might not seem like a fair portrayal of the military, but it is a masterpiece of showing how war can turn us into terrible people if we're not careful.<br/><br/>Set on the French side against the Germans in World War I, the film is about a French offensive that ends in death and retreat. When the general charges the survivors with cowardice punishable by death, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) must defend the lives of three of his men from the military powers that want to make an example of their execution. It is a story told with blunt dialog about the use and abuse of power, but it is structured and executed in a way that creates audience sensitivity and emotion first to justify the dialog's use.<br/><br/>It also helps the dialog to have much of it delivered by Kirk Douglas. Col. Dax is not a flawless character, but he's about as good as they come: smart, honest, passionate and selfless. Douglas plays the role with equal conviction -- it's hard not to cheer for his character and it's incredibly satisfying whenever he outsmarts the corrupt characters. Though he's far from French (a little authenticity in the film in general, like French extras at the least would've been nice)<br/><br/>Though Kubrick's talents will flourish in his later films, ""Paths of Glory"" is filmed beautifully. It is not a very visual war film, there is a lot of dialogue, but Kubrick somehow conveys his meaning so clearly to the audience. He mixes in shots of various lengths, carefully picking his close-ups of characters to indicate the pivotal moments and sometimes capturing the whole setting from far away for dramatic impact. He also uses a lot of long takes, a couple of times following one character who is the focus of the previous scene until the character focused on in the next scene walks by, then he changes directions. The techniques are simple, but they catch your attention when meaningful. Douglas and others like George Macready as the corrupt General Mireau also help maintain that dramatic interest.<br/><br/>Once fantastic choice Kubrick makes is keeping the Germans out of it. You never see them, only their artillery exploding in the war zone. It's critical to understanding that the real war here is not against the Germans, its within the French ranks. It's a war Kubrick wages against unfairness and injustice. He also portrays a wide range of character reactions to war. Of the three prisoners, each provides the viewer a unique insight to war and imminent death. The film really begins to make you rethink what courage is. Is it courageous just to accept death, even under unfair circumstances? Each prisoner's battle becomes a microcosm for the initial conflict of the soldiers retreating or in some cases not even leaving the trenches.<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"" is an incredible statement film about war's dark side, about how we're taught to fight for certain things like glory and patriotism and to obey all orders. This film downright questions it from the beginning and supports itself throughout its duration. It then goes on to address deeper questions of courage, faith and ultimately the timeless question of whether or not humans are inherently good or evil. At 87 minutes long, ""Paths of Glory"" still manages to tell a vital story with passion and grace."
"JohnWelles","10","2","3","4 April 2009"," Brilliant War Film.
","Stanly Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) is one of the very few First Wold War movies. I my opinion, the reason is that the death in WW1 was unbelievable. On the the first day alone in The Battle of the Somme (1916), the British suffered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead, the single most bloodiest day in the history of the British Army - and remember, this was before the Atomic Bomb. Hollywood would probably not be able to tackle something so grim and depressing (althouh Hollywood might do a WW1 film nowadays, especially after such films as ""Shinderlers List"" and ""Saving Privet Ryan"") when Hollywood mainly deals in escapism. And that what makes ""Paths of Glory"" so unusual. Seen from the French's point of view, it has three French solders being executed after taking lots because their unit is found guilty of cowardice while trying to take a German controlled hill, called the ""Ant Hill"". Kirk Douglas gives a fantastic performance as ""Colonel Dax"" and so do Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. Stanly Kubrick's first masterpiece, and one definitely one to watch."

Kirk Douglaus gives one of his better performances as Col. Dax. Despite to some belief, this is not an anti-war film. The film is supposed to somewhat of an anti-abuse of power film in a way, as stated by Kubrick.

The story is rather simplistic and so are the characters. No doubt about it who is bad and who is good.<br/><br/>But that is fine by me. The story grabs you and you feel sorry for the poor soldiers who are used as cannon meat, shown by the scenes on the battlefield, and you hate the generals who think nothing of their men as tin soldiers. I felt really frustrated when the 3 soldiers were on trial. This movie makes you feel with the characters and sucks you into the story. It shows the cruelty and the insanity of war. The same things Kubrick shows in Full Metal Jacket. The way the soldiers end is not happy but the last scenes of the movie give a spark of hope which can be a little bit silly for some viewers, which I understand, but I liked the ending.<br/><br/>It is a good court drama, with great acting and I like these kind of films. And because it is about a war where there are too little films about and because it is a classic and the film is made by Kubrick, I too might just give it a little bit too much credit."

","Stanely Kubrick's Paths of Glory is a great example of when Kubrick was at his best- and only in his twenties.

What happens in the trenches, if just from a bird's eye view? His gliding camera in these scenes is remarkable. Then when he moves into the courtroom scenes, and the following awaiting of the soldier's last call, it becomes heartbreaking, and it becomes one of those rare stories that never loses its relevance. And the last scene shows that Kubrick, contrary to his de-humanizing nature in his films, reaches an emotional peak equal to De Sica or even Dreyer. It gets better every year. A classic of anti-war sentiment."

","I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the ""real"" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies."

","War produces the true natures of men: some lose their humanity altogether and become monsters, while others embrace a kind of moral courage that cannot be defined or explained. So it's astonishing that a considerably intellectual filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick could distill this principle in such a visceral way.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Paths of Glory is a film of high concept and blinding idealism, but composed simply and without plot complication. It's World War I: Upon the orders of his superior officers, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) leads his entrenched regiment of the French Army into a battle to take ""The Anthill"", an impenetrable German stronghold. It's a suicide mission, and everyone knows it. Of course Dax protests that the attack would only weaken the French Army, but General Mireau (George Macready) does not care. Indeed, Mireau has made the same conclusion, only the promise of a juicy promotion (by the equally unscrupulous General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou)) and his own Machiavellian ambition have already persuaded him to command others to certain and purposeless death.<br/><br/>Unlike the amoral executives who command him, Dax does not lounge in extravagant mansions and eat gourmet meals with fine silver; he lives in the trenches with his men, a lawyer compelled by war to root in a festering wound of dirt and death dug by politicians who have never gazed upon a battlefield. As he dutifully proceeds to prepare the attack, fear abounds among the soldiers he leads, with deadly results.<br/><br/>It is here that the film begins to challenge how we define courage. We see Dax advance while hundreds of others die horrifically around him. Some do not leave their trenches, so intense is the firefight on the battlefield. A safe distance away, Mireau orders his artillery to fire upon their own army to force them out of the trenches. Meanwhile, without support, Dax falls back into the trenches in a rain of dead bodies without making it to the Anthill, unable to convince anyone else to climb back out with him into oblivion. <br/><br/>So galvanized is Mireau's rage at the prospect of losing his promotion that he demands one hundred men from the regiment be executed for cowardice. General Broulard convinces him to merely court martial three men chosen at random, and even allows Colonel Dax to defend them against the death penalty. The trial is a farce to say the least, and although the outcomes are sadly predictable, that doesn't mean the final journey we take with this movie is less than we can anticipate.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is a technically perfect film. As the camera seamlessly glides through the twists and turns of grimy trenches, horror and fear visually unfold like flowing tapestries along a magnificent human hallway. That nature and realism dominate the production design does not make the lens any less subjective or the images of war in all its boundless evil less beautiful. The booming cacophony of the battle scene has a aural texture that damns us to imagine the true nightmare actual combat must be. The acting is superb as well, every actor delivering his best work, Kirk Douglas in particular; despite his inclination for ham and bravado, Douglas' characterization of Dax is intense yet authentic and anything but a caricature. Colonel Dax's ability to maintain composure while evincing contempt and moral outrage is a script requirement, but the horror sculpted upon Douglas' face when confronted with the evil of men and the spiritual burden revealed in his posture and gait are the work of an artist. <br/><br/>As I said, this would seem at the outset like a philosophical film crafted by a director who demands his audience intellectually grapple with the moral implications of what is provocative material to say the least. Perhaps it does accomplish that; certainly, if you watch this movie and fail to think about the message the film delivers, you are not only brain dead but morally bankrupt as well. But please watch the final scene, a brief coda after the main plot of the movie has concluded: An achingly beautiful German girl held as an enemy captive is made to sing before the rowdy French troops. As the war begets monsters, sometimes men of real courage are able to rediscover their own humanity. Any movie can make you think. But in that last moment, if you can see more than a singing peasant and weary soldiers, if you are able to hear more in the simple folk song than the lyrics, then you, like Dax, can discover that the only true path to glory is not in war or ambition, but in hope and innocence that sometimes may only be found in the most unlikely of places."

This one is a heart-breaker account of a moment in history that repeated itself endlessly in that horrific bloodfest called the trenches of World War I. To some extent Kubrick returned to the theme in various ways with Full Metal Jacket, but Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is perfect here, demonstrating the challenge of maintaining honor within a system that has turned values on its head. It is a crisis in the life and career of Colonel Dax, who has lived by the watchword of Duty with a capital D throughout his career, but has remained idealistic and faithful to his men. The army's absurd effort to capture ""the Anthill"" results in a tear in the fabric of his idealism. The ugliness he sees is an eye opener for both Dax and the audience, who sees the truth with tragic clarity.<br/><br/>Colonel Dax, identifying with his men, is an inspiration in contrast to an empty culture of power and prestige with no ethical base."

","There's not much one can add here to what has been said regarding this excellent and classic War World I film based on actual facts.<br/><br/>Perhaps just point out that in a brilliant cast (Kirk Douglas renders one of his best performances ever and George McReady his best), the one who steals the show is Adolph Menjou in my opinion.<br/><br/>In his General Broulard character Menjou shows superb acting. He is a cynic and egocentric man who doesn't seem to care much about his men but a lot in his career and position, yet in his calm and at he same time strong manners he shows he will let some things pass but will not tolerate others. His meeting with Douglas while a party is going on downstairs is an acting class; he brilliantly avoids a serious conversation until he is told about MacReady's order to open fire against his own men. Menjou is perfect also when -while having lunch with Mac Ready- and with a sort of total lack of interest informs the man that there will be an inquire to judge for his behavior but you notice his eyes look clearly to see the other man's reaction and enjoy it. But mostly, in such a complex and unlikeable character (he goes along with the three soldiers shooting knowing perfectly it won't serve justice) his General Broulard transmits a sort of dignity and sympathy to the viewers.<br/><br/>And incredibly natural performer, Menjou died 5 years after this film at age 73.

A superb text (it pays attention in the excellent dialogs), capable to move perhaps to the most insensitive of the military ones. <br/><br/>In just 87 minutes, makes an implacable attack to the militarism, to the foolishness of the wars, to the cowardice, cynicism and incompetence of official. So deep in the accusation that the film was forbidden of being exhibited in France by several years. Without doing any concession to the commercial movies, the subject is been in a serious and contusing way. <br/><br/>The direction of Kubrick is exquisite Â— the only moment in that he failed and it allowed that the history was touching, it is in the end when the soldiers hear the German singer (interpreted by the wife of Kubrick). The cast is blameless, with special prominence for Adolphe Menjou, in the paper of cynic general Broulard. The only actor that doesn't have a good acting as the others is Timothy Carey, that makes the cowardly soldier in the hour of the shooting. My favorite scene is that in that colonel Dax is disgusted and he riots before the indecent proposal of general Broulard. <br/><br/>Even if you don't appreciate the gender, this film it is to be seen, reviews, debated and never to be forgotten.

To the poster who asked about the source of the song the German girl was singing at the end, it is ""Der Treue Husar"" (The Faithful Husar). The lyrics and a midi of the melody can be found here: http://ingeb.org/Lieder/dertreue.html. Oh and by the way, the singing girl is Christiane Harlan - later Kubrick's third wife.

","I have seen ""Paths of Glory"" after having learnt that it has similar similar themes and storyline to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". After this one there are only two featured Kubrickian movies for me to be seen: Lolita and Barry Lyndon.Since these two movies were adapted from two known world classics one should first know the book before seeing the movies in my opinion.Paths of Glory is loosely based upon the true story of five soldiers who were prosecuted for the cowardice in the face of the enemy. The movies uses three soldiers for the storyline.On a time when the French and German army developed into a continuous line of heavily fortified trenches a selfish overambitious French general during World War I orders a regiment on a suicidal mission to take the Ant hill to get promotion he has been promised. When the soldiers are under constant artillery fire the regiment refuses to leave the trenches with the third of men are dead. The general's order to open fire on his own squad and his accusations of mutiny of the simple soldiers display how Paths of Glory,with a masterly finesse, is making a mockery of the idiocy of high-ranking officials in the army.It depicts the wanton characteristics of the homo sapiens who could just rule out his entire nation for his personal ambitions.Kirk Douglas as the Colonel Dax, who leads the soldiers in the attack and is the counsel of three soldiers before the court-martial is totally great. His lines and cross-examination in the farce court make a laughingstock of war,the judiciary system of the army and the ambitions of the ignorant higher-ups. After having seen this one and Full Metal Jacket I said to myself I wish Kubrick could have done more war movies instead of involving in film-noir or a space flick."

"gelman@attglobal.net","10","1","1","18 June 2006"," World War I -- Kubrick Style
","""Paths of Glory"" is a film about the stupidity of warfare, set in 1916, when the French and the Germans were entrenched opposite one another and a ranking officer of the French General Staff (Adolphe Menjou) persuades a field general (George Macready) that it would be good for his career if he made an attempt to capture the ""ant hill,"" a German strong point opposite the French position. Menjou and (especially) Macready are perfect for their parts. I'm of two minds about Kirk Douglas as the colonel instructed to make the attack which he knows is doomed to failure. Douglas was a star of considerable magnitude at the time but he is no more credible as a French officer than he would have been as Lassie. Nevertheless, Douglas could act, and as the central figure in the film, he carries it off. There are a great many outstanding scenes in this movie -- what else would you expect with Stanley Kubrick as writer and director -- but the most telling is when a frightened German girl (Christiane Kubrick, also known as Suzanne Christian) is escorted on stage in a beer hall filled with French soldiers who despise the Germans and forced to sing a sad song in German which when the catcalls die down leave every one in the audience (on both sides of the screen) misty eyed or crying. My own memory of that scene will last long after every other fades away. This is a great film, worthy of its reputation."
"jldmp1","9","1","1","18 June 2006"," Essay In The Master's Craft
","This is early proof of why Kubrick especially loved the topic of war -- it inherently gave him two levels of directorial control: the 'normal' one at the director-over-the character level, and the implied one at the director-over-actor level. Douglas would later give profanely grudging praise to Kubrick about his methods.<br/><br/>The best part of this is the meta-level of conflict: that of rogue director against studio bosses, which is mirrored in the story narrative. Kubrick exploits this meta-narrative to get some fine performances from the battle within between Douglas and Macready.<br/><br/>Along the way, we get the nascent Kubrick visual treats centering on his trademark use of camera inertia - he would later build entire cinematic worlds on this notion (after gaining full auteurship). <br/><br/>Especially striking is the first sight of no-man's land when the flare briefly illuminates a landscape from hell. Also a striking effect, on the macro scale, is the jarring relocation of the story from the obliterated battlefield to the court-martial in Schleissheim castle, a neo-Classical beauty."
"VicTheDaddy","10","1","1","4 May 2006"," Important truths
","I was surprised how any one could criticise this film,I've always believed this to be one of the greatest anti war films ever made,it is so powerful.It was first shown on British TV in the early 80s,and before it was shown it had been announced that it was banned in France,i don't know if it still is,but they were not happy about this film,this maby why it was late being shown on British TV,after all our British Generals had our soldiers executed on ridiculous charges,so we cant be hypercritical.About 300 British soldiers were executed, the French about twice the amount,so this film is really important,and Stanley Kubrick was probably the first director to pick up on these terrible injustices.In Britain we have had campaigners trying to pardon our men,because the sad thing is their families at the time or their descendant's at the moment can not march pass at the centopath on Remembrance Sunday as where the soldiers were executed this is not allowed,and yet the majority of these men were executed for falling a sleep while on duty,one example that springs to mind was of a soldier who was executed for refusing to put on a wet cap,he was executed for insubordination.Paths of Glory really does open peoples eyes to what these poor soldiers were up against during WW1 as there are a lot of people out there who still don't realize what went on .For a 1957 film this is very harrowing stuff,you know that once the three men are going on trial their fate is already sealed they haven't a chance in hell.And the worst part about it all is that the French Generals actually believe the men had a fair trial,its all ludicrous but sadly true.I believe this film did get people more interested in learning more about WW1 as there were many cover ups and many untold truths like the amount of British soldiers bodies that keep being unearthed in France and Belgium at the rate of about 7 a year and sometimes as many as 20-30,our government kept this quiet for years,so it seems that WW1 is destined not to be forgotten."

","This film is a treasure. I first saw it in the local movie house in Ashland, Oregon, in my second season with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The theater owner screened it for one night only, I believe, as an ""art film"" that might appeal to a small off-beat crowd. The whole Shakespeare company showed up, and we were enthralled by the acting and stunned and moved by Kubrick's lean, masterful story of an historical cover-up perpetrated by autocratic generals in collusion with lower-ranking opportunists and cowards. Based on a blatant miscarriage of justice in the French army of World War I, the film had a powerful impact on our generation--in the post-Korea, pre-Vietnam era. It is a classic indictment of the corruption of men in war. I believe it holds up very well and that no one who sees it at the right time of their life will ever forget it."
"randeclip-1","10","1","1","16 January 2006"," Wow!!!
","Many films preach to us the horrors of battle and tout the slogan: ""war is hell"". Most only serve to give the viewer two hours of grand battle scenes interspersed with mostly forgetful introspective moments by the main characters. Then there is the film Paths of Glory directed by Stanley Kubrick. It could have been a grand World War I spectacle with a cast of thousands and sets rivaling the war itself. Instead, Kubrick brings us a story of a failed battle told from a personal side rather then the often used long shot of war, shown on a grand scale, so often used in lesser films. Paths of Glory is the story of an egotistical Generals failure and the lengths he is willing to go to protect his reputation. <br/><br/>What a truly grand film this is. Even though this is one of Stanley Kubrick's early films, his genius is plainly evident. In one of the first scenes in the film he took what could have been a long, dull conversation between two Generals and choreographed their movements, along with the cameras, in such a way as to keep the viewers attention. Also, the long dolly shot that followed the General through the ""trench"" is purely Kubrick. One of his signature moves that he has incorporated in all his films.<br/><br/>The film ends with a scene of a frightened captured German woman being forced to sing to the French troops. On first thought I wondered why this scene was in the film. Looking back this scene provides much more incite to the situation then first at hand. She puts a face on a faceless enemy, thus humanizing them. We see her fear and realize that the French troops, who are soon off to another battle, are just as scared and unsure of their own futures. She is the only person of beauty in a world filled with horror. The palaces that the Generals occupy are grand, but also cold and lifeless. She is alive and out in the terrible world alongside the men in the trenches. <br/><br/>War is hell, not only for the soldier but also for all of humanity, and the only Paths of Glory shown to us in this film is the one taken by the three men. This is what the film is truly about."

I was absolutely amazed that this film was made in the glory days of the Hayes system, because the ending is not a happy one. It isn't violent, but it is disturbing. That is the great thing about Kubrick's films. I find it unbelievable that the story takes place almost a century ago, but the story is exactly the same. There will always be highly placed authority figures who make huge mistakes, and there will always be someone else who will pay dearly for it."
"Jeannot","10","1","1","29 March 2005"," A Miniature of the Real Battle
","The film effectively depicts, in miniature, a historical realityGeneral Nivelle's spring offensive to regain the Chemin des Dames position in April, 1917. The real offensive involved 19 divisions, and not just one regiment, as in the movie. Forty thousand men were lost on the first day, with almost nothing to show for it.<br/><br/>Such a vast undertaking can be dealt with only in non-fiction works such as Barbara Tuchman's GUNS OF AUGUST, which marvelously depicts on a vast canvas, involving the movements of whole armies, the opening of the war in 1914, the events which led up to ""the Miracle of the Marne."" The irony here is that by stopping the Germans at the Marne, the French doomed themselves to four years of slaughter, eventually losing 1,400,000 young men killed.<br/><br/>Art cannot deal with such scope, but must miniaturize; thus the offensive in PATHS OF GLORY is confined to one regiment, and then focuses on just five men in that regimentits colonel (Douglas), a cowardly company commander (Wayne Morse), and three privates who are randomly selected as scapegoats. Of course, the selection is not really random; the Ralph Meeker character, for example, is selected by Morse because he had witnessed the latter's cowardice, which cost the life of one of his men on a scouting expedition.<br/><br/>In addition, two generalsperfectly played by a self-righteous George Macready (""If those sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones"") and a cynical Adolphe Menjou (who is surprised to learn that Dax is an idealist)are also individualized as the ""bad guys."" The point is often made that the bad guys are too bad. Of course they are. In a movie, more so than in a novel, you have to paint in broad strokes. The essence of film is melodrama.<br/><br/>The Macready character is loosely based on the real Nivelle, who was appointed commander-in-chief after the ten-month-long battle of Verdun, in which the French lost half a million men. Nivelle, more mistaken than evil, felt that what was needed was a major gung-ho offensive by artillery and infantry. But the Germans, forewarned, had taken the high ground (called the ""Ant Hill"" in the movie), along the Chemin des Dames, and had prepared impregnable positions. In WWI, unlike WWII, the defense almost always won.<br/><br/>The movie, based on Humphrey Cobb's novel, perfectly illustrates art's practice of miniaturization, individuation, and humanization of large historical events. As viewers, we need to see specific persons we can relate to. The Vietnam movie PLATOON, carries this idea still further, in that a platoon is only part of a company, which is part of a regiment. A WWII movie which does the same thing is A WALK IN THE SUN.<br/><br/>For me, PATHS OF GLORY remains a classic, and is not just an antiwar filmthough it is that too."
"Gavno","10","1","1","14 March 2005"," Kubrick's Masterpiece... and a Cautionary Tale for Today
","PATHS OF GLORY is, without question, Kubricks GREATEST film, even tho it was one of his earliest. In it's way it ranks with CITIZEN KANE as a controversial and classic work of art... in addition to being a work from early on that the director had to live up to in subsequent work.<br/><br/>Controversy followed the film all through it's first release... it made a LOT of people in high places VERY uncomfortable. For a time, the film wasn't permitted to be shown in France, and it holds the dubious distinction of joining the ranks of a small number of other films that the Defense Department BANNED from being shown at US military base theaters.<br/><br/>The only other military theme films (tho not war films) so ""honored"" by the Pentagon that I know of are Rod Steiger's THE SERGEANT (which depicted Steiger as a homosexual noncommissioned officer), and Kirk Douglas' TOWN WITHOUT PITY (which tells the story of the court martial of four American occupation troops in Germany who are charged with the rape of a German teenager).<br/><br/>Were PATHS OF GLORY to be released today, it would probably STILL be banned from post movie houses; it asks far too many questions and reaches too many conclusions that make the military uncomfortable.<br/><br/>PATHS OF GLORY shows the results an ill conceived (and ultimately unsuccessful) attack, ordered by officers who are far more concerned with their own egos, images and reputations than they are with either the successful prosecution that attack or the wellbeing of the troops... whom they refer to an expendable herd of cattle... and who made the sacrifices in the costly battle.<br/><br/>SOMEONE must take public responsibility for the failure to take the objective, and if the officers take that responsibility, they reason that it will undermine the Nation's confidence in the competence of it's military leaders. The troops didn't succeed with the botched planning, so why not make the troops pay for the failure? Three soldiers are chosen by lot, for the most part at random, to be tried for cowardice and executed.<br/><br/>The court martial is rigged from the beginning... no record of the proceeding is kept, no admission of evidence of extenuating circumstance that favors the accused is permitted to be introduced, no testimony is permitted other than explanations of WHY the troops failed to successfully take the objective... and of that, nothing is permitted that casts a shadow on the leadership. The only permitted explanation in this ""inquiry"" is cowardice of the troops.<br/><br/>Overlying the entire farce is the scheming and maneuvering of officers to advance their own careers, while at the same time scrambling to cover their own asses and avoid responsibility for the battlefield fiasco.<br/><br/>Contemporary audiences can scarcely avoid seeing the parallels between the repercussions of the movie's ill fated assault on The Anthill and the Abu Gharib Prison scandals in Iraq; high ranking officers are walking away clean while troops are bearing the brunt of discipline for decisions that they may not have made.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas plays Colonel Dax, the indignant field officer who defends the doomed troops, to perfection. His careful balancing of his sense of duty to his country with his sense of moral outrage over the travesty of the trial is magnificent.<br/><br/>Wayne Morris is notable as a weak, incompetent field officer who, much to our amazement, in the midst of battle raises a whining objection to the way Colonel Dax speaks to him as bullet whistle around them! The nonsequiter here is astonishing.<br/><br/>George McReidy and Adolph Mejou are sinisterly outstanding as the division's generals... men who can blandly refer to unjust court martials and subsequent executions as a ""tonic"" that benefits the ""morale"" of the entire division, men who can offhandedly comment that there is nothing more stimulating to troops than seeing someone else being shot, and men who are more than callously capable of calling in friendly artillery fire on their own troops in an attempt to force them to advance under impossible conditions. Their detachment from the realities of war, and from the humanity that they command as soldiers, is chilling.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning at times, especially in the execution sequence. It is probably one of the best uses of black and white cinematography that has ever been produced.<br/><br/>PATHS OF GLORY is a film that examines what Firesign Theater called (with tongue planted firmly in cheek), the ""Secret Code of Military Toughness"". It leaves the audience angry and disturbed... as it SHOULD."

","""Paths of Glory"" is one of those movies that movie making is all about. It is one of director Stanley Kubrick's earliest movies, indeed, it is his first really important film, and it is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Today, little is known amongst the general public regarding World War I, the great war, the war to end all wars. I study this conflict because, quite frankly, this war defines how the 20th century will evolve, World War II is merely a continuance of the first war, and the Cold War another chapter of the previous. <br/><br/>The film is based on a book by Humphrey Cobb which I have to say, I have not read, a situation I will soon rectify. The story is about this French army regiment's failed attempt to capture a worthless position called the ""ant hill."" The attempt is doomed from the start. Generals are embarrassed and examples must be made in the form of three innocent French soldiers, court martialed for cowardliness and sentenced to death by a kangaroo court.<br/><br/>Douglas plays these hapless men's regiment commander, and then their lawyer for defense. But every thing is rigged and so, the three men are finally shot by firing squad. Kirk Douglas' role is in a word inspired, and you can see Spartacus in his future in that intense gaze and strong dimpled chin. <br/><br/>But the film is so much more than this thread on injustice that binds scene after scene. It is more about the experience of the everyday combat soldiers trench warfare and senseless battle that marked World War I as the first of so many senseless wars of the 20th century, and finally it is about the commander's ego at the expense of the dog faced soldier. <br/><br/>This is an outstanding film. Four stars all the way. The writing, the acting, and the scene structure are all compelling. This is the definitive World War I movie, a subject that film gives little credence to today. It is in ultra silver black and white and filmed in a close up aspect ratio of the classic 1.33 to 1. Wide screen is what it is, but Stanley Kubrick knows the value of intimacy in regards to the original theatrical format, that all TVs use today.<br/><br/>I got this fairly new released MGM DVD for 10 bucks at the local big book store the other day. It is truly cinematic drama at a bargain. I know I will watch it again and again.<br/><br/>Recommended highly as high film art."

Its about how a grave injustice is carried out because of political expediency.  Made somewhat more believable by casting it in the French Army in WW1 (where in that legal system the presumption was guilty until proven innocent), and perhaps to partly side step the blatant antiwar message for Hollywood bankrollers and the American Audience. A futile attack is engineered playing on the ambitions of an unscrupulous officer, and when the attack on a strong enemy position, with a depleted force, is predictably repulsed, scapegoats are identified to be tried for cowardice.  Not only a good performance by Kirk Douglas as the righteously indignant defense attorney, but the villains in the film are totally despicable, which they are supposed to be. Kubrick's portrayal of trench warfare is every bit as good as All Quiet on the Western Front,  and his contrasting of the  circumstances of the officers' lives and of the bizarre trial standing next to the brutality of the war and the insanity of the majority of the frontal assaults is pure Kubrick.

War merely serves as a back drop to the true conflict at the core of this picture.<br/><br/>The story centers around the attempted assault by French troops on a heavily fortified position held by the Germans during WWI. The French general in charge is looking to advance himself by taking the ""ant hill"" as it's called, even though it looks like at best he'll lose over 50% of his men in the assault. Once the assault fails, the French commanders try three soldiers for cowardice to make examples of them, and show the others that failure is unacceptable. The three soldiers are tried with no evidence what so ever and convicted in a ridiculous trial, despite the efforts of their colonel (played to perfection by Kirk Douglas). <br/><br/>Kubrick actually gets to the point rather quickly in this early effort of his. Those of you who dislike the plodding pace of his other works like BARRY LYNDON and EYES WIDE SHUT will find this film a welcome relief. Kubrick's technical mastery can be seen even in this old b&w vehicle. He knows how to shoot a battle scene, it's safe to say. <br/><br/>SPOILER!!!!<br/><br/>The ending took me a little by surprise. I was hoping and expecting the three soldiers to somehow get off the hook and not be executed. I guess a happy ending would have killed the point, though.

It can't be beat. I can't decide however, whether I love the story, or hate it. The clash of the old and modern world is really what the Great War was fought over, or better put what prompted its outbreak. You have the old guard in the film, the 2 elderly generals, representing the 19th century remnants of the Napoleonic age, clashing with ideals of 20th century modern man, Kirk Douglas. And I do believe to a certain extent struggles like this were commonplace during this tumultuous period of history. But in the film, they were both ends overly caricatured if not satirized. Douglas's character seems, anachronistically speaking, out of place, more so than the old guard. Almost as if he's a lost time traveler trying to reason concepts that those inhabiting the time he is visiting have no possible way of yet comprehending. Representation of fact, probably not, but it is well written and extremely well acted. Even Douglas is outstanding. For the overwhelmingly positive hype it receives, I was somewhat surprised and decidedly letdown by its transformation from a combat action film into a courtroom drama. Not that it's slow, but I was totally eating up the action and was left wanting more. I still have to put All Quiet ahead of this, since it sticks to the facts and reports the action rather than passes judgment over war, by injecting a fictitious criminal justice proceeding, and making the good guys so to speak, the bad. We don't exactly need this to know that War is preventable calamity. The action, if done well enough, which it was here, will invariably slam that message home with authority. I'm afraid that in the end, this film leaves an after taste of rather naive and rather outdated idealism. But its quality, and worth a watch."

As this is a war movie shot entirely from the ordinary soldier's perspective it is shocking. This is a result of true fear in the spectator's mind rather than explicit violence on screen. The presence of death feels real. The story unfolds without any waste of celluloid. Kubrick explains the logic of the characters out of the war-circumstances they find themselves in without establishing the characters over a feature length. Even when it is clear how the film would end after watching it by half, the story telling gains more momentum . Having seen this film only once on a big screen I was surprised almost everybody cried in that movie theatre with the story's unexpected epilogue. These final frames explain how and why millions of people would go out killing each other and on the other hand why they should not. This movie is perfectly understandable because it is brilliantly made in any way with outstanding actors. One may argue whether or not this is one of the best movies of all times.

The movie certainly makes no attempt to be objective--and why on earth should it? From the perspective of the 21st century, it is hard to imagine a more immoral and outrageous event than World War One--in which an entire generation of several nations was led to slaughter for no detectable reason, except the pique of a group of so-called Great Nations whose era was deservedly coming to an end. Though I cannot comment authoritatively on how realistic the war scenes or the military protocol is--nor, I suspect, can anyone else living in this day--I found the battle scenes devastating, the dialogue often riveting, and the final scene extremely affecting. It would be best to see this film on a big screen, but it's worth seeing however you can. Kubrick might not have attained full mastery of his craft when he made this one, but he was still head and shoulders above most of his contemporaries. I have a slight preference for Grand Illusion as a film about the insanity of war, but this runs it a respectably close second."

"rzajac","Null","1","1","18 December 2002"," Very good. But...great?
","I enjoyed Paths of Glory well enough, but am surprised, for instance, that it ranks so high in the IMDB top 250....<br/><br/>I see it as a formative film for Kubrick.  You can see the beginnings of his special emerging talent and interest; naming the names and delivering the dramatic goods without a bunch of extraneous matter; addressing those of us whose dramatic needs won't be satisfied by an appeal to worn-out and questionable moral assumptions endemic to film up to then (and still afflicting much of film today).<br/><br/>However, there were problems.  It appeared to me that Kubrick was unable to transcend certain encumbrances of the medium of the time; character acting, ""stage"" dialog and exaggeration, ""pulling of the punches"" in some of the writing and development.<br/><br/>Another thing:  I think of a line from ""Manon of the Spring"", where Montand's evil, culpable character says:  ""That would be just like [another villager]; to confess someone else's sins [to the priest]!""  And rightfully so.  And I can't help but feel this particular concern taints ""Paths"".  At its heart, it is very much a cinematic confession of the ""sins"" of someone else (the French).  The fact that the story holds some promise of universal application doesn't to my thinking sufficiently blunt that core reality.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers Ahead ***<br/><br/>Another thing I couldn't banish from my mind as I watched was, as reprehensible as the depicted military courtroom procedure appears to our eyes, that it was a heck of a lot more than many Frenchmen received during WWI, when court martial procedures were very often hastily convened in bombed out buildings with the dust still in the air, based on flimsy ""evidence""; often patently subjective judgement calls on the fighting mettle of the accused; followed by throwing the ""convicted"" up against the nearest crumbling wall and knocking them down with no more ceremony than taking a dump.  Heck, that's war, and it's largely unwritten and undocumented.  Which reminds me; when Douglas's character says ""I'm incensed that there is no stenographic record of this proceeding!""...then what did the writers base their script upon?  I do realize the above *does* describe much about the process shown in ""Paths""; the General was taking unfair advantage of the subjectivity taken for granted in determining the inner states of the accused, and to the extent this came from base promotional motives on the part of the general, it's a crime against humanity of unspeakable proportions, and I'm glad the story is being aired.  But it's just a drop in the bucket of the insanity of real trench warfare.  I couldn't dispense with that distracting thought during the movie.<br/><br/>All the scenes in the cell where the condemned were held were fantastic, and show where Kubrick was headed in his career.  Great writing, presaging ""Sparticus"".  Not all the writing in the movie was up to that standard (though close).<br/><br/>I didn't get the point behind the last scene, where the German girl sings and the French soldiers are deeply moved.  It was a great scene (great!), but I couldn't for the life of me achieve the integration of that scene with the rest of the movie, and I consider myself perfectly amenable to doing the bit of work to make those kinds of connection on behalf of well-intentioned filmmakers.  If there was a spiritual connection, I didn't quite see it.  I think it was an end-game botch.  When you look at the story, you realize that there was no resolution possible, because you can't bring the executed soldiers back to life.  But Kubrick & Co. needed to find a resolution anyway.  Perhaps the dawning investigation into Gen. Paul Mireau's shennanigans and Dax's vehement denial of self-aggrandizing motives should have been left ringing in our ears.  I don't know.  I understand why they had to have *something*...<br/><br/>In summary.  See this movie; it's good, and an important step in Kubrick's work.  Decide for yourself if it all comes together as a moral fable."

","There are only two film-makers who never made a bad film in their careers:Andrei Tarkovsky and Stanley Kubrick.Even though Kubrick's mastery of the film medium was evident as early as Killers Kiss, and maybe even as early as Day of the Fight, his genius was confirmed by this, his second major feature.Some critics even suggest that  Paths  Of Glory was Kubrick's BEST film, and that his subsequent career was one of decline. It would be more precise to argue that Paths of Glory was the film which showed Kubricks complete mastery of TRADITIONAL film grammar and techniques, as first' exemplified by Griffith and Pudovkin, while his later films show him EXPERIMENTING with those techniques,challenging established ideas of narration and characterization. In addition, Paths of Glory is-on the surface- a more 'didactic' and ""humanistic"" film than his later works. He seems to be delivering a conventional ""liberal"" message; ""war is hell', ""men should not be inhumane to man',etc.While Kubrick is indeed a liberal humanist who  looks askance at the military, his film is not simply a pacifist sermon.Kubrick is, instead offering  a close analysis of the meaning of courage , loyalty, and honor. These virtues, so often extolled by 'conservatives' are NOT mocked by Kubrick. Instead he is criticizing the MISUSE of these virtues by ""scoundrels' such as the military brass hats.The true hero of paths of glory is NOT the well-meaning but tragically ineffectual liberal 'hero', Colonel Dax (superbly played by Kirk Douglas), instead the hero is a GROUP of people, the ordinary, suffering 'grunts' of the 'poor bloody  infantry', who, in the films unforgettable closing scene, hum along with a frightened German  girl as she sings a love song in her native language."

","It took a while to see the film that put Stanley Kubrick on the map as a force to be reckoned with. Paths of Glory was a war film with an interesting premise and has the reputation for being an ""anti-war"" piece on the dehumanization of soldiers. With Kirk Douglas as the star, the plot centers around prideful and power-hungry French military officers who order an impossible mission from a battalion who fleas upon defeat and is accused of cowardice. <br/><br/>Many other films by Kubrick shows his powerful and masterful filming style and Paths of Glory is no different. The focus is strong and it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen throughout the picture. Good use is made of these phenomenal actors who give heartfelt performances and deliver strong and emotionally piercing lines. <br/><br/>The film is a short and crisp 88 minutes so it's easy to watch anytime. This also makes the pacing clean and the viewer will know every scene, shot, and frame is completely intentional and justified. Not a single moment of this fascinating and well done film is wasted and the talented actors are utilized to their fullest. <br/><br/>Perhaps any downside to this film is the first 20-30 minutes in which the viewer may be wondering what kind of film they're watching and for what purpose. It's easy to see how upon release, however received with high regard, was met with some confusion as to the substance of the story and what it was trying to say. It's not a film that glorifies war or conflict; in fact, the concept of battle (physical or psychological) can cause some irritation for the viewer. This was most likely intended and it was probably a good move in the long run.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed Paths of Glory throughout the picture and found it as important as it is beautifully directed. However, the most impactful piece of the story is the final scene in which a woman is singing to a group of soldiers in a bar. Not many other scenes have had so much emotional impact and beauty that it truly made Paths of Glory a personal favorite. <br/><br/>Really no complaints about the quality of this film or the personal pressure points it wasn't afraid to touch. It's also amazing how those emotions can be pierced so powerfully more than 50 years after this was released. It's a grand milestone in filmmaking that deserves much more attention and is highly recommended to anyone who has the chance to see it. It's simply amazing!"

","PATHS OF GLORY is an anti-war film based on the novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb. This is a shocking film, which is inspired by real events, about the shameful incident on the Western Front in the First World War. We've seen the terrifying battleground in the grip of corruption and cynicism.<br/><br/>Kubrick's style became known after this film. Extremely long shots emphasize the importance of a particular scene, a part of the story or some locations. <br/><br/>Black and white photography goes well with the atmosphere and themes in the film. The dark tones, night scenes and human expression provoke strong feelings of anxiety.<br/><br/>The story begins with the agony that goes into the public injustice and ends with the tragedy. One general, on the suggestion of his superior, sent his division across the no man's land in a suicide assault that is bloodily rejected. Three soldiers must pay with their lives for alleged cowardice. However, their colonel reasonably rebelled.... The story of human intrigue, courage and fear of soldiers is honest, direct and explicit. Scenery, referring to the cold, wet and bloody trenches, is amazingly convincing.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is a passionate idealist. However, he is only one link in the chain of orders. His character is not a rebel. This is a natural reaction to the apparent injustice. Adolphe Menjou as Major General Georges Broulard is the embodiment of a cunning and ruthless war policy. George Macready as Brigadier General Paul Mireau is a kind of a grotesque. A vindictive character, who is a slave of his own ego.<br/><br/>The end of the film is somewhat cathartic. The soldiers revive forgotten feelings in inhumane conditions of war.<br/><br/>The future is pessimistic, but the struggle for humanity is visible. War is hell, and it is part of one's everyday life. Rotten people survived the war. The innocent are dying. Nothing changes.<br/><br/>Mr. Kubrick is a true master."

","""I reject the war and everything in it ... I don't deplore it ... I don't resign myself to it ... I don't weep about it ... I just plain reject it and all its fighting men. I don't want anything to do with them or it. Even if there were nine hundred and ninety-five million of them and I were all alone, they'd still be wrong and I'd be right. Because I'm the one who knows what I want: I don't want to die.""<br/><br/>--- Ferdinand Bardamu, admitting his absolute cowardice in the French literary masterpiece ""Journey to the End of the Night"" by Louis-Ferdinand Celine. ----<br/><br/>There's no possible anticipation of how our so precious ideals, nationalism, patriotism, and whatever abstractions ending with that detestable suffix, will inspire us at the crucial moment, when our chances of staying in one piece for the next minute will be severely compromised. For there is one thing for sure, no person in this world does want to die in the last moment before death, even in the case of suicides. Our conscience, works as a double-edged sword because we –contrarily to the animals- are aware of our mortal condition, and we all fear the unknown, except in the intimate conviction on the after-world's existence. The role displayed by religion in these circumstances is dangerous but crucial. Religion is like the accomplice of a cruel authority that decides to kill you, in the name of love. The general tells you why you should accept to kill, and the priest why you should accept to get killed.<br/><br/>Love your country, love your God, and kill in the name of them, and don't fear being killed. This is the indecent games that politics and religions love to play. In making us believe that we belong to the right side and naturally omitting that the enemy uses the same psychological mechanisms, after all, there is no room for empathy when it comes to wars, all that matters is the sacred and sanctified 'path of glory', a beautiful road paved with the most hellish intentions. These sordid roles are played by two generals in the opening of Stanley Kubrick's movie, one is the master puppeteer, General Commander Broulard and his distinguished subordinate General Mireau, and the puppets submitted to a suicidal mission, have no objection to express, except obeying the orders. This is the war's philosophy, go ahead, run, jump for glory, but don't look back; you own rifles are pointing at you. You belong to the greatest country in the world, and that pride alone is enough to resign yourself and die as a hero.<br/><br/>""Invoking posterity is like making speeches to worms"", said again, the great Louis-Ferdinand Celine. Dying like a hero, being remembered, the glory of this, or that, all these words become senseless when you know that you'll be a rotten corpse soon. This is what war is about. War is organic, you feel it, you smell it, breath it, the nose drown in an ocean of dirty mud, and praying your divine power that it would be quick, while watching the guts of your friend splattering in your uniform or a strident gurgle piercing your ears. During the film, two soldiers discuss which death would be less painful, as each one examines the effect of a bayonet, gas or a gunshot in the body. Speak about torment, fear or anguish, we're scared because whatever we're taught in class, in catechism, in history, we're afraid to leave the Earth, because we're afraid to live our body. We don't care for the other, this is OUR country, but this is MY body, and it makes a whole lot difference in the Army when the individual doesn't count, one death is tragic, one thousand is statistics. In one scene, one of the three soldiers condemned for 'cowardice in the face of the enemy', envies the cockroach that'll still be alive on the day he'll be dead, his unfortunate companion stamps on the insect, to give him 'the edge' not realizing that he just 'killed to make a point', his own condition in microcosm.<br/><br/>So, talk about courage, about heroism, these are such great words, but ultimately, while facing death, even the bravest man can collapse and bawl like a little girl. The moment where the supposedly toughest one begs for mercy, broke my heart as one of the most honest and truest depiction of the mental state of a man about to die  although I'm not in a rush to verify how it really feels. And this is humanity, an attachment to life, not a sadistic pleasure to kill the other in the name of your pride. War is the existential nightmare of humanity, and ""Paths of Glory"" the greatest denunciation of its anti-humanistic nature, after ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". It's hard to imagine that the film was made by a director who wasn't in his thirties. Stanley Kubrick made one of the most virulent pamphlets against the madness of war that sent millions of people to the massacre, selling the prestige of winning the war, of fighting for the country like the body of a beautiful maiden. A strong reason for Colonel Dax, Kirk Douglas as the man who defended the three accused, to be ashamed for human race.<br/><br/>Never had a movie be so just in its depiction of War, and I guess it needed a positive note to bring some light in the darkness. The unforgettable final scene in the bar, where a young German girl sings a famous song, and after the boos, the whistling, the soldiers hum the song in unison, is the highlight of the film, that proved that after all, we may be called cowards, pacifists, idealists, but when you overlook the futile barriers that poison our relationships, you realize that life is so precious it's worth being called a coward"
"lee_eisenberg","10","3","6","2 July 2005"," the insanity of war
","When people think of Stanley Kubrick making an anti-war film, they most likely think of ""Dr. Strangelove"", but ""Paths of Glory"" is equally as great, not to mention based on a true event. It happened in France during WWI. A platoon of soldiers was sent on a suicidal mission. The battle was essentially an excuse for both nations to try and gain prestige. Some French soldiers refused to go into battle. They were put on trial for ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"". In defending them, Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) sought to show how they were doing a sane thing by refusing to go into battle, and that the generals cared more about getting promoted than about the men under their command.<br/><br/>One theme that you find in this movie that Kubrick often uses is chess. Chess is an analysis of medieval Europe, with the pawns being expendable. In this case, the soldiers are senselessly thrown into battle, while the generals sit comfortably in the palace. Similarly, in ""Dr. Strangelove"", the men in the airplane were experiencing all sorts of Hell, while the president, generals and ambassador sat comfortably in the war room.<br/><br/>It's amazing how much this all looks like so many other things. And I don't just mean Iraq. When Gen. Billy Mitchell condemned his superiors for disregarding the safety of the men under their command, they put HIM on trial! Apparently, ""military justice"" is a total oxymoron. Anyway, this is a movie that everyone should see, just so that we can all know what war is really all about."

","""Paths of Glory"" is the film that officially transformed Kubrick from a talented young director to a genius in the eyes of the public. Although I consider ""The Killing"" an already stellar film, I see why this one would get so much love: its anti-war themes are splendidly developed in Kubrick's unforgiving way, giving the viewer every reason to keep his hopes high, but regularly smashing them in his face, showing how the world actually works and not how the classic movies would like to make us believe. The character of Dax (a performance that Kirk Douglas grows into as the movie progresses) seems to be the only reasonable person in a maddened system where human lives matter less than the career of the powerful. The natural instinct of survival (showed by the sentenced soldiers as they approach the end) is labelled as ""cowardice"" and reprimanded by those who are not in danger, of course. But the scene that may have moved me the most is the ending, with the French soldiers first taunting the German girl but then getting emotional as they realize that they share the human nature, and all the mad orders they follow have no meaning at all."
"bkrauser-81-311064","10","2","4","17 April 2016"," An Anti-War Film for the Ages
","The French Army calls it the Anthill. Mere kilometers away from Paris, German WWI forces have dug trenches and fortified the area for a little over a year. Gen. Paul Mireau (Macready) believes taking the Anthill is nearly impossible and says so within the first frames of Paths of Glory. Yet after the insinuation of a promotion by Gen. Broulard (Menjou), Mireau reconsiders, rationalizing and demurring such a feat of improbability for the sake of glory. Enters Kirk Douglas; cleft chin, movie-star good looks, and despite playing Col. Dax, a Frenchman, Douglas carries a signature American swagger. Surprised by the General's tactical decision, Dax nevertheless strives to carry out his orders.<br/><br/>Thus the wheels of Paths of Glory begin to screech and turn. The movie is infamously known not only as a damning anti-war film but as one of Kubrick's first great masterpieces in a career marked by nothing but. As an anti-war film, Paths of Glory is downright incendiary choosing hubris, human frailty and visual metaphor as a means to an end. Generals sit in a comfy château making decisions about the cannon-fodder in the trenches who are shell-shocked due to months of constant skirmishes. Those in the trenches who hold to some semblance of rank, take advantage of it to hide mistakes and keep up appearances. The end result of Mireau's gambit, which according to Dax ""will weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit""? So bitter and damning as to become farcical if it wasn't so unfailingly human.<br/><br/>Even as early as 1957, the late Stanley Kubrick displayed a mastery of his craft with a particular affinity to asymmetrical spacing, alienating long shots and mechanical tracking shots. He keeps his camera at a safe distance, robbing the audience of superfluous or unnecessary human emotions; concentrating instead on the chaotic wartime experience on an almost cosmic scale. Each 35mm frame of Mireau and Douglas coolly inspecting the foxhole huddled with frightened soldiers says more about inhumanity than can be found in the pages of a mediocre novel. The cynicism and pessimism of everything proceeding the battle is enough to make anyone revolt. Is it any wonder the film went unreleased in France for over twenty years?<br/><br/>But while the first tracking shots are an attack on the inhumanity of war, the scenes of the battle for the Anthill are a full frontal attack on the way Hollywood made war movies. While films like Sergeant York (1941) are drenched in patriotism, Paths of Glory's long, unforgiving battle scene dares to be cruel, emotionally complex and absurd. During an ever escalating barrage of artillery, mortar and machine gunfire, soldiers are dispatched with mechanical coldness, superiors shout out in the organized chaos while Col. Dax's story surreptitiously disappears into the ether. Meanwhile the enemy remains unseen.<br/><br/>As early as the forties, Douglas had been attracted by ardent bleeding-heart roles with a penchant for little-man-against-the- system melodrama. In the moments when the film veers into courtroom drama, Douglas oozes carefully controlled personal branding. Many claim that if not for Douglas's involvement, Kubrick would have shown his intellectual colors a lot earlier. Yet there's little doubt that without the interest of Kirk Douglas, Paths of Glory (twice rejected by United Artists) would cease be. While Douglas's star power does on occasion overwhelm the frame and he does chew the scenery with higher-than-thou proselytizing it feels almost like a release. It's almost as if Kubrick brings you to the edge of the abyss while Douglas warmly touches your shoulder and tells you not to jump. He's the bridge and arbiter between the entrenched studio system and the vanguard still percolating in France, raging in Japan and under-appreciated everywhere else.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is a near perfect anti-war film and a high water mark for film in general. While a little stark for some, one can't help but find hope and beauty in the small moments such as when Christine Kubrick (longtime wife of the director) solemnly sings a German folk song to a squad of French troops. Douglas once called Kubrick a ""talented s***,"" yet despite well documented friction, the two tall figures of cinema managed to make something real special here. Something too unique, too beautiful and too scornfully, maddeningly perfect to be ignored."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","4","9 July 2008"," A Masterpiece
","Paths of Glory (1956) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece anti-war drama centers on a Colonel (Kirk Douglas) who led a group of soldiers on a suicide mission but when the troops refuse to leave the trenches, three of them are hand picked to be executed on grounds of cowardice. I think sometimes it's easy to forget the pure genius of Kubrick and to me this was the first of many masterpieces that he'd deliver throughout his career. On a technical level this film is flawless from start to finish and this is certainly one of the greatest movies in its genre. There are so many brilliant scenes here that it's really shocking that such a young and fresh director could come off with something like this. There are many memorable scenes in the film but I suppose to most famous ones are the tracking shots following various men inside the trenches. Kubrick keeps the camera in front of the men and tracks them as they walk and the atmosphere this effect brings to the screen hasn't been matched from any war film that I've seen. This technique really builds a strange and claustrophobic nature that puts you right there in the action and gives you a sense of how tight these quarters are. The actual battle scene is also quite beautiful because it really doesn't center on any one piece of the action going on. Instead the camera just floats as the men try to capture their target and the swooping camera really gives you a bigger feeling of the battle. This scene comes off remarkably well considering the budget Kubrick was working with. The film is incredibly powerful with its messages on war and humans and all of this comes together beautifully in the finale, which is very haunting and touching. I think what made Kubrick a genius of his craft was the fact that he had a lot of guts and it's easy to see this with the ending, which doesn't end in a typical way. The final song was something very tricky to pull off yet Kubrick does so wonderfully well and really hits a home run with the message. Finally, the film contains some of the greatest acting you're going to see in the film with Douglas leading the way as the Col. who then must turn defender to try and keep the three men alive. The restraint nature Douglas shows perfectly fits the character but when his rage finally explodes, there's really no one better at doing this type of acting. George Macredy really steals the film as the General who wants the men executed and really becomes one of the most hated villains in film history."

I just caught it again on Turner Classic Movies, so I thought I'd check out IMDb and see what I didn't know about it.<br/><br/>Well, I didn't know that so many folks would choose to see the French generals as representative of shortcomings in the competence and character of all military leaders, rather than examples of poor leadership in general. Certainly those who work in corporate environments or read a newspaper regularly can attest to the presence of bad, greedy, or selfish leaders in all walks of life. If anything, the example of both Colonel Dax and the steady senior sergeant should serve as evidence that good leaders co-exist with bad ones. Their presence offers us hope that honor and competence may occasionally be recognized and given the authority to make intelligent decisions.<br/><br/>Sorry to have strayed so far from the movie. It is probably one of the black and white films that I am most willing to sit through. The cinematography and the acting are both amazing. The battle scene proves that Steven Spielberg's work in the opening scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" certainly had a precedent.<br/><br/>As to the final scene of Paths of Glory. I've read a lot of comments here misunderstanding that as well. I suppose that is easy to do, if you don't understand soldiers. These men are asked to exist like animals for months on end, in the dirt, in daily fear for their survival. They are reduced to ""kill or be killed"" and even their enemy is dehumanized in order to make his death less of a moral dilemma. So, of course, when presented with such a beautiful woman, their first reaction is animalistic. Here's the subject of so many dirty jokes and late-night fantasies come before them in the flesh. But then, her singing reconnects these men to their own humanity. They are ashamed of their former actions and of the level to which they have descended. And they are reminded of their mothers, wives, daughters and the homes that they left behind. Their tears stem from shame and homesickness. Colonel Dax exhibits compassion when he instructs the sergeant to allow the men a few minutes more of human experience before causing them to return to the mud, blood and misery of their existence in the trenches."

","It's easy to snare an audience by making a movie about an execution, which is why such movies seem so common -- ""Ted Bundy,"" ""I Want to Live"", ""The Book of Daniel."" Sometimes the whole story is about the technical aspects of the execution -- ""The Execution of Private Slovick."" It may be easier for an audience to identify with someone about to be executed than it is to identify with someone in a particularized conflict. Should Marlon Brando squeal on his friends and employers in ""On the Waterfront""? Well, yes, but none of us have ever been in Terry Malloy's shoes nor will we ever be, whereas we are all going to face execution some day. In a sense, the audience is gripped and watches with fascinated horror because it's their own deaths taking place on screen.<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"" centers around the execution by firing squad of three French soldiers during World War I for cowardice in the face of the enemy. They are picked at random from three companies, on the order of a general (George MacReady) and defended in court by their regimental commander Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas). MacReady blames them, instead of himself, for a failed attack against an impossible German position and wants to set an example for the rest of the French army. ""If those sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face FRENCH ones."" And anyway, killing a few of the troops now and again is a boost to their morale.<br/><br/>Kubrick takes full advantage of the dramatic elements adumbrating the three deaths. One soldier is simple-minded and desperate, and he turns to religion, blubbering with fear. One is bitter and combative and gets his skull fractured, so he must be propped up unconscious on a stretcher to be shot. The third is frightened but faces his death with dignity.<br/><br/>That's about as far as the conventional elements go in this superb movie. Facile clichés are avoided. Here's an example of what I mean. One of the prisoners (Ralph Meeker) has been chosen to die by his company commander (Wayne Morris) because Meeker has seen Morris behave like a drunken, murdering coward on a night patrol. Douglas suspects this, and chooses Morris to head the firing squad. Morris, deeply humiliated and remorseful, offers Meeker a blindfold. Meeker says nothing, just snorts in the negative. Morris mumbles that he's sorry, then leaves. A less original treatment of this incident would have Meeker delivering a speech to the cowardly Morris. ""I may die now but you'll be dying every day for the rest of your life."" (Hey, that's pretty good!) Or maybe, ""Forget it, Lieutenant. You'll be joining me soon enough."" Something like that, anyway. Instead, Meeker neither absolves him nor heaps calumny upon him. Meeker has something more important on his mind than dealing with this quivering moron and his guilt.<br/><br/>Well, one more example of what I mean by the avoidance of clichés. The court martial adjourns to consider a verdict. Fade to black. Open with the prisoners being marched to the execution posts. No scene in which everyone sits around biting his fingernails and waiting to hear the verdict. Nobody announces the prisoners have been found guilty and nobody sentences them to death. We don't see MacReady smiling villainously or Douglas looking stunned.<br/><br/>I don't want to run out of space so I'll limit this comment to a round of applause for the final scene of anguished French troops getting drunk in a bar, whistling, clapping, pounding on the tables, as a winsome young German girl is brought out by the inn keeper and ordered to sing a song. She begins to sing a German folk song timidly and softly. The soldiers gradually cease their rowdy behavior and listen to her plaintive untrained voice. Except for the pretty girl singing on the stage the bar room becomes utterly still and silent, and then one by one the men begin to hum the little tune along with her. They are all sad and some of them weep. The catharsis is absolutely necessary in a film so filled with tension, anger, and blood.<br/><br/>This is Kubrick's most emotional film and shouldn't be missed. His earlier films were good but derivative and his later films devoid of passion. This one hits all the right notes, and the performances are unimpeachable."
"fabiogaucho","Null","2","4","3 August 2004"," What is it about anyway
","I just rented it and was completely astonished. I had seen everything Kubrick did after this movie and never imagined it could top all the others so distinguishedly. It has ten times the human content any other of his movies has.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Another reader said what comes through most is the absence of hope. I think he kind of felt the same I felt, but I think it is more precise to talk of inevitability. Every little part of the plot makes you think of it: you just try to figure out HOW the poor men can be saved - and the fact is that they have a lot going on for them, such as the great lawyer, and the general's embarrassment - but somehow they don't even get close. They must die. Why? Because the assault was a failure? Why was it a failure? Because it was impossible to succeed anyway. Then why was it attempted? Because the target was there, and the army must go for the targets. What if they had advanced? They would die from German bullets. Deserted? Fire squad too. Not enlisted? They were probably drafted. Could at least that war never have happened? You get a feeling that, no, it was also inevitable, as long as there are countries. And the movie does not suggest that countries are things that can disappear. As long as human beings exist, and as long as there is society, the three soldiers must be executed.<br/><br/>In the film, there are people in power, making decisions, you despise them, but you don't really feel that those generals killed the 3 men. The feeling you get is that the country killed them. During the trial there is an opposition between membership in the human race and membership in the army - if you look at them as soldiers, they must die; if as humans, they must live. The audience takes the second position, the court, being military, takes the first. That means that the film is about the most fundamental truth about human condition - the inevitability of death. <br/><br/>That truth is so simple and fundamental that it may be too obvious, and therefore superficial. But the film focus on something more specific - the fact that the inevitability of death, being universal, puts us in the same condition. On one hand, it makes us all brothers, and human brotherhood is portrayed beautifully in the last scene. France is in war w/ Germany, but you don't see any German in the film except from the beautiful and frail girl in the end singing words they do not understand but with feelings every soldier there knows - the beauty and fragility of life. It is no coincidence that the melody is so incredibly simple. That fellowship is not unknown to the judges, and Kirk Douglas appeals to it. But they just have to overlook it. <br/><br/>On the other, there is the fact that each of us dies his or her on death, and each of us do not want to die. Somehow the film says that such condition throws us against each other, because we want others to die before us (in the case of the general, he has so much to lose that losing his post is the great men's equivalent to death for the simple - in this film, officers don't get killed, period), and therefore we will never be truly brotherlike to the other - hence, perhaps, the inevitability of the war you feel in the film. In one sense, ""Paths of Glory"" is not anti-war because it definitely does not imply that war is something evitable. The movie reminds us that war is an inhumane situation, but does not suggest we can abolish it. In another sense, it IS anti-war in the sense that there is NO reason for us not to lament war. There is no reason for us to find anything glorious or dignifying in war. Nothing, nothing in war is great - the title is definitely ironic. <br/><br/>Conclusion: despite all Kubrick's technical marvel of his later movies, nothing in his other works comes as deep as ""paths of glory""."

","Paths Of Glory is Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti war film that was in stark contrast to many of the more hawkish war movies that came out during that time. Also, this is one of the few films to be made that take place during WW1. This shows the grim reality of life in the trenches. This also shows how during war how sometimes ridiculous, suicidal orders come from high command and how some high ranking military brass value their own career advancement and image over what would seem to be in the best interest in their troops. Paths Of Glory shows how cheap life is, especially in a time of war and the futility of it all. Kirk Douglas is great as Col.Dax and is the moral center of the film and one Hell of a tough soldier. The themes of the film are still relavent in the modern world, especially in the military. Kubrick's film is timeless in the sense that this still holds up today and is a tremendous achievement and a really fantastic film."

One soldier was also the opponent of the last investigation of the battalion commander, the other was drawn from the cards, and One was assigned by the battalion commander because of a bad relationship with his comrades. Colonel Dax personally defended his soldiers. After the military court trial, Dax found that the judge and prosecutor did not care about the evidence at all, but only tried the three scapegoats.

","""The path of glory"" is a film that makes the fear of facing death real. There is a scene about cockroaches. Paris sees the cockroach crawling across the table and says, ""tomorrow it will be closer to my wife and children than I am to them. Tomorrow it will be alive and I will be dead."" Here's ferol slapping the dead cockroach and saying, ""now you're better than him."" The three soldiers who were about to be executed were superior to the cockroach only because they had more ""power"" than the cockroach and could decide whether it lived or died. In other words, they are now only slightly superior to cockroaches in power and status, and in the army, their lives are forever controlled by others. So presumably they are no different from cockroaches in the face of death."

","The real cruelty of war is not only the destruction of human nature, but also the decision by a few people to bury the innocent, but also to cover up the error of the more buried survivors. Under the banner of patriotism lurks greed, fear, arrogance, and callousness. It is not the enemy's fire that kills, but the baseness of friendly fire. There have been times when I have been ashamed to be a member of the human race, and this will be the time.
The general said he would not let a soldier die for his honour; Don't hesitate to ask for 100 scapegoats when you need someone to take the blame; After the execution, he proudly tells DAX that his men died too well. When he was responsible for shelling his position, he was quickly brought to trial by his superiors. Then he said, I am the only innocent person in this case.

","Early masterpiece by genius Stanley Kubrick. With extremely inteligent dialogs, it is one of his great anti-war movies, probably the best of them. Cinematography, acting, script, everything is perfect. Kubrick and Kirk Douglas's partnership gave us to of the best movies ever made, Spartacus and Paths of Glory, and both were able to discuss political issues deeply and seriously while accomplishing amazing artistic achevements with historical events as background. When France and Germany fought each other in WWI, the film is clear about who was the bad side: those who gave orders, all the others are victims. It ia not only one of the best war movies ever but also one of the best court films. The movie was already remarkable until the latest scene, which changed its status from excellent to absolutely brilliant.

","One of Kubrick's early features, this seems to have established him as a great young director. It is more than just an anti-war war story; unlike any other war flick I can think of it shows that soldiers faced peril not only from the enemy but from their officers as well, and portrays the whole business of war as corrupt. In this, an egomaniac general, dreaming of becoming a national hero, sends his troops on a hopeless attack. When they are pinned down and forced to turn back, he blames them and several soldiers are chosen to be executed for cowardice. Kirk Douglas is excellent as the one of the few good guys in the bunch, who fights to save the lives of his men. There is a touching coda at the end with a bunch of soldiers listening wistfully to the singing of a terrified German girl (the only woman in the film) who has been forced to perform for them. Great performances from Menjou and Macready, and some awesome tracking shots across battlefields."

","This is Stanley Kubrick's first great film, and it has the kind of emotional punch that many find sorely missing from his overall oeuvre. Dealing with themes that Kubrick would explore for the rest of his career, Paths of Glory is one of the great anti-war movies.<br/><br/>It seems like there's an unwritten rule that if you want to make a movie about war as a necessary and even noble thing you make it about World War II, and if you want to make a movie about how war is a waste of life without any redeeming value you make a movie about World War I. Hell, even The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles had an episode about the awfulness of war set in the trenches. And the setting is a perfect place for a testament to war's complete wastefulness. It was a conflict marked by trench warfare, exchanging thousands of lives in pitched but completely meaningless battles that decided nothing while completely destroying the verdant countryside of France and Germany.<br/><br/>In an undefined sector of the front, General Broulard visits his subordinate General Mireau and tells him that Mireau must attack the fortified German position the Anthill in two days. Mireau scoffs at the idea, noting the recent action his sector had just been involved in and the strength of the German position. Broulard, though, dangles a promotion out in front of him and Mireau immediately changes tune. Yes, attacking and holding the Anthill is not only possible, it's obviously something that his 7,000 men can accomplish.<br/><br/>The attack goes out under the direct command of Colonel Dax who does his best to make the insane orders he's received work. In the middle of the attack, he even retreats to the trenches to try and coax the right flank to emerge from the trenches, which they have failed to do up to that point, right as the attack falls apart completely. At the height of his frustration Mireau even orders his artillery commander to attack the French right flank but the artillery commander won't do it without a written order from Mireau, which he never receives.<br/><br/>In the face of such a complete farce of a defeat, Mireau wants blood from his own men. Broulard, understanding and conciliatory, talks Mireau down from 100 men to face the firing squad to three. Dax is horrified at the news and becomes the three men's counsel at their court martial. He gives a vigorous defense, but it's obvious that the fix is in and there's nothing he can do to prevent the executions. In a last gasp effort, Dax learns of Mireau's order to attack the French troops hiding in the trenches and tries to use that knowledge to convince Broulard to drop the whole matter. It doesn't work, the executions go forward, but Mireau is put up at a board of inquiry and Broulard offers Dax Mireau's command. Dax is horrified at the prospect and tells Broulard off. He wasn't trying to defend the men and undermine Mireau for his career. He was trying to save three men he considered innocent victims of a military bureaucracy that had become blind to his mission and responsibility to the men it served.<br/><br/>This move is just fantastic. Dax is a great protagonist, played commandingly by Kirk Douglas. He's smart, understanding, and willing to stick a knife in when he needs to. Mireau is the perfect kind of antagonist with a purely bureaucratic mindset looking no further than the advancement of his own career. The three men are strong, and Lieutenant Roget, who volunteered one of the three and whom Dax orders to carry out the executions, is a marvelously realized weasel of a man.<br/><br/>The movie looks amazing as well. Filmed in black and white, the trenches feel wonderfully grungy and filthy which contrast beautifully with the gorgeous German mansion that operates at the French military command's headquarters. The juxtaposition between the men at the front and their commanders is so stark that it cannot be missed. The failed attack on the Anthill (a name I love as it implies the target's immense unimportance in the grand scheme of life and the war) is gorgeously filmed. Largely made of steady tracking shots that follow the advance along with the troops, no man's land is all filth, mud, craters, and barbed wire. It feels like we're in the advance with them and only breaks when Dax himself stops advancing.<br/><br/>The film is so rich and yet only 88-minutes long. The final scene where the young German girl sings to the French soldiers, quieting their rowdiness with her tearful old song, shows the friends and fellow soldiers to the three sacrificed men in their most disarmed and innocent states. It's a temporary reprieve for them before they are sent back to the meat grinder where they will once again become subject to the whims of the French military command. It's perhaps their final moment of humanity.<br/><br/>One final note: I love how no one speaks with an affected French accent in this film. Everyone speaks plainly with their American (or, in one case, British) accents. I'm not one to nitpick about bad accents, but I think this approach is the most correct to take. If we're going to follow French soldiers speaking English, then they should sound like English speakers not French speakers speaking English. I've imagined a movie where the main characters are French played by Americans who then encounter American characters who speak French. I've found the idea amusing, at least."
"kurosawakira","9","0","0","17 February 2013"," The Absurdity of Life and Art
","I'm in the middle of revisiting most of Kubrick's work, and watching this after ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) is a wonderful experience. Accidentally, I had also seen Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" (1954) just some days earlier, and that experience too gave a great deal of perspective and enhanced my enjoyment. All the sweeter since I saw this last some 10 years ago and wasn't as overwhelmed then.<br/><br/>But now its strengths have really grown on me. There's the amazing, acute sense of movement in the camera, be it in the trenches or the encircling dancing in the interior shots of the Department. The claustrophobic sense of place, and the contrapuntal open, wide hallways and high ceilings of the courtroom. This is Kubrick at his best. And the sounds! Of explosions, machine-gun fire, breathing, the loud echoes of the cross-examination, the intimate singing of the German girl in the pub, revealed behind the wall of sound of obstinate cheering and drunken blabber. These counterpoints of both space (small, wide) and sound (loud, silent) define the film for me.<br/><br/>Watching ""On the Waterfront"" just before this was an interesting point of comparison. Brando and Kaufman's cinematography where the highlights of that film, but I couldn't really connect with the central social struggle at all, the bestiality of man toward man, man corrupted by power and prestige. Not so here – and here Kubrick's delicate sense of satire comes into play. Whilst a serious film, it doesn't take itself too seriously, which is exactly why it's able to connect with us the way it does. The absurdity of life and art, and of art trying to depict life (and art). How man is reduced to a mere number, a prop in a film. I found this very effective."

","A passion project of Douglas's, in which he was willing to knowingly make a film less box-office friendly in order to preserve its theme and integrity, this examination of power and the abuse of it is a stellar piece of film-making. He plays a colonel in the French army during WWI, situated in a standoff along trenches against German-held territory. When general Macready realizes he can receive a promotion by turning the tide of the standoff and taking a locale known as The Ant Hill, he sends Douglas and his men into almost certain death in order to make it happen. However, the military effort is an abysmal failure and, in order to make an example of them, he has three men selected to stand trial for cowardice. What follows is a kangaroo court martial in which the prior deeds of the men are ignored and the situation is twisted in order to ensure that the trio will be found guilty. Douglas struggles against the odds to find a way to save them, even daring to tangle with smooth, but dangerous, general Menjou. Douglas turns in one of his all-time greatest performances, only getting close to the edge of over-acting one time as he confronts Menjou. He's charismatic, idealistic, realistic and compassionate, among other traits. Macready enjoys possibly his finest hour as well as the hardened, heartless, driven instigator of the entire mess. Menjou is perfectly slimy; all smiles even as he's turning the screws on people. The three targeted men give uniquely compelling performances. Meeker, often an underrated actor, wrestles with the thoughts of never seeing his wife and child again. Turkel reacts violently to the situation, ending up severely injured. Carey, always a fascinating presence, starts to crack up emotionally, becoming almost surreally affected. Other key cast members include Morris as a lieutenant who actually is cowardly (and alcoholic) and yet isn't made to suffer for it (this weak, wormy character was portrayed by a man, Morris, who was in real life an actual war hero!), Anderson, as a smugly sycophantic prosecutor and Meyer as the pragmatic, resident chaplain. If there is one teensy ""flaw,"" it is that these men rarely, if ever, seem French, many of them retaining noticeable New York accents, but it's carping to even mention that in the face of such exemplary cinema. The movie, filmed in stark black and white, has the distinction of being simultaneous ugly and beautiful. One admires the stunning camera-work, even in the muddy, deadly battleground and can awe at the startlingly beautiful makeshift courtroom as injustice reigns over the proceedings. It's a sort of visual uneasiness that permeates the bulk of the film and only adds to how special it is. Despite the feeling of dread that lingers in many frames, there is also a tiny bit of ironic dark humor that seeps in from time to time. In short, director Kubrick has excelled here at manipulating the audience in every way from visually to audibly to emotionally. At a crisp 87 minutes, it never overstays its welcome. If only modern filmmakers could recognize that bigger and longer doesn't always equal better. The callous power plays depicted here could apply to virtually any place, not necessarily the French Army. Boardrooms, playgrounds, fraternities, Elk clubs It's the examination of the personalities and machinations that is key here rather than the setting. It's a must-see film that packs a wallop and which has not been given its full due even now."

There is no question that this thinking is why we go to war instead of using all other alternatives to the very last degree in order to avoid it. Also, if the old men who declare wars and send young men into battle to die also had to fight those wars on the front lines, there wouldn't be another war, ever.<br/><br/>In POG, the hideous part where the sick and dying soldier was shown being executed instead of being allowed to die a soon-forthcoming natural death was the best example of the cast-in-concrete military mind I have ever seen. And, so true, as I was in the Army and saw things such as this firsthand.<br/><br/>If you like this film, also see The Young Lions for a similar message and a great Marlon Brando performance."

","This is a great movie. The story is compelling, the acting powerful, the theme sublime. This movie is about how the individual person can be reduced to the level of a mere statistic, a mere dot on somebody's organizational plan, a mere object to be sacrificed and never be missed by those in charge, who have their own personal agendas and will do ANYTHING to avoid taking responsibility when things go wrong. A military operation fails, and the general in charge is angry and he will not be the one stuck with the blame. As far as this general is concerned, the soldiers are a bunch of lazy, cowardly slackers who don't want to fight - even though the soldiers are dying by the thousands. But that is of no concern to the general who wants to blame someone for the failed operation because if the general takes responsibility he will be revealed for what he is: an egocentric, incompetent martinet who is interested in only one thing - furthering his career at the expense of the soldiers under his command. To pursue that selfish goal, this general will throw away the lives of the soldiers entrusted to him. This movie stars Kirk Douglas. But the real star of this movie is Adolph Menjou who plays the French general. On July 1, 1916, the British lost over 57,000 men killed or wounded while the Germans lost 8,000, with no appreciable gains, tactically or strategically. What an extravagant squandering of human life. But the generals in charge, who did the squandering, lived to fight another day."

","In the military there are those, Corporals in this case, who falsely want Medals of Honor, and there are those falsely want to give them the medals of honor, higher generals in this case. Both of these things come crashing into each other like a train in this film. This is hailed as the only anti-war war movie ever made. That is quite an accomplishment. And who else but Stanley Kubrick could have thought to do such a project and not give it any kind of structure?<br/><br/>First, you see a meeting between the two men in question. One says they must do a doomed mission and there is another star medal in it for him if he behind his desk has a general go through with it. He, the corporal, at first says no until the higher up says that he'll just get someone else do it and ouch, without a medal if ""deserves"". So, he agrees to go through with the doomed mission and thats when Kirk Douglas as the general has no choice but to go through with it...or get discharged from his men and have someone else that is 100% unqualified. Unqualified, you ask? Well, Kirk's character understands that you have to know your men to lead them and so some stranger can't just come in and try to lead men to their doom. He has honor that the corporal is just shy of and wants to appear to have. The corporal tries to tell him of Patriotism and that's when Kirk fires back with a quotation from Samuel Johnson: ""Patriotism is the refuge of a scoundrel"". double ouch. <br/><br/>Of course, the mission is a failure and to cover his own back, the general that assigned the mission backs out of responsibility and gives it to the deluded corporal because after all, in military law, it's 90% true if you are higher up. So, its always the higher ups word against the lower. So, some men are executed even though Kirk's character was a polished criminal lawyer in the name of killing men every now and then sets good examples to the other soldiers. But what? It was an impossible mission and now they have to be killed in the name of setting examples? Hey, its their word. Who's going to believe who. <br/><br/>Then comes to the ending of this movie that you sense is an an ending but just can't believe it. It cuts to Kirk's character hearing some men sing along with a German women who is crying and forced to sing. To him on the outside it sounds like all is fun and innocent on the inside. But the girl is crying and even guys are crying singing along. This is not a happy ending."

","Kubrick's amalgam of riveting dialog, exquisite black and white photography and peerless acting brings life to Cobb's novel indicting the exploitation of the powerless by the powerful against the backdrop of World War I. By the nature of their work, generals use common soldiers like pawns but in this story the generals employ them with arrogance and disdain. Soldiers pay for their generals' mistakes with their life and limb not only on the battlefield but in the courtroom to save reputations. This is much more than just an anti-war film. The generals could be CEOs. Its about the corruptive influence of ego and power.<br/><br/>Kubrick moves seamlessly from the stark battlefield of the soldier to the the château of the generals. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, the only character to inhabits both worlds has his humanity dismissed as sentimentality by the elitist general. Though enraged by the arrogance of his superiors, the resignation of his soldiers is what scars him. They too if given the choice would prefer to be victimizers rather than victims.<br/><br/>The end scene where a throng of french infantrymen in a beer-hall bully a young German girl into singing, only to fall captive to her simple song is one of the most disarming scenes in movie history."

So three soldiers are chosen from their platoon to be sentenced to death for cowardice as they have supposedly disgraced the French flag.<br/><br/>This is one outstanding anti-war film by Stanley Kubrick, definitely one of his best films if not his best, well maybe behind 'A Clockwork Orange' ;). The performances from Kirk Douglas as the compassionately loyal Col. Dax who is furious about the decision and tries his best to defend his men, Adolphe Menjou as the crazed Gen. George Broulard who has no desire but to see his men punished, Ralph Meeker as the courageous Cpl. Philip Paris one of the three man who is on trail and George Macready as the unsympathetic Gen. Paul Mireau are simply brilliant and downright absorbing in their roles.<br/><br/>The story itself extremely packs a bite and captures the intensity of the in-humane situation; because of one failure the soldiers pay the consequences, with their earlier good deeds going unnoticed. By this, it showed us the bitter crookedness and incompetence that is found in the military hierarchy, not portraying the heroics- but the nastier side of war, though in our eyes the soldiers are definitely courageous not matter what the superiors think and what fate they shall receive and Kubrick portrays it greatly.<br/><br/>In the plot the soldier's fates seem to play more second fiddle to the confrontation between the military's superiors of this judgement, while the downbeat ending is truly powerful and captures the true spirit of war. The film is beautifully shot and the score is overwhelming to a great extend. The look of the film (trenches and castles) is vividly rich in detail and as well quite horrifying in capturing the mood of war and the unpleasantness that the soldiers face from their superiors and not just their enemies.<br/><br/>What you get from Kubrick is a compelling and touching piece of film art.

","Stanley Kubrick's 1957 masterpiece is a movie that looks fresh and sharper than most of today's movies. The story follows the french army during the days of the first world war. General George Boulard (Adolphe Menjou) has an impossible mission for his subordinate Gen. Paul Mireau (a vicious George Macready) who knows the high risk of such mission but takes it because he was promised to get another star after accomplishing the mission. The mission is to take on the ""Ant Hill"", a territory that for some reason is valuable to the high ranks. Kirk Douglas plays the part of The field commander Col. Dax, a man who unlike his fellow officers, has a decency towards his soldiers but can't save them from the cruelty lack of justice of the military system which is built only to protect the commanding officers. There are some cynical and sharp dialogs (something that's often missing from todays movies) delivered perfectly by all actors. Kirk Douglas is in top form here and brings a memorable performance. There isn't any dull or wasted moments here, every scene is significant and will keep you glued to your seat. Overall it's a fascinating classic that is well worth watching.

","I don't mean to beat up on BusterLA regarding the previous critical post ( Not what it used to be)--but I have to disagree with the assertion that ""Paths Of Glory"" is a dated and too simplistic film. The whole question about how movies hold up over time seems to always be a ripe subject for discussion (and I think misunderstandings). ""Paths Of Glory"" was released in 1957 and I suppose was slightly ahead of its time--Of course within the next 15 years movies like Catch-22 and M*A*S*H would bring their own anti-war messages -""Paths of Glory"" was banned in France until 1975--otherwise I don't think it upset or offended many others at the time. It's a bit more candid than ""All Quiet on the Wesern Front"" --however that movie was released back in 1930 (do the math). ""Paths Of Glory"" holds up well not because the theme or particulars are that new or outrageous---but only because it is so well and clearly told (thank you Mr. Kubrick). Please don't confuse clarity for a failure of imagination or creativity.<br/><br/>It's a given in this movie that the officers (except for Dax) represent the dark and cynical side -however- they are not morally bankrupt without explanation--they have a logical agenda of tradition and self interest based on the real (and sometimes mistaken) necessities of war. That everything accrues to their personal ambitions is nothing less than a reflection of ""the way it was"".<br/><br/>The condemned soldiers are also not just cardboard cutouts given victim status. One soldier is a ""social misfit""---one other assaults a priest the night before the execution and another one struggles to maintain his courage and falters more than once.<br/><br/>I am not a big Kirk Douglas fan--however I think he does a fine job here--perhaps a little bit too forcefully heroic--however you will note that there is no attempt to separate him out -- He is- in the end-- just another cog in the machinery of the war---His defiance to the system has real limits.<br/><br/>Finally, I guess I will have to defend the final scene of the movie where French soldiers choose not to humiliate a young German woman. I note that some critics think this scene is jarringly out of place or pointless--however I think it is very effective and speaks well to the subject at hand. Look into the soldiers eyes in that last scene --you can see then that they see themselves in that young girl -they understand her situation only too well. The last scene is put there I think to show that humanity is not automatically and by default cruel and ruthless and corrupt all of the time. The soldiers in the final scene choose to exercise mercy-when given the chance -even against the backdrop of a time and place where the execution of three innocent men is really only incidental trivia in the face of hundreds of others dying in the trenches daily."

","War has been a recurring theme in Kubrick's films. They were intertwined in the plot of Doctor Strangelove and was the focus in his 1987 feature, Full Metal Jacket. Here however, war is more based inside the court system as three soldiers are tried for cowardice after retreating on an impossible assault on the fronts of World War I. Kirk Douglas plays their Colonel, who's trying his best to win the case. Only about the first twenty or so minutes of this film show actual combat, it's mostly focused on the trial. Suprisingly, this film runs at one and a half hours, but it still includes everything it needs too. The script, drives the message through hard along with very suspensful lines and mood. The direction by Stanley Kubrick stays focused throughout, always delivering to the full impact. The photography during the battle sequence isn't exceptional, but it works. The set designs are noteworthy, as they show the very detailed trenches of World War I. The performances, most noteably by the lead actor, are amazing. They really drive this film all the way, always giving the viewer a sense of mood. This also happens to be one of the most emotional experiences in film I have ever seen. I never cry, and I didn't cry in this either, but this film is very emotional. Several details really get sink into the brain and stick with you. The overall message of the film doesn't seem to really be all about World War I, but about the bleakness of the human soul and how war makes a big rift in that soul and removes compassion and rationalization. This film doesn't back away and give in to be happy, it's gritty and it's harsh. It's very suspensful, well- crafted, and well made. A bit short, sometimes a bit too repeating, but it's a brilliant film. Stanley Kubrick is truly the visionary of Cinema. 9.5/10"

","""Paths of Glory"" is definitely a forgotten classic. The plot is fairly simple; a French General wants his troops (under lawyer-turned-soldier Colonel Dax, played brilliantly by Kirk Douglas) to take a German position, and when the attack fails he has three of the soldiers court-martialled for cowardice in order to set an example.<br/><br/>Apart from the excellent story, which I'm sure is well documented by the other summaries, I think the cinematography of this film is particularly astounding. There are some particular examples which I will mention:<br/><br/>After the scene in which General Broulard and General Mireau are discussing the planned attack on the Anthill, there is a shot of the German fortress; the camera then pans backwards to reveal that it is a view through an observation slat in the French trenches. The shot is accompanied by deep martial drum beats, and perfectly characterizes the changeover from the cozy office scene to that of the war-torn trenches.<br/><br/>Right before the attack, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) walks speedily through the trench. As he walks, the view switches back and forth from his view of the trench to a shot of Kirk's face as he walks. The ruthless lack of emotion on Kirk's face and the nervousness of the soldiers creates an all too realistic atmosphere of anxiety before the coming battle.<br/><br/>The battle scene itself is excellent. Older war movies are always disappointingly antiseptic and unrealistic. But though the charge in ""Paths of Glory"" is relatively bloodless compared to the invasion scene in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the motion of the soldiers over the cratered landscape of No Man's Land makes the scene seem more realistic than most of the same time period.<br/><br/>There is one final moment of excellence, which of course I would urge you not to read if you have not seen the movie in its entirety:<br/><br/>
*warning* SPOILER *warning*<br/><br/>
In the scene when the prisoners are being marched out into the courtyard in front of the assembly of military and civilian spectators, they walk past Kirk Douglas.

The film thusfar has portrayed the politics of the army, but at the end the politics are left hanging.<br/><br/>This isn't the only film where Kubrick does this. 2001 especially relies on the unresolved conclusion, and so does Dr. Strangelove. In all three of these films, this manner of concluding allows the underlying themes of the film to transcend the specific characters.

Dax is determined to defend his brave men.<br/><br/>Critique: Along with the legendary 'All Quiet on the Western Front' this is considered the most ardent and condemning of anti-war films. Both take place in the mud-laden maze of trench warfare and deal with themes of ineptitude and ignorance from military leaders. Whereas 'Western Front' deals more with the subject of lost youth, 'Paths' delves deeper into the political aspects & moral issues associated with tactics and military thinking. <br/><br/>Director Stanley Kubrick loved showing us how Topsy-turvy authoritarian figures can be, especially at wartime. He would take the subject into the absurd with 'Dr. Strangelove' and completely destroy social fabric and push violence in the cinema with 'A Clockwork Orange'. <br/><br/>Every Hollywood house initially turned down 'Paths' until Kirk Douglas lent his considerable talents and influence and stepped in as not only the main protagonist but as co-producer.

","Though using the milieu and tumult of war for its setting this is really a morality play more than an anti-war movie. Frankly the term ""anti-war"" has become trite, I guess it's defined as a film that shows war as less than glorious, and that's really not a hard thing to do.  This is a great film, but the one dimensional characters are create a manipulative emotional trail (personally I don't mind being manipulated and feeling passionate in films). And I think criticism that Kubrick took the easy way out here in regards to characterization may be justified.

Though it has been estimated that more than half of Dax's men will be killed, the 701st should be able to take and hold the Anthill until reinforcements arrive. <br/><br/>A day later, the attack begins. After a light bombardment, the first wave charges toward the Hill. However it is found to be merely a suicide charge. Many of the troops are either killed or wounded. The bombardment is so intense that some of the soldiers never even leave the trenches. General Mireau (Who was observing the battle from afar) deems the men cowards and orders a court martial with a sentence of death if the men are convicted.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is a bold and powerful statement against the self-serving officers of all armies. General Mireau did not capture the Anthill. So, although the attack was impossible, he court-martialed and had killed some of the ""cowards"" who made him look ""ridiculous"". These Generals, although they must be geniuses to have risen to such high rank, also have no clue what some of these soldiers go through. They live and work and dine and drink in their spacious, nice, clean mansions while the soldiers who do the fighting and win the wars live in cramped, ugly, dirty trenches under the constant fear of death and disease. In one scene, as General Mireau inspects the trenches, he comes across a shell-shocked soldier. In a scene reminiscent of Patton, he hits the soldier who he then claims is a Baby. Maybe if he had been in the first wave of the attack on the anthill, he might have respected the men rather than court-marital them.<br/><br/>
I will not talk much about the court martial, for there is not much to talk about. It is also more of a kangaroo court; The outcome has already been pre-determined and the defense is futile. The three men court-martialed are Private Paris (Ralph Meeker), selected because his unit commander has a personal grudge against him (The film shows why), Private Ferol (Timothy Carey), chosen because his commander finds him to be physically unattractive and Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), elected to be court-martialed just because he drew a slip of paper marked with an X. <br/><br/>Paths of Glory has often been renowned as one of Stanley Kubrick's best films. However, despite wide critical acclaim, it was not a commercial success and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences denied it even a single Oscar nomination.

The film is a heartbreaking account of the hypocrisies that exist in any war, and the fact that the American actors are playing French soldiers really doesn't matter (Kubrick did not allow his actors to sport fake French accents, and thank God for that). Kirk Douglas gives one of his great performances in a rare (for Kubrick) sympathetic hero role.  As the three doomed soldiers, Timothy Carey (who played a hateful criminal in ""The Killing"") and Joseph Turkel (who would later show up in The Shining as Lloyd the bartender) are especially memorable, each displaying a different set of emotions (sorrow or anger) when they realize their hopeless fates.

Stanley Kubrick did nicely in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" but here he gets right to the point.  Isn't war even more terrible if the enemy is your own officers? Up and up... And war is horrible, period.  The evil of the generals who ordered a meaningless suicide charge and their horrible manipulations stands for itself, but most meaningful to me is the overall administrative smugness projected, a personification of all those involved in running a war, any war, who are not themselves doing the fighting.  The setting of a court martial hearing with Dax (Kirk Douglas--boy, has anybody ever been better?) defending the three soldiers serves well to dramatize the issues, the basic antiwar theme, which climaxes with the final scene, the apotheosis of the horror and absurdity of war, ranking with Rosebud among the all-time greats."

","A Kubrick masterpiece and top notch anti-war film as good as All Quiet on the Western Front. This film looks to leadership as a Great White Shark looks to a seal. Military greed abounds as high ranking WW1 French officers play games with the lives and deaths of others whom they deem as just so much useless scum.

"Alexandr Vesnin","Null","0","0","5 November 2001"," The anthill, the ants and Kubrick's genius.
","So terse and unrelenting, it reminds war short stories by the great Ambrose Bierce. There's also slight Kafkian touch: the looming ""anthill"" in the begining evokes Kafka's unreachable Castle. The ensuing beaurocratic passages of colonel Dax also owe something to the writings of the famed Austrian, though, of course, the author's tone and stance are different. The division of characters into stone good and stone bad is not that disturbing: the good guys are not so flawlessly and grotesquely good as the bad guys are bad. And finally - the Kubrick's cinematic genius manifested in black and white exquisite imagery. The trench and battlefield scenes are almost surrealist nightmare-like trips hypnotizing the viewer, and the execution part is one of the most dexterously made pieces in cinema history as it makes you literally involved in this death-soaked dismal sight. Unfortunately, the last scene is too unnatural unlike the rest of the film. In spite of that POG is among the most compelling war movies ever made on this planet."

","Kubrick ventured into the realm of warfare three time in his film career, Full Metal Jacket, Dr Strangelove, and, in 1957, Paths of Glory. Paths of Glory definitely stand out as one of the best war movies ever made.<br/><br/>
Paths of Glory tells the story of the French armies attack on the German held ""anthill"" during WW 1. The story focuses on the self serving and often ludicrous orders of the high ranking officer class and the attempts of Douglas's character to fight his superiors while at the same time fighting a war.  when the attack is unsuccessful, several soldiers are picked at random for execution for cowardice  in the face of the enemy. The second half of the movie focuses on the legal proceedings of a court martial trial of several soldiers of the attacking regiment.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very well done, especially for the era. The scenery and filming locations and cinematography are top notch. The dialogue is well written and read (perhaps Kirk Douglas's best acting performance ever). If you look back on movies contemporary with this one, Paths Of Glory definitely sticks out of the crowd for it's seriousness of the subject matter. The only other war movies that match it would be Kubrick's own Full Metal jacket, Platoon  and, of course, Saving Private Ryan that blew everyone else out of the water. Like Full Metal Jacket, SK begins a story and delivers a side of it seldom told and tells it well."

","Nothing comes near this one. Kubrick was just a few films down when he stumbled onto that script (true story). He must have been inspired as he managed, within minutes, to recreate the muddy trenches, the staunch smell of the fear of men, the inhumanity of the French officer corps (excluding Dax of course)and the dichotomy between the Château living conditions and those of the enlisted men. The so-called trial should be shown at movie schools. But certainly the most moving scene of them all has got to be the closing scene with Kubrick's real wife on stage. The song she is forced to sing to a bunch of men transformed into wild animals happens to be a song from both the German and the French Folk music (Marjolaine in French). They realize that after all, they are not so different from their archenemy, the hated Germans (Les Boches). An American Director capable of capturing the essence of WWI has got to be a genius, which of course Stanley Kubrick was."

","Paths of Glory is one of the best World War One pictures. Stanley Kubricks work is nothing short of brilliant , and in this production , the term genius can be totally justified in how Kubrick managed to film this tale of World War One.<br/><br/>The plot centres around a military objective ""The Ant-Hill"" and the French General is persuaded by a Senior at Staff HQ that if he and his division could take the Ant-Hill , then a room for promotion would be made for him. Naturally the General laced by his own reactionary beliefs is easily succumbed to flattery , as the Senior Staff General knows , and accepts the task of demonstrating French will and determination , even though he privately knows that his division is tired and strained , plus the logistics for the Offensive will be completely inadequate .<br/><br/>Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is to lead the division on this slaughter...er..sorry , mission. Dax knows the cost will be heavy , even before the division can even reach the German wire. Kubrick also manages to introduce a sub-plot in this saga as a sergeant displays cowardice in front of the enemy in a reconnisance mission...I'll come back to that later... The offensive is a complete failure and some soldiers seeing the carnage refuse to move from there trench..The French General orders Cannon fire on his own line..condemning there cowardice.<br/><br/>As the aftermath of the failed offensive is known. The Commanding General refuses to take responsibility for the debacle and as a gesture condemns 3 individuals from each Unit to stand trial on charges of cowardice. The sergeant takes his opportunity in stitching up 1 of his antagonist soldier's and duly puts him up for trial , with 2 other decorated soldiers...<br/><br/>The trial takes place and is very emotive , but when the scene ends as the Military Tribunal considers its sentence..The next scene is the assembled excecution squad , pure Kubrick brilliance.<br/><br/>Paths Of Glory , brilliant and superb ,only Come and See surpasses this picture..in truly showing the horror of war."

","I've been a fan of Stanley Kubrick since I first saw ""A Clockwork Orange"" 10 years ago at the age of 15. Many film scholars more articulate than myself could go on about the depth of his films, and I would surely agree.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately, ""Paths of Glory"" is hardly ever mentioned when Kubrick's films are discussed. Of course, ""Spartacus,"" ""2001,"" ""The Shining,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" are classics, but this film is just as good. One of my friends has the Kubrick Collection that was released on video last year. Sadly this isn't in the box set. I honestly hadn't even heard of it until I watched it in a war film class last spring. What a revelation. The cinematography is awesome. The scenes of men walking through the trenches were later duplicated by Kubrick himself, but these work the best.<br/><br/>Kubrick knows how to pull at our heart strings. He doesn't leave us with any doubt as to how he feels about war. This film makes a definite statement. Most films work as entertainment. This one works as a true piece of art.

","Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>There were some masterful moments in this film and the film asks us to entertain certain pertinent questions about the morality and conduct of war.<br/><br/>Still, I thought that the characters were too one dimensional, especially the ""evil"" generals. This film went overboard in reinforcing the stereotype of the uncaring officer whose out of touch with the dog-faced soldier he is ordering into battle. Rather than depict a true moral dilemma the screenwriters flinched and made evil people the scapegoat for the ""necessities of war"". If the practices of directing futile orders and of making examples out of innocent soldiers is allowed by the French people and politicians, then they cannot blame the generals for carrying out those practices. We should not blame the generals for acting in accordance with the established procedures. <br/><br/>Also, the battle scenes were unconvincing to me. Directors like Speilberg and Malick know that it's more effective to shoot battle footage from more than one point of view. The viewer needs to see not only what the attackers are seeing, but what the defenders are seeing as they mow down those coming at them. The fact that the camera followed our hero's profile across the battlefield with those around him slumping over now and again did little to portray the violence of a frontal attack.<br/><br/>The film did make some daring choices. For instance, it does not sugar coat the execution scenes or the fact that innocents sometimes die, but I hoped for a film that more adequately reflected the moral confusion in war, as opposed the the absolute injustice in it."

This is my favorite Kirk Douglas film about the French military during WWI. A group of French soldiers are sent on an impossible mission. When they obviously fail, the General afraid of losing face for a stupid decision decides to court martial some of the soldiers as a punishment. Three soldiers are singled out. One obviously fought very bravely and another was hit on the head and knocked unconscious during the battle. Their stories are futile against the kangaroo French military court. Douglas tries valiantly to act as their legal council and present their defense in vain. From what I understand this film is still banned in France! I guess the humiliating loss during WWII did nothing to sway the French military from its self-conceived notion of being a great military power!"
"gard_centauris","Null","0","0","19 January 2000"," Cowardice and Bravery as depicted in the film (spolier inside)
","In the movie Paths of Glory soldiers are put on trial and executed for ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"".  The movie is about different kinds of true cowardice and bravery and the effects they have on men. Through the use of World War 1 as a setting, the movie depicts the human virtue of bravery.  It also demonstrates the real differences between bravery and cowardice.<br/><br/>Real bravery is shown in the movie through a number of different methods: The way the men stood up to their execution, even though they were picked unfairly and were going to die for no real reason.  The very fact that the soldiers came out of the trenches in the first on an obviously impossible mission was another way real bravery was shown.  Finally, bravery as shown by Colonel Dax standing up to both of the Generals, even though he knew it probably would mean the end of his chances for promotion and maybe even his career.  Another example of real bravery is shown by the artillery commander.  He ignores what is a direct command from his superior officer to fire on his own troops.  He does this knowing full well what kind of trouble that he could get into, but still denies his orders because he knows that it is the right thing to do.<br/><br/>Real cowardice is also shown in this movie.  One of the most obvious is General Miro giving in to personal ambition.  He was the key role in the actual pushing forward of the mission, because he though it would get him a promotion.  When he saw that all the men were not advancing out of the trenches, he ordered his artillery units to fire on their own trenches. Afterwards he didn't even have enough integrity to face up and say that he had ordered the friendly fire in an attempt to force his men out of their trenches.  Instead, he had three men killed for the mistakes that he had made during his command.  Another example of cowardice appears in the form of the Lieutenant who leads the scouting mission into the enemy's territory. He takes with him two other soldiers.  Before the mission he was caught drinking by the men that were to accompany him.  After reaching the enemy lines, he sent one of the other two ahead as an advance scout.  Later he began to hear the sounds of fighting and panicked.  He threw a grenade toward the enemy side and then fled back to his own trenches.  His companion went to go looking for the missing scout, and found him, his smoking corpse was all that was left from the grenade that was thrown at him by the Lieutenant.  By this is not where the real cowardice takes place.  Later on, after the doomed assault on the ant hill, the Lieutenant is ordered to choose one man from his division to face trial, who was to be picked randomly.  Instead he chose the only witness to his cowardly actions and slaying of a friendly soldier.  He could not bring himself to even tell Colonel Dax the truth.  He had been drinking before a dangerous mission, fled in the face of an enemy that he never even saw, and killed one of his own men in the process.  His act of cowardice was to send his only witness to go take the bullet for something that he obviously fully deserved.<br/><br/>Bravery is not just a measure of how much a man is willing to risk his life.  Any man can be convinced through drugs or other means to rush head long into a battle.  This is not necessarily all bravery is about.  It is also a measure of their personal pride and will.  It is the ability to be to undeservedly die and to take it with pride and dignity intact.  It is the ability to stand in the face of something that you know is wrong, that you know you will be killed for, and that you know if there were any fairness at all in the world, you would not be taking the blame for it.  This does not necessarily have to be death, such as the soldiers in the movie faced, but can even apply to unjust punishments in our society.  Just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you can get in trouble even though you did nothing at all.  On the same token, cowardice is not just standing down in the face of what seems to be, or is, an impossible task.  That is just being sensible or smart.  Real cowardice is putting the blame on other people or shrugging responsibility off of you to someone or something else, even though you know what you did was wrong.  Just because you can get away with it does not make it the right thing to do.  By doing this you usually end up hurting others and maybe even getting them punished for something that you did."

Douglas remains unfortunately unaware of this fact until the end of the movie.  But after having had his men withdrawn from the attack, Douglas's men are accused of cowardice and three of his men are to be executed.

The three are executed and Douglas is finally informed that his superior had ordered a bombing on his men.  His superior is to be removed from his post and the penalty that awaits him is unknown to the audience.<br/><br/>  As in all his movies, Kubrick lets you hoping the badguy will be caught until the end but as usual, it's too late to change the bad part when he is finally caught.

Kubrick did not persuade us that war is evil, the general ennui and detached air did not help us feel any bonds to main heroes, and even great final scene failed to cement the film reputation. Overrated, boring and zany at places."

"tudormon","2","10","45","29 December 2006"," ""Classic"" Kubrick-Kirk Douglas collaboration, like Spartacus - more precisely, a bad movie
","For a reason which escapes me, Kubrick (an extraordinary director) agreed to direct 2 movies of Kirk Douglas, which I am sure actually did all the work and, well, the movies are bad. These movies were both produced by Kirk's production company, and he of course was the great star. Kubrick even disowned one of these movies as not his own - and yes, Kirk's influence is THAT bad.<br/><br/>Looking on the Spartacus page, I quote from the currently displayed comment: ""As most are undoubtedly aware, this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS(1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. [...] But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY(1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company, and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well.""<br/><br/>This is very nicely said so I guess I need to add no more.<br/><br/>Luckily, these two never made another movie together, and Kubrick made history by following up with Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut. In the meantime, Kirk made no history but instead did 58 more movies, of... shall we say... very sad quality.<br/><br/>Overall, Spartacus is even more laughable than Paths of Glory because poor Kirk is a small guy and not even 2 of him would make up for the physique of a gladiator (yet he is Spartacus). But Paths of Glory is certainly more annoying as the sweet perfection, flawless intentions and pure soul of Kirk's character makes you want to puke - they are almost not human, let alone not possible for an army colonel whose job is - ultimately - to kill."

","Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory is holding up rather well these days, in fact it's as pertinent and relevant as ever.<br/><br/>It's 1916 and the French and German armies are in opposing mud trenches, when the French are ordered to undertake a suicidal assault on a German held hill, many of the soldiers are quick to realise it's an impossible order to see through to its conclusion and retreat, something which brings charges of cowardice from the military hierarchy. Someone must take the fall... <br/><br/>Withdrawn from circulation in France at one time, unreleased in Spain as well, Paths of Glory is a shattering indictment on military hierarchy. On those General types who watch from afar through telescopic sights as men and boys are led like lambs to the slaughter, then off they go to their dinning rooms to gorge on wine and wholesome meat, the stench of rotting flesh as bad on their breaths as it is out there in no man's land. But it's OK for the war effort, while there might even be a promotion for some lucky soul in nice trousers...<br/><br/>A two-parter, the film was adapted from the novel written by Humphrey Cobb. The first half follows the craziness of the attack, the horrors of war brutally realised as Kubrick and cinematographer Georg Krause bring out the worry and simmering anger that jostle for the soldier's souls. The camera is cold and calculating, thus perfect for the material to hand, it leads the viewers - with skillful fluidity - through the bleakness of the trenches and the desolation of no man's land, the former a foreboding place, the latter an atrocity exhibition as bodies get flayed and shattered, while others retreat with limbs or sanity barely intact.<br/><br/>Second part shifts to a legally based procedural as the Generals conspire to make an example of those who retreated. Cowardice and a dereliction of duty apparently means the firing squad must save the integrity of the army. Patsies are lined up, but their Colonel (a superb Kirk Douglas) wants to defend them, there's much sweat, tears and anger, accusations hurled, and mistakes once again proving insurmountable. Which leads to the astonishing finale, heartbreaking whilst inducing fury, and crowned by an elegiac song that brings tears for characters and viewers alike.<br/><br/>A monochrome masterpiece full of technical skills, towering performances and writing to die for, Paths of Glory, candidate for one of the greatest anti-military films ever crafted. 10/10"
"Snow Leopard","Null","2","5","4 October 2004"," An Interesting, Tense Story
","The story in Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" is tense and interesting, with the action and chaos of a bold yet ill-advised attack followed by the drama and fear caused by its repercussions. But if it were only an anti-war film, it would be a bit too pat, aiming at some generally easy targets. Though set in the heat of the action of World War I, the story and characters are vivid enough to suggest some more general themes about human nature.<br/><br/>As the man in the middle of it all, Kirk Douglas has plenty of energy, and he handles the various confrontations believably. His character has more depth than the others, and in addition to playing an important role in the events, his reactions also form the lens through which the viewer sees everything else. From the first scene to the last, Colonel Dax is spirited in his responses and acute in his observations.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou gives a generally effective portrayal of the bureaucratic officer in charge of it all, though sometimes it is hard not to view his character in the same light as the various charming scamps that Menjou played in his less serious movies. George Macready's character is one-dimensional and disreputable, but he plays the role as it was intended. Ralph Meeker has the most presence of the three prisoners.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, some of the characters' decisions are deplorable, but most of them are believable, and not only in a war-time setting. It is possible to see in the characters some parallels to everyday behavior. This is one of the things that sets the movie apart from the many run-of-the-mill anti-war pictures, and it helps ""Paths of Glory"" go a little beyond its immediate genre."
"tim777ca","7","2","5","31 December 2002"," Actor manipulator
","Stanley Kubrick tended to manipulate actor like puppet to serve his camera, that's why I never like his work very much. He had been eager to show off his mise-en-scene ability, which became more and more obsessive in his later films.<br/><br/>Early in this over-praised movie, two generals, played by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready, has a conversation about attacking German-occupied Ant Hill. Kubrick makes them walk around in the room without any motivation, just to move the actors so that he can pan his camera to reveal the well-designed set.<br/><br/>Later, Kirk Douglas is talking to someone on the staircase of the headquarter, Macready walks up and joins him, then they move higher while carrying on conversation, so the camera can change its angle to pick up other parts of the huge set without cutting. After their dialogue is over, Macready steps down the stairway. (Why he leads Kirk to walk up in the first place?)<br/><br/>Not having military background, Kubrick doesn't know soldiers don't talk that way. If a general wants to talk to a colonel, he would simply yell, ""Hey, colonel, come over here!"" He would never go to a subordinate officer in real life. Moving the actor up and down for no reason seems rather ludicrous."

The trench scenes are done quite adequately nice considering the technology at the time of the movie's production. It has a nice effort of sound effects. But the story just goes on and on without any real focus, from the talks, to the half baked assault scene where there were no German seen, to the court marshal. Besides the story building talks up front, the sequences show only failures, cheats, treacheries and stupidity. Kirk Douglas is the only actor doing a decent job in this movie.

","I just started a Kubrick Marathon this summer and I chose to start with this film and it was a pleasure to experience such a well-presented anti-war film. Kubric is a filmmaking genius and proves it both with his interesting camera work and with the direction he chooses to talk about war and humanity.<br/><br/>
At first,we get to see the uglyiness and unfairness of war even without seeing the Germans, who in this case, are the enemy. We get to see how unfair and ust plain stupid and politicly-driven can a war be by watching an insident in the battlefiled of the French army. The soldiers are acussed of cowerdness but they actually could noto do anything because the attack was impossible.And the commander says that 3 random soliders have to die in order to give a lesson the other soldiers.<br/><br/>The men with the most power are so arrogant and cunning hat only seek for their own good and do not care about the human lives. A life t them means nothing and they do not understand that a human is a being with emotions and wants love and care and is not a robot made to please every higher force.<br/><br/>And there we have Kirk Dougles' character who is the face of ethics and truth. He cares for every singl life of his men and rightably argues to any wrong or immoral decision. He is an unstoppable force and craves for the better.<br/><br/>And then we have the three exceptional performaces of the ""guilty"" soliders who have been chosen to die for a nonsnese. And it hurts to see young men lose their soles for such a wrong and barbarian order. The monlogue of one of the soldiers about him and the insect that by the time he dies the insect will closer to his wie than him is so true and difficult to swallolw. And all this for a stupid order of a stupid arrogant being.<br/><br/>The ending is pure genius. The soldiers desprately cry by listening to a german singer and their sadness and pain and everything that this war has caused to their soles, their longing of family and peace is depicted through their sad and lost faces. And then Kirk Douglas gives a memorable smile, which as I see it, means that he was definately right form the begining. Humans are humans. They can't like a perfect being because being tired and dizzy and not being able to move on are situatin that we all face. And the tears of these soldiers signify that war damages and poisons are nature. War and these stupid men of power torn human nature apart. Humans are afraid and angry and feel pain. We ain't guns, we have a soul.<br/><br/>Kubrick delivers a film which offers so many ideas about war that it is impossible not to keep thinking about the film. His camera work is provoking and we should cnsder that this is a film made in the 60's. Every choice, from technical aspects to the main critic on war and poltiics and religion is bold and it is striking to see a film with such a moral compass.<br/><br/>A glorious film."

I had heard great things about this movie for years, but for one reason or other, I'd never gotten around to sitting down to watch it. If I'm being honest, when I sat down to watch it, I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to see it (as this was one of the films for the Kubrick series, it felt like sitting down to watch it was a little bit of a chore), but by the end of this movie I was so wrapped up in the story that I could barely take my eyes from the screen, and as the final scene played out on screen I found myself emotionally overwhelmed and I started to cry. This film is a harrowing look at the horrors and absurdities of war, and a commentary on the horrid way that humans can treat each other for no reason whatsoever.

The bold plot (which seemingly takes a page from the excellent 'The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)' in its latter half) is incredibly impactful thanks to its blatant injustice.

The movies tackles issues with war such as cruel leaders, brutality of war, the army system, and the soldiers hesitation in war, whom you can't really blame because of the horrifying enemy's machinery and weapons firing in-front of them. The movies also shows the loyalty and honesty of some generals that they are ready to defend their soldiers in front of the leaders in trial, and refusing to be a under a system which condemn their soldiers lives just for reputation. It also shows the extent at which some leaders are ready to go to protect their reputation. Also, the grey area that the top leader hide in, not offending or denying the leader, nor protecting him.

It follows the planning and potential execution of a suicide mission in World War One. If you can use your suspension of disbelief and accept the fact that no one in the movie has a French accent, you'll be in for a very riveting, well-acted film.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou and George Macready are big-wigs in the French army, and they plan out a mission for their boys in the trenches that has virtually no likelihood of success. Both men are hard-hearted and treat men in uniform like chess pawns. Emotional and physical wounds are often ignored, but when Kirk Douglas hears of the plan, he doesn't want to go through with it. He actually cares about his soldiers and doesn't want to order them to their death. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that this is a war drama, so don't pop this in if you're in the mood for a light afternoon flick. This movie will absolutely get you riled up, and if you're already anti-war, it might become one of your favorites. It had the misfortune to be released the same year as The Bridge on the River Kwai, which swept the Oscars in 1958 and took space in audiences' memories in the years to come. You've probably heard of Paths of Glory, but unless you're a film buff or student, you might not have seen it. If you're up for a very heavy, depressing movie, it's absolutely worth watching."

","Stanley Kubrick's potent anti-war classic comes down super hard on the intrinsic cruelty and unfairness of the bleakly efficient military machine in which the arrogant top brass are more concerned about enhancing their lofty statuses and saving face with the public than they care about the grim plight of the hapless common foot soldiers who are sent to certain deaths by being forced to carry out mpossible missions for the sake of said top brass's own overinflated egos and self-advancement within the ranks: One can't help but feel infuriated when the ruthlessly ambitious General Paul Mireau (a marvelously haughty portrayal by George Macready) orders his own men to be shot when they fail to follow through with taking a heavily fortified area. Indeed, Kubrick astutely captures not only the brutality of war, but also the frequent absurdity and futility of same in both the harrowing combat scenes and at the shattering climax in which three innocent men are executed just so those in charge can prevent themselves from feeling disgraced. <br/><br/>Kirk Douglas contributes a wonderfully impassioned performance as the idealistic Colonel Dax, who makes a game, albeit fruitless attempt to defend several men under his command when they are brought up on charges of cowardice. Moreover, there are strong contributions from Ralph Meeker as the sarcastic Corporal Philippe Paris, Adolphe Menjou as the smug and calculating General George Broulard, Wayne Morris as craven drunk Lt.

He might eventually be brought down, but his evil lives after him."
"JamesHitchcock","9","1","2","31 October 2017"," The paths of glory lead but to the grave
","In 1916 a French regiment is ordered to attack ""the Anthill"", a strongly fortified German position. The attack proves a disastrous failure; the French suffer heavy casualties and none of their soldiers succeed in reaching the German trenches. When a second wave of troops refuse to attack, their commanding officer General Mireau desperately orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander, however, refuses to do so without a written order. To try and deflect blame from himself for the failure of the offensive, Mireau orders three soldiers from the regiment, chosen at random, to be tried for cowardice. The task of defending the accused falls to Mireau's subordinate Colonel Dax, a lawyer in civilian life.<br/><br/>The film was controversial when it was first released in 1957; it was banned in France, where it was regarded as a slur on the honour of the French Army, until 1975. It was also banned for a time in Switzerland and Franco's Spain and (remarkably) in West Germany. Films with a strongly anti-war theme were perhaps unusual in the fifties, a period during which American (and British) war films were mostly set in World War II and were generally patriotic in tone, with war shown as something heroic. World War I, which could not so easily be turned into a glorious fight for freedom, was largely ignored.<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"", however, was based on a novel by Humphrey Cobb which had been written in the very different political climate of 1935, when following the slaughter of 1914-18 pacifism was more in fashion. At first sight, Cobb's title looks deliberately ironic because he depicts war as something far from glorious. To those who recognise its source, however, it appears not so much ironic as grimly appropriate. It comes from Thomas Gray's poem ""Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard"", and what Gray wrote was ""The paths of glory lead but to the grave"".<br/><br/>The film makes its case against war in two ways. The first is by emphasising the futility of war. The only German we see is a female civilian captured by the French; no German soldiers appear at all. I think that this was a deliberate decision by director Stanley Kubrick; the French soldiers seem to be fighting not against men like themselves but against some nameless, invisible and inexorable force of nature, able to cut them down at will. They appear to have no more chance of capturing the Anthill than they would of capturing the moon.<br/><br/>The second way in which Kubrick makes his case is by emphasising the gulf between the generals and the man under their command. This is not just a difference in social class- indeed, this element is not emphasised as much as it is in some British productions about the war. It is more a gulf in the way in which they experience the war. The general staff, safe in their chateaux away from the lines, have no real idea of the hardships and dangers confronting those under their command.<br/><br/>Moreover, the generals do not even seem to be motivated by patriotism or a belief in the rightness of their cause. They are much more concerned about self-advancement and their own brand of office politics. When Mireau is first ordered to take the Anthill he demurs, believing that the objective can only be attained, if at all, at an unacceptable cost in French lives. It is only when his superior, General Broulard, intimates that a successful attack might be rewarded with a promotion that he changes his mind. When Dax complains about Mireau's behaviour, Broulard assumes that this is all part of a ploy to obtain Mireau's job; it never occurs to him that Dax might be sincere about trying to save the lives of three unjustly accused men.<br/><br/>This was not the first film to be directed by Kubrick, but it was perhaps the first to bring him to public notice. The battle scenes are well done, even if they lack the realism of more modern war films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the recent ""Dunkirk"". The trial scenes, during which it becomes increasingly uncertain as to whether Dax, for all his forensic skills, will be able to save the three accused. Kirk Douglas is excellent as Dax, a sane and humane man in an insane and inhumane world, and he receives good support from the rest of the cast. Particularly good is George Macready as General Mireau, a man driven literally mad by unbridled ambition to the point where he is prepared to sacrifice hundreds of lives, not for the honour and glory of France but for the honour and glory of General Mireau.<br/><br/>The film is perhaps less well-known today than some of Kubrick's later efforts, but I would regard it as his first masterpiece, equal or superior in quality to virtually anything in his later work, including his two later anti-war films, ""Dr Strangelove"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". Douglas was also to collaborate with Kubrick in his second great masterpiece, ""Spartacus"". 9/10"

","Banned in France till 1975, Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957) is an unusually powerful and incisive cinematic discourse relating to the futility of war. In fact it would be almost unbearably grim without the performance of Douglas as Colonel Dax - the liberal defender of three innocent French soldiers accused of cowardice on contrived trumped-up charges by the over-ambitious and arrogant General Mireau (George Macready). Such social issues as class differences and military hypocrisy in the French High Command are emphasised. Douglas' Dax character gives the film its only light and warmth. In appearance he looks impressive - fair-haired and lantern-jawed, he sports his regiment number '701' on his collar and cuffs and wears a prototype wristwatch. Along with 20.000 Leagues under the Sea (1954), Ulisse (1954)and Light at the Edge of the World(1971) it is one of his most compelling performances although it lacks the Nietzschean undertones of the aforementioned adventure and sword and sandals films. Time Out describes Douglas' performance as being 'astonishingly successful' and refers to the very interesting 'diagrammatic tracking shots' relating to the battle scenes."

The acting is phenomenal, there is no bad performance in this movie. But the thing that makes this movies is the story and writing. Every line tells the tragedy of war seamlessly and is touching at times. The story is perfectly paced and executed and it feels like every scene has purpose. This movie also contains one of my favorite endings to a movie, so that's a bonus.

","The film, made in 1957, is typical of Kubrick's earlier work in being short (84 minutes), tight, told with an economy approaching terseness. Later his films would expand in length and epic scope, sometimes to their advantage, sometimes not. It does however contain examples of one of his favorite visual strategies, the extended camera movement that unfolds to reveal details of a set or location, and continues long after we expect it to be over.<br/><br/>These shots of long duration impress the importance of their subjects upon us: The permanence of trench warfare, the devastation of attack, the hypocrisy of the ruling class, the dread of the condemned men. The shots in ""Paths of Glory"" are aimed straight at our emotions.<br/><br/>The black-and-white photography is the correct choice; this is a world of shapes and shadows, mud and smoke, not a world for color. The loss of life is devastating. The advance is halted. Watching from the safety of the trenches, Gen. Mireau decides the men are cowards and orders French artillery to fire on their own men, to drive them forward. The battery commander refuses to act without a written order.<br/><br/>In any conventional war movie, in a film made by 99 directors out of 100, there would be an 11th-hour reprieve, the condemned men would be spared, and the stupid and treacherous Mireau would be publicly humiliated.<br/><br/>Not here. Kubrick finds a way to draw all his story threads tight without compromising his harsh and unforgiving theme. The plot is resolved, yes, but cruelty and duplicity survive, and private soldiers are still meaningless pawns. Broulard believes the executions will be ""a perfect tonic"" for the army: ""One way to maintain discipline is to shoot a man now and then."""
"kgprophet","7","1","2","28 November 2013"," A Early Masterpiece by the Genius Filmmaker
","It seems amazing the jump in scope and complexity from Kubrick's previous film ""The Killing"" and this landmark motion picture. The competency in direction - acting, staging, pacing, editing, and of course the pristine cinematography. It seems it was made by a director with many more years of experience. As many people involved with the project knew, this film would be remembered through time. Based on a real incident, it reflected the change in sentimentality of how soldiers were being used as human waves, where it was acceptable to allow for a certain percent of casualties. This disregard for human life is eloquently displayed with a series of scenes the demonstrate the futility of war. From the miserable trench conditions, to the fighting for mounds of dirt, to the blind military strategy that merely repeats failed attacks, to the absurdity of threatening death as punishment as part of the ""rules"" of war. Partly what makes this such a timeless statement is the fact it was banned in many countries, because of the possible explosive anti-military sentiments it may have provoked.<br/><br/>Sadly, this film was ignored by the Academy Awards, there are many aspects of the film that are excellently executed. Primarily is the lean script. Clocking in at 88 minutes, each exchange by the great cast is sharp and poignant. The intriguing audacity of executing your own soldiers during a war creates meaningful contradictions. A Colonel wants 3 men shot for cowardice, as a representation of each group. Why not kill all the soldiers if they are all accused of cowardice? And what real incentive does it give the other soldiers to go on to a battlefield and be killed or stay in your trench and be killed? These dilemmas are intelligently staged with a crisp pace that successfully develops sympathy from the audience. Part of what makes the casting great is the use of actors that have distinctive characteristics that present more of the human side of facing death.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone will deny the artistic freedom of using American actors as French soldiers. Or the fact this 1916 period piece has distinctly modern dialect and frank honesty about religion, military power, and what the definition of true patriotism is. Even better is that these subject matters are cleanly addressed with not one moment feeling like a dry debate. Rarely do these confrontations occur sitting down, the body language and use of space creates a dynamic that feels heavily thought out and rehearsed. The locations are exquisite. Ironically, the locations were filmed in a castle in Germany. All the characters in this film are well drawn and a joy to watch when sparring against each other. Kirk Douglas particularly savours his juicy scenes of disdain and rebellion. George McCready is the antagonist, and speaks with a lofty prima donna delivery that makes him all that more detestable.<br/><br/>This film succeeds on all levels, it has great action scenes but has a moral message. It has unpleasant confrontations with death but is still beautiful to look at. The subject matter is serious yet very entertaining. It achieves the classification of a film masterpiece because of the ability of the filmmaker to encapsulate the heart of the story with only a few scenes (the entire film plays out over the course of 2 days) with well honed dialogue and an active camera."
"Arriflex1","10","1","2","8 November 2013"," Stanley Kubrick: His First Masterpiece
","PATHS OF GLORY: Here, Kubrick establishes an important thematic component that is present in many of his great films. The idea of entrenched authority answerable only to itself and running amok with cruel insensitivity would seem like the fearful concerns of a paranoiac except that Kubrick is informed by reality. The film is named after and based on Humphrey Cobb's 1935 novel which was based on actual events, making Kubrick's depiction of the sadistic generals unassailable. Their ill-advised forays into the battlefield are horrifying. When their folly turns into unimaginable tragedy we enter the realm of the demented. Willing to maintain their status and power at a terrible human cost the depraved military leaders persecute brave men who are guilty only of following orders. From a moral stance, the viewer is poised to watch hopefully as one man steps forward to begin the search for truth and the fight for justice. <br/><br/>Maintaining status and power despite the human toll; Kubrick gives this subject a thorough and unflinching examination in PATHS OF GLORY and it would be a topic he would scrutinize more than once with fierce intensity. In SPARTACUS (1960) the cruelty of Roman might seeks to strangle human freedom. In DR. STRANGELOVE (1964), a deranged general (again the military) strives for purity of essence by driving mankind to the brink of doom. And perhaps most chillingly, in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), a nearly ""human"", all- controlling computer, evolves into a homicidal entity determined to preserve the integrity of a space mission by eliminating ""human error"". <br/><br/>The validity and impact of PATHS OF GLORY is underscored by its twenty year ban by the French government. The film is a seamless melding of technique (the dolly shots of Kirk Douglas in the trenches are remarkable for their power), storytelling (the script is highly charged but not hysterical), and beautifully nuanced performances (McCready and Menjou are utterly dynamic; Douglas gives his outrage a perfectly modulated naturalism). Kubrick's emotional passion is unalloyed by his intellectual cool in this film. And that fact makes PATHS OF GLORY my favorite of all the director's work.

","<ul><li>This is Stanley Kubrick's 4th full length film released in 1957 as a drama and war film. Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. </li></ul><br/><br/>After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken.<br/><br/>These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. <br/><br/>Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. <br/><br/>''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from ""Paths of Glory"". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''."

","Paths of Glory is an anti-war film by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb.Set during World War I, the film stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, the commanding officer of French soldiers who refused to continue a suicidal attack. Dax attempts to defend them against a charge of cowardice in a court-martial.Adapting Humphrey Cobb's novel to the screen, Kubrick and his collaborators Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson set out to make a devastating anti-war statement, and they succeeded above and beyond the call of duty. <br/><br/>In the third year of World War I, the erudite but morally bankrupt French general Broulard orders his troops to seize the heavily fortified ""Ant Hill"" from the Germans. General Mireau knows that this action will be suicidal, but he will sacrifice his men to enhance his own reputation. Against his better judgment, Colonel Dax leads the charge, and the results are appalling. When, after witnessing the slaughter of their comrades, a handful of the French troops refuse to leave the trenches, Mireau very nearly orders the artillery to fire on his own men. Still smarting from the defeat, Mireau cannot admit to himself that the attack was a bad idea from the outset: he convinces himself that loss of Ant Hill was due to the cowardice of his men. Mireau demands that three soldiers be selected by lot to be executed as an example to rest of the troops. Acting as defense attorney, Colonel Dax pleads eloquently for the lives of the unfortunate three, but their fate is a done deal. Even an eleventh-hour piece of evidence proving Mireau's incompetence is ignored by the smirking Broulard, who is only interested in putting on a show of bravado.<br/><br/>The movie was a failure when first released since it was banned outright in France for several years, Paths of Glory has since taken its place in the pantheon of classic war movies, its message growing only more pertinent and potent with each passing year.It was especially popular during the Vietnam era.This masterpiece still packs a wallop, though nothing in it is as simple as it may first appear; audiences are still arguing about the final sequence, which has been characterized as everything from a sentimental cop-out to the ultimate cynical twist.And most of all,it is all about that greatest of all movie subjects: power."
"davidgkimberley","9","1","2","22 January 2012"," Very near Perfection
","What first struck as being most impressive in Paths of Glory, was the way in which trench warfare and life in the trench was shot. Usually I find there's some sort of gloss over the reality of the situation, and whilst here, there weren't mountains dismembered bodies and discarded heads, the emotion of the place was just so brilliantly conveyed. In the shots in which the camera glides through the trenches the emotion of every man is conveyed and felt, its seriously powerful. Though obviously not intentional, the fact that this film was in black and white actually helped it to feel more real somehow. That's probably just a personal opinion and its quite hard to explain but I just don't think the film actually would have been so effective if in full colour, it is far more a film of message and emotion than of beautiful scenery and an array of rainbow like effects.<br/><br/>In terms of directing, Kubrik is really very good. There were three shots used a few times each throughout the film that I really liked. Firstly was the gliding through the trenches that I've already spoken about. Secondly was the following of one person whilst panning the camera behind other people. This was quite exceptional in the shooting scene which is so abrupt, and as its almost from the perspective of the shooter there is almost a feeling of guilt or at least it induces some sort of emotion. Thirdly was the way in which people's faces are shot, I you feel like you see everyone in this film and whilst that might sound strange or pretty stupid its true. Pretty much every character in the film, from the tiniest extra to Kirk Douglas, facial features seem to be shown and it brings in such an incredible array of emotion (I'm sorry for saying emotion so much!), whether it be the nasty general or normal soldiers who we see panning through the trenches. <br/><br/>Acting wise I thought this film was really spot on again. Probably the most impressive element was the one of restraint. So many characters have to hide their real feelings in the face of their superiors whilst simultaneously displaying them to the audience. Kirk Douglas's cracking point was probably the best example of this, even though he does reveal his true feelings to some extent, one still feels he is still holding back some what and that was very very good. <br/><br/>In one of his very rousing speeches Kirk Douglas states; ""There are times when I am ashamed to be a member of the human race and this is one such occasion"". I think this probably best sums up the whole motif of the film. Although it might be an anti-war piece, the film really has a Kafkaesque feel to it, it seems to be calling into question certain elements of humanity and it does absolutely brilliantly, so that even at the conclusion there is no real certainty, I didn't feel as though anyone had lost or won, just that everything was going to carry on as usual despite the travesties that were occurring so constantly."

","A Kubrick movie is always something unique. No matter if his movie got made in the '50's, '60's, '70's, '80's or '90's, it's always something special and also recognizable. His style throughout his movies and also the way of storytelling have been very consistent. It's a real accomplishment for any type of director to make successful and acclaimed movies over many different decades. ""Paths of Glory"" is one of his earliest movies, or at least it's one of his earliest truly recognized ones. It really shows some guts and confidence that he made this movie the way he did, while he wasn't even an established directing name at the time in Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a daring and unique movie for its time really, that kicks against the military. It's a war movie without really being a war movie. It's more about humanity and is basically a story that could had been set at any given place at any given time. It actually has a quite simple little story in it, that becomes very effective through its characters and just overall way of storytelling.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily a movie about the madness of war but more about the madness of men. In a war its more a character movie than anything else really. So it also really helps the movie that it has such fine actors involved. It has Kirk Douglas in the lead but I enjoyed some of the supporting cast members even better. I particularly enjoyed Adolphe Menjou and Ralph Meeker. Adolphe Menjou was actually an old star from the silent movie era but in this movie he perhaps gives his best performance. Even the acting style in this movie is being quite unique and unusual for its time, like basically all Kubrick movies can be describes as, as well.<br/><br/>It's still a large scale looking and feeling movie, despite the fact that it doesn't really feature that many action or battle sequences. It's mostly due to the sets, directing approach and camera-handling. There are some trademark Kubrick looking moments in the movie, such as some long shots, moving camera's and interesting camera-angles. <br/><br/>It's not my favorite Kubrick movie and it's also not his best but it's still a more than great early, beautiful and intriguing compelling movie from the master.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"antonjsw1","10","1","2","7 March 2010"," Kubrick the auteur(well almost!)
","This is an excellent film.<br/><br/>It shows that Kubrick is really pushing the boundaries of film-making despite the limits of a modest budget and strongly established film conventions of time. His decision to film in Europe really helps this film with excellent b & w photography and the emergence of the Kubrick signature tracking shots shot with a wide angle and large depth of field. The directing is pretty much flawless and the visceral battle sequences are pretty startling for a film made in 1957 on a just a $1 million budget.<br/><br/>The story is fascinating, and providing you can get past the American accents, which is not to difficult, the politics of power is well observed. The machinations of specific characters, and their consequences for those at the sharp end, are also a comment of society in general, particularly how the powerful treat those lower down the social layers. Performances are very good, notably Ralph Meeker, Killing alumni Joe Turkel and Timothey Carey as three soldiers key to the story, supporting player George Macready as General Mireau and a thoughtful turn by Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax. Douglas plays understated extremely well, and the character's conflict and frustration with the situation he finds himself are well played. However, there is a determination to not give up his principles and humanity, which is the highlight and anchor of the movie.<br/><br/>Production design Ludwig Reiber, costume design by Ilse Dubois, and b & w cinematography by Georg Krause are superb, and Kubrick's trademark camera-work really shows in this film for the first time.<br/><br/>Interestingly I did notice a music track early on that sounds strikingly similar to the drum riff that introduces the preparation of the marines for heading down to LV426 in Aliens. It made me think whether a certain Mr Cameron is paying homage to some of Mr Kubrick's films in Aliens. After all Aliens opening is at the very least heavily inspired by Gayane's Ballet Suite from 2001.<br/><br/>In summary a outstanding film that sort of marks the end of Kubrick's breakout phase, before he moved on to direct is one and only populist blockbuster."

","Every war bears its own signature. As with all wars, none ever succeeds in proving it's original intention. Take the First World War for instance. It's was touted as the War to End all Wars. That never happened. Instead, it is agreed, it firmly established the reasons for the Second World War. This film is entitled "" The Paths of War ' and like all wars there is much insanity in it's story. During the many battles, there were orders and counter-orders, some of which made no sense at all. In this movie, one such order concerned the careers of several high ranking French Officers, such as Gen. George Broulard and Gen. Paul Mireau (Adolphe Menjou and George Macready) who were only interested in making a name for themselves. Thus when they concocted a suicidal attack on a German position called 'The Ant hill' they were fully aware that such an assault would needlessly cost the lives of hundreds of French soldiers. Being veterans of many such reckless and futile assaults, many in the infantry refused to go. The furious Generals thereafter selected several soldiers to be arrested and tried for Cowardice and executed. Despite the most persuasive and certainly the most logical defense offered by Col. Dax, their lawyer (Kirk Douglas), the cowardly generals refused to change their order. The entire saga of this true story is forever affixed in the annals of French stupidity. Moreover, the insanity of the French Officer corps, is a prime example of all Militaries throughout the world. Indeed, movies like this and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' are excellent reasons for abolishing war altogether. However, like the outcome in this film, it is ordained by the arrogant ignorance of each new generation. We can only pray, it's won't be as repetitive as our propensity for destruction. ****"

","When the bulk of our generation thinks of black and white movies, we instantly imagine a largely boring experience, filmed on a set with a painted background, with tiresome monologues given by stiff actors and actresses. The movie Paths of Glory (1957) proves these stereotypes wrong and is perhaps more enjoyable than many modern films.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory (PG), directed by Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut), is a story set in World War I era France. It documents a French military exploit that is doomed from its conception. The protagonist, Colonel Dax, played by Kirk Douglas(Gunfight at the OK Corral), is given the task of attacking a heavily-fortified German position, the anthill, by his commander General Paul Mireau, George Macready(Commandoes Strike at Dawn). General Mireau decides to issue this insane order after he is tempted with a promotion. The attack ultimately fails and General Mireau wishes to blame his ""cowardly"" troops for the loss. He has three men court-marshaled for cowardice (Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel, and Tim Carey). It is then Dax's job to defend them against the biased French military command. The movie gives an insightful snapshot of the Great War that was never attempted by any other film, modern or old, and also contains very strong anti-authority/ anti-war messages purposefully intended by Kubrick.<br/><br/>The filming techniques that Kubrick uses in this movie are unique for the time of its filming. When I first saw this movie, I was convinced that it was a modern film, done in black and white for dramatic effect, but I later discovered it was produced in the 1950's. Kubrick breaks away from tradition and gives very personal close-ups of the characters in the film. This method shows the actor's emotion in great detail, and adds to the complexity of the film. Kubrick added subtle details to his scenes, like shooting the commanders from a low angle during the battle scene, which gives them an appearance of gods looking out over their creation. He also adds shadows in the office of the cowardly and drunk Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris), to make him even more villainous. There is also great use of eye-line match while both General Mireau and Colonel Dax are walking through the trenches, which adds to the realism of the movie. The eye-line match also gives the viewer a picture of all the various soldiers in their different forms of apprehension before the battle.<br/><br/>The age of this film does not harm its appearance. Unlike many black and white films, this one was filmed entirely on location. Kubrick paid much attention to detail. He even created a very convincing no-man's land in a German farm field. The court martial takes place at Schleissheim Palace in Munich, Germany, which adds great character to the film and shows the viewer the decadence of the French high command compared to the regular officers. The costumes for the film are very authentic for the time, Kubrick even made sure to have the regimental numbers on the soldiers collars. There was no detail left unnoticed in this movie, and it gives me all the more reason to like it.<br/><br/>Kubrick restrained himself in the use of music, there is little sound track other than a march, which opens the film. He does have a great use of drums for suspense, during a night patrol scene in which three characters go out into no-man's land. The last scene, however, contains a very beautiful song. It is sung by Christiane Harlan, who later married Kubrick. The scene has little to do with the plot of the movie, but I feel adds greatly to the films effect. It takes place in a dirty bar, where Harlan is a captured German civilian, who sings a native song to the French officers on leave. When the soldiers jeers and taunts turn to silence and tears, it creates a very moving scene.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are not well-developed and little is given about their background, however, I feel it does not ruin the story. The actors all give great reactions to their situations that I feel are very realistic and honest. There are many moving scenes in this film, the court martial being one of them. Kubrick also adds many subtle details, like having wounded troops pass behind General Mireau while he is laughing.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is largely overlooked by the public and should be considered to be one of the great movies of the 1950's. Paths of Glory presents a realistic and enjoyable movie experience, and presents a very stunning picture of authority and war that can relate to any time. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to watch a very moving film. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
"cwarne_uk","9","1","2","30 August 2008"," Kubrick's Finest
","I am no fan of Stanley Kubrick and consider all of the films he made after ""Dr. Strangelove"" to be cleverly made, imbecilic rubbish. The basic problem was his world-view - apparent in the few interviews he gave - deeply anti-humanist and incredibly arrogant. That the later films are so devoid of intellect or passion may well be why he has become a favourite of so many who want films to be arty without actually being truly difficult. This has little to do with ""Paths Of Glory"", made before Kubrick had developed the deadened style of those later films. Perhaps the secret ingredient is Kirk Douglas, here at his muscular, intelligent best and obviously deeply committed to the material. The gliding camera in the trenches and the battle scenes are amongst the best filmed moments of 1950's cinema - realistic in a way few English language films of that time were, the only comparison being in Japanese films such as ""Fires On The Plain"". The film is very cleverly constructed, playing almost as a two-acter of trench and aftermath, with a coda that is surprisingly moving. There are a few gripes, as always, the first one is Kirk's hairdo which is pure 1956, slightly more serious is the loading of the film against the generals - maybe this sort of thing is needed in cinema, but compared to literature it is quite crude. I would disagree with those who see this as an anti-war film - it seems to me to be simply a film that takes place in wartime. It may explore what war can lead men to do, but, like it's hero, there is little suggestion that it explicitly condemns war. Overall I would rank this as a great film, to my mind it is certainly Kubrick's finest."

","With the exception of Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front (29), Paths of Glory is probably the most powerful anti-war film ever made, clearly laying the blame for such obscene waste of life at the feet of vainglorious officers in ruthless pursuit of advancement. <br/><br/>By 1916 of World War 1 the armies of France and Germany find themselves battling to a standoff in a quagmire decorated in barbed wire known as ""No Man's Land"". The 107th infantry stationed in the trenches on the front line is overextended and undermanned from casualties. The battalion commander, General Mireau (George Mac Cready) at first begs off an attack on ""The Ant Hill"", a near impregnable position, for these reasons. But when General Broulard (Adolfe Menjou) offers him promotion Mireau quickly does an about face and agrees to the suicidal attack. When it fails miserably, Mireau attempting to deflect blame demands that enlisted men be chosen as examples and tried for cowardice, the penalty of which is death in front of a firing squad.<br/><br/>From the beautifully choreographed dance for death between the cold hearted generals in the lavish country mansion to the grippingly taut tracking shots through the trenches and the attack across No Man's Land director Stanley Kubrick's visual artistry is well in evidence as he draws striking contrast between those who make war and those who fight it. The generals live in lavish spacious quarters while in filthy squalor the infantry hug trench walls under constant shelling. The trial itself is a mockery, with the impeccably dressed General Mireau lounging in an 18th Century love seat interrupting the proceedings as he sees fit while the accused look awkward and out of place in rumpled uniforms. Kubrick skillfully gives the proceedings a chess board look with these three pawns surrounded by knights and kings.<br/><br/>As the ruthlessly ambitious generals, Menjou and Mac Cready look very much at home festooned in beautifully tailored uniforms, billeted in palaces. The war is a game to them as well as an opportunity for advancement. If it takes massive loss of life to achieve objective then so be it. As the bridge between officer and enlisted man Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is omniscient witness to the cold inhumanity being practiced on the battle field as well as in the drawing room. Douglas gives one of his finest performances restrained in part by the fact he must be an officer and maintain control and not give vent to emotion. In the court room he fights passionately for his men, but on the battle field he must lead by example and his stoic demeanor as he moves through the trenches before going over the top in the attack scene solidifies his perfect fit as Dax. <br/><br/>This is the first in what I consider Kubrick's run of superb films between 1957 and 1970. The topic is controversial (it was banned in France, Germany and Spain),the telling sardonic. Jump cutting gives the film a rapid rush to judgment pace and those incredible tracking shots evident in so many of his films are powerfully employed throughout Paths. The music score other than percussion and military drumming is confined to two scenes but used to maximum effect, especially in the film's finale. <br/><br/>Paths of Glory is a rare combination of form and content flawlessly carried off by a cinema icon presenting a message that resonates just as powerfully today as it did back then."
"freemantle_uk","10","1","2","3 May 2008"," Short Snappy Anti-War Film
","Paths of Glory is good early example of Stanley Kubrick's ability as a writer and director. It also offers Kirk Douglas' best performance.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory was based on a novel by Humphrey Cobb, a novel with a strong anti-war stance. The film is during the First World War and the French attempted an unsuccessful attack on a well defended German position. General Mireau (George Macready) who ordered the attack was looking for promotion and when the attack fails he ordered the artillery to attack his own side which they refused to do. He was so angry that he wanted 100 men shot for their failure. It was then decided that 3 men were going to used as examples. Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) was the officer who led the attack in the field. He ended up leading because he was threaten with removal from his position if he didn't lead it. After the attack he representatives his soldiers in a show trial. He was a lawyer in civilian life and he makes a good case, but he was fighting the French military establishment.<br/><br/>The film is shows that the trenches were unpleasant and that the French General held the rank-and-file troops and life in general with little rearguard. It had such impact that it was banned in France and Spain when it was under Franco. It is still banned in countries that are under military rule. The film does not drag out the story and tells it very quickly: its running time is one hour and twenty minutes. Great if you got a short attention span. The film has some good scenes and Kubrick like always pays great attention to details. You get to see the horrors of the trenches compared to the luxury that the French generals lived in. They are good performances in the film, but it is Kirk Douglas who is the most noticeable in the film. He last scene with General Broulard is particularly good. At the end there is also a nice little German song by Christiane Harlan, who latter becomes Stanley's wife in real life.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is worth watching, no matter what your politics and what your thoughts of Kubrick and Douglas."
"charchuk","10","1","2","21 April 2008"," Anti-war masterpiece
","There's something to be said for watching this after a few hours of Call of Duty (and also followed by Harold + Kumar and something called The Giant Gila Monster - but that's another story), but I'm not sure exactly what it is. Suffice to say, the great disconnect between these two forms of entertainment, both dealing with war, is stunning and affecting.<br/><br/>This is a sobering and infuriating piece of work. The characters and dialogue are a little too on-the-nose and obvious, but I'd be lying if I said that they didn't anger me anyway. I'm rapidly getting the sense that Kubrick likes to deal with the dichotomy between superficial 'high' society and passionate 'low' society, and he expands on it here to great effect. The carefully chosen vocabulary of the various generals and other higher-ups contrasts exceedingly well with the dialectic slang of the soldiers, with Dax being somewhat of a bridge between the two classes. With that in mind, it's the eloquence and articulation of the generals as they call for soldiers to be made an example of that truly angers me, as their silver-tongued calls for patriotism and loyalty while they hide behind their fortifications is utterly maddening, if a bit heavy-handed.<br/><br/>But it's also in the depiction of the battlefield where the film really gets me. The utterly alien landscape of the trenches at night, as the patrol scampers about, is a suitable reflection of the totally inhuman trial that will soon dominate the film. Combined with the claustrophobic tracking shots through the trenches, as well as that great pan during the actual attack, this is as well-directed a film as Kubrick ever made. And that final scene, when the soldiers realize what they have lost and what war has done to them, is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Simply one of the finest anti-war films ever made."
"Det_McNulty","9","1","2","8 April 2008"," For Those Who Say That Kubrick Couldn't Show Compassion
","With his former directional effort, The Killing, Stanley Kubrick had established his talent as both a storyteller and visionary. In 1957 Kubrick released Paths of Glory, an anti-war film which was instantly banned in France and Spain for its negative portrayal of the military during World War 1. Nevertheless, the director has reportedly claimed that the film is not ""anti-war"", but is ""anti-authoritarian ignorance."" While not receiving much attention at the time of its release critical acclaim grew with each passing year and today it is often ranked among ""the greatest films ever made."" Director Steven Spielberg has even stated that it is indefinitely his favourite work from the late icon.<br/><br/>When people study Kubrick's filmography in retrospect there is a particular criticism which nearly always rears its ugly head; this being the accusation that Kubrick was incapable of capturing emotion or providing a sense of empathy towards his characters, therefore distancing the viewer. I for one consider Kubrick's detached manner intentionally in context with the nature of his work. Even so, this definitive anti-war outing is far from echoing the cold demeanour of those endless, symmetric corridors in The Shining and yet it still contains the theme of struggling to cope with a greater force.<br/><br/>Starring macho action star Kirk Douglas, the film boasts the greatest performance of the actor's lengthy career. It was the performance which developed the foundations of a two-film companionship between actor and director, the latter work being Spartacus. Douglas defied expectations, performing as a disillusioned French unit commander in WW1. His character's idealistic duty is to protect the human rights of three men who have been unjustly accused of cowardice and are consequently facing firing squad execution as an example for those who retreat while in the warzone. Douglas' performance is an acting showcase, displaying the utmost degree of empathy and moral insight.<br/><br/>Much of the narrative is spent with Douglas defending the three men facing death. Kubrick's trademark tracking-shot was introduced and utilised to the best extent during the scenes of trench warfare. The technique adds an enclosed, claustrophobic impression of unease. The meticulous manner of direction is directly impressionable and acts as a method of submerging the viewer in a story of delusions, ignorance and more than anything else, arrogance.<br/><br/>If you are yet to of seen this film, go and grab yourself a copy right away as you are almost certain to be blown away at the hands of an auteur. Plus, it beats the noticeably dated All Quiet on the Western Front any day, and you are unlikely to find a story with a more benevolent and worthy conclusion."
"Terrydoodle","Null","1","2","31 March 2008"," The first great proto film of Stanley Kubrick
","Paths of Glory is the first great proto film of Stanley Kubrick. You can see elements of his style taking hold and developing. The incredible use of set and location, the long tracking shots of the trenches, war, and execution march. His unrelenting storytelling style compared to Hollywood genre conventions; And of course his ending.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory works both as a great human drama and an anti war film. The most mesmerizing moments are when Kurt Douglas' Colonel Dax is defending his men's lives from what he clearly views as an unjust decision. He pours his emotions onto the floor of the ballroom where the court marshal is being held and the French generals put him down every chance they get. While the film's most personal moments are the scenes of the soldier's reactions to their own captivity and their impending doom, they don't want to die. Lastly, and most important, is the film's closing scene.<br/><br/>The ending, to me, has to do with the theme of the young and the powerless sent to die by leaders warriors and generals who themselves do not fight on the battlefield and who do not die in the cold night. There is a world war I poem of amazing power called Dulce Et Decorum Est (which is the first part of a Latin phrase Dulce Et Decorum Est Pa Patria Morie) which means it is sweet and proper to die for one's country. Here are these men, obviously men, who are fighting and dying because they are told they are fighting for France against the enemy Germany. And then a woman is brought out on stage. One of the ENEMY, who can't even speak French. And at first the audience is thinking ""oh my god, they're going to rape her"" etc. They're going to force her to strip and Colonel Dax is going to have to step in. And then Kubrick does something amazing. She begins to sing a German song. The soldiers don't understand, but they don't need to because the message is clear. She's human... so are they... and they begin singing with her realizing ... why are we killing these people... and yet even with that realization... it's not enough because war goes on and they have to go fight because their leaders tell them to. I think it's a similar statement about how far man can go that is made in 2001 but in a much more compact shorter scene that is cut short because... well... they have orders to return to the front.<br/><br/>There are so many interpretations of the ending but a couple of things bare mind, first of all, the young woman singing the song eventually became Christian Kubrick, his wife of many, many years, they stayed married until his death. When she called Stephen Spielberg to tell Stephen of Stanley's death, Stephen was having a couple of people over for a dinner party, none of them involved with film, and he wanted to show a scene to celebrate Kubrick's life and he chose this scene, a great decision. Special thanks to Jeremy Lum."
"hnt_dnl","10","1","2","27 March 2008"," Perhaps the truly greatest war film of all time
","I wish we could give a film more than a 10 out of 10 rating. Because PATHS OF GLORY is one of the very few films that I'd give an 11! It is perfection. Plain and simple. It is a bare bones film, very short, and cuts to the chase. There are several fairly long scenes, yet none of them seem long and there are no wasted words, thoughts, or moments in any of the scenes. They are all perfect. Perfection is maybe an overused word, but not in this film. Directed by the great Stanley Kubrick and coming out in a great year of films 1957, this could very well be Kubrick's true greatest accomplishment.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory takes place during WWI, but is it a war film? Debatable. It's about a regiment of French soldiers on the front lines forced into an impossible, unwinnable situation to take the 'Ant Hill' by their power-mad regimental commander General Mireau (played to 100% cold, selfish, heartless perfection by George Macready). The attack is unsuccessful (as expected) and Mireau literally wants blood for the failure (he even orders fire upon his own men for cowering back to the trenches during the unwinnable battle). The battle itself, while extremely short for a large scale assault, is technically executed to perfection with long-view wide, tracking shots of all the action so you can see everything at once. And in the middle of all of this action is brigade commander Colonel Dax (played by Kirk Douglas in truly the most impressive performance of his legendary career). Colonel Dax orders his men to return back to battle, but to no avail. He finally sees it as unwinnable as his men.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Mireau wants multiple executions to take place, but 'compromises' so that one man from each company in the front line battalion will be court-martialed for cowardice. 3 soldiers Paris, Ferol, and Arnaud (played by Ralph Meeker, Tim Carey, and Joe Turkel) are chosen for various reasons (one by lot, one b/c his unpopularity, and one b/c he knew of his company commander's part in a soldier's death). Col. Dax, a lawyer in the civilian world, represents the men. The trial is pure, military hogwash. Dax isn't allowed to present crucial information that could exonerate the men and the tribunal looks like they have already decided the men are guilty before the trial even starts. Dax has one final chance to save the men as he is given critical information by the gunnery commander that Mireau ordered him to fire upon his own men. Dax takes it to Mireau's superior General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) in hopes of getting a stay of execution for the men, but to no avail.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of great, memorable characters and moments that stay in the minds of the viewer long after the film is over: (1) the cockroach scene, (2) two men discussing how they would prefer to be killed (slowly or quickly, with a knife or with a gun), (3) the company commander (in charge of the execution) who wrongly chose Pvt.Paris to be tried apologizing to him before the fateful execution and Paris nodding his head in forgiveness, (4) Dax telling off Broulard calling him a degenerate and that he can go to hell. (5) And finally, there's the great ending, perhaps the most memorable moment of the film where a captured German girl (Stanley Kubrick's real life wife) who sang that melancholy tune that the French soldiers hummed to in sadness as she sang it, perhaps thinking about their wrongly executed comrades in arms.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory says a lot about not only the military, but also society itself. There are haves and have nots, those who rule and those who are ruled, the privileged and the lower class. It's a war film in the sense that it accurately depicts the grittiness and grunge of it. It's an anti-war film in the way it portrays the lunacy of parts of it, like the unwinnable attack on the Ant Hill that would have had no meaningful outcome on the war itself. It's a social film in the way it clearly delineates the high-ranking military (the establishment) and the rank-and-file soldiers (the working class). It's an anti-establishment film in that it portrays the high-ranking officers as power-hungry, self-absorbed fat cats who only want recognition. Who's the real enemy? Those we fight against or those who we thought are supposed to be on our side protecting us, but literally sending us to our slaughter to gain promotions? But most importantly, it's a human film b/c it accurately depicts all different types of human beings, each one delineated clearly so that the viewer can either relate to b/c we know that's how we would act or react or either abhor and despise b/c we'd like to believe that we, or no human being, could possibly act that way."

","It's WWI in France and Colonel Kirk Douglas is ordered to take an enemy position named Ant Hill. But his soldiers are not at full strength and he will not be given any support except for some preliminary bombing. When the attack fails, his superior General is furious so he orders 3 men to be chosen for court martial with the charge of cowardice. Douglas has no choice but to obey, but since he is also a lawyer, he insists on defending the men.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is a great film. Director Stanley Kubrick made this film in 1957 and it shows glimpses of what he would do later on with Dr. Strangelove and all of his other films. His point of view, showing the injustice of war, is brought out very strongly and clearly in the story of these men and their commanding officers. Later on, Kubrick's films seemed to become colder and colder with the humans being treated like robots. But not in this film. Every character, even those with small parts, is clearly defined and sympathetic. Kubrick's philosophy, although not fully developed, is evident in this film. He subsequently filmed Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove and Full Metal Jacket, all films that dealt with war.<br/><br/>A great film which deserves to be seen."

","Not really an anti-war film but a film showing the callousness and stupidity of military leaders.  The film takes place in France during WWI.  Col.

Things go terribly wrong and three men are (unjustly) courtmartialed for cowardice.  Dax tries his best to save them.<br/><br/>Very strong, depressing drama.  Even though its over 40 years old it still shocks you.  Stanley Kubrick's direction is just great especially during the attack sequence and another part near the end.  All the acting is just great--especially Douglas, Macready and Adolphe Menjou.  Script is just fantastic and the movie never strikes a false note...even when you think there might be a (somewhat) happy ending the movie pulls the rug out from under you.  I can't really say I enjoyed the picture...but it makes its point.  The last sequence with the girl singing is really strange--I'm guessing Kubrick added it so the audience wouldn't be TOO depressed!<br/><br/>This was a bomb in 1957 (even though critics loved it).  It was too ahead of its time.  It's now regarded as a classic--as it should be.  A definite must-see...just brace yourself."

","It is interesting to read the range of reviews regarding ""The Paths of Glory"".  While some consider it a classic, others decry it as mediocre or much worse.  As far as I am concerned it is indeed a great movie.  Upon its release, the New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther,  was highly critical of it... for among other reasons, that the actors do not have French accents and are more likend to WW2 GI's.  For me the message of this movie is not dependent on French accents,nor is it a microscopic view of one war time incident.  It goes to the very heart of moral ambiguity, personal ambition, and rationalizations that enter into so many political and war time decisions.  The dialogue, acting, directing, and characterizations make this a true classic.  Being filmed in black and white evokes the somber and realistic theme of this movie.<br/><br/>I consider this to be Stanley Kubrick's and Kirk Douglas' masterpiece.  It is a film that only gains in stature as the years pass.  I rate it a ten.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas, Adolph Menjou, Ralph Meeker, and the rest of the cast are superb.  Wayne Morris is especially fine as the repentant officer who regrets the choices he made."

","This film has good intentions, and as an anti-war film in 1957, I'm sure it was groundbreaking. However, in 2007, it doesn't hold up. Stanley Kubrick is a genius and one of my favorite directors. So what's the problem? Simply put - the accents of the actors. American actors, a lot of them from New York, are playing French soldiers in World War I. I just can't get past their wooden and sometimes unintentionally funny delivery of lines - ""Youse don' understand, faddah, I don' wanna die!"".<br/><br/>If this movie were made today, not only would they cast French actors, but it's likely it would be in French with subtitles, even if it were made by a US studio. Even casting British actors would have been better; somehow it's easier for us Americans to accept British accents for French, Romans, and all sorts of other nationalities.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate because I can see that the direction, cinematography, screenplay, and all the rest are top-notch. But the film as a whole failed me."

","The one and only reason that I wanted to see this movie was to see Tim Carey.A few articles have stated he was somewhat of a character and that Kirk Douglas became annoyed with him more than once during the filming of this picture.Seems as though Carey was accused of scene stealing especially during the long dragged out firing squad sequence.His waling's and carrying on seemed to bother the star of the movie.For that reason when Douglas was shown scowling while Carey was protesting during his death march it made me laugh,I figured he really was angry at Carey.In all fairness the scene stealing rap on Carey doesn't seem correct.Check out the distance from headquarters to the spot where the prisoners are going to be shot,it looks like a quarter of a mile.Some guy that feels he hasn't done anything wrong is taking a long walk to drums seeing those death posts draw closer oh so slowly,it's not surprising if he was beside himself.Without Carey's moaning the scene would start to fringe on boring.This movie gets a high rating from many persons even though it seems like the actions of the commanding officer go unexplained by the movie makers.Maybe I missed something but this is what puzzles...first the commanding officer states that the lost of one of his men is far more important than any promotion and he seems very serious about it.By the time he does an inspection of the trenches he is an unexplained different person,all business,without feeling for the battle weary.From there he gets worse,still unexplained he wants victory at all cost,which means bombing your own men.Then when accused of this he says it never happened.Seems as though not too much thought was given to this character,to be the bad guy is one thing,to show three faces and not stand behind any of them is another."

","Observe how simple percussion is used in Kubrick's Paths of Glory to build tension. Three men creep out in the dead of night on a reconnaissance mission. There is only sparse moonlight to guide them, brief flares illuminated the corpse strewn battlefield. The uneven bass drum beats sound again and again, while the pattering of the snare mimics their slow progress, sliding over dirt and blood and mud. Then with a sudden cut and a clattering of the cymbals, a Lieutenant has killed his own man in a fit of cowardice. Later, the slow and steady drum beats again lead us through the progressions of an execution by firing squad. It is painfully slow and elaborate, sacrificial like, the way they determinedly prop up the wounded body and dehumanise him. We wait agonisingly for reprieve, for the general to intervene, and do not get it. <br/><br/>This film is concerned with two distinct worlds. One is the bureaucratic higher ups, the generals and commanding officers who remain spotless in the face of such atrocities. The others are those nameless soldiers who are treated as a number; 100 yards for 1000 men. As we track General Mireau through the grimy trenches, he remains quite physically and mentally distant from the men he so heroically commends. They flinch as explosions nearly breach the trenches every now and again; Mireau hardly notices, because he will be soon back in the comfort of his office. Georg Krause captures the setting in all its drab, freezing and gray misery; there are no fancy angles, no playing with depth of field. One shell-shocked soldier does not respond quite as heroically as he would like, looking off camera as he shows symptoms of cracking his hard persona. He is reprimanded and dismissed; soldiers are not meant to act this way. <br/><br/>One man ventures into both world, the leading figure in Colonel Dax, played with steel by Kirk Douglas. He is the absolute moraliser, heroic and brave, but he is only one man. In an extended sequence, he leads the regiment over the trenches and into a suicide mission. The camera tracks him in a wide angle as he brandishes a small pistol and futilely blows a whistle, easily outmatched by the explosions of blood and dirt and shrapnel, as dead bodies crumple all around and bullets hiss pass ears with a metallic sound. Mireau watches from afar with binoculars, bewildered by why they are retreating. Dax knows these horrors, and they are the basis for that great impassioned monologue in the courthouse, where he pleads to superiors who have not experienced the trenches to spare these 'cowardly' men. The only brave man is a dead man, the prosecutor snaps. They are of a different world; no better visualised than that long tracking shot of Broulard which displays the lavish dance and banquet in stark contrast to what we have witnessed. These are the men who easily rationalise the lives of soldiers and calculate as if they were empty faces, the men who think of promotions, not lives spared. <br/><br/>Dax is far too conventional for Kubrick's taste, which is perhaps why his protests and actions are ultimately unavailing. He is stoic in his futility, unblinking and all seeing - whereas the camera always presents Mireau from the outside, immaculately dressed and self-important (notice the lovely little protest he at first gives, then easily is swept aside: ""What is my ambition compared to that? My men come first...""), we are immersed in Dax's POV. He sees every tremble and flinch of the soldiers he commands, and does not want to go ahead with this mission. He does find a small consolation; he forces Roget to face his crimes, and in doing so exposes a rather meek apology, too little too late. <br/><br/>A rabble of soldiers gather in a bar. They are drunk and rowdy, and even more so when a teary and clearly uncomfortable German girl is ushered onto stage from them to ogle. They jeer and make lewd requests, ridiculing her for her gender and nationality. This is a young Christiane Kubrick who delivers a heartbreaking scene; she stutters but somehow manages to quell the noise, urging them to hum along to a German folk song. Here is a brief moment of shared humanity. Oh how swiftly it will be taken away."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","3","15 July 2015"," Paths of Anti-War
","Paths of Glory is one of those films that really makes you hate war and everything that comes with it. It's a great film that perfectly portrays the many horrors that go along with war. But it doesn't just address the bloodiness and violence, it looks at the psychological imbalance that it gives people during an awful period of time. World War I wasn't perhaps as terrible as the second World War, but it still was a gruesome time for several countries.<br/><br/>What I think Kubrick nailed the most about this film was the displaying the vast differences between the colonels and generals personalities to the horrific mindsets that the soldiers have going into a battle. Really, the whole plot of the film is quite ridiculous, but this type of stuff very well may have happened. The film captured the utter loudness that battles create, and even leaves out the music when it needs to. I love a good score but I liked that the battles weren't filled with a bombastic score, rather just the sounds of explosions. I didn't know much about the film, so I was shocked at first to find out it was more than just an epic war film. It was more a look at the trials of innocent men and the sort of dehumanization of them. Kubrick does it well in his later films but his approach to Paths of Glory proved to be different. He implements more emotion and sadness to his characters. This is all evident in the famous final scene, which is probably my favorite of the entire film.<br/><br/>So yes the film does become more of a courtroom drama than I expected, but it's a different kind of war film that works. It's a film that deals much more with the political side of war than the battles. But in reality both sides of war are equally as devastating. Especially when you have a story as brutal and emotionally draining as Paths of Glory.<br/><br/>+Imbalance of psychological viewpoints <br/><br/>+Music hits when it needs to<br/><br/>+Kubrick's meticulous directing <br/><br/>+Emotional <br/><br/>8.0/10"

","I just saw this film again on AMC for maybe the 35th time. It is truly a work of art! Perhaps the most blistering anti-war movie ever made. Great script, great photography, great acting (with the exception of George Macready occasionally chewing the scenery). Kirk Douglas was at his considerable best here. Menjou and Meeker were also terrific. Richard Anderson gives a great little performance as the consummate, suck-up weasel and a nice job by Wayne Morris. So many scenes stand out for me. Of course, there's Douglas' little speech about apologizing to Menjou. I also love the scene where Douglas toys with Morris about heading up the firing squad and, after Morris asks to be excused from the task, Douglas' sneering ""Request denied. You've got the job. It's all yours."" Only about 90 minutes long, this film grips you from the very beginning and never lets go. The final scene never fails to touch me profoundly. IMO, one of the greatest films ever made!"
"bob_meg","10","1","3","30 July 2011"," Riveting, chilling in its intensity, and shockingly relevant
","I generally don't like war movies, even anti-war movies. To me, they're like Westerns, most of which fall back on the same tired tropes we've seen a billion times.<br/><br/>Then, while browsing Kubrick's impressive back catalog, I stumbled on ""Paths of Glory,"" and was transfixed for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Simply put, this film has it ALL and touches on almost as wide a scope: right and wrong, moral and spiritual hypocrisy, the futility of conflict...there's not a root cause of human suffering this film doesn't attack, and splendidly. But, it's never heavy handed, never verbose or pedantic.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the story, it's very simple to sum up. A glory-mongering general (MacReady) accepts an offer by a superior (Adolphe Menjoe) to seize a literally impossible-to-take target during the WWI France/Germany conflicts, then tries to blame the mission's failure on three almost randomly picked scapegoats in the trenches. The sentence? Death by firing squad for cowardice. Douglas is the commanding colonel who sees through MacReady and Menjoe's motives and fights like hell to save the lives of his troops. Douglas is as fine as he's been, but MacReady and Menjoe steal a lot of the thunder, as two of the most inhuman monsters you'll see on screen. The scene after the execution where they discuss how well the execution of the three martyrs was carried out, as they dine on a gourmet lunch at Menjoe's exquisite château, is nauseating but all too true-to-life. Oh, did I forget to mention one of the victims had a skull fracture and was barely awake when shot? MacReady's character sadistically directs the man to be revived seconds before being shot. ""The general wants him conscious,"" his flunky explains.<br/><br/>Many mention the battle scenes in this film, and rightly so. Fot the time period, and the budget, their immediacy and coldness will take your breath away, and that's all Kubrick. There are actually several stunning camera moves here, not the least of which is a long tracking shot of Douglas walking through the trenches, the dismay and disgust on his face palpable, as the bodies writhe on either side of his like a human sea.<br/><br/>War is about money (as is just about everything, sadly) and its accorded power, and that's one thing that hasn't and probably won't change, long before this film was released in 1957. Kubrick puts this all in our face without any tired clichés, preaching, or hubris. Just phenomenal and utterly perfect."
"ajs-10","9","1","3","9 July 2011"," Classic Kubrick!
","I am a bit of a fan of Stanley Kubrick and have decided to try and watch as many of his films as I can. This one was showing one afternoon and so it was duly recorded for a viewing at a later date. That later date came around today. Set during World War I, this film tells the story of a French Colonel who ends up with the unenviable task of defending three of his soldiers who are charged with cowardice.<br/><br/>Colonel Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, cares very much about his troops and tries to do his best for them. When ordered by General Mireau to attack a well defended position called the 'Ant Hill', he follows orders, but the enemy proves too strong and his troops have to fall back. One platoon is trapped in the trenches and the General orders his own artillery to open fire on them. This order is not obeyed despite the General's threats to the officer commanding the artillery battery. After this debacle, and wishing to make an example, the General, along with his colleague, General Broulard, agrees to Court Martial three men for cowardice. Colonel Dax decides to act as their defence, but is not hopeful of a good outcome. The penalty for this crime is death by firing squad. The three men are selected by their unit commanders. At this point I'll leave my brief summary, I won't tell you the outcome because I don't want to give away too much.<br/><br/>An excellent example of the filmmaker's art, I couldn't find fault with this film. It may look dated by today's standards, but given the era it was made and the budget available, it's a fine job. Also guilty of doing a great job was Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, he really stands out as a quality actor in this one. Also worthy of note were Ralph Meeker as Cpl. Philippe Paris, Adolphe Menjou as Gen. George Broulard and George Macready as Gen. Paul Mireau.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is well done, that is with one exception. The sound in the court martial scene is terrible, it's a big room and I found the echo of the voices quite an annoyance. That aside though, I thought the anti-war message got through loud and clear and you are left with no doubt who the enemy really is. I really enjoyed watching this film and I can recommend it very highly.<br/><br/>My Score: 9.1/10"

","Rated number 50 in the IMDb.com greatest movies of all time , Paths of Glory is not a film that i was particularly familiar with. I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrik and i love Kirk Douglas so it should come as no surprise that i really enjoyed this movie. When a group of soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them. I love the look of this film. You can pretty much tell this has Stanley Kubrick's fingerprints all over it. It asks uncomfortable political and social questions and you can't help but be angry at authority which is a thread that runs through a lot of Kubrik's movies. The acting is superb , especially from a super confident Kirk Douglas and like the fact that this does not have a sickly sweet outcome to it which was so common with war films made in the 40's and 50's. It's a film that spits in the face of authority while the common man suffers and i loved it."
"Supachewy","9","1","3","11 December 2010"," Kubrick's Genius at Work
","The war drama Paths of Glory is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Kirk Douglas and George Macready. The film takes place in 1916 France.<br/><br/>General Paul Mireau (Macready) is ordered by a superior general to take an area known as the Anthill in his sector which is currently under German control. At first Mireau declines because the mission is impossible but when the superior general says how he may be considered for a promotion Mireau goes through with the action. Mireau personally supervises Colonel Dax's (Douglas) attack on the German controlled territory but when Dax's troops do not even make it out of the French trenches Mireau orders that the French artillery fire on their own men to motivate them. When the battery Captain refuses to do so without a written order the general does not pursue the option but instead decides to try three men from under Dax's command for cowardice which is punishable by death.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson is superb. The characterization of General Mireau and Colonel Dax are both great and by the end of the film you know the two for exactly who they are. Also you get quite attached to the men that are tried for cowardice and hope for them all the way to the end. What makes this film different from most other war films is that there is no action in it after the attack on Anthill. It is part courtroom drama as well and this film is much more than it appears. Also I absolutely loved the ending which featured Stanley Kubrick's future wife, the only female in the entire film and his wife until he died in 1999.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is often called one of the greatest directors of all time and this film shows why he is. The shot that I absolutely loved was a long shot of General Mireau travelling the trenches and greeting several soldiers on his path before the attack on Anthill. Nothing makes me happier than seeing a beautiful long shot like that, and by long I mean that it lasts for a long time not that it is far away. Also when Colonel Dax is on the battlefield the shots of him are absolutely mesmerizing, the fact that this film was completely ignored by the Academy Awards is just a shame on their part. Throughout the film there are plenty of more wonderful shots, one is towards the end with a bunch of soldiers in front of a large building, I won't describe what is happening because it is a spoiler. I personally believe that Kubrick is the greatest director of all time and obviously that is arguable but I believe everyone who respects film understands that Kubrick is a genius and this film is just one of the many examples why.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas gives a very powerful performance in this film. He is very strong and military like and deserves much praise for his performance. When he gives his strongest performance is when he confronts General Mireau or General Broulard at the end of the film. Also, when Douglas is leading his men on the battlefield he does a very good job. The only problem with Douglas's character is that he is kind of one dimensional. He is a man who believes in justice and truth, not in politics. Truly a man that a person can look up to. But that is basically it, but that is all he needs to be because even though he is the lead the supporting characters take up a large part of the eighty seven minute film. This is the first of two films that Douglas works with Kubrick, the other being Spartacus, and the two are a great team.<br/><br/>George Macready also gives a great performance except his character is the exact opposite of Douglas's, he is a selfish, despicable man. But Macready plays the part extremely well. Whenever him, Colonel Dax, General Broulard, or all of them together all three of them give their best performances. The look of Macready's eyes is what really makes his performance so powerful, his stare can break a person's will. Also, when Macready was at the battle of Anthill ordering the artillery to fire on his own men his devious performance was fantastic as well.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 9/10, it is another Kubrick classic. Everything about it was great, and what I love about Kubrick's films is that he never uses music to tell the audience how to react to what is happening on the screen. He lets them feel how they want to feel. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war or courtroom dramas. It definitely is a must see just for Kubrick's direction."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","3","8 February 2009"," A fine, uncompromising war film
","Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" wasn't much of a success at the time of its release but it has proved its worth over the years and is today remembered as a classic. The film is set during WWI and revolves around an attempt by French troops to carry out a near-impossible mission handed down to them by their glory-hungry superiors.<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one but you'd be advised to forget about the fact that these guys are supposed to be French. That being said, Adolphe Menjou & George Macready are convincing as the glory-seeking generals while Kirk Douglas delivers a fine performance in the film's pivotal role. The rest of the cast is acceptable but not really worth noting.<br/><br/>Kubrick's direction, even at this early stage in his career, shows a master's touch. The battlefield & trench scenes are particularly well done while Kubrick comes up with memorable visuals throughout the film. Gerald Fried, who was Kubrick's go-to guy for music at the time, contributes a score that deftly supports Kubrick's script and visuals.<br/><br/>In the end, while the film's acting and technical merits are indeed notable, it is the story that truly makes the film stand out. It defies expectations and incisively examines the supposed glory of war and the price paid for it. I wholeheartedly recommend the film although I think that the current top-50 IMDb rating is a bit generous, particularly when you consider that it is rated above ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" & ""A Clockwork Orange""."
"tracyfigueira","10","1","3","20 September 2008"," the greatest film ever made
","Now that ""The Dark Knight"" has toppled ""The Godfather"" from the #1 spot in the IMDb Top 250, only to be toppled in turn by ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" might I be permitted to nominate this shamefully overlooked Stanley Kubrick classic from 1957? Made before he had perfected his unique signature, it has a raw, semidocumentary, almost cinema verite quality that distinguishes it from the more distant, formal films of Kubrick's maturity. Just compare it to ""Full Metal Jacket,"" made exactly thirty years later. The film is short (less than an hour and a half) and there's no soundtrack aside from the relentless drum rolls. Kirk Douglas, whom I have often found hammy in other films, is perfect here as Colonel Dax, the sole voice of moral rectitude in a tale of double dealing, casual cruelty and Machiavellian intrigue. He's well-matched by his opponents: the deceptively suave Adolphe Menjou (the only Frenchman in the film) and the deranged Charles Macready. Interestingly, Menjou was one of Hollywood's premiere red-baiters, and played a key role in driving Chaplin from America. He plays a similar character here, and one wonders if he appreciated the irony. The black-and-white photography adds to the film's no-frills atmosphere. This film was considered so inflammatory that Kubrick was forbidden to shoot in France, and instead it was filmed in Germany, with German policemen doubling as French soldiers. ""Paths of Glory"" was a commercial failure, but it led to Kubrick's second collaboration with Douglas, 1960's ""Spartacus,"" which gave Kubrick the box-office clout he needed to make his later masterpieces. Without this film there might never have been a ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""The Shining."""
"JuguAbraham","8","1","3","3 August 2008"," Rich in content and relevance
","Here's a significant black and white film from that only a small section of Kubrick's fans discuss. Here's is a movie made five decades ago that film goers might find relevant even to this day. It was not a runaway box office success. It's an anti-war film that has a political relevance for any country that pushes its foot soldiers to fight suicidal battles for the glory of politicians and generals. And the most surprising element of the film is that the film loosely describes events that actually transpired in France. Consequently this 1957 film was not shown in France until 1975, and in Spain until 1986.<br/><br/>Set in Europe during the First World War, the movie is based on a novel by Henry Cobb. After the book made an impact on film director Stanley Kubrick, the film rights of the book. That act tells you a lot about Kubrick! Cobb's novel describes a historical event that took place because some French generals decided to derive glory for themselves during the war by pushing soldiers in the trenches to attempt a suicidal attack on an enemy position. Once the decision is taken by the generals, the orders are passed down the pecking order, from general to colonel, from colonel to major, from major to corporal. The suicidal strike does take place, some die, and many fall back under the fire from enemy lines.<br/><br/>That's only the framework of the story that Kubrick used to build a film that asks inconvenient questions of the viewer. Kubrick and Cobb underline the difference between the generals who are waltzing with their spouses while the poor foot soldier is worried if he will ever see his wife again. Those in power enjoy, while the poor are pawns caught in the games the powerful play to bring glory to themselves.<br/><br/>Kubrick's taut screenplay shows interaction between a general and the foot soldiers in the trenches. Three of the soldiers the general chooses to speak to are the very same individuals who are made the scapegoats at the military court and shot to death for no fault of theirs. Are all of us who do not enjoy economic freedom, slaves to a system that is not fair and just? The content of this film somehow anticipates Kubrick's and Kirk Douglas' next project, Spartacus, a film that was not planned at the time Paths of Glory was being made.<br/><br/>The film has shades of existential colors. One of the condemned men compares his life and the life of an insect: ""See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive. It'll have more contact with my wife and child than I will. I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive."" At several points in the film, the screenplay underlines the reality that a junior ranking officer can never blow the whistle on a senior officer's misdeeds and get away with it. The ending of the film that Kubrick was toying with was a happy onebut the lead actor Kirk Douglas prevailed and made the ending a philosophical and a tragic one. This is perhaps one of the few examples in cinema history when an actor contributed so positively to a film. The film with a happy ending could have made more money but wouldn't have been comparable in merit and strength as this one.<br/><br/>The viewers today can approach the film as an intelligent anti-war film in the league of Terrence Mallick's The Thin Red Line. Yet, remove the element of war and what happens in Paths of Glory could happen in an office, in a university, or on the playing field.<br/><br/>If we study the film closely the film it is basically a story of men. But the men are always thinking about women. And a woman's (a German, a representative of the army they were fighting) song in a dehumanizing situation transforms the leering soldiers into men recalling their wives, mothers and daughters. The dehumanizing situation of the woman is not far removed from those of the three innocent soldiers killed by a firing squad. The lady who sang the song became Mrs. Kubrick.<br/><br/>Philosophically the film asks the viewer whether all the various paths of glory in life lead to the grave. And as the Thomas Gray poem that provided the title of the book suggests: death is a great equalizer. The tragic twist at end of the movie underlines this dark facet of life Many critics have praised the performances in this film. Ralph Meeker and Timothy Carey as two of the condemned men and that fascinating actor, Adolph Menjou and George Macready as the Generals provided sterling performances. (Macready's performance in Tora! Tora! Tora! was probably a notch better) Kirk Douglas had a role that any good actor could have taken advantage ofmy guess is that had Richard Burton been finally cast in the role, as Kubrick initially planned, the film would have been richer. But then if Douglas was not there, we might have lost the tragic end of the film. (Douglas' finest acting credentials surfaced in my opinion in the little praised 1969 film of Elia Kazan called The Arrangement.) Paths of Glory is a film that never won an Oscar or a major film festival award. Yet, it marked the beginning of a series of great films by Kubrick. To Kirk Douglas' credit he is quoted as saying, way back in 1969 ""There's a picture that will always be good, years from now. I don't have to wait 50 years to know that; I know it now"" How true!"
"dougdoepke","Null","1","3","24 May 2008"," Casting a Long Shadow
","How well I remember the audience of 1958 sitting in stunned silence as the daring iconoclasm of the film washed over us like a bucket of cold water at a snoozer's convention. Post-war generations had seen nothing like its brutal honesty before. Instead, Hollywood had taught us that soldiers don't bawl like babies before being shot, that chaplains aren't part of a murderous war machine, that military justice really is about justice, and that generals however far removed are ultimately good and honorable men, (and that cameras always look away from execution scenes). Sure, the movie was not about our army, but the power of its message could not be missed, and no one from that era, having seen it, could again accept Hollywood's platitudes at face value. <br/><br/>Now, fifty years later, the film is still timely, having lost none of its power to illuminate. Thanks be to Kirk Douglas for taking a chance on an unproven Stanley Kubrick and getting Allied Artists to finance what was so clearly a non-commercial project. I suspect too, that it was at AA's insistence that Hollywood veterans be cast, even though the movie was shot to great advantage amidst the majestic settings of old Europe. Given the film's message, I think Kubrick would have preferred no-name principals, but then, who could have surpassed the oily charm of Adolphe Menjou's diabolical general, or the pathetic repulsiveness of Timothy Carey's sacrificial dog-face. (It's ironic that the part of the cowardly lieutenant went to an authentic war-hero, naval air-ace Wayne Morris, then only two years away from an untimely death.) This many decades later, I still have mixed feelings about the celebrated final scene. On one hand, it's so clearly manipulative (someone once called it a ""male weepie""), that I try to steel myself against its undeniable force; on the other, it's so superbly well done that the humming chorus of universal brotherhood never fails to move me, even after this many viewings. <br/><br/>Researchers digging into origins of 60's counter-culture should check out themes and characterizations of the screen-play, particularly Timothy Carey's social outcast and Fred Bell's absolutely stunning thirty seconds of emotional break-down. For this is one of the few films from the conformist Eisenhower era to cast a shadow forward in time and serve as a reference point for future generations. The film's abundant cynicism may no longer be as revealing as it once was, thanks to Vietnam. Yet the emotional honesty remains as fresh and compelling as ever in its search for a gut-level depiction of real human anguish. Above all, Kubrick's anti-war classic points toward a more civilized potential amidst the barbarities and passions of combat, whether French or American, and given present political realities, still has many lessons to offer."
"EUyeshima","10","1","3","5 May 2008"," Kubrick's Searing Indictment of Military Politics Still Startles and Resonates
","There have been many exceptional anti-war films throughout the years - Lewis Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"", Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" - but I doubt if there's been one as emotionally devastating and economically dramatized as Stanley Kubrick's searing 1957 classic indictment of military politics among the upper ranks of the French army during WWI. Running a scant 86 minutes, the movie wastes no time in showing the exploitation of military ranks by the French General Staff to participate in a suicide mission on the western front. The objective is to take over ""Ant Hill"", a German stronghold of no strategic importance to the French except to the ambitious General Mireau, who is given the incentive of a promotion if the attack is successful. It's oblivious from the outset that the chances of success are practically nil since the men in the trenches are battered and weak from a number of successful advancements into enemy territory. The conscientious Colonel Dax is handed the responsibility of leading the men, but it turns completely fatal due initially to the blunder of one commanding officer's orders and the dominant German forces. Desperate to avoid humiliation, Mireau transfers blame for the failure to the soldiers and accuses them of cowardice.<br/><br/>If Mireau had his way, one hundred men would have been publicly executed, but he is ordered to identify three men to be to be executed exemplarily to satisfy the blood thirst of the military command. Dax defends the three men at the court-martial hearing but appears doomed to failure by a kangaroo court. The rest of the story plays out in aching detail until the shattering conclusion. Although he is more famous for his larger-than-life portrayals like Vincent Van Gogh in Vincente Minnelli's ""Lust for Life"" or the title role in Kubrick's later ""Spartacus"", Kirk Douglas is no less mesmerizing in a comparatively subdues performance as Dax. In hindsight, it seems rather punitive that he never won a competitive Oscar. In a particularly poignant performance, Ralph Meeker, an even undervalued actor most famous for Robert Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly"", plays Corporal Paris, one of the three chosen to die specifically because his commanding officer wants to be rid of the only eyewitness to his act of drunken cowardice. With his distinctive facial scar, George Macready plays the fanatical Mireau with uncompromising fury, while Adolphe Menjou, in one of the last roles of a long career, plays the blatantly immoral General Broulard with a slyly sinister panache. It's no wonder the film was banned in France for nearly two decades. The 1999 DVD offers only the original theatrical trailer as an extra. Well beyond Kubrick aficionados, this remains essential viewing for anyone interested in classic cinema."
"Hitchcoc","10","1","3","16 February 2007"," Those Who Decide Should Fight
","I've often been Luke warm about Kirk Douglas. This, however, is a phenomenal movie. War is usually fought by people who have no say in what is happening. The despicable man who can send thousands to their deaths to get a military promotion is every bit as bad as the enemy being fought. We have a lot of that going on in this country. Those who choose war should fight it or send their own to fight it. This is ad much a story of how people treat each other as it is a war movie. We hand over power to a complex that sustains itself on the backs of those who never get to state their cases. The men chosen are done so in an arbitrary way, caught unawares and defenseless. Of course, religion plays a part in it too. We may die, but there is a reward for us. There are so many parallels to what happens to men in combat (the ambush, for instance) that these men become victims. Like someone said, so much war is fought over anthills. I have never felt so sorry for characters as I do for these because they are defenseless. The cockroach scene has stayed with me my whole life. It's the same basic premise as Galipoli (which came much later)."

From the opening to the ending, I was completely gripped by what I was watching on screen; in terms of 'you-are-there' war-reality, then the combat scenes in this film stand parallel to All Quiet On the Western Front, Stalingrad, Saving Private Ryan etc. There are echoes of Kubrick's later Full Metal Jacket at one point, and the generally anti-war, pacifist message in the film is certainly a powerful one that emotionally involves the spectator. Halliwell's Film Guide describes this as 'overpowering cinema', and I couldn't agree more; for the time this film was made, I don't think it could have been realised any more effectively!

I 1st saw it on late-nite TV, as a 'kid', and was quickly 'hooked'---no idea of who Kubrick was---simply captivated by the acting, realism, and sad truths of the politics of war.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas is superb, as the defender of French soldiers, who wisely refuse to be 'cannon-fodder', later accused of 'desertion', only to be put on trial, for their lives.<br/><br/>The film, for some reason, was handed to Kubrick and this is where he became known as 'Master-of-the-trenches', having several close-calls at being 'blown-up' while directing the many very chancy explosions characteristic of 'trench-warfare'.

","""Paths of Glory"", Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film was his first film in the anti-war genre, but not his last. Starring Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, the commander of a regiment in the French army who fall back on their orders because theirs is an impossible attack. Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) is a glory-seeking man who agreed to this attack regardless of the casualties it will cause, and when it all hits the fan, looks for anyone else to be the scapegoats. He and Gen. George Broulard (Adolph Menjou) tell Dax that he must select random men to execute for cowardice, but Dax talks him into only selecting three, and to allow him to defend them. (In civilian life, Dax was the best attorney in France.) All of the events of the film are an exercise in futility, and the entire film's strong anti-war stance is extremely effective.<br/><br/>This was one of the very few Kubrick films I had not seen (I think my last one is Spartacus) and I was extremely impressed. As with another early film of his, ""The Killing"", his intelligence, vision and burgeoning talent are so very apparent. I enjoyed seeing certain Kubrick trademarks in this film, (particularly the tracking shot which follows Douglas through the trenches) and the story really was a compelling one. Apparently he had to fight to get this film made, and found a strong ally in Douglas, who used his star power with Warner Brothers to get the job done. This is certainly a must-see for any Kubrick fan, and a worthwhile film to check out anyway. ""Paths of Glory"" does not have the wit or belly laughs of ""Dr. Strangelove"", or even the terror of ""Full Metal Jacket"", but it is a strong film with a strong story.

","Impassioned examination of military injustice during WWI.  Douglas must defend 3 prisoners wrongly accused of cowardice and sentenced to be hung. Menjou is powerful and convincing as a military higher up who believes Douglas cares only for a promotion.  Beautiful photography in the style of Ophuls contrasts plush life of higher officers with the hell of trench war. Some melodrama, but all in all it's much less sentimental and also less spectacle-oriented than most war films (including Douglas and Kubrick's later ""Spartacus"", which is a pompous bore).

"avik-basu1889","9","1","4","25 June 2016"," War, what is it good for?
","Adapted from Humphrey Cobb's novel of the same name, 'Paths of Glory' is generally regarded as Stanley Kubrick's first masterpiece. Kubrick's fascination with war is apparent if one explores his filmography. It is an issue that he tackled on multiple occasions throughout his filmmaking career. 'Paths of Glory' has to regarded as a very bold piece of work considering the uncompromising way in which the film critiques the concept of patriotism and the military as an institution which was a taboo concept during the 1950s.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, the screenplay co-written by Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson is uncompromising in its approach. Kubrick doesn't indulge in any form of subtlety. The characters are pretty much laid out in black & white. We instantly know who the good guys and who the bad guys are. He gives the antagonists some motivation for their actions, but never allows the viewer to have any sort of sympathy for them. As a matter of fact, 'Paths of Glory' plays out in a very similar fashion to the pro-war propaganda films made during WW2 in the way that it offers the viewer a clear distinction between the good and the bad, but while those films used this technique to champion patriotism and nationalism, 'Paths of Glory' does the opposite. Not just patriotism, Kubrick's film is an indictment on the inherent corruption in the institutional system of the military. Kubrick underlines Humphrey Cobb's opinions in his film through cynicism and a touch of dark comedy. Very interestingly the Germans are never seen in the entire film. The enemy here is war and the dehumanisation of living soldiers which is an inherent aspect of it.<br/><br/>'Paths of Glory' is masterfully directed. One can easily see Kubrick's presence in every shot of the film. He uses the characteristic tracking shot on numerous occasions. The sideways tracking shot of the soldiers marching ahead towards the German wire acts as a beautiful juxtaposition to the tracking shot in the bourgeois-esque scene in the dance hall where the camera follows Major General Georges Broulard walking in the background with the couples dancing in the foreground. Kubrick also juxtaposes the huge, opulent and aristocratic rooms in the army headquarters where the superior officers are stationed with the dirty and claustrophobic atmosphere in the trenches where the soldiers are stationed. Another thing that I noticed in the film was Kubrick's meticulous use of blocking. The actors move in very specific ways to beautifully depict the mental state of the characters. At times the blocking almost becomes a dance between the characters in the way Kubrick shoots them. Kubrick also uses the zooms quite extensively. Another important thing to mention will be the lighting. The cinematographer Georg Krause and Kubrick use shadows and contrast between the light and the darkness in the scenes beautifully. The shadows are artistically used to convey themes and moods in some scenes.<br/><br/>Colonel Dax is one of the very few characters in the whole of Kubrick's filmography who can be called a true 'hero'. He is idealistic, he is a man of convictions, and he stands by his troops. Kirk Douglas brings a sense of gravitas and likable charm to the character. He is understated when he needs to be understated, but also explodes when he needs to do the same. The presence of Kirk Douglas in this cynical film actually reminds me of another film which is Billy Wilder's 'Ace in the Hole' which is also a very cynical film and has another fantastic performance from Douglas, although the characters that he plays in both the films are completely different. I will give a mention to George Macready, Adolphe Menjou and Timothy Carey too for their solid performances.<br/><br/>Although 'Paths of Glory' is a cynical film, however it ends in the most poetic way. The final scene is heartbreaking and will make anyone melt with the humanity on show. It reminded me of 'Rashomon' where Kurosawa gives the viewer some hope in humanity after a whole film exploring the selfishness and narcissism of human beings. Actually Kubrick didn't want to include the final scene but was forced into doing it by Kirk Douglas. I have to say that last scene infinitely benefits the film. 'Paths of Glory' is truly great."

","This is one of the most powerful and moving anti-war films ever made.<br/><br/>When 3 soldiers refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superior officer decides to make an example out of them.<br/><br/>This movie is thoroughly engaging from start to finish. No parts felt too slow and no parts felt too fast. 88 minutes is a short running time but it is just the right length for this movie.<br/><br/>Kubrick was a genius filmmaker and this movie succeeds because of its simple yet very effective story. Its story discusses a very important issue and that's what usually makes a memorable and entertaining film to watch.<br/><br/>The ending scene which shows a woman singing in a bar sparked such a human empathy in me that it made me cry. It's quite a sad scene which can make anyone cry.<br/><br/>My only issue with this film is that since the combat scenes aren't violent, it doesn't paint an accurate description of battle. War movies involving combat need to be violent.<br/><br/>The fact that this is based on true events only makes the story more poignant. It's not one of the best films of the genre, but it's still pretty good. This is a must watch for all fans of Kubrick and the genre."
"donbrown-16800","9","1","4","7 August 2015"," Close to Home Anti-War Movie
","Is this not one of the best films that Stanley Kubrick has ever made This film was a pioneer in its time probably the most remarkable aspect of this film was its exposures of what you might call the monsters within and not particularly the anti war message itself. Two of the most stand out members of the cast for me are Adolphe Menjou and George Macready they are just superb. The message is our enemy can be at home not just in some far off battlefield and given what's going on these days with home grown extremism i think its very apt in today's world.<br/><br/>I think this film shows us about our misguided belief in the quest for glory. It shows us how politicians and military commanders are willing to sacrifice others in the name of their own self importance."
"polecat-1","Null","1","4","4 July 2002"," A vastly overrated dud
","The sentiments are no doubt very worthy, but since when can sentiments alone make a good film? I guess Kubrick's budget could not be stretched for a longer exposition, but how about a little more subtlety? The opening scene with the dialogue between the two generals, each with his own agenda, is so naively straightforward it would have been laughed offstage at a high school drama class performance. Menjou just about carries off his part by not being too serious about it, but Macready would certainly have benefited from a director who knew what he was after. Douglas is OK, but he is not given much to do, and what should have been his big scene - the court-martial - is so underwritten, one wonders if it was improvised over a cigarette between lunch and the afternoon shoot. Kubrick dots all the i's and crosses all the t's with an almost bizarre simple-mindedness: his hero is obviously heroic, his villains obviously villainous; he also has an honest corporal who annoys a rascally lieutenant who accidentally kills a heroic soldier. And he has the general's slippery aide, a matter-of-fact sergeant who is simply doing his job, and a whining coward who turns to religion. So much for characterization. OK, I will not carp about the trenches set being so cheap - by that time K. had not yet hypnotized Warner Bros. into giving him a carte-blanche for stretching the genius muscle, - but give me a break about that final scene. It has to be the lamest, cheapest banality ever committed to celluloid. I see the film is #30 on the list of the all-time greatest; all right, let me guess then: #1 must be Attack of the Clones."
"Angry_Arguer","6","1","4","27 August 2003"," Elaboration
","While Paths of Glory is certainly one of Kubrick's best (it certainly ranks above The Shining and Full Metal Jacket), it is only an elaboration on the darker aspects of Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front.  Such concepts as cowardice, insubordination, and prejudice are thrown in to keep things different, but Kubrick can't help hiding that fact.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas never was a particularly varied or useful actor (Michael Douglas only continued that tradition) and here he is his usual maniacal self, only now we are supposed to sympathize with him.  Talk about the impossible.<br/><br/>The camera is not as declarative as AQWF, but Kubrick takes some personal notes and tries to be one better through ""artistry"".  That doesn't quite cut it.<br/><br/>Overall, watchable understanding of war's insanity.  Better than MASH and most other examples, on the level of Catch-22.  4 out of 5 stars."
"the red duchess","8","1","4","15 August 2001"," Flawed, but frequently brilliant, Kubrick classic.(spoilers)
","'Paths of glory' is considered by many to be a Kubrick masterpiece, especially by those disenchanted with the later works, and their seeming abandoning of humanism.  'Paths' is a very humanist work, not so much an anti-war film as an anti-authoritarian film.  It is a timely work, an implicit critique of a 1950s, conformist America ruled by a military hero President.  It takes the idea of order - military order as a metonym for social order - and shows how it is paradoxically used to create an Absurdist universe, where a General fires on his own men, where drunken cowards are put in positions of life-determining power, where a man dies not for any logical reason but because he drew lots.  <br/><br/>In this way, the film is very much of its cultural time, the post-war world of the existentialists and the Theatre of the Absurd - the closing weeping at a song the soldiers don't understand can be seen as an equivalent to the Nietzchean laugh that closes Sartre's famous short story 'The Wall', a pointless affirmation of a universe where order creates disorder, and man must die, as these men will as they march to the Front in a few moments. <br/><br/>
This philosophical underpinning serves to reinforce the critique of Eisenhower's America, the cowing of men into mindless, slobbering beasts at the mercy of their capricious masters; an anti-Semitic world (something the Jewish Kubrick would have been responsive to); a world where the apparatus of law and culture, those great Enlightenment forces of humanism, join forces with the military to validate and conceal the profound subversion, by authority, of natural justice.  Visually, this is most powerfully expressed in the obscenely beautiful, symmetrical scene, where Saint-Auban, the army and the mansion behind him, reads out the death sentence.<br/><br/>
There are many pointers to the later Kubrick here, in particular the exciting use of cavernous interior space to alienate the individual from himself, his environment, his status, his fate, as well as to visualise a kind of mental deterioration or decadence, in this case the mind of the army, the State, the decadent West.  One must admire Kubrick's integrity in a vision of unremitting brutality - he sadistically tantalises us with possibilities of Hollywood-style redemption (the parodic religious symbolism - the mud on the barracks walls like three crosses, the floods of divine light pouring into the cell; the hopes of a deux ex machina when Bax finds about General Mireau's murderous intentions).  <br/><br/>With great subtlety, as he would do throughout his career, the camera, supposedly the viewer's guide to the truth, is put in the service of authority, leaving us with the near-impossible task of disentangling what it shows, how it moves (those awesome tracking shots moving at the behest of officers) and what it represents.  The scene where the army try to take the anthill, soldiers dying all over the place, literally unable to move, caught by a a freely, relentlessly mobile camera, like the generals urging them on, is an astonishing case in point. <br/><br/>And yet I don't think it's a totally successful Kubrick picture.  There are concessions to audience sensibilities - Mireau is punished - too late, but punished; the singing scene, though ultimately pointless, does affirm a humanity in a world Kubrick has shown has very little.  The caricatures of the Generals are too easy, if very funny, the case is too one-sided: how can we not sympathise with the innocent victims (although, being men, who must die anyway, they are not really innocent).  When Camus wanted to explicate existentialism in 'The Stranger', he chose a murderer.  Later Kubrick films would centre on paedophiles, rapists, criminals - it is how we cope with the moral ambiguities they throw up that true argument lies. <br/><br/>
Dax shows the possibility of integrity and human decency in such an absurd world.  Even here, through, Kubrick's intellect is not static.  Like must Kubrick heroes, Dax's unity, his sense of masculine power and capability, is diminished not by his defeat by  authority (his speech to Broulard means he remains morally powerful and unified for us), but by his Kubrickan split between his feelings as an individual, and his social (in this case, military) role.  When the condemned men walk to their deaths in that amazing scene of death-ritual (like 'Barry Lyndon', super-civilised Western society is underpinned by the most barbaric rites), Colonel Dax's monumental impassivity and his uniform, condemn the men and legitimise their death.  As Ionesco warns 'Arithmetic leads to Philology and Philology leads to Crime'."

"alexzhang2","5","1","6","13 January 2019"," Too Hollywood
","Your typical Hollywood film following the righteous and genuine Dax, the too typical American-styled hero, as he fights against the system of justice, represented by the cold and removed bureaucrat-officers, for his men, the simple and victimized soldiers. This sums up the entirety of the story: another sad one-man crusade against the evils of the ""system"": just another hero who has enough of a heart to do the right thing, enough of wit and bureaucratic standing to be able to, enough under his command to prove that he's that great leader of the people that we all want, and enough simplicity to make us identify with him as some genuine friend.<br/><br/>For me, the adjectives ""hollywood"" or ""hero"" comes way before ""anti-war"" or anything of the like. The characters were way too flat. There were way too many scenes at the chateau: apart from the night patrol and our heroic Dax charging across no-man's land with a shiny hand-pistol, the war was never developed as a scene. There were scenes of beautiful cinematography from time to time, especially the scene of Dax going through his soldiers, it was more absurd than anything else: the wondering eyes of the soldiers looking lackadaisically, the various things they were doing (that cigar), and the removedness we sense even from the eyes of our hero Dax.<br/><br/>In the end we see the soldiers in the tavern calling on the German girl, an exotic piece captured and up for display for the soldiers' entertainment, who does not communicate. She sings a folk song, and the soldiers join in, only humming: was it a song they knew also in French (or English) or did it ""speak"" to them through the language barrier on some beautiful universal thing called humanity? No. They were only humming because they were perhaps touched by the sincerity of the scene, they wanted to express some sort of response. Perhaps it was the world for the German girl, but was just another amusement for the French soldiers, a distraction that even Dax yielded to and a useful one as well as many of them would be dead the next day. Not so different from this film."

They have to retreat as they can't get to their objective, but their superiors are not very happy about it and decide to bring some of the soldiers to a military tribunal, accused of cowardice. If found guilty, the will be killed.<br/><br/>The movie offers a not very nice view of power and war, of how the ones that are on parties and eating nice food send the poor to fight and die, as no more and no less than expendable pawns. It shows how Dax and his men are dehumanized by their superiors, and how these superiors behave like spoiled children when things don't go their way. All very patriarchal, with even a dialogue where a superior talks to Dax in these exact terms: a superior is to soldiers as a father to children. Is patriarchy guilty of violence?<br/><br/>The acting is OK, a little bit of overacting typical to the era, and a couple of too long sequences. But the story is good, the direction sound and all the actors give their best.

","This is a very well made anti-war movie, however since the characters are all French I find Kirk Douglas' portrayal a real blight on the movie. An actor is supposed to do that act! Douglas just plays a modern (1950's) American guy trying to convince as a Frenchman from World War One with no hint of an accent. He comes across as overtly American, the sort who would be leading the invasion at Omaha Beach in WW2. In one scene he even quotes Franklin, an American Statesman - now no French Officer from WW1 would be quoting an American - he'd of course be quoting some Famous Frenchy, Voltaire for example. The movie does steer toward a powerful conclusion, I just wish that the central character was chosen on suitability not star power."

Higher command ordered Mireau to take the hill, Mireau obeys, devises a plan to take the hill, knowing that casualties will be high, and gives the order to move out. Some soldiers move out, then (without orders) retreat and some stay in the trenches. To get the soldiers to obey, Mireau even orders French artillery to deliberately shell the troops. What a mess. Of course, the attack fails. Mireau refuses to accept responsibility for the failed attack and blames the failure on the troops for refusing to obey orders. Mireau orders one hundred soldiers to be immediately executed for cowardice, but is persuaded to reduce that number to three. Three soldiers, each one an enlisted man, are selected. A court martial is quickly convened, finds the three soldiers guilty of cowardice in the face of the enemy. and sentence them to execution by firing squad. The next day the order os carried out. the movie attempts to depict the three soldiers as victims of an nasty and incompetent general who uses the court martial to cover his own incompetency. The movie tries to depict Mireau as the villain and the three soldiers as his hapless victims. Kirk Douglas stars as Colonel Dax, Mireau's chief of staff and the person responsible for leading the attack, who is the personification of righteous indignation. The movie fails to make a case against Mireau. At the court martial, one soldier admits that he never left the trench, another that he moved out only to the French barbed wire, and the third that he retreated without being ordered. The movie makes a case that the the three soldiers were afforded less than adequate due process but fails to make a case that Mireau was a villain. First, the troops refused to obey his orders. Second, selecting individual solders for collective punishment was standard practice at the time. Third. higher command knew that the attack would result in lots of casualties. Fourth, Colonel Dax, who was the officer placed in charge of the actual attack, failed to rally the troops. Fifth, Mireau was doing his job. Sixth, it was war. Seventh, Mireau's orders were lawful. Eighth, if anyone should have been assigned blame, it was Colonel Dax whoi harbored personal animus toward General Mireau.

When widespread hesitations occur on the front lines the general is furious and three randomly chosen soldiers are court-martialed and tried for cowardess, which has a penalty of death.

","Although ""Paths of Glory"" certainly makes a powerful statement about the horror, misery, and insanity of war, specifically the hellish conditions of the World War I trenches, it addresses an even broader theme concerning the arrogant abuse of power by extremely flawed individuals who sometimes occupy positions of authority that control our very lives.<br/><br/>The ""powers that be"" demand that Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and his men ""take the anthill no later than the day after tomorrow"", and the generals don't want to hear any ands, if, or buts about it. From the response of Dax, who seems able and reasonable, and other officers on the ground, we soon realize that the order by the distant and detached generals is all but impossible under the current conditions on the battlefield. The generals have barked their commands but appear indifferent to the suicidal nature of the mission. They dine and dance in palatial magnificence far away from the difficult and inhuman conditions of the foul and filthy trenches and then break for a few minutes to plan for the sure slaughter of their own subordinates without the slightest concern for the impact of their decisions upon the very lives of other human beings.<br/><br/>Filmed in stark black and white, Kubrick very ably recreates the maddening and terrifying conditions of the World War I trenches unlike any other film that I have ever seen. As Colonel Dax passes through his weary and injured troops, who line both sides of the narrow, fortified passages, a constant barrage of enemy explosions and whizzing missiles threatens them from all sides. What could Dax be thinking and feeling as he is about to lead his men beyond the trenches into an even worse hell of the open battlefield and toward the anthill beyond? We observe an undeniable look of terror in his face that is camouflaged by the strength and resolve that is required to lead in battle. To me, this sequence is one of those very special, unmatched moments in cinema, and, as to its intensity and complexity, who could deliver it better than Kirk Douglas?<br/><br/>When the predictable outcome of the mission is reported to the distant generals, that is, as soon as they find a moment to break from their perpetual partying, imbibing, and gorging, they decide to hold responsible one individual from each of the three companies for the failure. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is selected by his cowardly, drunken lieutenant only because he witnessed the same superior officer killing a subordinate in order to escape from a dangerous assignment, therefore conveniently avoiding his own court martial trial. Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel) is selected merely at random from the drawing of lots. Private Fierol (Timothy Carey) is chosen only because his superior took a personal disliking to him as a ""social outcast"". ""Me a social outcast?"" Fierol asks in outrage and disbelief. As in ""The Killing"", Carey is a special kind of an actor who portrays his characters so realistically that you feel as though you've met them somewhere in your life, but you can't recall exactly when or where. Was it in high school gym class? Homeroom? Afterschool detention?<br/><br/>As a perpetual, lifelong fan of ""Blackboard Jungle"", produced two years earlier, I take special note of the drastic conversion by actor Emile Meyer from gruff vice principal Halloran (""Shaddap!"") to the compassionate and totally appalled priest here. This guy could probably play anybody, and play him well.<br/><br/>Rather than revealing the results of the trial, I'll skip to the final scene in which Dax's remaining troops are celebrating their fortuitous survival at a local bar. The proprietor introduces a very reluctant, captured German girl (played by Christina Kubrick, the director's wife!), who is forced to perform before the rowdy and raucous group. As she slowly begins her melancholy song, the camera shifts to the individual faces of some of the men who have suddenly quieted down as they listen to the music. The tune sung by the terrified, tearful girl somehow moves them to stop their noisy celebration and to focus instead on their own inner thoughts, perhaps of the lives they left behind or of their ability to survive the war. The men then start humming to the girl's nostalgic song as she finally succeeds in composing herself on stage. The camera then shifts to Colonel Dax who has paused in front of the bar to listen to the singing men, absorbed in his own most private thoughts. A sergeant arrives to tell Dax that his men must return to battle. ""Give the men a few more minutes,"" replies Dax, fully aware of how very precious those moments are."

I haven't seen that many WWI movies in my life besides this movie and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" which was from the German viewpoint, and the key difference with this movie in terms of the plot is that this movie presents the French point of view. Kirk Douglas stars in one of his finest performances as Colonel Dax a soldier who is in charge of group of soldiers tasked with the impossible task of taking the Ant Hill from the Germans and once he realizes the impossibility of the mission they're forced to retreat and General Paul Mireau (George Macready) the commanding officer present for the failed operation accuses Dax's battallion of cowardice in the face of the enemy and court martials them and only three soldiers can be tried and Dax himself volunteers to defend them in a trial rigged against them and are thus found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. I had been dying to see for years and it really exceeded my expectations as to how great it was going to be because I went into this thinking it was going to be a war movie that just focuses on the fighting but this movie is more than just fighting and loyalty to one's country. When Kirk Douglas accepted the AFI lifetime achievement award in 1991 he said that he used to believe that movies should be merely entertaining and not have a message and that belief gradually changed as he got older and believes that movies should make statements in order for the betterment of mankind. The movie is a movie effectively hones its message of war being hell for the soldiers that fight in them andsometimes even in impossible odds get punished even though they were trying to serve their country which rarely happens in any country's military. The movie is one of the most well acted and well made anti-war statements ever put on film along with ""Platoon"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and is one of the very best movies of the late 1950'."

"maue-19674","9","0","1","4 May 2019"," Kubrick's Masterpiece on the utter folly and horror of war
","Very few Films have ever quite captured the true misery and horrors of the First World War. Having studied Military History, I had always imagined the I would never see a film that would portray the awful conditions, the sheer waste of mens lives and the terror of a n attack by Infantry against machine guns and artillery. Then, I saw Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' and sat stunned through a film that avoids the usual Hollywood 'heroics' and shows us the 'human' side of this conflict - from the French High Command, most of whose Officers are drawn from the wealthy classes - and who hardly care about the scale of the casualties, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) an Officer who deeply cares about his men and who doesn't wish to expose them to unnecessary danger, to the ordinary soldiers - just carrying out their duty - and trying to come out alive. Shot in Black and White, which really gives and authentic look to the trenches, Kubrick's tracking shots as the Officers walk down the trenches hoping to 'spread morale', show you the soldiers 'eye-view' - with incessant shell-fire throughout. What makes 'Paths Of Glory' such a powerful film is the sheer idiocy - and almost childish - reactions of the most senior French Officers. The Court Martial scene shows this more than anywhere else - the 'verdict' has already been decided and, as such, the Court is a farce, simply there to verify the wishes of the Commanding Officer.
The main attack against the 'Ant Hill' is one of the most brilliant, and accurate, depictions of such an assault in the First World War. All through the film the 'enemy' are never seen - not a single German Soldier is ever shown. The Irony being that the final scene, where the French troops are drinking and singing before returning to the front, shows a frightened German girl, who is forced to sing for the Troops. As she slowly, and faltering, sings a sad, melancholy, song from home, the troops stop their initial hostility and begin to hum along - painfully aware that soon, they too will return to the hell of the trenches.
Kubrick's film is one of the very best Films about any war and is amongst my favourite films of all time. Highly recommended"

","Stanley Kubrick was a very versatile director. His movies differ greatly in subject matter and genre. Yet there are common elements among all of his films. The technical mastery, the tone, and some themes. Of those themes sexuality was a big one, but not as big as war. Or rather the opposition of war.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory takes place in the French trenches during World War One. Desperate and ruthlessly ambitious general orders his men to take a hill held by the Germans. This proves to be an impossible task and the men retreat. Incensed, the general accuses his men of cowardice in the face of the enemy and orders one man from every company to be executed by firing squad.<br/><br/>This doesn't sit well with Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), the regiment's leader, and he appoints himself as their defense at the court-martial.<br/><br/>It's an early Kubrick film and thus it doesn't have quite as many ""But what does it mean?"" scenes than his more famous films. There are some of those here as well - the ending for example - but it is a surprisingly straightforward as far as Kubrick films go.<br/><br/>Yet you can still see his touch in almost everything. Especially on the technical side of things. The film has some great long takes of men walking in the trenches or crawling over the no man's land. The characters are rather black-n-white, or at the very least easy to understand motivation-wise. Which is typical for Kubrick, when you think about it. His characters would develop more grey areas in his later films, but they'd always remain rather... Iconic? Archetypical? They're deep despite it, don't get me wrong. Perhaps it would be better to say that his character are cut with broad, wide strokes, to make them easier to understand in the context of the story.<br/><br/>Not the best Kubrick film I've ever seen, but very good nevertheless. If you like this one, you probably should check out The Killing as well."
"jamesrupert2014","10","0","1","25 February 2019"," Searing anti-war film from a master director
","During WW1, three French soldiers are chosen, ostensibly at random, to be court-martialed as representatives of the units that failed to take a key German outpost during the trench-warfare stalemate of 1916. Defending them is idealistic Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), who finds himself facing an indifferent and callous court as well as cynical, self-centered senior officers. Kubrick's camera work is outstanding, with long, fluid tracking shots of officers walking through the trenches, stopping to both congratulate and berate the exhausted men. The battle scenes, as the infantry struggle though the shell craters, barb wire and bodies of no-man's land, are masterful, as is the beautiful, poignant imagery of the long walk to the execution site. The cast and script are equally excellent. George Macready plays Gen. Mireau as a heartless, self-aggrandising martinet while Adolphe Menjou's cynical Gen. Broulard, while more thoughtful, comes across as even more pernicious. The three soldiers (Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel and Timothy Carey) who find themselves being scapegoated for the poor military decisions of their leaders are also excellent: at times weak, at times strong, and the dialogue between soldiers (such as the discussion of death by bayonet vs. shell vs bullet) has a feeling of authenticity often lacking in war-films. The film has an interesting release history: it strong anti-war message and criticism of both military mentality and military justice, got it banned in a number of venues, especially France. All-in-all, a superlative film from the early years of one of the industry's most talented directors."

"Enchorde","7","0","1","14 February 2019"," Stuck with me... but the movie kept it's distance
","If a movie really sticks with you, that counts for something. If it does, there was something in the movie that made me think and reflect. The problem with Paths of Glory is that I'm not sure what it was...<br/><br/>But let me start from the beginning. Paths of Glory comes with a great reputation (and it is always difficult to live up to a hype) and an impressive rating here on IMDb. The movie, a clear anti-war movie, shows the aftermath of an futile attack on a German stronghold by the French army somewhere along the trenches in the first world war. To be clear, this is no war/action movie, it is almost all about what happens after. The general responsible (hoping for yet another promotion) is furious. After trying to have his artillery fire on his own lines (to get them moving), he ""settles"" to have one from each company put on trial for cowardice (after initially demanding that a hundred be put on trial - and this is a general that takes pride in being ""a soldier - one of the men""). The men's colonel, who personally led the attack, protests vehemently and demands to defend the men during the trial. The trial is of course a sham, the outcome decided from the beginning.<br/><br/>Futility is a common theme. The futility of the attack - thousands of lives sacrified for nothing, with no hope of success. The futility of the trial and hopelessness of the men - chosen just to make an example. The disdain of the higher officers for the enlisted men (one genereal thinks it unfair to compare the enlisted men dying to the newspapers critique the officers suffers (which he thinks is worse)). The anti-war message is clear. And finally, the ending scene, where the enlisted men leers and howls at a poor captured German girl that is made to perform for them. Is that the message? That everyone, even the common man, kick downwards on those who are weaker? The men start to sing along in the end, a significant change - but what does that mean?<br/><br/>To be fair, I wasn't that impressed when the movie ended. But then the thoughts started. What was the point really? Is everything depressing, or was there hope somewhere? And then I realized how expertly Kubrick has manipulated my thoughts and emotions throughout the movie with his choice of scenes and camera positioning. In that regard the movie is a directorial masterpiece. The movie, almost without me noticing, planted seeds of thoughts and questions, but offering no answers.<br/><br/>But herein also lies the movies greatest fault. By the same questions that made me think after, built a distance between me and the characters during. There were no real accomplishements, almost no characters to build a relationship with and feel for. I can't say the movie was very entertaining at all. By entertaining I don't mean I have to laugh or wonder at the effects - but I do expect to be engaged by the movie. Be dragged into the movie by the story. I actually wasn't with Paths of Glory, there was that distance.<br/><br/>And in the end, the real masterpiece manages to do both. I don't think Paths of Glory quite lives up to it's hype. Or is it that I expected too much out of it because of the hype?"

"TheNabOwnzz","9","0","1","2 December 2018"," One of the all-time greats of anti-war motion pictures
","Paths of Glory is undoubtedly Stanley Kubrick's first truly great motion picture, and in turn cemented his talented potential in the motion picture industry. Ofcourse, he would later follow this up by directing at least six more films of superb quality, yet the typical Kubrick technical aspects are first visible in this particular picture.<br/><br/>In a way, Paths of Glory is the most humane movie that Kubrick has ever made, and while certain trackingshots are very reminiscent of later projects such as The Shining (1980), this is still for Kubrick terms a very unconventional film. While one cannot deny Kubrick's genius as a director of angles, visuals, depth or artistic imagery, his films are generally emotionally quite disconnected since his character development is quite minimal, and the characters themselves one dimensional. ( Yeah, Alex DeLarge is an exception to this ) However, Paths of Glory is one of the most coherently structured films Kubrick has ever made, and doesn't have that 'weird-esque' feeling to it that later Kubrick films might have. It also has the strongest message about humanity and evil indifference, which in a way makes this Kubrick's most personally touching film by far, and the result is that it is without a doubt the most emotionally draining film he has ever made.<br/><br/>Colonel Dax ( Kirk Douglas ) is the metaphor for the sole representation and hope of humanity, whereas every other high ranking officer symbolizes the evil and inhumanity of man. The picture does a tremendous job by showing the futility of war, and the corruption of those involved. The enemy is never shown, and battle sequences, while technically superbly filmed, are deliberately not very satisfying. This further symbolizes the fact that this is in the end about an army fighting itself, instead of an enemy, which ofcourse also emphasizes the ultimate uselessness of war. The only German that is shown ( The female singer in the final scene ) is depicted as an array of light and hope, instead of hate and anger as is usually associated with the enemy.<br/><br/>The acting is generally superb, with in particular an outstanding performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role, who truly seems to be the sole 'human' officer depicted in the film. The screenplay that is accompanied with this ( In particular later discussions between him and his superior officers ) is also fantastic, as the dialogue is intelligent and very relevant to this reflection of the human condition and the corruption thereof. There are a couple of short scenes in which the three future victims are introduced, and they are depicted as the average joe's who are quite comparable to nearly every other human being, and therefore their dilemma is even more emotionally compelling.<br/><br/>In terms of technical aspects, Paths of Glory is also phenomenal. It is one of the best looking black-and-white movies ever made, which is a result of fantastic cinematography. The lighting in the jail sequences, the sideways tracking shots of the charge on the ant hill or the execution walk, every shot is close to perfection. Ofcourse the long trackingshots in the trenches also help enhance the situation our characters are in, and Kubrick's blocking in the officer scenes is fantastic, with many varieties in mood swings which are always emphasized by a character sitting down, standing up, or walking a certain direction. The dynamics in these exposition scenes are remarkable due to these varying visual hierarchies. One also has to mention the fantastic production design of the indoor sets featuring the high ranking officers, which definitely gives the audience this aristocratic kind of feeling that is in high contrast to the bleak trackingshots in the trenches featuring the normal soldiers.<br/><br/>In the end, Paths of Glory is Kubrick's greatest personal effort, and among his greatest films. It is a genuinely human story under inhuman conditions, and with a final scene that is one of the greatest metaphorical and emotional sequences ever created in cinema, it is indeed one of the all-time greats in terms of anti war motion pictures."

As his men whoop and holler, lusting after the woman on stage, you can see Douglas losing his faith in humanity with every lecherous cheer. Then quietly at first, the woman starts to sing. The men slowly pause one by one, as the simple familiar song brings to them feelings of home, family, childhood, innocence, purity, as only the softness and warmth of a woman could evoke.<br/><br/>Then the camera returns to Douglas, and you can see as he hears the men hum along, that a glimmer of hope returns, and he knows there is still humanity in his men, there is still something in all of them worth living and fighting for. One of his men comes to him with news that they are to head back to the front the next day, and the colonel puts on his hat again and resumes his command and returns to his office.

","What could I possibly add to the culture or knowledge of this film? To me, on certain days, this is Kubrick's finest achievement. Without a doubt this is the most impactful anti-war film ever produced. Kubrick i employs an unwaveringly documentarian approach in recounting this fictionalized amalgam of what could have been any battle on the Western Front. Portraying the ruthless mundanity and senseless destruction of human life in those trenches is done so effectively that he's succeeded in making such an abhorrent level of violence seem routine. You accept it as a norm. Something that we should never let it become. But we have , we have to in order to devote full and complete attention to the mental insanity that is unfolding in the upper ranks of France's military-industrial complex. A Dance of Death is unfolding over the failure of yet another Offensive. Heads must roll. Three enlisted men are essentially randomly selected for summary execution before a Firing Squad. During the battle and desperate to make good on his predictions for a glorious French victory over the hated Huns, an order is issued to the French artillery gunners .Confused, the targeting Corporal requests confirmation of the coordinates. Surely this must be an error. These numbers would put all of our largest shells right on top of our own French positions!! Timothy Carey plays one of the three enlisted men. Pvt. Maurice Ferol. The man was born to play this role. Carey's delivery is the most devastating Supporting Actor performance I've ever witnessed on the big screen. I'm neither kidding you nor am I exaggerating.

In a château, General Georges Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), a member of the French General Staff, asks his subordinate, the ambitious General Mireau (George Macready), to send his division on a suicide mission to take a well-defended German position called the ""Anthill."" Mireau initially refuses, citing the impossibility of success and the danger to his beloved soldiers, but when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.<br/><br/>Mireau proceeds to walk through the trenches, asking several soldiers, ""Ready to kill more Germans?"" He throws a disturbed private (Fred Bell) out of the regiment for showing signs of shell shock, which Mireau considers simple cowardice. Mireau leaves the detailed planning of the attack to the 701's Régiment Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), despite Dax's protests that the only result of the attack will be to weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit.<br/><br/>During a nighttime scouting mission prior to the attack, a drunken lieutenant named Roget (Wayne Morris) sends one of his two men ahead as a scout. Overcome by fear while waiting for the scout's return, he lobs a grenade and retreats. The other soldier—Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker)— finds the body of the scout, killed by the grenade.

"naysbaghai","9","0","3","12 December 2015"," A multilayered and candid portrait of war
","The expression ""two for one"" summarises my experience of Stanley Kubrick's anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory, a work from a cinematic maestro examining the multitude of issues that plagued World War I. Sure, the film is a great history lesson, but it also highlights the origins of Kubrick's directorial style, and how it has also educated cinema for the last 58 years in a profound way. In the words of Steven Spielberg, ""when you look at Paths of Glory, every sequence hammers its points home, but within every sequence, the filmmaking is delicate, subtle and gentle almost.""<br/><br/>Before Kubrick's idiosyncratic and perfectionist nature was highlighted in his later works, such as The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut, the subtlety, perception and imperturbability he applied to his direction is in full bloom. We are constantly reminded how we are observers to the tragedy of events, instanced by the going-over-the-top scenes and arguments between Kirk Douglas' Colonel Dax and the pompous generals. The impeccable composition and lighting of the cinematography highlights Kubrick's undying attention to technicality, and also sheds light on the influence of his background in photography.<br/><br/>However, the sound design of the film is particularly enticing, with the rhythms of machine gun fire and legatos of whistles providing a haunting soundtrack in its own right. When actual music does occur, the symbolism is retained, as shown by the mocking juxtaposition between snare drum ostinatos and marching generals. I'm sure that I'm not alone in my view that Stanley Kubrick is the director to learn from when it comes down to solely technique.<br/><br/>Although the dialogue in Paths of Glory tends to be wearisome and slowly articulated, I should remind myself that the film does depict the prosaic nature of war, and that we are observers of the events, be they snappy or sluggish. The story touches on a wide variety of topics surrounding the Allied war effort, including the persuasive yet delusional behaviour of the generals and the suicidal nature of trench warfare. However, what separates Paths of Glory from other war films is its ability to simultaneously examine law and justice, and therefore bolster its educational power. <br/><br/>Although Paths of Glory is an unconcealed constituent from the Criterion Collection, evidenced by its artistic, symbolic and periodic features, it is nonetheless a multilayered and candid portrait of war that still maintains its relevance and watchability almost six decades from its release. It's easy to see how both history documentaries and other film directors have tried and failed to replicate the work of the integral film genius known as Stanley Kubrick."

"sandnair87","9","0","2","22 April 2015"," The 'Paths of Glory' Lead But to The Grave!
","Right at the beginning of Stanley Kubrick's World War I epic 'Paths of Glory', we are placed right amongst a troop of worn-out French soldiers, led by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas, in splendid form), dug into their trenches and their morally corrupt commanders – both trying to hold off the Germans. Exasperated by the stalemate, the French supreme commander orders Colonel Dax's troops to do the impossible – launch a suicidal assault on a strategic hill – the Anthill. Even though he thinks the idea sounds insane, Dax is in no position to decline the directive and commands his men to charge to their likely doom. The soldiers are indeed like ants on the Anthill, stomped mercilessly by larger unseen forces. When the operation ends in inevitable retreat, their commanding general, himself largely responsible for the fiasco, wants an entire company to face execution. France needs a sacrifice, as if it hadn't bled enough. Eventually, three men are chosen at random to face court-martial for 'cowardice', as an example to others. The decision brings Dax, himself a defense lawyer in peacetime, into conflict with his superior officers, as he tries to assert reason during wartime for those on trial against an apathetic panel of military judges, even as the three men await execution. Can Colonel Dax save the men from the trumped-up charges of pusillanimity and eventually from the firing squad?<br/><br/>Over the years, Kubrick's WWI saga has attained a status commensurate with its meticulous craftsmanship and unfortunately timeless message. The movie is visually alluring from the start, whether it is when the camera is patrolling the trenches during the frighteningly vivid warfare or pacing the courtroom during the trial scenes in the latter half. Corrosively antiwar, the film is indeed pointed, but its contempt is directed not at war per se but rather at the manner in which war is conducted. For the movie is fundamentally an attack on bureaucracy and its attendant rigidity, hypocrisy and cumulative ineffectiveness. If that sounds dull or, worse, didactic, rest assured that in the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it is no such thing. Kubrick almost scornfully illustrates the consequences of unchecked ambition and mass complacency, as high- ranking officers calmly plot the basest turpitude, far from the muck of the trenches. It serves as a reminder both of his extraordinary formal virtuosity and his powers as a satirist.<br/><br/>With Paths of Glory, Kubrick sits himself down to brood on the meaning of 'courage' and 'honor' in war. Decades later, it continues to be hailed as a devastating body-blow that reminds us that the true horror of war is the endless futility of it."

From start to finish Paths of Glory is a gritty dramatization of what conflict looked like during WWI. The movie shows many layers of depth from inside the mansion of the bourgeoisie, all the way into the hearts and minds of the men fighting on the front.

"GeorgeRoots","9","0","2","14 March 2015"," An Anti-War Movie That Still Holds Up Considerably.
","In many ways Kubrick's ""Trench-Drama"", is one of the greatest movies about World War 1 ever made. Life and times of those who fought on the battlefield are depicted radically for the time, fear and morale's are ever present and the lives of soldiers from multiple points of view are deemed crucial and worthless. Fantastic tracking shots move across the barbed wire and holes of a visceral ""No man's land"", all the way to the courts and firing squads depicting Kubrick's use of one point perspective. Truly this film still packs a punch that really depicts how much a soldiers life meant back then, and in saying all this I want to point out that I'm not only addressing the French, everyone had a certain cause and reaction in the War which can be deemed ""inhumane"".<br/><br/>After a voice over addresses the current situation of 1916, French Generals plan to send their men on a suicide mission to claim the ""Anthill"". Though there is doubts, promises of prestige quickly removes them and affirms the mission. The film stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, A commanding officer who leads the mission aware of the odds against them. Though a valiant effort they must withdraw, Dax then attempts to defend a trio of soldiers against a charge of cowardice.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of events, a lot of emotion between soldiers lead to moments of babble and solemn dignity. The somewhat conflict on the battlefield and court rooms are eerily similar, but there are also glimmers of hope to be had for the future. Kubrick's second of many War movies remains one of his greatest black and white classics, it is also the first well known account of Kubrick's infamous amount of re-takes that lead veteran actor Adolphe Menjou, to do the same scene 17 times with fury and anguish.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Unflinching in its portrayal. There is no hidden agenda in this movie, or at least one that is insultingly blatant that comes off shameless. It continues to be extremely re-watchable, as well as a well crafted movie that continues to hold up. 9/10."
"asda-man","8","0","2","26 February 2015"," Stanley's first moment of glory
","Paths of Glory is a World War 1 film with a difference. It's less concerned with the actual trench warfare and more concerned with the sadism found in higher ranking officers. It's clear that Stanley isn't a fan of war, so it may be a little biased, but it is based on a true story and Stanley handles it absolutely beautifully!<br/><br/>After the limp Killer's Kiss and entertaining, The Killing, Paths of Glory is Stanley's first truly great film. You can see his directing style really shine here with the fantastic tracking shots and wide angles. If you look at most films from the 50's you'll find that the camera barely moves. Here, the camera is always on the move which is partly why the film still holds up so well today.<br/><br/>It's the type of film which makes your blood boil. There is no conventional happy ending, the entire film is on the road to tragedy. There are several brilliant scenes which stand the test of time including the storming of the Ant Hill, which adds a kind of surreal grace to a scene full of ugliness and intensity. Another great scene is the infuriating kangaroo court where Kirk Douglas hopelessly tries to defend the 'cowardly' soldiers.<br/><br/>The most memorable moments are probably the final two scenes though. The first one features a long and melodramatic walk to the firing line. There's obvious religious imagery here and it's handled magnificently. The last scene is the famous moment in the bar where Stanley's beautiful wife takes the stage and gets a bunch of rowdy soldiers to hum in unison. It's a weirdly moving moment to end on.<br/><br/>I'm not a particular fan of war films, but Paths of Glory has to be one of the best out there. It has a terrific story to tell and it's one which will anger and sadden you. It's superbly acted and directed too. Some say that it's Stanley Kubrick's best film. I'd disagree with that statement, but I can see where these people are coming from. It definitely has to be his most emotional and moving film."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Paths of Glory"" (1957) is a stunning motion picture. It's about war, it's about life, it's about immeasurable things. What is courage? What is glory in the face of death? How to measure it? Can it be measured? Does courage or cowordness can be judged? These are just a few questions this movie brilliantly asks. And there is no sure answer. <br/><br/>Watching this movie i was stunned how interesting and involving it is. It's superbly acted, directed and amazingly written war drama, that isn't much about the combat, but more of what consequences it brings. I'm still not sure whether the court itself was moral. It's yes and no at the same. If there were no court, many soldiers would have followed by example of those who didn't fight (as it was their responsibility - they are soldiers), and they would have surely lost war, which would ended by deaths for millions. On the other hand, the court itself was just a reminder, of why war itself is the most inhuman thing of them all.<br/><br/>Overall, one couldn't summarize this movie and especially it's ideas in one summary. This is anti war movie that raises questions, and as they are eternal, there are no black or white answers to them. ""Paths of Glory"" is a must see motion picture for everyone and for all ages. It's a damn perfect classic."
"phubbs","10","0","1","18 February 2015"," Paths of Glory
","Despite being known as a bit of a classic, Kubrick's anti-war film was not a box office hit at the time of release. It was actually frowned upon by various European countries for the portrayal of the military and its negative message towards the establishment in general.<br/><br/>It is clear to see the moral injustice carried out which is the films basis and the theme for the anti-war message. The fact that men were shot by their own country for petty charges such as cowardice, or less, shows how poorly humans treated each other and at this time how life was cheap. High ranking officials grasping for honours by playing their war games with real lives at stake. This whole ideal naturally caused controversy at the time of release amongst military leaders (especially French ones), the truth stings huh.<br/><br/>As a film there isn't much better, there are numerous classic war films of the age and this Kubrick offering is up there with the greats. What is impressive (like 'All Quiet on the Western Front') is the gritty trench/no man's land sequences which are highly authentic looking with fantastic production values. Truly a real work of art displaying bunkers and trenches soaked in thick wet mud, bomb craters and debris set in a barren misty wasteland scattered with bodies and barb wire. But remember this isn't an action flick, this isn't a war film high on blood and guts fighting, its about the moralities of war.<br/><br/>Told from a French point of view of course (WW1 trench warfare against the Germans), but amusingly you wouldn't think it as the cast bare no attempt to sound French with everyone having an American accent. Wayne Morris as the drunken Roget especially with his slightly southern twang, these days that would be more accurate I'm sure. <br/><br/>But no one can dispute the quality of the cast line up with a strong headed Douglas (Dax) leading the way. With fire in his eyes he tries his best to remain civil against a sly heartless Macready who in turn is trying to butter up the quietly cunning Menjou for promotion. There is added entertainment with a surprisingly good portrayal from Carey as one of the doomed soldiers as he displays some much needed dark gallows humour to the whole affair. The little sequence where he squashes a cockroach whilst awaiting his fate in a military jail is actually amusing and almost out of place. <br/><br/>You are just given snippets of relief from this story of lunacy and corruption. At other times you feel the desperation and anger for the hand picked men, picked for execution. One man chosen because he witnessed his commanding officer get up to no good on a scouting mission, another because he is simply unsociable and the final man merely at random despite being awarded medals for bravery (a young Joe Turkel who will later turn up in cult classic 'Blade Runner').<br/><br/>I'm sure people can relate to being persecuted, maybe in the workplace for whatever reason, picked on or victimised. Its a very easy, common thing that can happen to anyone, well imagine that but in the end you'd be shot at dawn for it. When you think about it, the whole process you're watching unfold really grabs you by the scruff of the neck and shakes you violently. You really want Dax to win, to show the commanding hierarchy in their ivory towers what's its really like to be a grunt on the front line facing certain death. Would you run blindly across inhospitable land into gun fire??<br/><br/>In the end of course its all to no avail. The powers that be get their way and later on the rest of the men are once again ordered back to the front where they will all most likely be killed. Dax knows what will happen as do we the viewers, and with that he leaves them to enjoy one last happy sing song.<br/><br/>The films message is clear and virtually stated by Douglas during the court martial scene and its spot on. Kubrick's adaptation of the Cobb novel is pinpoint and speaks volumes, it paints a solemn picture of the era in many ways, generally negative. The fact the whole story is also based on a true event makes it even more poignant.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Making a profound statement against war, crafted with precision care & sincerity, and featuring some truly memorable & exquisitely detailed shots throughout its runtime, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory is one of the finest examples of its genre which established the then-young filmmaker as one of the most promising directors of its time & continues to influence warfare filmmaking, even today.<br/><br/>Based on Humphrey Cobb's novel of the same name, the story of Paths of Glory is set in France during the First World War and concerns Colonel Dax; a commanding officer of French soldiers, who goes against the orders of his superiors & refuses to continue marching his troops towards what's clearly a suicide mission, only to later defend them when they're charged with cowardice in a court-martial.<br/><br/>Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the entire picture is steadily narrated, properly introduces its fascinating characters & presents a remarkable level of craftsmanship in its technical aspects. Set pieces are state-of-the-art stuff, Cinematography is notable for its fluid tracking shots, the brutality of war is unflinchingly portrayed, Editing is steadily carried out & its score provides a militarised feel to the whole narrative.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Paths of Glory features a fine cast in Kirk Douglas, George Macready & others, and the performances are very impressive. Leading from the front is Douglas as Colonel Dax; the commander who stops the attack midway after the first wave are mercilessly slaughtered. Macready plays General Mireau, who in pursuit of more power green lights the attack despite being aware of the impossibility of the mission & the supporting cast chips in strongly too.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, anti-war films don't get any better than this for Paths of Glory presents Stanley Kubrick in prime form & is a timeless classic that hasn't lost even an ounce of its effectiveness despite being nearly 60 years old. Brilliantly directed, deftly scripted, boldly shot, splendidly photographed, tightly edited & nicely scored, Paths of Glory is an amazing portrait of greed, fear, death, war & duty that comes one hundred percent recommended."

",". . . to maintain a strategic advantage, it's up to Americans such as Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas--the PATHS OF GLORY creators--to expose the secrets of French military success. Many of these tips involve execution by firing squad. When you face embarrassment from whistle blowers such as Edward Snowden and Monica Lewinsky, just shoot them (like Corporal Phillip Paris here). Since decorated war heroes such as SERGEANT YORK or that Pennsylvania Marine who gunned down his ex-wife and her family this week, can become post-war liabilities, just shoot them before the war ends (like Private Pierre Renaud's fate here). With the high cost of medical care, when soldiers are wounded in battle, why award them Purple Hearts, when you can just finish the job the Enemy started and shoot them (like Private Maurice Ferol here), even if you need to strap their stretcher to the execution post and slap them out of a comatose state (Private Renaud's fate here)? This French approach to Military Discipline virtually eliminates the need for veterans' benefits and V.A. hospitals, while insuring sterling reputations for the general staff Muckety-Mucks. True, it takes a lot of bullets (nine per soldier) and sandbags to do things the French Way, as depicted in PATHS OF GLORY. Maybe the guillotine would be cheaper."

","This is the true story of how those in power took advantage of it and put three innocent soldiers on the stand for cowardice, during World War I. One of Kubrick's earlier classics, this film deals with the savagery of violence, and how the common people are made to fight others' wars. The visuals are so empowering, and the film hits you right in the gut with its emotional prowess. The lives of these men are decided by the higher powers and their decision making, over what is just. Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) tries to save the lives of the three men in question but he has to fight against bureaucracy time and time again. Even when he has a chance to right the injustice he is thwarted by his government and unfair officials, who fight them in purely evil and sadistic ways. We don't know until the final moment whether or not the three men will be saved, and it's a long and painfully aware scene. The very ending, with the German girl in the bar, singing a familiar tune, sparked such a human empathy within myself that it made me cry. A very emotional and quintessentially moving film, it's obvious that Kubrick has made the seminal war film."

","This is one of the best movies you've probably never heard of. It's perhaps the best indictment of the faux patriotism of authoritarian regimes - not only countries, but also the military, law enforcement, and large corporations - that I've ever seen. The script is brilliant and directing superb. Most of the performances are first rate, though it does detract that the realism of at least adding French accents was eschewed. A few of the parts were either unbelievably overacted or didn't achieve the effect I'm sure was intended, but all in all, this movie deserves to be among the ones every parent should be sure to watch with their kids as a rite of passage into adulthood."

","The climax song and the expressions of the soldiers sum it all of how much dreadful pain a war can bring.<br/><br/>The sound and the visuals made with terse verbiage and tight screenplay consummate this film to be the best war film ever made that highlights the corruptness of the superior officers who presume they can get away with anything. It takes us through the military trenches filled with nothing but men willing to fight, the gore war landscapes where men will fall in the attack by the enemy. The court martial that is closed even before it started, all this done and the emotions of those accused just resonate of what gruesome magnitude can the war become and the worse part is being killed by their own men. Have mercy, have them killed by enemy let them die like soldiers I was craving within.<br/><br/>Impeccable vision of Kubrick has brought this movie to state from where it actually was, the story as such has nothing much to be proud of but the way it portrayed with such raw energy from the actors has to be acclaimed.<br/><br/>Art direction, Oh my god what it could have taken to set up those trenches and the war space is really commendable given that in those days, they had to set these up manually.<br/><br/>Kudos again to the vision of Kubrick for a war film that can be considered one of the best ever.

He wants to shoot a 100 men for cowardice but this number is whittled down to 3.

","Stanley Kubrick's Path of Glory is an Epic movie depicting military life in France during the First World War. Kirk Douglas plays the Colonel who leads his men into battle. An honest portrayal of the conditions that the men in the French uniform had to endure. The movie asks the audience to decide for themselves the morality of the officers show in the film.<br/><br/>History has proved that this film is an accurate representation of French military justice contrary to opinions of anti war propaganda which would seek to deprive it of the respect it deserves,however when viewed through the lens of the present so much about the time it is set in is revealed. The General at heart is a soldier duty bound to uphold his principals. The deserter despite his lapse in judgement was most likely due to being warn down by the years of warfare. The executioner who was used to instil discipline in the army.<br/><br/>This film is an excellent ww1 historical film. Regardless of the reasons for the war this tells a story of the hardship of that war. Long may it be remembered as a great movie."

","How do you deal with a No-Win situation? Do you move forward knowing that you'll inevitably fail or do you just give up and wait to die? Does it even matter? Can empathy and basic humanity stand up in the face of such a situation(s). These questions and many others stand at the heart of Paths of Glory.<br/><br/>In Paths of Glory Colonel Dax(played by Kirk Douglass) is tasked with leading an assault on a German fortification knowing full well that he will fail. Ultimately though Dax is a good soldier and follows orders. He leads the assault and it fails spectacularly with half of the troops never leaving the trenches. Dax's superior ,General Mireau(played by George Macready), notices that a good portion of the troops never leave the trenches and charges the regiment with cowardice in the face of the enemy(a charge with the penalty of death). Of course this is a complete and utter farce. The men were not cowards they were just men thrust into an impossible situation.<br/><br/>Colonel Dax, being the moral man he is, stands up for his men and defends them in the court-martial. His voice is the only voice of reason in this tragic situation. In spite of his best efforts the men are executed anyway.<br/><br/>I'm not a really emotional sort of person but this is a movie that always gets to me. To quote the film,""I can't believe that the noblest impulse for man - his compassion for another - can be completely dead here."". To be honest a lot of the time I can't even bring myself to watch the news because it really does disturb me how some people can just knowingly bring harm to others with no regret for their actions. I'm not claiming to be some model of morality(I'm not) but reading or seeing those sorts of things really disturbs me. Fiction is one thing but.. doing those sorts of things to real people is unfathomable to me.<br/><br/>Anyway this is an amazing film. You have great acting, cinematography, dialogue. I can't really point out a weak point in this movie."

","Kubrick never disappoints, or at least that seems to me! He can either make a film about the 1st World War, the exploration of the galaxy or a hotel full of metaphysical horrors, it does not matter, you will always find a great piece of art (but it doesn't mean you're gonna love it!) In this case, Kubrick shows us the sordid horrors of warfare thru a point of view of a colonel who hates the loss of humanity of his superiors, people who thinks and acts in a way totally different to the poor soldiers sent to die in the trenches. The best thing of the film is, doubtless, that Kubrick succeeds in making us hate war and everyone involved in his primary realization and organization...and in just one hour and a half! (Shortest Kubrick film I've ever seen).<br/><br/>The 1st World War setting is excellent as ever. The photography, the costume, the scenarios...just incredibly accurate. Kirk Douglas and the two ''antagonists'' (Adolphe Menjou and George Macready) play great roles.<br/><br/>I doubtless recommend this film, especially if you hate Kubrick longer ones."

To my surprise, this is pretty excellent. The story is intriguing, and a lot of moral complications arise, stuff that only Kubrick can so wonderfully get at and truly dissect. The performance here are pretty great, and Douglas gives so much to his character. One of Kubrick's undisputed heroes, no doubt, if not one of cinema's greatest ever. This might very well stand as one of the late director's best works, and am pretty struck that it took me this long to finally give it a go."

","Not only does one get an opportunity to appreciate brilliant directing and stunning cinematography, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory also examines highly significant themes of morality and integrity, making it a very powerful and truly great film. By focusing on the exploits of the French army during the years of the First World War, Kubrick successfully manages to expose flaws within the military system, highlighting the immoral behavior of the commanding officers, as well as the unjust treatment of the soldiers. Kirk Douglas' terrific acting skills are on display in the leading role, as he portrays a colonel that challenges the conduct of his superior officers, thus epitomizing the ideas of justice and ethical behaviour. Due to its flawless execution, the film serves as a very thought-provoking critique of the military and again proves Kubrick's distinct ability to confront delicate themes with a simple, yet impactful approach. Paths of Glory is perhaps the most realistic cinematic portrayal of the grueling trench warfare endured by millions during the Great War, and undoubtedly one of Kubrick's finest."
"Red-Barracuda","7","0","1","14 May 2014"," An anti-war film, ahead of its time
","Paths of Glory was seemingly unsuccessful on initial release. It was also banned by several European countries, France only lifting the ban in the 70's. It was clearly a film which touched a nerve. In the years that followed its release it started to gain its reputation though. By the time of the height of the Vietnam War, the anti-war, anti-authority sentiments of this movie were very much in line with the times and it was embraced fully. Like a few films now considered classics, Paths of Glory was simply out-of-step with its time; as it turned out, it was ahead of its time. Its bitter cynicism and pessimism was hardly the norm for war movies of the 1950's but was certainly in-line with what was to follow in cinema from the late 1960's onwards.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was a master film-maker who made classics in several genres but if there was one he returned to more often it was probably the war film. This one is quite a good companion piece to his later Full Metal Jacket with its anti-war theme. Both films of course look at different ways in which war is terrible; in the latter film it is the way it dehumanises but in Paths of Glory the spotlight is on those who direct events in the background. The military elite are depicted as out of touch and detached. They callously set objectives that they know will result in mass deaths, only really interested in their own reputations. The resultant trial and executions are unforgettably senseless and truly encapsulate the madness of war. Kubrick ends the film on an unusual bitter sweet note though, with the final scene with the German girl who is forced to sing for the French soldiers. They are at first rowdy and intimidating but once the girl starts singing they become quiet and tearful. It's a quite unusual scene but one that strikes a chord even if it is not immediately obvious why it has.<br/><br/>The film that Paths of Glory most resembled to me was All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), which is generally regarded as the first classic movie of the sound era. Both films deal with World War I and both are American features that focus on foreign soldiers. In All Quiet on the Western Front it's the Germans, in Paths of Glory, the French. I am guessing this allowed the film-makers to make anti-war statements and to criticise those in power who orchestrate it, without appearing unpatriotic to America. Whatever the case, the distance allowed both movies to be very damning of war in general and neither criticises the fighting men portrayed no matter the side they are on. Paths of Glory also shares another thing with that older film in that it has an extremely well shot battle scene with a fluid tracking shot of carnage in No Man's Land with explosion going off everywhere and men advancing and falling. It's visually impressive elsewhere too with a gliding camera in the trenches themselves. You can certainly see Kubrick's visual flair here. While the rhythmical soundtrack of beating drums enhances the tension very well. Kirk Douglas, who also produced the film, is fine in the starring role. You may also recognise one of the condemned men, Joe Turkel, who went on to play the sinister bar man in Kubrick's later film The Shining."
"writers_reign","9","0","2","12 May 2014"," Primrose Paths
","I haven't looked at the other reviews posted here but I would be very surprised to find even one negative comment. Frankly this is an excellent film and a more than worthy addition to the genre labelled loosely as 'anti-war'. The fact that it deals with the First rather than the Second World War tends to place it in the minority but it is well worthy of taking its place along the original version of All Quiet On The Western Front and it did, of course, inspire a rip-off in the shape of King and Country which covered its tracks by focusing on one soldier (Tom Courteney) rather than three (Joe Turkel, Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey) on trial for alleged cowardice and being defended by a serving officer - in this case Kirk Douglas, in the rip-off Dirk Bogarde. All Kubrick's ducks are in a line beginning - as every movie must - with the screenplay, through the direction, photography, editing and acting and it would be churlish to single out any one performance. Deserves every accolade that comes its way."

","I won't bother to dissect the film, or to comment on its value as a statement of war, but rather to state this is a testament to the brilliant film making that marked the career of Stanley Kubrick. The greatness that was to come through his next films (Strangelove, 2001, Clockwork Orange) is on full display here. Its hard to imagine that we can enter this twisted world of war, where nonsensical episodes are commonplace, and yet we are not simply muted spectators, we are empathetic participants. This is Kubrick's genius. Making the bizarre and extraordinary seem almost mundane. <br/><br/>One could consider the range of performances as a further measure of Kubrick's growing confidence as a film maker. Kirk Douglas can never really be accused of being too subtle, but here the passion seems to rise out of the absurd circumstances. There is a genuine quality to everyone here, just as there would be with Gen. Jack D. Ripper and Alex years later."
"donuthaters12","10","0","1","25 November 2013"," A Film Rivalling Kubrick's Best And The Other Films Within It's Genre
","This film is one of Stanley Kubrick's overlooked films, others include the films that came out before it, but just because the film is overlooked doesn't necessarily mean it's good. Paths of Glory is the best of his overlooked films. Before watching this, I heard so many great things about it but I always try to be objective when I come into a movie to avoid unrealistic expectations and prevent myself to be too excited or disappointed.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is based on the book of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb. The screenplay was written by Kubrick, Jim Thompson and Calder Willingham. Thompson and Kubrick have previously worked together on The Killing and I thought they did a decent job on that one. Paths of Glory is definitely an excellent tale of loyalty, mercy, sacrifice and the politics of war. There are many war films that fail to captivate me but this one has such a great story and such an empathetic and likable protagonist that the film had me engaged the whole way through. The film's dialogue, in my opinion, is much better written here in comparison to Kubrick's previous film as it felt more realistic and doesn't try to stand out. I understand that both films are totally different in genre and style but I am just judging it with what works for me personally. People who expect the film to show more chilling and intense action sequence may be disappointed as there is only one area of the film that contains this, but I didn't mind it because it's great plot made up for it. There are definitely some stand out scenes in this film including the ending, the courtroom and the charge on Ant Hill.<br/><br/>Kubrick comes back to the modern war genre, his previous being Fear and Desire. He definitely showed his capabilities as a director in this film by creating a war film that is intimate and personal. Kubrick understands the importance of substance over style and that making this film more character driven, it haves the audience care about the tragic and sadness of it much more. This film definitely competes with the other Kubrick greats but it lacks the brilliance and originality that his subsequent efforts would deliver. Kubrick is not a stranger to controversy, though his most controversial films were released much later, and this film definitely created quite a buzz in certain countries which I think just supports the film's greatness.<br/><br/>The film's photography was handled by the German cinematographer, Georg Krause. This is the only film so far I have seen from Krause's long list of films he has worked in. The film's photography may not stand out or stylistically as much as Kubrick's previous film but there are moments in here that are very memorable and excellently shot, an example would be the long shot of the camera moving down the trench seeing the soldiers just standing on the edges of the scene. The black and white photography by Krause will not have anybody turn heads and be in awe but instead it just brings the viewer into the story and have the image be appropriate in enhancing the film's themes and plot. Paths of Glory is the earliest film of Kubrick that I have taken notice of his style that allows a shot to be patient and have the characters do a long take of a scene, this makes the film feel a lot more natural and relying less on cuts in order to drive the film.<br/><br/>Gerald Fried comes back to do the score for this film and it certainly is different from his previous film with Kubrick. Fried's score doesn't feel as cheesy or as over the top here in comparison to The Killing. The score feels very patriotic and strong. The use of drums to create that sense of tension really makes certain moments feel right. I can definitely say that his work here is much more appropriate and an improvement over his previous work.<br/><br/>The acting aspect of the film is driven by Kirk Douglas. I have always admired his acting and he always seems to play characters that are very likable and can empathise with. Douglas shows a lot of vulnerability and compassion for his character, and this feeling is even more heightened with the supporting cast that primarily interacts with him are cold, heartless and egotistic. The stand out in the supporting cast is George Macready as he played an egotistic and cynical antagonist that polarises with Douglas moral values. It's always nice to see the usual actors that come back in Kubrick's films, as they are always playing very different characters and they always stand out.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory is one of Kubrick's well made films and it definitely competes with the other highly acclaimed war films. It has a strong performance by Douglas, excellent direction and writing from Kubrick, and a fascinating story of the politics of war."

","What can I say? The film was beautiful both in picture quality and story. I'm not a huge war movie fan, but I loved this. I might also add that I've seen very few war films, maybe 10 or so, and Paths of Glory became an instant classic. I found myself losing focus ever so slightly in the beginning as it took just a little bit to gain momentum. But that's perfectly fine as it's Kubrick's style to take his time. It's worth it. Once you reach a certain point of the story you're holding on with all your strength, swimming in the trenches with the soldiers. <br/><br/>The deeper meanings carried throughout the film such as hypocrisy, the weaknesses of bureaucracy, and the travesty's of war are clearly depicted. After doing some further reading, I learned there is some truth to specific events that take place in the film. I'm sparing the spoilers so I don't have to tag this review as such. <br/><br/>If you're a war film buff, I think you'll love this movie. From the mouth of Martin Scorsese, ""My friends and I were war movie buffs. We had seen nothing quite like Paths of Glory."" Personally, I was so intrigued by this movie that I will make it my duty to watch more war films. I never realized how powerful they could be. <br/><br/>The cast is also fantastic. Each actor portraying their character with extreme accuracy, not allowing the viewer to question its authenticity for a second."

","I love war films! Usually I watch the ones about the commanders like Tora! Tora! Tora(1970) or The Longest Day(1962). These films are both about a historical event in World War 2. They don't form any opinion on war they just show what happened. War films about the soldiers themselves are different. They still showcase an event but these films express views on war. All Quiet on the Western Front(1930) comes to mind. Paths of Glory(1957) is sort of a mix. It's about both the commanders and the soldiers. It's about how the commanders treat the infantry men. It's about two generals General Paul Mireau(George MacReady) and General George Broulard(Adolphe Menjou) who want to take over the German anthill in World War 1. They plan to do this by using troops led by their leader Colonel Dax(Kirk Douglas). Colonel Dax does as he is ordered and he and his men attempt to storm the anthill. It goes horribly wrong and results in an unnecessary loss of men. The attack was suicide anyway. General Mireau is angry and orders his artillery to fire on Colonel Dax's troops. The order is refused so General Mireau blames the men for cowardice. Colonel Dax attempts unsuccsessfully to save his men from execution. But to get revenge on Mireau, Colonel Dax tells General Broulard about Mireau's attempt to fire on his own troops. This is my 3rd favorite Stanley Kubrick film out of the 4 i've seen at the moment. This is an amazing film from one of the best ever motion picture makers!"

","Kirk Douglas stars as Col. Dax, who is chosen to defend a group of French soldiers selected by lot to represent their unit who have been charged with cowardice in battle after being forced into an impossible battle with opposing German forces from the trenches onto the front lines of World War I. An arrogant and glory seeking General(played memorably by George Macready) is responsible, but irrationally blames the men instead of his lunatic battle strategy. Sadly, the outcome is preordained, much to the indignation and sorrow of Dax.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick directed this shattering masterpiece of the insanity of this war, and how arrogant and out-of-touch Generals get away with murder. Harrowing and realistically recreates battlefield conditions, and acting is superb all around, with a searing and insightful script, leading to a devastating ending that may leave the viewer in tears.<br/><br/>Not to be missed."

","Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful.<br/><br/>It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt.<br/><br/>One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion.<br/><br/>But Paths of Glory is a must see."

","A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements.

","Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides.<br/><br/>'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front.<br/><br/>The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film."

","Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film."
"Hey_Sweden","10","0","1","13 June 2013"," An excellent anti-war film.
","Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact.<br/><br/>Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed.<br/><br/>A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches.<br/><br/>With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, ""Paths of Glory"" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced.<br/><br/>I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me.<br/><br/>If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you."
"ripley217","9","0","1","18 December 2012"," Kubrick's best?
","It is almost impossible to write a review of Paths of Glory without spoiling, because if you want to talk about the best parts of the film - as I do - you will have to give away key plot points. <br/><br/>Firstly, the plot: after an goes horribly wrong, a crazed general decides to cover up his failure by picking three soldiers at random to be tried for cowardice in the face of the enemy. Colonel Dax, aware of the men's innocence, chooses to act as their lawyer.<br/><br/>There are four scenes/sequences in particular I would like to mention: the first is the sequence in which the camera does a tracking shot, following Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) through a trench which is being bombarded by the Germans. This creates a incredible sense of impending doom, which builds to a devastating climax when Dax leads his soldiers 'over-the'top' to their certain deaths. For the time the film was made, this battle seems to me to be astonishingly realistic, and on such a massive scale too.<br/><br/>The next scenes I would like to mention are the scenes in which the soldiers awaiting execution live out their last hours. The cinematography in particular helps to layer a sense of dread over these scenes and you will feel that you feel as helpless as the soldiers awaiting death, and as worthless as Dax as he runs around trying to save them.<br/><br/>The execution scene itself was more suspenseful to me the second time I saw it than when I saw it first. The relentless drumming in the background just helps build the massive tension to its inevitable climax.<br/><br/>Finally, the final scene, in which a young German girl is forced to sing in front of a bunch of rowdy French soldiers. Like the scene previously mentioned, this scene was a lot more powerful the second time around, for whatever reason. While the sings, the room gets gradually quieter, as the soldiers fully realise the situation they are in and weep. You may even cry yourselves - I almost did. <br/><br/>To conclude, Paths of Glory could possibly the best Kubrick film I have seen yet (it's this or The Shining). It's obviously severely dated, and some of the acting leaves a lot more to be desired. But if you look past that, you are watching something truly brilliant, and very anti-war.<br/><br/>Oh, and look out for what are without a doubt the best lines of this or any film (the ones I'm thinking of involve the scene between Dax and Broulard)."
"virek213","10","0","1","18 December 2012"," Kubrick's Scathing Indictment Of War And Military Tribunals
","It is an unfortunate fact of humanity that few things seem to stimulate it more than watching hundreds of thousands die in war, no matter the enemy and no matter the necessity. But it is equally true that war has been commented upon time immemorial on the big screen, sometimes with utter jingoism being involved (as is the case with many a John Wayne film), but usually with a ""Man's inhumanity to Man"" comment involved. Such is true of director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 film PATHS OF GLORY, set against the horrible backdrop of World War I and involving a criminal court-martial that, by itself, is even more horrible than the war itself.<br/><br/>Based on Humphrey Cobb's classic novel of the same name, PATHS OF GLORY involves a French army regiment's charge against a heavily fortified German ant hill on the Western Front, instigated by an ambitious general (George Macready) who has been promised a promotion by his superior (Adolphe Menjou) should it succeed. Needless to say, despite the efforts of most of the men, the withering mortar fire of the Germans causes the attack to be a crippling disaster; and Macready, looking for someone to blame for an attack that was strategically pointless from the get-go, orders that three men (Timothy Carey; Ralph Meeker; Joe Turkel) who could not advance far out of the trenches be put on trial for cowardice, a charge that carries with it execution by firing squad. Kirk Douglas, who portrays the men's trench commander and who in civilian life is an attorney, is given the unenviable task of defending his men against charges that, just on face value alone, are extremely ludicrous, but he is prevented by the General Staff and the prosecutors (including Richard Anderson) from presenting exculpatory evidence. As a result, not even three days after the Ant Hill attack, the three men are executed. Douglas, however, uncovers evidence of Macready's complicity in the attack and the fact that he ordered other French troops to fire on the psychologically paralyzed men. He also confronts Menjou with Menjou's own complicity in this sick and pointless incident, verbally denouncing the general square in the face.<br/><br/>Having achieved a great early standing with his 1956 crime film THE KILLING, Kubrick became internationally known on the basis of this masterful and scathing combination of war and courtroom drama that, as would be the pattern of many of his films, was also the source of controversy. Its depiction of the behavior of French commanding officers attracted a lot of scorn in France, so much so that PATHS OF GLORY was not shown there until the late 1970s; and several US bases in other countries in Europe weren't allowed to show it either until the early 1970s. As with so many detractors of Kubrick's films, however, the French and American military censors missed the point. The film does not dishonor the men who actually did the fighting in the war, but it does severely scrutinize the commanders who sit behind their desks in sheltered chateaus, prosecute wars and trials as if they were marks of manhood, and destroy those who won't follow the most ludicrous of orders. This can be said not only of World War I, but also of almost every military conflict that has come in its wake, from World War II to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. What is equally important is how Kubrick, often criticized in his career as a cold director, is able to depict the best of humanity (in Douglas and the three men he has to defend) against both the inhumanity of the kind of trench warfare that World War I was, and the basic inhuman bureaucracy represented by Macready, Menjou, and Anderson. PATHS OF GLORY, much like the similar Lewis Milestone classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, is a hard-hitting look at what war does; and unlike so many jingoistic films of the war genre, it shows how it damages soldiers and also how it absolutely corrupts commanders.<br/><br/>Kubrick shot most of this film in the countryside outside of Munich, West Germany, and he gets the most out of his actors, including Douglas (in one of his most powerful and humane performances), while Menjou and Macready accurately depict the toadying commanders who plan and decide with only glory in their minds (but as the old saying goes, ""the paths of glory lead but to the grave""). The end result in PATHS OF GLORY was a milestone film for Kubrick as a director, and a signpost for Hollywood that it could no longer depict war as merely a flag-waving, patriotic venture or grist for political propaganda. It is a masterpiece of the highest order, one of many in Kubrick's canon."
"manuel-pestalozzi","10","0","1","12 November 2012"," The Chain of Command
","This movie hits you like a ton of bricks. Like almost the whole work of Stanley Kubrick it tells a story about the failure of civilization. I do not see it as an anti-war movie or a historically accurate depiction of World Ware One but much more as a comment about large organizations. Principally, it deals with stalemate. The bosses have run out of ideas. They don't know what to do. But because their remaining in power depends on something - well, anything - being done, they risk the lives of thousands for enterprises that are highly unlikely to succeed. All the characters seem to be victims of a command: to make the impossible possible. The risks are unevenly distributed - as befits a vertically organized institution. The Paths of Glory is a story that is being told over and over, you can pick the settings yourself, it needn't be the trenches in Northern France, it could well be Wall Street or, for that matter, the European Union.<br/><br/>From an artistic point of view, I find Paths of Glory very satisfying, starting with the camera gliding flawlessly along the trenches down to the excellent set design by Ken Adam. The ending is the work of true genius. They way the jeering soldiers turn soft and melancholy is entirely convincing and unforgettable."

","Paths of Glory is a Stanley Kubrick film with all his trademark characteristics. Set in WW1 when a commander orders his artillery to fire on his own men to force them to attack enemy positions, the film follows the judgment of the three men (which were randomly chosen from the regiment) charged with cowardliness from not following the order to attack.<br/><br/>The film shows all of the classical Stanley Kubrick's tropes: a cynical view of the human condition, a highly negative view of war and of its dehumanizing effects over the men involved in it. This film, however, is not perfect and shows the limitations of making cinema in the 1950′s. Still, it is considered by many as Kubric's first great film, though I haven't yet watched his earlier films. I would say that all Kubric films that I have watched, which are Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odissey, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, are all round excellent and all deserve praise.<br/><br/>One thing that I have noticed is that I like Kubrics films more than other old films (I consider a film old if it was made before Star Wars)."

Ferol, Timothy Carey, from being executed for cowardice to cover-up the mindless and disastrous mistakes of their superior officer scare faced General Mireau, George Mecready.<br/><br/>It's 1916 and there's a two year stalemate on the Western Front with the German and French armies locked into bloody combat with tens of thousands of men being killed and wounded in the fighting. Told by his boss General Broulard, Adolphe Menjou, to take the blood soaked Anthill from German hands Gen. Mireau at first is taken back by his superior's almost insane demand. The Anthill has been in German hands for the last two years despite being bombarded and assaulted by hundreds of thousand of French combat troops who were beaten back at every attempt; Suffering tens of thousand of casualties! Now Gen. Broulard expects Gen. Mireau to get the job done in one day with only a regiment of 8,000 French war weary and shell shocked troops!<br/><br/>As expected the assault on The Anthill was a total disaster with the Germans mowing down those French troopers who went over the top of the trenches as well as pinning down the French reserves who were supposed to do the mopping up after them. At the height of the fighting Gen. Mireau frustrated that his men, whom almost 90% were either dead wounded and no longer combat ready, weren't getting the job done ordered his own artillery units to bombarded them in order to get them to move forward! It's later when looking for a scapegoat for both his Gen. Mireau and his superior Gen.

Which in fact turned out to be a task ever more difficult if not as impossible then his men taking the Anthill!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** Great courtroom drama with Col.Dax getting stymied at every turn by the French Army brass in saving his men from execution. It's disgusting to watch how those French officers in charge of the ""trial"" didn't give a lick about the men whom they were judging not at all caring if they were or were not cowards under fire but doing everything to clear the real culprit's in this matter, the disastrous assault on the Anthill, Gen Broulard & Gen. Mireau from any responsibility! You don't have to guess what the results of the trial for the three condemned French soldiers was but there indeed was a real big surprise waiting for us in what happened later on in the film. Like rats turning on each other Gen. Broulard exposed Gen. Mireu's insane decision to kill his own men, by artillery fire, as some sort of revenge against them for not fully obeying his insane order to move ahead in a kamikaze like suicide assault against murderous German machine-gun and artillery fire. It turned out to be a small victory of sorts on Col. Dax's part in that he was the person who informed Gen, Broulard, with documented proof, of Gen.Mireau deranged order. But it came far too late to save the men that he was defending!<br/><br/>P.S As for the devious and back stabbing Gen.

","Despite its many virtues, and manifest greatness, Paths Of Glory did not get even a single Academy Award nomination, and was banned from many European film festivals, due to French protests. That the film was released just shortly after David Lean's first epic, The Bridge On The River Kwai, no doubt was part of the reason, for that film- a widescreen Cinemascope blockbuster, in color, from a major studio- is also a great war film, albeit from a wholly different end of the spectrum. Which returns me to my earlier point, that Paths Of Glory is not merely a war film nor an anti-war film. It is both, and revels in such. As French filmmaker Francois Truffaut aptly noted, all war films hold a power that makes calling them anti-war ridiculous. We can not be fully realized human beings without acknowledging that we love war and killing, and war films indulge this, even if they sometimes slip anti-war messages within them. The thrilling shots of Dax leading his men in No Man's Land prove this.<br/><br/>Of course, there are always people and critics who will whiff on even the greatest works of art. Bosley Crowther, the ridiculously bad film critic for the New York Times, wrote:<br/><br/>We feel that Mr. Kubrick--and Mr. Douglas--have made a damaging mistake in playing it in colloquial English, with American accents and attitudes, while studiously making it look as much as possible like a document of the French Army in World War I. The illusion of reality is blown completely whenever anybody talks.<br/><br/>This sort of comment, by Crowther, is akin to those many bad critics make in defense of subtitling over dubbing foreign films. Anyone who is hung up on the American accents of an American made film, wherever it is set, simply is invalidating their worth as a critic of note.<br/><br/>Paths Of Glory is a great film, made by a great director at the start of a career that is nonpareil in American cinema. The Criterion Collection has also don eon eof its best jobs, in recent years, of restoring this classic, and surrounding it with features that are worthy of the art they comment upon. War may be hell, but this release is Kubrickian heaven. If you've never seen the film before, or merely want to see it again, this is the release to engage."

","Although less than 90 minutes in length, Paths of Glory has a great amount of depth in the scenario it presents. A critical anti – war perspective on how formal war can be and how it distances itself from humanity.<br/><br/>Their lavish surroundings immediately showing the gap between themselves and their troops, Generals Broulard and Mireau hatch a plan to overtake the Ant Hill. Yet even though they are fully aware that they do not have enough troops to overtake the Ant Hill successfully they simply push on with the plan. This shows no respect for their troops resulting in a complete disaster. This scene establishes the direction of George Macready and Adolphe Menjou performances, playing men so stubborn in their ethics that they are excellent within the narrative as the aloof villains.<br/><br/>Lead by Col Dax, the troops try but fail to complete their mission. Again the gap between authority and their troops is conveyed. Whilst the camera makes memorable tracking shots of Dax and the troops advancing against bullets and shellfire, Mireau and his colleagues watch the fighting from a safe distance. It is oblivious who the sympathy lies with here, the fighting is shown through close tracking shots and close ups of the soldiers in no man's land whilst Mireau in a distant long shot orders his own troops to be shelled for not advancing ignorance to their plight. The abuse of power does not stop there.<br/><br/>Unwilling to listen to reason he along with Broulard agree to hold a trail to judge three chosen soldiers. This leads to a trail which can only be described as a masquerade as there is already a predetermined outcome. It is from this point on where the levels of humanity are severely contrasted. Dax removes himself from the coldness of authority. Not only does he offer himself to be shot for being the commanding officer for the ill fated mission but then decides he will defend the three men showing his loyalty and heartfelt sympathy to his troops unlike Broulard and Mireau.<br/><br/>This is where Kirk Douglas' performance becomes its most passionate. A man willing to defend the accused making his presence felt using the tone of his voice to get across his character's standpoint on the issue most memorably stating ""I am ashamed to be a member of the human race and this is one such occasion"" stressing the contrast of the court's humanity. However Dax's efforts are in vain as the soldiers were not given a fair trial and are sentenced to death. Not only are we shown the injustice of their execution through the completion of the act but also the hopelessness the condemned soldiers feel. Cpl Paris compares himself to a cockroach stating it will live through tomorrow while he will not. Even later in their final moments they are not given dignity, with one of the condemned executed whilst injured and confined to a stretcher. It puts the situation in context of Paths of Glory's humanist theme.<br/><br/>Even at Paths of Glory's finale a dim view of humanity continues to be shown even at the sight of hope. Dax, feeling defeated and angry by his hierarchy, watches the troops in a moving final scene. Listening to the beauty of a young woman's voice begins to let out the emotions of the troops. A montage of the troops still faced with tears welling in their eyes. It shows us not only that these troops underneath their exteriors are human but it becomes a piece of tragedy at the thought of these men dying because of people like Broulard and Mireau's take on humanity is futile. ""Give them a few more minutes"", Dax states knowing what Broulard and Mireau failed to realise in terms of the troops humanity as well as the somber knowledge of the inhumanity which will continue to rule the reins.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory sums up the stains trusted on humanity and its devastating effects. How the ones who do not appreciate its core cause recklessness are ironically in power to preserve their countries civilisation."

","Fans of Stanley's Kubrick latter, more celebrated output (from Dr. Strangelove onwards) may find it jarring to realize how little Paths of Glory feels like a Kubrick film. On one hand, it may be considered Kubrick's first real classic (unless you love The Killing, which I don't); on the other, he didn't quite find his own voice yet. It's a mixed blessing - Paths of Glory isn't quite as mesmerizing or stylish as The Shining, A Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket; but it's much tighter and more focused than any of those. It's also far more human and more realistic.<br/><br/>The strange result is that while Paths of Glory isn't quite one of Kubrick's greatest classic, it's one of his best films and, as a matter of fact, one of the best films of the 50's. It's also one of the finest war films ever made, and practically one of a kind within the genre; Paths of Glory isn't about the chaos and hell of war (like Kubrick's own wildly chaotic Full Metal Jacket) but rather about its effect on people; as such, it's a surprisingly subtle and poetic affair, focusing on characters and scenes of extremely powerful quietness. The acting is terrific all around, so much so that Kirk Douglas's character - the moral compass of the story - may be the least interesting of them. The fascinating ones are the flawed characters - those are the ones who make Paths of Glory both incredibly realistic for its time and a potent and powerful allegory."

Paths of Glory is overwhelmingly negative, so the effect is overwhelmingly positive.<br/><br/>Like a great, one cannot fully explain the reasons that make this great. The film opens to a general bullying another general. Eventually the second gives in, upon the issue of a promotion coming into question. He then passes the ridiculous order onto Dax (Kirk Douglas) who has no choice but to accept, despite being told just how bad it will be. We are then treated to some fantastic trench tracking shots,and then the battle occurs: it's chilling. A massive slaughter, very busy. Extraordinarily well done. Despite this, there's more courtroom drama than action, and the dialogue (and script) holds up excellently. There are some simply brilliant lines.<br/><br/>Kubrick could finally go epic, with sweeping war scenes and indulgent 'civilized' halls. In a recurring pattern, the film is a technical marvel, with tight trenches, craters of mud, and explosions occurring feet from living actors. There are fantastic shots, namely the famous tracking shots, as well as trademark Kubrick lighting and nerve wracking music. <br/><br/>Like another 1957 war film, the Bridge on the River Kwai, futility is king. If the enemy won't kill these men, we will! Ridiculous logic from ridiculous men. This film was banned in France for years, but it could've been applied to any nation: Britain, Russia, even Germany. <br/><br/>The emotions of Paths of Glory are superbly delivered by the cast. Steely Kirk Douglas leads as Col. Dax, the man of honour, who honestly fights for his men selflessly, and leads to a spectacular outburst at the end. And you can tell it's going to happen throughout the film, he has a pent- up rage just beneath his skin. Opposite him are the two ignorant generals. Actors Macready and Menjou are great playing terribly self centered men, thinking more of their status than the status of their men. The soldiers show true desperation, such as Timothy Carey in a complete reversal from his hilarious role in the Killing. It's all gut wrenching.<br/><br/>Then comes the ending, which wraps everything up that was started in this 88 minute epic. I won't spoil anything, except say that it's very fitting and hammers in the point, unlike Killer's Kiss which uprooted the entire film.<br/><br/>If I haven't gotten it across to you, Paths of Glory is a fantastic anti war film where the good guys aren't the good guys, and with power comes irresponsibility. Even in black and white the film feels very modern. 9.2/10"
"classicsoncall","9","0","1","18 March 2012"," ""One way to maintain discipline is to shoot a man now and then.""
","I would give this film a perfect ten rating except for a couple of points. During their initial conversation about taking the Anthill, General Mireau (George Macready) emphatically states that the safety of the men under his command is more important than sending them to certain death on an impossible suicide mission. Yet in virtually the very next scene he's shown making his rounds in the trenches determined to stiffen the men for the very same engagement he railed against earlier. He seemed to disregard an opportunity for a promotion while disagreeing with General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), but the only thing that seems to make sense is that he changed his mind about that.<br/><br/>The other point has to do with the consequence of failing to take the Anthill. What was it? The bitter history of World War I was that the opposing French and German forces waged a virtually immobile war with dug in positions that resulted in the deaths of millions. So by not taking the Anthill, an impossibility demonstrated in the story, nothing changed to influence this battle or the larger War, except to serve as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobeying orders.<br/><br/>There's one more thing. The premise of the picture began with that conversation between Broulard and Mireau. When all was said and done, General Broulard comes out unfazed and unaffected by the very circumstances he set in motion. Possibly the most damning indictment of military intelligence to ever be portrayed on film, though virtually all of that nuance is lost if I were to rely on the handful of reviews I read before setting down my own.<br/><br/>With all of that considered, ""Paths of Glory"" is a remarkable film illustrating the bitter irony of war when it's circumstantial victims boil down to real soldiers and not a faceless army. There's a considered ambiguity in the selection of three men to face a charge of cowardice based on relationships and circumstances that had gone before. Which makes Colonel Dax's (Kirk Douglas) choice of Lt. Roget (Wayne Morris) to command the firing squad a somewhat fitting decision in the midst of all the insanity otherwise.<br/><br/>There are reasons nations go to war, sometimes for noble reasons and sometimes not. Soldiers know their duty in the chain of command, but I don't know if I've ever heard it expressed any better about how a soldier faces his mortality under battle conditions than in this film. Recall the foxhole scene between the pair of soldiers who were otherwise not prominent in the picture. Discussing their possible fate, one offers the following insight - ""I'm not afraid of dying tomorrow, only of getting killed."""

","There are lots of so-called anti-war films out there, which focus on showing the inhumanity of war by pointing the camera at soldiers who are shot, blown up, mutilated, that sort of thing. Often these movies lack the necessary reflection related to the shown violence, and assume that this already takes care of itself, and this is a really sad story. The result may lead the phenomenon that some people enjoy such movies because of what they see, not what the film is meant to be about. And thus it might be safer to call such movies ""war films"" rather than ""anti-war"". Well, ""Paths of Glory"" is different. It focuses on the individuals, the executors in the command chain, on those, who are forced to make decisions about life and death, those, who have to survive or make achievements against all odds, who therefore use others to save face.<br/><br/>Kubrick's film is short, but very intense and poignant and goes far beyond the regular motion picture which just happens to be about war. It forces the main dilemmas of a stone-cold war machinery to the surface, where everyone has to play their role and humanity has no place in it, where absurdity is method. ""Path of Glory"" is a benchmark as far as anti-war movies are concerned, and this also has to be said about one of the most touching final scenes ever. In it Kubrick immortalized his later wife, whose performance gets under one's skin and suggests to us that there are also humans fighting on the other side, caught in the very same inhuman war machinery. There are films that last more than three hours and fail to make a point about war - Kubrick only needs his German wife and three minutes to make this point."

","Paths of Glory-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick. Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham, Jim Thompson, Starring: Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, Adolphe Menjou, George Macready, Wayne Morris, Richard Anderson, Timothy Carey, Suzanne Christian, Bert Freed.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's second masterpiece after The Killing follows an insane general who sends his men on a suicide mission during WWI. When the men ultimately fail, he charges three men to represent the force and be executed for cowardice much to Douglas' disgust.<br/><br/>This film is the first of his that directly represents his recurring theme of dehumanization. Kubrick is not making a common war film that promotes battle, but his film is less straightforward in the fact that we do not learn whether or not Kubrick is for or against war. Are Kubrick's speculations that of a warmonger or a pacifist? He never answers those questions for us, but the effect he creates is a terrifying sense of realistic horror.<br/><br/>He shows us how much military and war takes away the thing that makes us human. The general is barely a human, but is programmed as a warmonger. He represents the loss of humanity, his very character makes us shiver because he is a character we are used to, but seeing it in a form of art develops reactions we normally would not have. This film strips away the military mentalities and reveals the soldiers and the generals as they really are. We see multiple reactions from the characters. <br/><br/>We see acts of cruelty, cowardice, and sometimes even sadism amongst the soldiers. We also see acts of bravery and compassion amongst them. Kubrick reveals true character and the results are sometimes not quite what we might want them to be of the soldiers, which reveals our inner feelings. Our responses define the way we look at war and cowardice. Some people sit through with an iron face, some look away, some cry in pity, and some may even laugh at the sheer cowardice of the soldiers about to be executed. These reactions are often disturbing and Kubrick brings them out of us without being sadistic in violence. Kubrick knows his audience and he understands the reactions, so there are little feelings of self-pity when a sadistic reaction is provoked by a scene of cowardice or a scene of cruelty.<br/><br/>The genius of the movie is how Kubrick gets to mechanical reactions as well as emotional reactions to his subject matter. His masterful storytelling is neither sentimental nor nihilistic but it brings out both of those feelings from us. It's because we sometimes do not know the way we should react to what is going on. We are confused by the way the film presents war with such searing honesty and symbolism."

","Too many war films claim to condemn their subject matter with one hand whilst making pornographic use of battlefield bloodshed with the other. Kubrick's second studio picture, banned in France until 1975, was truly controversial, but not because of the violence.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) asks General Mireau (George Macready) to command his division to storm the Ant Hill, an unassailable German target across no-man's land. Sniffing promotion, Mireau agrees. And so it is down to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to undertake the impossible mission. When it fails, Mireau blames Dax's soldiers, and three of them are chosen to be tried for cowardice. The trial turns out to be Dax's second impossible mission.<br/><br/>At under 90 minutes, it's remarkable how many themes are explored. And these are the big ones, too: courage, belief, fear and, most significantly, humanity. Dax is a moral man in a war-torn world where humanity does not exist - and not simply on the battlefield, but in the general's headquarters. All hope seems spent when Broulard confronts Dax in one of the final scenes, and is surprised to find that the colonel's actions truly came from a position of morality. But then some light in the darkness: a German singer (Susanne Christian, who would later become Kubrick's wife) touches the souls of his men; observing the scene reminds Dax that hope does still exist - just not in war."

","General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) of the French General Staff asks his subordinate, General Mireau (George Macready), to send his division on a suicidal mission to take a well-defended German position called the ""Anthill"". Mireau initially advises against the attack, citing the low probability of success and the danger to his beloved soldiers, but when General Broulard mentions the possibility of a promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.<br/><br/>In a sense, this film anticipates ""Hamburger Hill"", with the military's focus on one impossible task. Though, I don't think this film is historically accurate, and they don't really seem too concerned when they don't make it.<br/><br/>The theme seems to be glory over pragmatism, over perhaps glory versus pragmatism. To achieve glory, the soldiers have to accept a mission that will surely lead to their death. From the point of view of the officers (who command but don't fight), glory is an easy choice. But pragmatism, choosing the best option at the moment, is seen as cowardice, despite saving the lives of the men and having them alive to fight another day. In war, who wins this struggle? <br/><br/>Kirk Douglas is excellent as Dax, excellent during the trial scene, which I saw as the pivotal part. Along with Douglas, I have to single out Timothy Carey, who made the scene great, and was also excellent in ""The Killing"". (Carey went on to be one of Hollywood's great character actors, and the man behind ""The World's Greatest Sinner"".) <br/><br/>Last but not least, this film showcases Kubrick's hot wife... it's no surprise that he was attracted to her, and they had many years of marriage... presumably happy."

"Lejink","8","0","1","17 February 2010"," Devastating anti-war polemic from Kubrick
","My dad raves about this film and he's rarely wrong in his opinion about movies so I finally settled down to watch this taped-at-Christmas movie after putting it off as a deferred anticipated pleasure for long enough.<br/><br/>It's self-evident that in the world in which we live, war films will always be topical and it can be difficult for film-makers to get across the requisite pacifist message with originality in an overcrowded field. Indeed I'm no great lover of war films per se, bludgeoned too much about the head I guess by the likes of John Wayne, Audie Murphy and others of that ilk over-simplifying and grossly simplifying the very complex human emotions which drive or in some cases hinder the ranks of ordinary men (and although not in this film, women) called up to fight for their country in the prime of their lives.<br/><br/>Kubrick chooses to focus in on a seemingly minor uprising in the French army on the German Front in the First World War, which no doubt then, as now, would get buried away in the ""Classified"" files in case its exposure damaged troop morale but goes far deeper in analysing the actions of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances with not all displaying what Hemingway termed grace under pressure. This is actually as it should be and draws the viewer's empathy as we see that all life truly is here in the fictional drama. As for the ivory-tower generals who unfeelingly treat their exhausted and dispirited underlings like sacrificial pawns to the slaughter, Kubrick delivers to them his greatest opprobrium, highlighting their self-serving, manipulative and downright callous traits, always passing the buck away from their desk.<br/><br/>From several scenes which etch themselves deep in the memory, I'll highlight two for brevity's sake - firstly where Kubrick completes the lengthy and engrossing if dispiriting court-martial scene by cutting away from its expected climax by moving straight onto a scene with the now-condemned men already awaiting their execution - completely excising the delivering of a clichéd verdict scene, so much of a foregone conclusion is it in the ""kangaroo court"" against which Kirk Douglas' character rages in vain. Kubrick then rounds off the film with the deeply moving extended scene where you fear for the safety of a captured pretty young German girl, made to sing for her supper and who knows what afterwards you fear, by a clamouring crowd of no doubt sex-starved troops, who with Douglas waiting outside to intercede, collectively draw back from the brink of primitivism as they one by one realise that this girl could be their daughter, sister or wife, as helplessly caught up in the madness of war as they are.<br/><br/>The acting from top to bottom is terrific, Douglas brilliant in a non-action role, wholly immersed in his character's moral dilemma with George McReady and especially Adolphe Menjou, heretofore considered by me as a lightweight comedic actor, ably displaying the venality and shiftiness of the powers that be. The rest of the acting by Kubrick's ensemble as the battle-weary soldiers is also superb. The black and white cinematography hits home too in its convincing depiction of life in the trenches.<br/><br/>This is a great film conveying the universal anti-war message with rare subtlety and conviction."

That film is essential, and as meaningful today as the day it was made."" <br/><br/>Kubrick, Willingham and Jim Thompson (the three screenwriters) also discuss the dehumanising influence institutions have on those caught within the hierarchical web. Example: Very early General Mireau forsakes his 8,000 for promotion, not long after Cpl. Paris and Sgn. Boulanger come to an arrangement in relation to the botched reconnaissance, company commanders are cruelly ordered to select individuals for the firing squad, the firing squad is detailed and Sgn, Boulanger put in charge (having selected Cpl. Paris to face it): The institution nags at us, eats at us, never leaves us alone and slowly, little by little, we lose our individuality and finally, as demonstrated by the Generals, our humanity.<br/><br/>Only Colonel Dax resists the institution, firstly when he's invited to take leave on objecting to the mission and, later, when he refuses promotion – later, Kirk Douglas encouraged a public perception of himself in that same role in real life, as did Kubrick.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, an observation is clearly made about the Catholic Church's deference to - and even implicit support of - military power, this some 12 years after WW2 concluded.

Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion! <br/><br/>Winston Churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest to evoking the atmosphere of WW1 and the military mind.

The efficiency of Kubrick's direction is proof of a great man at work.<br/><br/>The performances were superb. As the general who orders the hopeless attack on the German position, Adolphe Menjou's character is perceived as a villain not because of being an officer adhering to the letter, but that he is seen as ""the arrogant aristocrat"" because of his fear of the working classes than his hatred of the enemy. Among the cast, Timothy Carey and Kirk Douglas especially were outstanding. And the music? That is one rousing score I can tell you. Great movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

If there really was such a thing as ""dying for your country,"" it would be stupid enough, but no one ever really dies for their country - they die to appease the small-penis insecurities and greed of the low, gutless swine who ordered them into war.<br/><br/>From the book by Humphrey Cobb, Stanley Kubrick directs PATHS OF GLORY - an outraged, frustrated scream against the duplicity, mendacity, idiocy, inhumaneness and ingloriousness of war.<br/><br/>For two years, a platoon of WWI French soldiers have been fighting futilely against Germans in trench warfare. Led by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), they are ordered to storm a German fortification by their cowardly commanders, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) and General Mireau (George Macready, who looks and acts ominously like Dick Cheney). The attack is a failure, but the Generals - who think nothing of losing ""51-percent casualties for the sake of moving their line ahead,"" refuse to acknowledge the impossibility of success or their own lack of strategy and stupidity, and scapegoat three men from Dax's platoon to be tried and executed for cowardice, as the reason for the failure.<br/><br/>Outraged at the injustice, Dax does all he can to stay the execution, meeting with Broulard and Mireau to plead not just clemency, but to avoid descent into the madness of arbitrary slaughter of their own men simply for the Generals to save face; further, Dax acts as legal counsel for the doomed men. All in vain. High command will have its blood - from the enemy's side, or their own.<br/><br/>Cobb's tale has not dated in half a century, its message, its impact, its depiction of low men in high places. Though PATHS depicts French officers heartlessly regarding their men as cannon fodder, the same attitude is adopted by every single faction that enters into war - the high commanders seeing their militia as statistics and the officers closer to the ranks becoming greater idealists, like Dax. (But who am I to talk? The closest I've come to trench warfare is taking cover behind rows of school desks and launching lethal shoes at my enemies before the teacher arrived and sent us all to the principal.) <br/><br/>For its unafraid camera (Kubrick pans through rows of trench gutters, over shattered bodies, through glutting mud and ear-damaging explosions - all in stark black and white) and fearless unpatriotic concepts (Mireau orders his own men fired upon to get them out of the trenches, Dax goes hell-bent insubordinate against his superiors to save his men), PATHS inspires outrage, but could it have been all that hard for Americans and Brits to enact these foreign roles so convincingly and make the Froggies look like buttered croissants? Even though Kubrick portrays war as ludicrous on every level, from the fighting to the politics, we are left with the image of the French being ludicrous. So ludicrous that the French banned PATHS OF GLORY in France until 1975.<br/><br/>But the message is still damning in its intensity. PATHS is so disturbing and cloying that the irony of its title is like a sledgehammer to the spine - unlike almost every other war movie existent, from then to now, we clearly see there IS no ""glory"" in war. And ""war"" these days covers every underhanded business decision (like George W. Bush's ignominious Iraq defeat) and political and religious skirmish (from monks in Myanmar to Iranian elections). And the very same contradictory insanities in PATHS OF GLORY continue right now: The Geneva Convention clearly delineates torture as a war crime (Article 17, Article 130, and others from 1949) - yet Bush tortures in the name of America and remains unconvicted, he jails soldiers who refuse to torture for their disobedience to his dictatorship, then jails scapegoats who DID torture to gain political capital; while Barack Obama allows CIA operatives who tortured to remain free, citing their excuse (""just following orders"") as valid, even though this same excuse incarcerated those at Nuremberg...<br/><br/>There is no Hollywood Eleventh Hour stay of execution in PATHS OF GLORY.

","How I hadn't even heard of this film until now, I will never know. Here we see Kubrick establishing his knack for realising beautiful cinematic landscapes and giving depth to characters through the mise-en-scène. In many scenes, a character's position within the frame defines his level of power  men of lower ranks are visually lower down than their superiors, individuals are cut off from their peers by borders in the background. Perhaps the most conspicuous example of this is when the three accused soldiers are on trial. When each individual soldier is questioned, he is framed in a medium close-up, with his superiors a fair distance behind him. This allows us to relate more to him, as he is essentially nearer to us than the others.<br/><br/>The camera-work isn't limited to static framing. I was hugely impressed with a typically Kubrickian tracking shot wherein we see Colonel Dax walk through the trenches. The shot is intercut with footage of the same route, but from Dax's point of view, observing the soldiers as they cower and wince at every explosion. The two shots intertwine to contrast the reactions to war from different ranks  Colonel Dax puts on an unshakably blank front, while the inexperienced soldiers have a very immediate, natural response.<br/><br/>Towards the emotional climax, a few biblical connotations come into play. There is one scene where the soldiers are being given their last rites that brought to mind a Caravaggio painting, followed closely by their execution, where the audience's consistent empathy might have grown strong enough to see them as martyrs."

Paul succeeds in capturing the Ant Hill post. General Paul agrees and offers a similar promotional offer to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to inspire and motivate his already weak and beaten down battalion to charge Ant Hill post and capture it. Colonet Dax tries to execute the order, but fails and looses the battle with many of his men dead or injured. Gen. Paul is disappointed by the battalion (especially Majors and Sergeants) who disobeys his direct orders and wants to set an example for the French army (by executing 100 French soldiers of the battalion). Three innocent soldiers are selected randomly from the battalion for execution. A court martial takes place where Col. Dax unsuccessfully acts as a defence counsel. In the end these three innocent French soldiers are executed in front of the French army by French soldiers.<br/><br/>The most poignant scene is the last scene of the movie when Col. Dax walks back to his barracks and finds the comrades of the executed soldiers sitting merrily in the pub laughing and singing  as if nothing has happened.<br/><br/>The movie is excellent. It portrays the politics of war, of institutions, of organizations where there are hierarchies and systems of rewards and punishment. Though the movie is more than 50 years old, the movie remains relevant in making a real mockery of today's organisation structures we work in.<br/><br/>Reputed director Stanley Kubrick  what praise one can bestow upon him? Few and far between (especially after 50s) but he has delivered great memorable movies for each generations to see and remember.<br/><br/>All the actors are top class; especially the charm of Kirk Douglas is irresistible. The shrewdness of Gen. George character is presently excellently  and we find similar evil character around us in every organisation, who can play the game of being pleasing in cunning garbs  every moment.<br/><br/>This movie is a small 87 minute marvel that tells and gives enormous insights to the emergence of management organisations directly from ridiculous army ghettos.

","I don't know what happened to all those film experts at the Baftas and the Oscars in 1957, but it must have been pretty severe as neither of them seemed to recognise the brilliance of either this film or that of Sweet Smell of Success, both of which can hold their own against the epic Bridge on the River Kwai and courtroom dramas 12 Angry Men and Witness for the Prosecution, also from that year, and all of which I have seen.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory may not be a happy tale, but it is a realistic one. Kirk Douglas is excellent as the colonel who, despite holding military rank, is almost helpless in preventing the atrocious court marshalling of innocent soldiers. George Macready is also good as a sadistic general gone mad with power.<br/><br/>For me though, it was Adolphe Menjou who stood out as a two faced general, cheerful in public, but even worse than Macready in private. Invested with the power to stop the execution and bring down Macready's character, he holds back and does nothing. Later, he plans Macready's downfall while genuinely puzzled as to why Douglas is disgusted with him.<br/><br/>There was no happy ending to Paths of Glory; instead, Kubrick(for it is he) gave us a savage dose of reality. The direction of the film was superb, especially the scene when the regiment goes over the top: the depiction of trench warfare was one of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>If I had the power to choose the academy award winners in 1957, I would have given the best director award to Stanley Kubrick, but I would probably have given best picture to Sweet Smell of Success."

","Stanley Kubrick, like playwright Arthur Miller is one of that elite band of artists whose works rise above country and time to become universal and timeless.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly the movie was banned for many years in France but in reality it could have been set in almost any country - and that country would have most likely either banned it officially - or, as almost amounts to the same thing, not distributed it. France was perhaps simply a convenient other country on which to hook a universal story. Unfortunately many of the audience may have seen it as an expose of the French Army - and for that matter the French more generally.<br/><br/>Yet is it anti-war? Certainly not directly. It said little or nothing about the massive casualties - it concerns the fate of just three men. Does it say no war is worth fighting? It is in truth completely silent on that. What then does it say? I think that it says that over and beyond killing and suffering, war leads to another kind of inhumanity - when those ordering others to die may be persuaded against their conscience to do so for the basest of personal reasons. In fact the motives of the high command in the movie seem purer - they simply wanted the elusive ""breakthrough"" and made the judgement that the cost in soldier's lives was in that immortal phrase ""a price worth paying"".<br/><br/>The clincher for greatness and perhaps the real message was the scene where French soldiers are reduced to tears while listening to the shy pretty German waitress singing homely German songs. Few of the soldiers would have understood the language - although all instinctively understood what underlay it: the softer side of common humanity without borders or flags. Their tears one supposes come from their recognising that fact - and that they have been killing and are being killed because of something that has no place for that common humanity."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","9","0","1","10 February 2008"," A war film not rooted in any one historical moment.
","Every serious war movie is in a large sense the same. It shows the horrible things that happen during it. From the combat out in the bloody battlefield to the war each man fights in his own head. Every serious movie is in a large sense different. It shows those horrible things from a different angle. In 'Paths of Glory' the view point is that of Colonel Dax, a respected officer in the French trenches of the First World War. His latest orders are to take a German position only a couple hundred meters beyond his own trench and hold it until reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that General Mireau who orders the attack is fueled mainly by ego. Colonel Dax is driven more by strategic logic and what it means for the lives of his battle tired soldiers. A great scene is when Gen. Mireau lays out his plan to Col. Dax. He proudly walks through the rugged trenches, scolding men who appear cowardly (""There's no such thing as shell shock."") and ignoring wounded soldiers, but instead looking toward his objective. In this same scene Dax is clearly momentarily by the passing of some of his men who have torn limbs and faces. It is a scenes that lasts for about a minute, but it sets up the rest of the film brilliantly. Mireau's ego and Dax's loyalty to his men. But the shades of character aren't nearly that black and white. Dax is clearly driven to achieving the General's intended objective, but through the smoke and roar of the battlefield he somehow sees the futility of the matter and is later shocked when Mireau orders a court martial for cowardice from Dax's regiment.<br/><br/>As an older war film the special effects and battle scenes are quite tame by today's standards (especially after a film like 'Saving Private Ryan') but the examination of the military mind is positively fascinating. World War One is often viewed as a useless war and the issues at hand ""could have been settled at a table and not a battlefield"" is a quote that I remember from one of my high school history teachers. This is a war film that is not rooted in a particular historical moment, but it will remain relevant as long as there is a such a thing as war. --- 9/10<br/><br/>Not Rated, has violence. Ages 7+"
"slokes","10","0","1","25 October 2007"," The Enemy Is Us
","Stanley Kubrick reportedly said ""Paths Of Glory"" was not anti-war so much as anti-idiocy-in-power. Yet it's hard to tell when the idiocy begins and the war ends, one of many striking impressions left by this singularly striking film.<br/><br/>It is World War I, and French and German armies are stuck in an entrenched stalemate. Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) is ordered by his overbearing superior Gen. Mireau (George Macready) to take a German high position known as the ""Ant Hill"". Mireau is eying a promotion, so when Dax's soldiers are pushed back, he takes it personally and orders soldiers under Dax's command executed for cowardice. Dax takes their defense.<br/><br/>There are those who say director Stanley Kubrick had difficulty in his films with brevity and human feelings. I'm one of them. ""Paths Of Glory"" proves me wrong. It's less than 90 minutes from beginning to end, shorter than some R. Kelly videos, and packed throughout with a kind of raw emotion that tugs at you without slipping into sentiment or hyperbole. This is best displayed in the film's jawdropper of an ending, but always present, whether it's Dax leading his doomed command across No-Man's Land or two soldiers the night before asking each other earnestly if it's better to be shot or blown up.<br/><br/>You never glimpse so much as one German soldier in the entire film, even during the big attack, shot from the side at waist level as if the stricken Frenchmen are going to fall in your lap. The underlying of the movie may be war is hell, but it doesn't help when you are led by those with their own selfish agendas foremost in mind. As Pogo once said around this time: ""We have met the enemy and he is us.""<br/><br/>Douglas is the one star of this film, of course, and in impressive command throughout, whether bucking up his men or bandying words with slick Gen. Broulard (Adolphe Menjou). But Macready is the one who leaves the strongest impression, a character actor memorably parodied in his time by Lenny Bruce as a diabolically fast-talking airplane-glue addict. Clearly nuts at the start, Mireau seems utterly blissful in his ignorant selfishness, proclaiming himself ""the only completely innocent man in this whole affair"". The shame of it is, compared to Broulard, he is.<br/><br/>""If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones,"" Mireau screams after witnessing the near-decimation of Dax's command. But Broulard knows the men gave their best effort, and backs the executions anyway for ""morale"".<br/><br/>Great supporting performances, too, by Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel, and especially Timothy Carey as three condemned soldiers; Wayne Morris as a slippery lieutenant; and Richard Anderson, later Steve Austin's tan boss on ""The Six-Million-Dollar Man"", as Mireau's unctuous chief of staff, dedicated to seeing the men executed yet showing some understated remorse at the end.<br/><br/>No attempts are made by any of the cast at French accents; the only accents audible here are Brooklynese. Like another screen classic, ""Amadeus"", this makes the story feel less exotic and more natural to American ears, and hence less easy to dismiss as ""other people's problems"".<br/><br/>Ultimately this is Kubrick's film, though. In shot after memorable shot, he serves up a classic of economy and raw emotional power, and if you click on the ""trivia"" feature here, you find he got the girl besides. Kubrick made more celebrated films, but this is his best film ever, one of the best ever made."

","This is not exactly an all war film, but from director Stanley Kubrick it is still a great film, even Winston Churchill was impressed with it. Based on a true event in World War I, this film sees Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) taking his troops getting ready to go over the top of the trenches, with the command by the arrogant aristocrat General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou). It is during this battle that three of the troops disobey their orders to advance, they do not go too far, and this results in their court case. They are found guilty, and face execution by firing squad. The villain of the picture is the arrogant general for making a stupid order that would ultimately be sending his army to death, and not listening to the reasons for the troops not advancing.

","A French colonel is asked to take a crucial position from Germany in the First World War. The only problem is every one from top to bottom knows that it's an impossible task. The reason this campaign has to be carried out is that some promotions are based on the favorable outcome. In the middle of the campaign half the soldiers decide to back out and General in a personal vendetta orders the stationed army to fire at its own army. The orders are never carried out but army loses the campaign. The general can't take the defeat and asks colonel to pick three men from each battalion and court marshals them. This initiates a crude and realistic drama of personal politics and human misery.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant. Message of the film comes through in the first 5 minutes and keeps intact until a very sad ending. I felt miserable at the end of the film. It's a masterpiece. Dialogues are appropriate and narration is tight. Acting is world class. Direction is minimum and works in favor of the movie. It is not an anti-war film. It is about corruption of human minds.

","During the trench warfare of 1916, the French 701st Infantry, led by Colonel Dax, are ordered to attack an impregnable key strategic position. The attack is a complete disaster. To punish what they perceive as cowardice within the ranks, the generals in charge order three men to be picked at random and court-martialled.<br/><br/>This was Kubrick's first big-budget film (Douglas helped to finance it) and the first of his truly stunning works. It is an incredible indictment of the suicidal horrors of the First World War, but it tells its story with keen objectivity and meticulous detail. The imagery is unforgettable; the soldiers crawling through the mud, blood and barbed-wire of no-man's-land contrasted with the corpulent generals waltzing in the palatial opulence of their château. Kubrick's camera restlessly prowls the trenches, placing the viewer right in the middle of the action, and circles around the officers as they play their political games with one another. For me, this is Douglas' best performance; Dax is one of the great military heroes in cinema - a quiet, thoughtful man but also a powerful leader, who genuinely cares for his troops but is resigned to the hopelessness of the war. His sense of tragic astonishment as the court arbitrarily passes death-sentences on the scapegoats for a general's failed ambition is the very core of the film's humanity. The rest of the cast are equally fine, particularly the wearisome Meeker and the fuming Macready, and the film is simply brilliant on every technical level. Written by Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson, from a novel by Humphrey Cobb (the title of which comes from Thomas Gray's poem Elegy Written In A Country Churchyard). The film was banned in France and the German girl who appears in the final scene is Kubrick's wife, Christiane."

","World War I was supposed to be the war that would end all wars. Of course, history has shown otherwise. I read somewhere that Paths of Glory is the greatest anti-war film ever made. Yet, I have also read where some argue against the idea that the intent of the movie is to make an anti-war statement. Whether or not this was Kubrick's intention, the very human story of these French troops puts forth the message that war is not the answer. Vanity and the lust for power and prestige make the goals of even a just war unattainable. WW II shows us that the losers just go and regroup and plot revenge. What may be the most poignant, touching moment in cinema history is the scene at the end where the French soldiers are treated to entertainment by a Bavarian, Fraulein singer in a local tavern. When she comes out on the stage, the soldiers at first begin to jeer and make sexually charged statements that demean the woman and cause her obvious fear. But, when she begins to sing, the whole room suddenly becomes silent. Every soldier suddenly becomes emotionally touched, even overwhelmed, by the haunting beauty of the melody. Though they do not know German, they begin to hum along. In this moment, the soldiers are able to gain a glimpse of humanity in the one who is supposed to be the enemy.

As a film, it is pretty much a perfect film all round  even the length is appropriately short as to not allow for unnecessary sentiments to build up. Kirk Douglas does very well with his lead role, and he even felt that he worked so well under Kubrick's direction that he chose Kubrick to replace Anthony Mann as director of the epic 'Spartacus', a Hollywood success that lead Kubrick to be able to choose his own big budget projects."

","A great piece of work by director Stanley Kubrick, its only weakness being that it comes across a little too obviously as a piece of anti-war and anti-military propaganda (not that there's anything wrong with that, but I really don't care for being too openly preached at in the course of a movie.)<br/><br/>That is, however, the only weakness one could identify with this movie. Kirk Douglas put on a fabulous performance as Colonel Dax, a French Army officer during the First World War, whose troops are ordered to launch an impossible attack on a German position by their commander, General Broullard (Adolphe Menjou), only to then see three of the soldiers arrested as examples and subjected to a court martial for cowardice - defended by Dax - because the impossible attack failed.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the upper echelons of the military is not flattering. Broullard (although making frequent visits to the trenches) has little compassion for his men, treating projected casualty estimates as if they were, indeed, nothing more than numbers on a piece of paper. Death in battle is portrayed by virtually all the generals we're introduced to as a glorious thing, with even unjust executions being justified as necessary to build the morale of the remaining soldiers. The best line of the entire movie was spoken by Dax, who - after being subjected to one of those ridiculous arguments about how noble executions are - asks General Miraud (George Macready) ""do you really believe all that nonsense?""<br/><br/>The soldiers in the trenches are treated with respect by Kubrick, whose clear bias is against the decision-makers. Dax comes across in the film as the only truly noble officer, who really cares about his men and about justice and who despises the military caste for its insensitivity, corruption and just plain stupidity. (This being accounted for by Dax being a famous criminal lawyer in civilian life, rather than a career officer.) In fact, Dax is so noble that in the end General Miraud can't understand that everything Dax did was because he believed in it; Miraud preferring to believe that Dax was simply out for Broullard's command, and then dismissing him when he discovers that Dax is an honest man as a simple ""idealist."" The clear message is simple: there's no room for idealists in the military.<br/><br/>It's a well filmed movie; gritty in its realism. The trench scenes come across as believable, and the court martial scenes are compelling in their absurdity. All in all, an excellent film.<br/><br/>9/10"
"BlackJack_B","Null","0","1","19 July 2002"," The brilliance of Kubrick!
","It is amazing that Kubrick was only 29 years old when he directed Paths Of Glory. Despite his young age, he delivers a movie with the poise of an older man, a film that shows the horrors of war. As much as a war film, it's more of an indictment of war.<br/><br/>Kirk Douglas plays a Colonel in the French army during WW1. He has been ordered by his superiors the task of using his soldiers, many of them hurt or inexperienced, to make a run for an anthill being held by the Germans. However, this ragtag group fails so badly that they end up retreating. This doesn't sit well with the French generals, one of whom tries to kill off the battalion for cowardice. Later, Douglas must defend his corps in a court-martial to prove that they aren't cowards. He also fights to say his peace on how the evils of war have affected his own people.<br/><br/>There's no better 50's film that has shown the horrors of war better than this one. The horrific deaths suffered from the attempt to capture the anthill cannot be shaken easily. The fact that certain men feel that others are expendable to continue the needless wars is hammered home in my mind. It's a film that certainly shows how mindless it all is.<br/><br/>With a superb cast led by Kirk Douglas and Adolphe Menjou, a fine script, and lensed in simple-but elegant B&W, this stands out as one of the finest films ever made. You only wish that Kubrick and Orson Welles could have made more films, they were a cut above the usual fare."
"Evolvist","9","0","1","10 July 2002"," Always Needed
","What is amazing, and given that it was made in 1957, is the almost complete lack of ""cheese"" that this movie could have had. ""Paths of Glory"" was way ahead of its time as a war movie: a semi-film noir masterpiece that shows Kubrick stretching his wings and getting a real feel for the world outside of Leave It To Beaver. However, thank the great acting, as well, that carries this movie. Although the groups of actors, including the great Kirk Douglas, never even attempts to try out a French accent; nevertheless, the whole cast does a great job, and only a few times do the actors get carried away into some ""stage theatrics"" that was common in the movies of this time period.  But, we need WWI movies like this, and I am almost ashamed that I had not seen it until now. The photography is beautiful, as well as the realistic battle scenes, and please take special note of even how the soldiers wore their facial hair back in 1916. Everything looks authentic and down to the wire. Even the extras in the film are shown how they really were in the French enlisted army of that time: a mixture of all ages, from very young to men in their 50s. The complete absence of showing the Germans? The enemy is truly within! I could go on about this flick: from the walking down the trench scene, to the photographs of grand halls and architecture, but I will end here, and just say to watch this film, even if you are not a fan of ""old"" movies. Almost a 10!"

","This movie does not get the recognition it deserves; it is not only one of Kubrick's best works but one of the best films of any director I have ever seen.  It made little impact at the Oscars that year, and never shows up on things like the AFI 100 Years 100 Movies list, but it's great that IMDB users have placed it so high in the Top 250.  That inspired me to see it, and hopefully will many others.  For those who don't know, it's about an impossible attack during World War I that fails, and how the piggish army generals make three innocent subordinates the scapegoats and have them sentenced to death.  The movie is absolutely heart-wrenching without having to resort to the slightest bit of manipulation; I found myself wanting to lash out at the screen at times because I was so furious at the injustice of the matter.  Adolphe Menjou really sinks his teeth into the role of the main heavy, and Kirk Douglas is just exceptional as the angry officer fighting futilely for justice.  The interactions between the two of them are among the best dramatic scenes you will find anywhere, and the trial is horrifying, and yet so gripping.  At times such as the final scene, the movie is too poignant at times for me to even do justice with words.  All I can say is SEE IT!  It's a 10/10!!!!"
"Spleen","7","0","6","13 March 2002"," Kubrick is master of his craft, but the overall result is second-rate, especially by his standards
","Spoilers below.<br/><br/>Apparently it was Kubrick who, during production, suggested sparing the lives of the three scapegoats, and Kirk Douglas who angrily vetoed the idea. You can see why in each case.  Neither ending really works.  There's no way of getting the men off that doesn't feel phoney - but how IS it to end? Three times in a row, that's how.<br/><br/>First, there's the execution.  Horrific?  Not really: we'd seen it coming, indeed we'd almost seen it HAPPEN, during earlier scenes which had implied it, in the courtroom and the prisoners' cell.<br/><br/>Then, there's the scene at the villa in which Dax lashes out at his superiors.  British critic Robin Wood complained that this was just a cheap way of allowing audiences to vicariously ""tell off"" the bad guys.  I'm loath to admit this, given that the claim was made in a poorly argued, spiteful and often embarrassingly foolish book about Alfred Hitchcock, but on this particular occasion, he has a point.  It's a hollow climax.  The fact that Dax's heatedness is partly due to guilt only makes the moment still less convincing.  Oh well.  Again there's the problem: what WOULD work?  It's hard to say.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the coda, with the captured German girl singing for the French troops.  Now THAT'S the real stuff.  Nothing anywhere in the narrative prepares us for or plausibly leads into this scene, at once so delightful and so disturbing; if only Kubrick had been less single-minded, and allowed himself more moments like this earlier, we wouldn't feel so cheated when the film ends abruptly at this point, fading out just as it starts to get fired up.  And indeed, all subsequent Kubrick films would be considerably longer than ""Paths of Glory"", and contain less padding.  This would be the last occasion on which Kubrick had more technique than he new what to do with.  That technique is already fully formed, in almost every frame from the opening tracking shot to the execution; one doesn't know whether to applaud the technique or lament the lack of overall effect."

"brotheray","Null","0","1","12 September 2000"," Kubrick's a genius, blahblahblah
","Don't get me wrong-- his movie has a lot to recommend it.  Like all Stanley Kubrick movies, it's unconventional, challenging, and unlike anything any other director could craft.<br/><br/>However, in reading the comments listed here for Paths of Glory, it strikes me that when viewing the work of geniuses, a lot of people have trouble judging objectively.  This movie is undoubtedly a cut above the average war film, but can't we have an honest assessment?  For starters, Kubrick shows here in his early work his almost complete inability to work with actors. He simply does not get good perormances from his cast.  When an actor in one of his movies performs well, it seems almost like an accident.  To contrast Kubrick's work with actors with that of a true actor's director, compare Tom Cruise's performance in Eyes Wide Shut with his performance in Magnolia. Night and day.  Kirk Douglas gives a good performance in PoG, but when doesn't he?<br/><br/>Another problem I had with this movie is its flat dramatic arc.  Kubrick is so strong visually, but he doesn't always seem in command of the story he's telling.  Unlike another war movie dealing with a similar plot, The Caine Mutiny directed by the underappreciated Edward Dmytryk, this movie doesn't drive inevitably towards its climax and conflicts so much as it meanders to a conclusion.<br/><br/>And finally, has anyone else noticed that Kubrick's films almost all, at some point or another, go through at least a short period where they seem to be making fun of themselves?  The trial sequence in PoG had, to me, an unmistakable tone of mocking parody.  Maybe it's just me."

Kirk Douglas is the french (but strangely all american) hero who has proved himself not only on the battlefield but the court floor also, he is also a man who empathsises with his men, and so we see a patriot who understands the reasons for war, but a man who also understands the need for true justice.<br/><br/>Although the finale is a complete shock to anyone expecting sentimentality from Kubrick, we see how various forms of justice have been dispensed, even the cowardly leitenant, a man who should be on trial, and both of the hateful generals are made to see the full consequences of their actions."
"JJHLH1","10","0","1","29 May 2000"," One of the greatest films ever made.
","'Paths of Glory' is a masterpiece directed by Stanley Kubrick when he was still in his 20's.  This film demonstrates that a tight plot and strong characters are infinitely more important than special effects, gratuitous violence, profanity, and sex.  Don't get me wrong, if the latter are use sparingly and judiciously then they can add a lot to a movie.  The problem with too many films produced today is that they rely on these devices as crutches to support what is otherwise and inferior plot/film.<br/><br/>'Paths of Glory' demonstrates what would become classic Kubrick trademarks. For example, the wonderful long tracking shot of Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) walking through the trenches with the camera following immediately in front of him as he progresses.  Another example is the way Kubrick chooses a very wide angle far away view of the court martial proceedings interspersed with close ups of the major participants.<br/><br/>It's a shame this movie hasn't received the wide acclaim and respect that it deserves.  I have looked for this movie in many video rental stores including Blockbuster and almost none of them carry it.  They will have plenty of copies of silly comedies or markedly inferior dramas.  Yet, when they have the opportunity to put even one copy of this movie in the classic section (where it certainly belongs) they choose not to do so. Unbelievable!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, please do so.  Even if you have to buy your own copy.  It's that good."
"the dude-3","10","0","1","26 April 2000"," A genre unto himself.
","I was originally going to say that a third of Stanley Kubrick's films were about war, but that wouldn't be accurate.  A third of Stanley Kubrick's body of work were anti-war films.  Considering he only made 12 major films (not counting the five theatrically un-released) this is pretty significant.  He practically invented the anti-war genre with this film or at least made the first nationally recognized anti-war film.  His four major anti-war films could even fit the traditional genre cycle model.   ""Paths of Glory"" being his first anti-war film established the genre and thus was its novelty period.  His next anti-war film was ""Spartacus"" and this could be the classic period of the genre.  Next was ""Dr Strangelove or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb"" and this could be the revisionist period of the genre in which it takes a comedic turn.  Lastly was ""Full Metal Jacket"" which could fulfill the parodic period of the genre as it makes fun of itself.  These 4 films might have better fit the genre cycle if ""Dr. Strangelove"" was made after ""Full Metal Jacket"" but I'm not sure.  Anyway, it's a very interesting view of the four movies if you compare them. <br/><br/>
One thing that struck me in ""Paths of Glory"" was the German woman who sings at the end.  I may be wrong, but she is the only woman in the whole film, and I may again be wrong, but as I recall there was only one woman in ""Dr. Strangelove"" and one woman who was a main character in ""Full Metal Jacket"" (actually two, the Vietnamese prostitute and the assassin, but they could be considered the same woman).  This is very peculiar and thus very relevant in interpreting some of these films' meanings.  Most importantly, in all three of these films, the woman is something of the ""enemy""(somewhat of a stretch for the woman in ""Dr. Strangelove"" but she could be seen as an enemy as she keeps General Turgidson from doing his job and trades information between military officers.)  Also very important in two of the films is that they are the only enemy to be seen close-up.  In ""Paths of Glory"" the German singer at the end is the only time in the film the ""enemy"" is actually seen and this proves quite effective is demonstrating the absurdity of claiming she's essentially any different than the ""good guys.""  Also, in ""Full Metal Jacket"" the only enemy seen close up that's not dead is the assassin at the end who is not only female but a child and this is Kubrick's most wicked ploy as how could this young girl possibly be the enemy?"

""Kwai"" does a better job of describing the horrors of war.  The acting in ""Kwai"" is much better.  However, the screenplay for this movie is better than ""Kwai"".
