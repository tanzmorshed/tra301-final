","Pardon my knowledge on real life Chris Kyle but in terms of movie, this is awesome. I'm not from america and don't know more about the ""man"" Bradley portrayed. Bradley did and amazing job as well others. Sniper shots are directed brilliantly.<br/><br/>If you're not around from america and don't consider yourself letting in politics, chances are high that you will enjoy this movie."
"davidec23","1","1793","3041","20 January 2015"," Good ol'Murican propaganda
","When American Sniper first came out I ignored the film thinking that it was the usual war propaganda Hollywood delivers once a year. <br/><br/>After it received a couple of Oscar nominations I got a little curious and decided to go watch it. I am a big of Clint Eastwood and appreciate most of his work as a director, I am aware of his right-wing views and as I sat down in the theatre I was expecting a very patriotic story on the war in the Middle East.<br/><br/>But what I got was 2 hours of pure biased war propaganda. The story is supposed to be about a war hero, but what we get is a ruthless southern who kills ""bad guys"" because he saw some terrorist attacks against his country on TV. Not once are the his intentions questioned by either the character himself or others. The entire film just follows a one-track minded perspective on a ""just"" war. There is no morale to the story, there are no grey areas where the viewer is allowed to have an opinion and decide for himself what is right and what is wrong. <br/><br/>Now if this was satire, it would have been brilliant. The story of a redneck cowboy who after seeing some footage on TV about terrorist attacks decides he needs to protect his country by enrolling in the Navy and killing 150 people over 5000 miles away from where he lives, and without the slightest hesitation. But unfortunately it was not.<br/><br/>It is actually quite sad to see how low American cinema has stooped. The fact that people might actually believe this crap (and most Americans do) makes me lose hope for the future of a once great country.<br/><br/>There was a time when Hollywood war movies raised important questions on the righteousness of war (such as Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now) where the viewer was given the clear picture that all war, justified or unjustified, is wrong.<br/><br/>Nowadays most war movies are just commercials to get the American public behind the idea that invading a foreign country is a God given right.<br/><br/>The fact that it got nominated for the Academy Award just shows how much a once acclaimed award is quickly becoming a pat on the shoulder to the most politically correct motion picture of the year."
"Qrobur","1","2145","3660","13 January 2015"," This is a disgrace of a film
","First, let me say that Eastwood's direction, Cooper's acting and the screenplay are all competent. Were this film a wholly fictional account of a warrior with special skills put in the service of his comrades it would be quite serviceable, though no more than that.<br/><br/>However, here was an opportunity to show the complexities of a man hailed as an American hero; and by complexities, I mean the thoroughly odious aspects of Chris Kyle's character. The man enjoyed killing people, regarding his targets as savages, and he bragged about killing looters in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - even if he didn't, because we don't know for certain, what kind of man declares proudly his murderous inclinations? In short, he was far from a good man. Dismally, you would never know this from the simple-minded depiction of him as an all American Hero in Eastwood's film.<br/><br/>Likewise, there is not a shred of awareness in the film that the US involvement in Iraq might have been illegal and was certainly catastrophic for the Iraqis. The film's approach is to display every Iraqi man, woman and even child as intent on murdering ""good"" American troops and therefore deserving of their fate, both at the end of Kyle's rifle and under the boot of American troops generally.<br/><br/>I don't know what Eastwood was thinking when he made this film. Perhaps he saw an easy way to make money by appealing to the misplaced patriotism of some Americans. What I do know is that this is a disgusting film."

","The story of chris Kyle, one of u.s military best snipers is a story of how war affects a man's life and mind. The action sequences were great and Bradley cooper is fantastic as chris Kyle. I liked how the movie shows his journey of becoming a marine and his fears and inner conflicts of what to do when he's in sniper possession. From his childhood till the day he was killed helping another veteran. I just wished the scenes where he was with the other veterans were longer so it seems he has been through some sort of ""journey"" and now he is taking care of himself, trying to stay alive and well. To see him with the other veterans at the end of the movie helped me understand his suffer during the war. And I wished we would have seen more of it."

","Overall, a great movies, it takes a lot of time to explain not only the war but the relationship between the members of the same family and the friendship that are related during wars.<br/><br/>In this movie, Eastwood wanted us to feel like every soldier as and identity, this why he didn't only filmed only war sequences, there is a lot of people who died or are injured in this movie, it shows that those who dead should be remembered, they weren't only soldiers, sometimes they were husband or fathers.<br/><br/>For the family, it is always a tragic moment to lose someone no matter the danger that they have gone through during war.<br/><br/>Often now, Eastwood makes movie about real heroes who weren't recognized for their services soon enough. I think that it is a noble idea overall.<br/><br/>The only place where this movie is losing points, is that I feel that a certain part of the movie was more concentrated on killing a particular sniper of the enemy, The movie goes a little bit far by making a useless emphases on that aspect of the story.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie, it shows us that Clint Eastwood still make good movies, this one was even nominated for an Oscar."
"adeckofcards","8","19","26","19 June 2020"," The american hero
","Clint Eastwood has always expressed his devotion to his country, but probably where it becomes most evident is in 'American Sniper'.
The film tells the story of Chris Kyle, who was one of the best snipers in the history of the United States, standing out in the war against Iran. From this point on, the plot uses two narrative channels, one to tell the events of war and the other that shows the life of Chris Kyle with his family and the consequences of having been in a war. The first of these two narrative branches works flawlessly, with Eastwood even using western resources to recount the war. However, the other narrative path feels weaker in comparison. Probably because the topics displayed on screen do not have the necessary weight in the story or are treated in a slight way.
This film, like the latest by Clint Eastwood, aims to show the American hero in his purest state. He bets it all on leaving aside some themes that could have been better developed and that Eastwood himself has shown in other films of his filmography that he can do better."

"dudemisra","8","33","49","26 November 2019"," Eastwood's fitting and respected tribute to the US military
","American Sniper follows more than the life and career of Navy Seal Chris Kyle, it examines the Army, Marines, Navy and the Air Force and their involvement in the Battle of Ramadi, Iraq in 2006.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper grows in size and character as he fittingly transforms into the patriotic US Navy Seal Sniper Chris Kyle, showing nothing but grit and tenacity in his role as a Seal and a father, Cooper played this role exceptionally, so much so that I forgot he was acting, the whole movie just felt real in general. Sienna Miller also rises to the occasion as the honest yet loving wife to Kyle, her transformation in personality to when she met Kyle in a bar till minutes before she would see him for the last time forever was at a smooth and appropriate pace.<br/><br/>The film does show action and does a fairy good job at it, while not guns-blazing, is honest and simple with sequences such as front door breaches, Kyle's sniping snippets and the occasional Humvee (Vehicular) scenes. There is only one scene in the film where everything is havoc and that occurs right after Kyle snipes and records his longest kill against Mustafa, an Iraqi sniper working with ISIL militants.<br/><br/>However, the ending to this film is shocking because it was reality and Eastwood reminded us once more through a fitting and touching tribute about the contributions and tribulations of Chris Kyle. While the film is definitely American propaganda, the notion shouldn't stop us from dissecting and appreciating the cinematic and storytelling prowess of Eastwood showcased here.<br/><br/>Whether you're an American or non-American, we can all agree that Chris Kyle has made history for himself and his country and there is no-one who can do justice to his story and legacy other than Clint Eastwood."
"postsenthil","8","33","49","27 October 2019"," A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
","While widespread trail of death, destruction and displacement are the visible effects of war, its real brutality is in the less visible, or often invisible, albeit pronounced effects on the psyche of those who survive. For, it is they who have to live with the scars of war, picking up the shards of their shattered life. As against those who die and are consumed by the war, the survivors face the pain of death on a daily basis as they are relentlessly haunted by their commissions and omissions which could have made a meaningful difference.<br/><br/>In American Sniper, veteran director Clint Eastwood narrates the real life story of Chris Kyle (an excellent Bradley Cooper), an ace marksman of the US Navy SEALs, who in his four gruelling missions during the Iraq war, is credited with more than 160 confirmed kills - the highest ever for a sniper. The film is largely set in the wreckage of Iraqi towns where the invading US marines had to engage in deadly urban combat with deadly insurgents from the al-Qaeda. The nature of urban warfare necessitates the services of snipers like Chris Kyle who is perched in a position, far and high from the battleground, keep an eagle eye to protect his mates from any incoming threats.<br/><br/>While this setting provides for several thrilling and action packed moments, especially when confronted by an Olympian sniper from the other side, the focus of the film remains firmly on the psychological aspects of the war on Chris - Why he came to be what he is and what is he going through..? Even as he is highly effective in his role as a sniper in the battlefield and is celebrated as ""THE LEGEND"", we find that the war quickly consumes his psyche entirely. He is unable to shift his focus away from it even during his well deserved breaks away from the war zone when he is safely ensconced in the warmth of his home with a loving wife, Taya (an effective Sienna Miller) and his newborn son. The battle continues to rage on in his mind and brings on a firestorm of guilt and helplessness that singes his very soul and almost upends his normal family life which was moving on an even keel. As the distant war continues to cling on to him like an unyielding parasite and can he quell the very real threat it poses to unleash a turbulence on him and his loving family...? Check out the movie to know the answers.<br/><br/>Despite being an one-sided narrative which does not care to focus on the other side, Eastwood's movie which has strong resonance with his earlier westerns raises difficult, yet pertinent questions about the whole idea of heroism and violence. And, in a beefed up Bradley Cooper, he has an actor who has embodied the character so deeply with all its vulnerabilities and nuances that makes this movie tick as an almost meditative exploration into the troubled psyche of a celebrated war hero."

","American Sniper was such a fantastic film & a true story. The overall cast made the movie even better in my opinion! Action packed, love and heartache. Some intense scenes for certain individuals but the movie was absolutely incredible."
"r96sk","8","36","54","4 February 2020"," 'American Sniper' is very good
","A beautifully made film regarding a remarkable individual in Chris Kyle. Bradley Cooper plays the lead role tremendously, as Clint Eastwood & Co. set everything else up expertly. One or two, minor, pacing/editing issues aside, 'American Sniper' is very good."
"Tweekums","8","15","20","7 February 2017"," Bradley Cooper does a fine job playing sniper Chris Kyle
","This film is based on the story of Chris Kyle, a sniper in the US Navy Seals who earning to sobriquet 'The Legend' for the number of enemy combatants he killedÂ… more than any other member of the US Armed Forces.<br/><br/>The action opens in Iraq as he observes a woman giving what appears to be a grenade to a small boy; as the child runs towards US troops he must decide whether or not to take the shot. We then flash back to his childhood in rural Texas. Here his is taught to shoot by his father and also to stand up to bullies. As he grows up he becomes a ranch hand and rodeo starÂ… then he hears the news of terrorist attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and enlists in the Navy. He trains and eventually becomes a sniper with the elite Navy Seals. During this time he meets and marries Taya. Then the unthinkable happens; terrorists fly planes into the World Trade Center in New York and the rest is history.<br/><br/>We then return to Iraq and see that he takes the shot; the child is dead but he has saved lives. As his tour progresses he quickly becomes known for the number of enemy combatants he has killed. He is soon helping to hunt a particularly vicious enemy known as 'The Butcher' as well as an enemy sniper who had previously competed at the Olympics. After the tour he returns home but he isn't the same; his mind is still in Iraq. He returns for three more tours before finally returning home to his wife and two children but is still troubled.<br/><br/>Before watching this film I knew how Chris Kyle's story ended but not much else about him; this meant the details that were changed to make the film more dramatic didn't spoil it for me. Director Clint Eastwood tells the story in a no nonsense manner; there is little in the way of gung-ho flag waving nor is there condemnation of the war. Instead we see men doing a dangerous job in a dangerous place and the consequences it has for them. The action sequences are intense, especially the climactic battle which ends in a sandstorm. This scene brilliantly captured the confusion of war as we can hear gunfire but can only see the occasional silhouette. Bradley Cooper does a great job in the lead role; bringing an intensity to the character without making him some sort of super-soldier. Sienna Miller is fine in the supporting role of Taya; showing how those thousands of miles from the battlefield struggle while their loved ones are in danger. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for a good modern war film that doesn't shy away from showing the effects of war on those who take part."
"f-40457","9","28","41","24 January 2020"," The American Sniper
","In the film American Sniper the main summary is about Chris Kyle a sniper for the Navy seals. Chris Kyle is played in the movie by Bradley Cooper. Bradley Cooper is very well known Actor and plays the role very well. As we get to know some of the back story of the film, Chris Kyle was one of the most deadliest snipers to live. 255 kills but only 160 confirmed. In the beginning of the film Chris is a bronc rider in his mid 20's. He is unsatisfied with what he's doing with his life. Then throughout the movie it shows us how Chris becomes the man he is and was until his death in 2013.
Overall the film is a great way to learn how pressure with PTSD affects many people after and during a war. Chris fought a battle with PTSD when being home from fighting. Many military men have this when they come home. Some can change this but others can't. There are multiple movies based off the war in Iraq, but this one was focused on one main character unlike Zero Dark Thirty and 13 Hours. Both of those films have multiple characters that they tend to focus in on. One thing I saw that was interesting is that Chris was all about going out into a battle unlike other men. Serving his country meant a lot to him and you realize that during the film. Clint Eastwood is known for making great films, going back to old westerns and newer military movies. Clint Eastwood is the perfect director for this film and the film was created in California, along the Malibu shores. Clint made multiple scenes in this film feel special to the actor playing the role of Chris by having the actor feel the same way that Chris felt when it truly happened.
A main scene that I found to be very important and breathtaking is when Chris makes a remarkable sniper shot. Another scene from the film makes you feel the tension between the main character Chris and a little boy. The film makes good transitions from Iraq to back home. Chris's Wife deals with a lot of stress taking care of their 2 kids and the film shows that very well by making us feel what she is feeling. Chris's wife is played by Sienna Miller and her name in the film is Taya. Sienna Miller has been in more than 28 films and American Sniper is her well known film.
Overall, this is a film I recommend especially if you like military movies. Battles in Iraq are very important because we still have troops over there to this day. Clint Eastwood makes great films, this was one of my favorites. Being though this film was based off a true story it makes it come to life even more and makes you feel the way the characters felt in the film."
"filipemanuelneto","8","20","28","26 April 2020"," A good film about a soldier and the psychological effects of war.
","This biographical film describes the military trajectory of Chris Kyle, a member of the SEAL's, the US Navy special operations unit, who was considered the most lethal sniper in American history. Over several service commissions in Iraq, he killed about 160 people, always in situations where he protected his own life or that of other American military personnel.<br/><br/>Personally, I really liked the film, I think it made a faithful account of the most important events in the life of the person portrayed and used the original material well, present in Kyle's autobiography. It was expertly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was perfectly capable of recreating the dangerous environment of the war, as well as the facts of Kyle's life. Being a film about a soldier more than about war, Eastwood focuses on his character, the portrait he wants to make of a man of integrity, brave, eager to help and make a difference. Eastwood gives us more than enough material to create a strong link between the audience and the main character, and that gives strength and sustains the film until the end. Another thing that the film shows are the psychological wounds that Kyle is having due to the war, to the point of emotionally distancing himself from his family. The film reasonably balances the portrait of a today's ""war hero"" with the intimate account of the secret inner pains and complexes of a man who feels that he has seen evil in its purest form.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was competent in the task of bringing Chris Kyle to life. As far as I was able to understand in the readings and research I do when I want to see a film I don't know, Cooper got to know Kyle and respected him a lot. It was certainly a project that he did with special commitment and affection, and this was reflected in the quality of his work. Technically, the film is flawless. Good special and sound effects, excellent sets, costumes and touches of authenticity in everything we can see. In addition to this, an excellent soundtrack."

"cdstickney","9","38","58","20 September 2019"," Action, Romance, and Drama all wrapped into one!
","American Sniper, a true story, and a realistic war drama, Bradley Cooper's performance is highly captivating and is a spot-on portrayal of Chris Kyle, United States Navy Seal sniper. This film not only has action-packed war scenes but it also offers some romance by letting you take a glimpse of how Chris and his wife, Taya end up together and eventually married.
Along with the action and romance, this film surely doesn't skimp on the drama. During Kyle's 6 tours in Afghanistan, you begin to see the effects that the War has on Chris and his family. This film does a fantastic job showing the audience how a soldier returning home could experience the effects of PTSD and things their families can do and what they can do to get help.
So much of Chris Kyle's life gets packed into 2 hours and 14 minutes but nothing feels underdeveloped or left out of this film. In the dramatic ending of Chris Kyle learning how to cope with his PTSD, he finds comfort in helping other soldiers through their PTSD. Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in American History lived the tell the tale of 6 tours in Afghanistan only to perish at the hand of one of his own. This film is an emotional roller coaster that sadly ends in tears."

"CubsandCulture","9","32","48","6 February 2020"," One of the better Iraq films
","I have always been a bit confused that this film was thought of mere jingoistic propaganda by a certain segment of the left. I understand how that impression could come about because of the ending/credits. The ending is the weakest aspect of the film and much more should have been made of how Kyle died and the credits are pretty overtly chest thumping. The final few minutes greatly simplified the overall film and the principle reason why I can't fully recommend this film. However, everything that occurred before that is pretty darn interesting in how Eastwood and his writer are trying to reconcile competing tensions.<br/><br/>There is a troubling ambiguity at the heart of the film about what the film itself thinks of Kyle's military service. He is shown to be reactive and to be blunt not very self-reflective. He ends up joining the military in response to the embassy bombings in 1998. The decision comes across less because of a sense of patriotic duty than because of personal issues he was having on the very night the bombing occurred. In any case it is not a deeply felt ground project of Kyle's. Or how the film's central battle is ultimately ""won"" by Kyle only to have this Pyrrhic victory places his unit in greater danger. The film repeatedly shows the US's actions creating more insurgents. There's even a sarcastic invoking of Bush's ""mission accomplished"" in the film. The domestic scenes-especially in the car dealership-show a man deeply damaged by his experiences and he is largely unable to process it. The film is deeply paradoxical in the way it tries to square disapproval with the war in Iraq while sympathizes with a down to earth guy having the impulse to protect home and kin.<br/><br/>I think viewing the film in the larger context of Eastwood's filmography is important. In particular, Unforgiven (in the that essentially peak American genre of Westerns) is a pretty stark condemnation of how violence begets violence. Furthermore, the Eastwood sympathies towards Kyle are pretty much the same sort of sympathy he has had for boots on the ground displayed in Flag of Our Fathers and *critically* Letters from Iwo Jima. The film is fascinating in how it tries to reconcile the various tensions embedded in its narrative.<br/><br/>The film is technically stellar. (well fake baby aside) Eastwood continues to be one of the best restrained directors working today. There is a rawness to this film that sells the war scenes. Cooper really gives a fully engaging and heartbreaking performance. This is a film that may be too subtle for its own good."

The film itself is parochial, but it resonates deeply and depressingly with the audience. The war scenes are well-paced and harrowing, and like 2008's the hurt locker, the film is both a patriotic tribute and a stridently anti-war film. Either way, it tells a powerful, moving and tragic tale."

","I chose this movie because It's a real entertaining action movie based on a true story of an American hero Chris Kyle. The movie is based off a man named Chris Kyle that joined the navy seals in 1999 and got the most confirmed kills. In the beginning of the movie they show him at navy seals training which they made it look easy compared to the real thing. There is a lot of long shots in the movie because he was a sniper and it showed how far the target usually was. He was called an American hero because of the amount of kills he got when he was deployed. He had 160 confirmed kills out of 255 claimed kills. His wife later gets mad that he keeps deploying but that's all he knows what to do. Once he goes back home he seems out of place and has just doesn't seem right. He goes back to fight more and one day they got surrounded on a rooftop and finally decided it was time to go home. He wanted to help soldiers when that got back so he was helping them at a disabled veterans meetings. One day he took one former marine out shooting and was killed by him. That was the downfall of the movie and a lot of people were crying because it was based on a true story and it was a terrible thing that happened."

"jackhm-48980","9","27","40","3 June 2019"," The movie this country did not ask for, but needed.
","Guns, patriotism, war, family, love the list goes on and on, what's not the love about American Sniper! Oh boy, oh boy, I really do not know where to even begin with this movie. It is amazing in so many ways. A memoir-based movie written by the man who lived through it all, Chris Kyle. I read the book a few years back and I was in a trance reading it and I knew I needed to see this on the big screen.
Directors and cast are award-winning stars credited to multiple movies. Director, Clint Eastwood, does a fantastic job tying the true, horrific stories of Chris Kyle to the Hollywood aesthetic of movies. Although not always entirely accurate throughout, man is this one amazing movie to watch. You're constantly on your toes. You want to thank your veterans. Eastwood balanced everything in this movie to a tee. A lot of action but did not shy away from the real world problems of war.
Bradley Cooper. I have no words for this man. He is an incredible actor and this movie is no exception. He portrayed a navy seal that was tough as nails. It would be hard to believe this wasn't just a documentary of Cooper at war. He played the part so well and his emotions captured the realism of war so much. Cooper played the part of Chris Kyle a man that came from nothing but rodeo clowning and drunk fights. He decides to enlist in the armed forces and in due time trains to be a Navy Seal. He quickly climbs the ranks and becomes a eagle-eyed precision sniper. He gets sent overseas to the middle east to fight in the war of terrorism. He records a huge sum of kills and gets all sorts of praise and nicknames. Eventually even receives a hit for his death for a large sum of money. The way Cooper is able to portray the character and the thoughts going on make him more than deserving of the MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance.
One scene stood out above the else highlighting Coopers talent in this movie. He is in the hospital and the doctor asks him a few questions about how many kills he has. He then asks Kyle if he regrets seeing anything. Cooper responds,
""I was just protecting my guys, they were trying to kill... our soldiers and I... I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took""
Chills, chills, chills. This highlights the true aspect of war and why the guys serve, they do it for their buddies and the ones back home. Cooper by far took my spot as my favorite male actor from this performance alone.
All in all this award winning/nominated movie deserves nothing less than what it has received. It is similar to other war movies but Eastwood does one thing to set it apart, highlight the human side of what happens to our soldiers. This movie makes us feel more for our soldiers. It connects us to our country. It is certainly more than just an action movie with a few good explosions."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","9","16","22","23 February 2018"," The negative reviews just don't get it
","Most of the negative reviews on this film seem to hate it simply because it's ""too American"". Well yes, it's very American, you'll get a lot of that ""good ol' land of the free, home of the brave"" preachy stuff in this story, but no, it's not ""propaganda"" trying to make Muslims look evil and Americans look glamorous. If anything, it's simply about the futility of war and the cruelty of it all. The behavior of Americans towards Iraq is not glossed over in the least. We get Marines busting down doors, constant derogatory remarks and comments about Muslims being ""savages"". All that being said, Chris Kyle hates terrorists, not Muslims, and it's both 9/11 and the deaths of Muslim children he sees that haunt him the most. I'm sorry, but if holding down a little boy and drilling into his skull to torture him in front of his father isn't savage behavior, I don't know what is, and keep in mind that both the little boy and his grieving parents are all Muslims. This film could even be said to be about the underlying flaws of patriotism when the human cost of it is not acknowledged. A grieving lady is seen sobbing and cringing at a soldier's very military, gun-toting funeral service, reading his last letter home to her and wondering if it's really all worth it. Soldiers are shot in the face and killed in the line of duty only to be quickly forgotten. What did it solve? American Sniper breaks down the blindness of American patriotism in a frightened post-9/11 world, and it's impossible not to compare the American and Middle-Eastern children in this film and wonder if the war their parents became involved in will follow them for the rest of their lives. Whether it's a boy throwing a grenade or a boy shooting and killing a deer for ""sport"".<br/><br/>The film does have good morals in the end as Kyle explains to his young son, ""it's a hell of a thing to stop a heartbeat"". If there's one lesson to be learned here, it's that if you ever feel like there's a good reason to kill, you'd better pause for just a second and consider first whether or not it will undo what's already been done. For the 160 people Kyle blows away, 3,000 still died in 9/11 and can't be brought back. I was personally four years old when 9/11 happened and the loss of some very good friends really affected my family in a bad way, but honestly when I think of those people working in the World Trade Center, men and women who had families of their own just trying to make a living, if you asked any of them when they were still alive I don't think they'd agree with what happened in Iraq (oddly enough, Al Qaeda wasn't in Iraq, they were elsewhere in the Middle East, but that's another topic). What really drills down to the pointlessness of war in American Sniper is the ending. If you allow yourself to be consumed by this military culture over your family, it'll eat you alive sooner or later, no matter how tough you think you are or how detached from killing and violence you may be. <br/><br/>My only real complaint about this film is that it drags on at times with nothing but gunshots and death. We rarely get a view of Kyle's wife and children to see how they cope with his absence except for brief shots of his wife crying or spying on her returned husband sprawled out on the sofa. Yes it's his story, but I can't help but think that the bigger story here is the legacy that the ""War on Terror"" will leave behind for future generations, generations who will just have this stuff ingrained into their culture from birth even if they were never alive to witness 9/11 or the Iraq War or the politics and rhetoric that quickly followed in the event of these terrorist attacks. Now we've got ISIS to worry about, and I often wonder if maybe it will just keep going in a chain of brutality until one country knows enough to break it and call some sort of truce."
"coxb-47937","10","16","22","28 January 2018"," An American Cowboy Turned to War Hero
","This movie is about a cowboy that turned into a war veteran legend to protect his country. Bradley Cooper plays as Chris Kyle, a navy seal veteran that is trying to protect his country and his family. The theme of this movie is how Chris Kyle goes through four tours of war overseas and how he changes drastically each deployment. Chris's wife, Taya, is played by Sienna Miller. She notices that Chris is different every time that he comes home. In this biography of a guy's adult life and life during the military you learn a lot about him, a lot about who he is and mostly a lot about what he stands for. 
 There are three main types of theme in this movie. There is Chris's life before Taya and the Military, then Chris's life with Taya while he is home from the military and the final theme is Chris when he is away with the military. In the first part of the movie Chris is a typical rodeo cowboy that rides on the weekends for competition. Then the other two main parts of the movie are intertwined with each other the rest of the movie. First is when Chris is at home with Taya. They are happy before his first tour of duty. Then is when everything started to change between them. After four tours of duty overseas there is a lot of difference. Chris is a different person when he is home because he can't stop thinking about war. He is always spaced out, he tweaks over loud noises and he is over protective of all things dealing with his family. Since this movie is a biography, it is hard to compare to any other films that have been produced because this film is a reflection of a single man's life and how he chose to live his life. 
 The production of this film I though was very well. They used natural lighting for the outside scenes and provided the viewers with exceptional light on all scenes including the scenes that were being portrayed as the night. Another thing that was done well was the angle of the cameras. When important stuff was about to happen, you could tell because the angle of the camera eliminated all dead space so that the viewer could focus on what was happening. This tactic is to make sure the audience doesn't miss essential points to the film that portray and make the theme what it is."
"theloverofpigeons","8","16","22","15 December 2017"," Very good Book
","Chris Kyle was born on April 8, 1974. He was raised up in a ""Country"" family. Later on his parents had another child. Chris became an older brother and looked after him. He got his first gun when he was nine. He loved to guns, horses, and really anything Cowboy-ish. As he grew older his passion for horses and cattle grew. He got so good with riding horses that he tried out for some local rodeo tournaments. He had thought of the going into the military when he had finished high school, but ended up going to college. While going to college he worked on a ranch, a big one. Riding horses, feeding cattle, and doing anything his employer wanted really. After awhile he had thought of the service. He went down to the recruiters office and him and all the recruiters talked. He liked the Navy the best. He went in to sign up, got everything checked out, before he could get really into the navy they found out that he had a bad accident when he was younger. When he was younger he rode horses, the horse tripped and fell on top of Chris. Cracking his ribs, completely obliterating his wrist, and some other minor injuries, are what occurred. Since his wrist were almost obliterated he had to get steel rods put in them, and since he has steel rods in his wrist, the Navy wouldn't allow him. Chris finding out this, went back to work at the ranch again. Not long after the Navy recruiter call him up and told him he could join. Chris went through all the trainings and test, passed them and started to take on more stealthy trainings. He was deployed many times during his first 4 years of the Navy.<br/><br/>I think the main strengths are in the emotions mixed in with all the war Chris has been going through. Chris brings you through his journey and what he experienced. Yet, he spills his emotions out. Generally people think "" Oh, you're in the navy. You don't really have feelings."", But in this case it's the exact opposite. Chris opens up and shares his feelings, emotions, and thoughts. <br/><br/>I think the author's message is mainly about war. He wants to bring notice to how war really is. This is a valuable book, if not the most valuable. It teaches lessons that everyone should learn. One incident that I thought was important was where Chris and Taya had their second child and Chris still went back to defend his country. That scene was really emotional. <br/><br/>I would recommend it for high schoolers, it;s best for males and females. I would recommend i for people looking to join any branch of the service. Someone who is afraid of war or doesn't like war shouldn't really read this, after all this is based on war. It is generally a book for all."

Everyone remained seated until the closing shot on the casket with the many, many badges pounded into it. Only then did people slowly begin to rise, yet nobody uttered a word. The theatre was SILENT. And there were annoying pre-teen girls present and even they were speechless.<br/><br/>The acting is stellar, the film tells an enthralling story, and this film is downright shocking. It perfectly demonstrates the effect war has on people. <br/><br/>I don't care if the real Chris Kyle was a brutal human being: this is a movie.

","This film is based on the true-life story of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), America's deadliest sniper. The movie portrays Chris as a super patriot from Texas, smart, but not too verbal. He had four tours in Iraq becoming a legend while distancing himself from his family with each tour. The film showed him suffering emotionally from his actions while displaying a tough exterior.<br/><br/>This is not exactly a war action film, but more of a war drama. It is a character study of someone that is hard to know. We got to see his boot-camp, early life, and bits of each of his four tours to complete the 130 minute bio. His demise is not shown but is included as an end note.<br/><br/>Worth viewing as a history and bio.The controversy involving some of his claims is not included.

"nick-sultana","9","397","723","1 February 2015"," Intense, Emotional, Controversial and yet Engaging
","When it comes to true story films, there are times where film-makers try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being told. In this case, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper has already contracted not only positive acclaim but a stir of negativity and controversy that surrounds the way Kyle was really like in life. Some say he had lost his mind in the war for peace while others say he was caught up in the emotional aftermath after service but Eastwood has stated that his film is ""the biggest anti-war statement any film can make,"" and said that ""the fact of what war does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did""<br/><br/>What AS tells is the true life figure Chris Kyle who served as the American military's 'lethal sniper' who has made more kills in his duty of tours during the Iraq war period after 9/11. It chronicles how Chris became a true American to protect his homeland and the aftermath of serving his tours when he came home to his small growing family, leading up to the final hours of his life.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>+ Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris Kyle is indeed a new height for his career, he gives a performance that can be described as gripping, tense and at times<br/><br/>+ The action sequences are all done well, but at times it can be tense, violent and confronting for some.<br/><br/>+ The emotional connection between the main character and his family, that the final scene that will either break you or make you undecided.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>The controversy that surrounds it, it can make the film an exaggerated lie or truth to what Kyle was like in reality but again it is showing what war can do on people on the front-line and home.</li></ul><br/><br/>OVERALL: Despite the controversy it has gained by writers , the film is indeed a strong acting showcase for Cooper while leaving audiences both open and more aware of the effects of war on human kind. Go in with an open mind and see for yourself for what you would think that made Chris Kyle a 'lethal sniper' for this country. If you had liked The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and Machine Gun Preacher (not a war film but somewhat similar to Kyle's story) you will enjoy this."

","With this movie being probably the best of 2014, its probably my favorite movie of all time, Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood did an amazing job in the directing of this film. After seeing the trailer, it was a must see for me. In this movie a Military Sniper for the US Marines, named Chris Kyle, is challenged at war with Iraqi and Afghan soldiers.
I took a lot away from watching this movie, since I watched it when I was a little younger and didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life, it inspired me to want to be like him. Yet I didn't quite understand why he was named the ""American Sniper"" when that was was supposed to be the best sniper in the world, because the Terrorist sniper, was way too much of competition for him to even hang. 
In my opinion this isn't a movie you should just ignore, its definitely one of the greatest movies in a while."

"ciagent-64772","10","14","19","30 April 2016"," The Most Divisive War Film I've Seen
","On just the first page, I've counted more negative reviews for this film than I've heard from my friends when discussing this film. All of us have come to a consensus that this film is one of our favorites, while IMDb, it seems, has decided to discuss politics and take small scenes as major deciding factors regarding the quality of the film instead of, oh, I don't know, remember that this is just one account of it. <br/><br/>Chris Kyle is one of the most decorated SEALs in US history because of what all he did, and the novel (or at least what of it I've read thus far) is his personal account (what he can share of it at least) of what it was like being in Iraq. Many thus far have debated that this film makes Chris Kyle seem like an inhuman killing machine with no regard for human life. My counter-argument to this is simple; have you tried talking to somebody after they came back from Iraq? It isn't easy. One of our neighbors is in the Navy, and it took weeks, if not months for him to adjust back to life in the states. In that sense, I think it's very legitimate for Kyle to seem a little bit off and more at home in Iraq than in his actual home with his wife. In that sense, Bradley Cooper is one of the best actors I've ever seen. He portrays his role with respect while still having a hell of a performance. Hell, I'd argue that Cooper as Kyle is one of the best casting choices I've ever seen. It's equal parts human and killer. <br/><br/>People have questioned the realism of having a cell phone in combat. To this, I ask ""Have you read the book?"" If I remember correctly, this scene was fairly true to the novel. People point out the scene Kyle has with his brother as being flat, to which... yeah, I agree that there's no connection between the two. Even so, it's a two minute scene. It hardly drags down the film to levels of trash matched only by films such as ""Spawn"" and ""Garbage Pail Kids."" The last scene people hate is the ending half-hour. In my own opinion, as that is what all reviews are, just opinions, the last combat scene was one of the most engaging scenes I recall seeing. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire thing. When he finally went back home and readjusted back to his normal life, it was too close to home for me. When he died, I think Eastwood did the only thing he could to treat it with dignity; show news reports and pictures of the funeral. If you know how to direct that better, then why didn't you direct the film?<br/><br/>At the risk of being one of the most hated people on IMDb, I loved American Sniper. It was a realistic story of what it was like in Iraq, while telling it from the angle of one of the most recognizable servicemen this side of Grant or Eisenhower. It was well directed, well told, and generally did everything right. If I wanted to debate the politics of the war, I wouldn't do it here, I'd go to debate.com. If I wanted to know what he was really like, I'd read his book. If I wanted to watch a damn good film about a US hero that treated him with respect, then I'd watch this film. R.I.P.

","This film about deadly American Seal Sniper Chris Kyle is a deep look into the psyche of a trained legal killer. In an Iraq plagued with ambushes and IEDs the US forces are often sitting ducks for the ISIS militia operators. Kyle sets about providing cover for the army patrols. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper executes a convincing role in this very realistic film. He shows a deep understanding of the pain suffered by men experiencing war memories. <br/><br/>Since this film is based on a real life experience the ending is a though it has been written into the screenplay. Kyle is helping a PTSD sufferer adjust to civilian life when he is gunned down at a rifle range. One of America's greatest heroes id taken from us too early. This makes me as a viewer reflect on how fragile our hold on life is. <br/><br/>This is one of the best war movies about Americans at war that I have seen."
"melaniefaure","9","12","16","19 May 2017"," Remarkable film.
","As perhaps the most accomplished marksman in US military history, Chris Kyle's experience of war is very unusual:it's an ""endless extreme close-up"". The film is suspenseful and emotional, it makes very interesting parallels between Chris' private life and his life as a soldier who has to kill children and women. I do think that the whole question of the film is: ""is Chris Kyle a hero?"". Indeed, he could be considered as a hero because he kills human bombs which would have killed many people in return... But can we really consider someone as a hero if he kills children? I believe that Clint Eastwood, through American Sniper, does not really give an answer to it, he just leads us to think about it... which is even more interesting and difficult."
"kathhome","9","12","16","6 April 2017"," A tense and extremely respectful War drama depicting modern warfare witnessed by soldiers and how it leaves its mark
","This movie was incredible, there was never wasted moment. All the scenes were wonderfully put together by the legendary Clint Eastwood As well as being very well acted by the almost unrecognizable Bradley Cooper As Chris Kyles and Siena Miller as Kyle's wife Taya. Bradley Coopers depiction of Chris Kyle is accurate and he steals every scene he's in from Kyle's thick Texan accent to Kyle's view on war. The Battle scenes are raw and very authentic and to a certain point very realistic. My only main concern was the use of the word "" savage"" to depict Iraqis and some of the earlier scenes before Chris goes to war. Apart from that Brilliant movie directed by Clint Eastwood and the phenomenal performances by Bradley Cooper and Siena Miller."
"zkonedog","8","12","16","1 March 2017"," A Film About Many Things (But PTSD Is What Truly Stands Out)
","While settling into my theater seat to view ""American Sniper"", I had about as high of expectations as any movie I'd seen in the past year. Rarely do those type of expectations ever get lived up to these days, it seems. That was emphatically NOT the case with this film, however, as it captivated me from beginning to end.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary (minor spoilers), ""American Sniper"" focuses on the life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), who serves multiple terms in Iraq during the early 2000s while wife Taya (Sienna Miller) dutifully waits for him on the homefront with each deployment. Over in Iraq, Chris is an expert sniper, tasked with providing air support and protecting ""his guys"" from any number of unforeseen calamities (a scene where a young Iraqi boy begins to pick up an explosive device is particular telling on what mental torture Chris's job can be at times). Because, Chris doesn't want to leave until the ""job is done"", he's a little bit less himself every single time he returns stateside. This puts particular strain on wife Taya and a growing family that Chris does not know how to integrate back into.<br/><br/>One could almost say that ""American Sniper"" is two movies in one...<br/><br/>First, it is a taut psychological spectacle of the type of warfare that was being conducted in Iraq. A sniper from the opposition is nearly Kyle's equal, while a notorious ""Butcher"" commits atrocities that begin to wear on Kyle's mental faculties. To me, this was the ""weaker"" portion of the film (though to call it ""weak"" would be a travesty), but that's likely because I don't have first- hand experience in that type of environment. It was all kind of surreal to me. A number of people in the group I saw the movie with thought these war/sniping scenes were the best part, so it was probably just personal preference.<br/><br/>Secondly, and to me this is where the flick can go down in history, are Kyle's struggles with post- traumatic stress disorder. Each time he returns back to Taya and the family, he is a little bit less himself, and even a bit more anxious to be back to the battlefield. I was utterly fascinated (and quite more than a bit proud) by how a man can voluntarily put himself into harm's way in order to finish the war at hand and have the back of his fellow soldier. These are the scenes where director Clint Eastwood really excels. He knows exactly how to prod the emotions and then get out of the way so as not to seem preachy.<br/><br/>So, for me, ""American Sniper"" made my ""top films"" list because I've never seen a war film tackle the issue of PTSD so brutally. Usually, a soldier returning home will say something like ""I saw some things over there"" and that's all that will be said. Here, however, the PTSD is actually experienced in chilling fashion.<br/><br/>If Bradley Cooper doesn't get serious consideration for his outstanding performance as Chris Kyle, it would be a crying shame. The auxiliary cast is good as well, but Cooper is almost literally front and center in every meaningful scene or exchange in the picture. He'd certainly get my vote for ""Best Actor"" to get a gold Oscar, that is for sure.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Sniper"" is one of those films that is tough to ""like"" even though it is truly a gem. The reason being? It is so hard-hitting. The story of Chris Kyle and his family is one that resonates in this day and age, while Eastwood was the perfect choice to get the most out of it. If you want an insight into many aspects of being a soldier that you had likely never thought of before, ""American Sniper"" is the film to watch."
"MrDHWong","8","12","16","23 December 2015"," Bradley Cooper gives another memorable performance in the title role
","American Sniper is a war drama starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. I found it well acted and cleverly directed as well. Bradley Cooper gives another memorable performance in the title role.<br/><br/>The film is a biopic about real life Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper). As a young boy, Chris learned all of his sniping skills from his father by hunting deer. Now an adult, he decides to put them to good use by joining the US Navy. After the 9/11 attacks, Chris is sent over to Iraq to serve alongside his fellow soldiers and while over there, he manages to kill 255 people, making him the deadliest marksman in US military history. However, in doing so, he ends up saving many of the lives of his fellow men and even some other innocent Iraqis. As a result, he is considered a hero by his country and earns the nickname ""Legend"". Upon returning home from the war to his wife (Sienna Miller) and two children, Chris is still traumatised about the events of the war and feels like he will never be able to adjust to normal everyday life.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's performance carries the film. He was very convincing in the leading role. Clint Eastwood's direction is very good as well. He manages to blend real life events with cinema very effectively. Even though some of the war scenes tended to drag at times, they never felt forced or glorified. However, due to some of the violence, this is not a film for the weak-hearted.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10"
"Afshin-A","8","12","16","7 December 2015"," Entertaining, well made, and thought provoking
","So much was made of this movie being this or that when it was released. the main theme of the criticisms was that it glorified war and dehumanized people of the region. I did not see any that; however, I can see how certain aspects may be interpreted that way.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has done a great job of showing the gradual toll that four tours of duty took on the hero. He also shows us how cruel and unforgiving war can be on all fronts. Based on that, I reject the notion that the movie is a glorifying war or violence. Yes, if you are watching a movie like this and it is so well made that you side with the hero, of course you cheer when he gets the bad guys, but is it really any different than Rocky Balboa knocking teeth out of his opponents' mouth?<br/><br/>I have not the autobiography that this movie was based on, but I hear that the script followed the book closely.<br/><br/>Put another check in the win column for Clint!"

For him to then be killed by a man he was trying to help, who was also dealing with post war mental health. It shows the strains and stresses of what war is really like. I believe this movie to be excellent and moving. Sad ending for such a great Soldier. Reading some of the reviews, surprise me. I wonder how these guys would cope 1. Just with war in general. 2. Being a sniper which you have to battle with your mind playing tricks, being 100% alert the whole time, whilst laying in your urine and poo. My hat is off to the man and it's so sad he died.

"aciessi","9","12","16","25 September 2015"," This Means War
","The most controversial, sought after, talked-about movie of the past year has been American Sniper. It excited self-proclaimed patriots, annoyed the PC gestapo, and beat Spongebob at the box-office. So what is the big deal? <br/><br/>Because all those who've seen it will tell you the same thing, it's an excellent movie. This thing is not going to leave my mind for a few days. Clint Eastwood, you're a hell of a director. He managed to get inside the mind of America's most lethal sniper, and show to us his demons. To those who sit there and think that it's a thankless, cowardly job, I'd ask you to kindly get your head from out of your ass. Chris Kyle is no saint, but he saved many of his fellow men, and protected his country. But in the process, he made many, terrible mistakes. Eastwood, I thought absolutely made sure not to make this movie a gung-ho, get-some, merica' love fest. It's just real life. <br/><br/>The war scenes are some of the best ever filmed, and hold absolutely nothing back. But, it's everything outside the battlefield that will surely haunt you. Here, we have a transformation of a Texas good-old boy, to an empty vessel staring into the abyss. War is a drug. Chris Kyle was a war junkie. Everyone tries to bring him back home, but time and again, he goes back to the desert. Each time, little by little, his soul is sucked from his body. By the end, just when you think he's been home long enough to have recovered, well.. we all know what happened. <br/><br/>If there's anything to criticize about this movie, it's the time it spent glossing over Kyle's work for veterans at home. That scene with the veterans is great, but it goes way too quick. Also, let us not forget the fake-baby. Folks, we aren't looking at a perfect movie.. but by God is it close. <br/><br/>It's an ice-cold slice of americana. The quintessential movie to those who are serving, and those who have served our country."
"awesomedawson","10","76","129","9 April 2015"," Incredible performance, and true to Chris Kyle
","As I read through some other reviews I have to wonder if anyone read the book. A person well read on Chris Kyle would realize that he thought he was fighting a worthwhile cause. This movie is taken from that point of view, the view of the person that this movie is based on (What an idea). I appreciate this because it allows me to really get in touch with Kyle, and feel his struggles. This was never meant to be an antiwar movie, but a true representation of the feelings that a majority of these men and women feel as they're fighting. The comparison to the Nazi Propaganda film in Inglorious Bastards is an absolute injustice to the true message of the film. It's the true story of a man who would put his country fist, because he was a true patriot. There is no other way to put his message on screen without showing Kyle in that light.<br/><br/>Now for the actual film itself. I thought it was a very well made film. Every scene is gripping, and the war scenes in particular are intense, and show a somewhat realism of war. When I first heard the Bradley Cooper was Cas as Kyle I wondered how a mainly comedy actor from Philadelphia could pull off a war hero Texan. But my god is he amazing in the part. At no point while I was watching did I think I was watching Bradley cooper, I was watching Chris Kyle. His performance left me speechless. Sienna Miller as Taya Kyle doesn't get enough credit for her performance as well. The phone call scene as she is walking out of the doctor's office is truly emotional. Most of the supporting cast is great in their roles as well.<br/><br/>All in all is the movie perfect, no not really. But it is a truly great film, that portrays the life of Chris Kyle in a respectable and mostly accurate way. Nobody tried to interject their viewpoints in to his story, because that's not the point of the film. It is meant to portray a great man, in an honest respectable way. It accomplished that goal, and is a fitting portrayal of a man who fought for his country, and died for his brothers in arms"

","American sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war film because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent war films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly dramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley Cooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's best movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were handled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film were the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the main character. The story is mostly just learning about one character. There really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan of war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","114","200","10 February 2015"," Top-Notch Directing and a Marvelous Lead Performance
","American Sniper (2014) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Thrilling, tense and dramatic telling of Chris Kyle's (Bradley Cooper) rise from a cowboy without much direction in his life to becoming the deadliest sniper in U.S. history.<br/><br/>Director Clint Eastwood has made countless great movies in his career and even tackled the war drama in brilliant fashion with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. This film here could have been clichéd in so many ways but thankfully a director with such masterful direction can take a familiar story like war and its impact on someone and make it feel fresh, tight and original. Since movies began, the war genre has been one of the most popular and they continue to pump them out yearly so trying to find a fresh way to tell a story is always a challenge but Eastwood and company really pull it off.<br/><br/>American SNIPER is certainly about the war but it's main focus is telling the story of this American hero. The main goal of the screenplay is to show people what a special person Kyle was and balancing his personal drama and the war stuff was so wonderfully done that both story lines contained some real drama and one wasn't overshadowed by the other. I think that's the most accomplished thing Eastwood does here. Making sure that the war at home is just as intense as the war in Iraq. Another major plus is that, on a technical level, the film is flawless as it contains some of the year's best cinematography, a touching music score and some of the best sound effects out there.<br/><br/>The wartime scenes are all shot extremely well and I think the best thing about them is the feeling the director shows in the fact that these men are really in a trap not knowing where the next bullet is going to come from. The scenes of Kyle doing his job were full of tension as were the scenes where we get more gunfire. There's a sequence early on, highlighted in the trailer, were a kid possibly has a bomb and this here is perfectly handled. The ending is also incredibly intense and the terrific editing here really helps build up the tension of the combat zone.<br/><br/>What really pushes the movie from the opening scene to the very last is the terrific performance by Cooper who turns in his greatest work to date. I'm not sure how many people could have predicted that Cooper, who was mostly playing comedy roles, would turn into such a fine dramatic actor but he's turning into one of the most dependable actors out there. He's simply wonderful here and manages to really come across as a tortured person. The film shows Kyle from various points in his life. His wild younger days. His rise through the Seals. Of course, some of the most talked about scenes deal with the depression and anxiety that starts to set in. We've seen many actors deal with the ""struggling vet returning home"" and Cooper manages to bring a real depth to the character.<br/><br/>American SNIPER isn't going to end up being the best movie on 2014 but it's certainly a very impressive film. Technically it's quite sound and Eastwood once again proves why he's one of the greatest director's out there. As for Cooper's performance, it's certainly a terrific one and overall this is a great film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about and be thankful for."

","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>You would think that we would get tired of these war movies depicting life over in Iraq and Afghanistan but when they come together in a movie this good it is easy to see why we keep coming back for more. This is easily one of Clint Eastwood's best directed movie. And then we come to Bradley Cooper, he has always been a face in Hollywood but I think this movie shows that he has some serious acting chops. I know he was a Hollywood A lister before but this movie shows that he is more than just a pretty face to look at when he is on screen. I would like to see him in more of these drama type roles. Even though I did like him as Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>We follow Chris Kyle's life starting with a brief glimpse of how he grew up and what he did before joining the Navy and the SEALs. We then follow Chris through Basic Underwater Demolition/SEALs (BUDs) training. To him finding and marrying Taya (Sienna Miller). But what this movie really focuses on is the time Chris Kyle spends between four tours of duty in Iraq to the time spent between them at home. Chris seems to thrive while over in Iraq, he is in his element and knows what needs to get done. Chris is in a war between himself and an Iraqi Sniper that wants the glory of taking down the Legend that Chris Kyle has become over there. When at home though he is faced with a family he barely knows and trying to get reacquainted with them, too dealing with the mundane day to day life.<br/><br/>I am sure there is some things that the movie doesn't portray correctly be it due to the missions still being classified or to wanting to protect some of those people that are still active and out there protecting us. But the movie does capture what it is to be a man going off to fight a war in another country and then trying to come home and dealing with not only with your day to day life but also trying to put behind the war. Luckily in this day and age Veterans do have avenues to get help and work through it. And Chris once he got his feet under him was an advocate of trying to help those returning Veterans get a hold on reality and get back to living that normal life they had before going of to war.<br/><br/>This movie is an emotional roller-coaster and is going to take you on a journey. So be prepaid to have your heart strings pulled and maybe a Kleenex or two with you when you see this. Especially if you are like me and did not know Chris Kyle's story before seeing this movie.<br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>A Must See."

","I have never done a film review before but after seeing American Sniper I thought i would share my views on what a brilliant film this is.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a biopic about the ""legend"" Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper). Kyle starts the film as a wide boy cowboy, but then realises that he wants more from life and joins the American Seals. As this is happening he falls in love with his wife to be Taya ( Sienna Miller). This is where you start to see the beauty of the film develop. His love and passion for his country, and his endless-love for Taya is portrayed perfectly from Eastwood. <br/><br/>Kyle ends up doing four tours in Iraq with over 1000 days in service, away from his wife, and the three children that came over the 5 years. Out in Iraq Kyle become known as a ""legend"" with his deadly aim with the sniper rifle. You see Kyle become ever close with his comrades. It was rumoured that the Taliban put a bounty on Kyles head of $180,000, you can only imagine how deadly his rifle was. After each tour you see Kyle with his family and you can see that Kyle is struggling to deal with civilisation, becoming very jumpy and hearing noises that he had in Iraq. This is shown in a few teary scenes between Taya and Kyle. Some very heart wrenching moments. This showed what any military personnel would go through when tore between love and duty of serving their country.<br/><br/>The film ends with Kyle getting honourable discharged and starts to rebuild his life with Taya and the children. You can get the tissues out for the last scene!<br/><br/>I am ashamed to say that I didn't know this was a true story before watching this film. This is news that should be heard worldwide, not the latest selfie taken by the Kardashians..."

","The movies is about Chris Kyle's home life and military career with the US Navy as a SEAL sniper. The movie has some intense moments, containing violent and disturbing scenes. The movie doesn't portray Chris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems all soldiers have to face both overseas and at home. Clint Eastwood who is in his mid-eighties, shows us he still has it, directing an amazing film. The movie tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the first book. Overall, American Sniper is a great movie that has all the components, that make a movie great. For anyone who is a war film enthusiast, this is a movie for you.

","""American Sniper"" is one of the worst movies I have ever been forced to endure. It is simplistic propaganda masquerading as an award-worthy story. There is no story.<br/><br/>American kid Chris Kyle is good at shooting so he uses 9/11 as an excuse to join the Navy SEALS and kill Iraqis. That's it. That's the whole movie. Clint Eastwood's one-dimensional direction shows Chris as some sort of American hero, even though any sane human will at least question the cold-blooded murder of men, women & children in a morally ambiguous war. I'm still not sure how Iraq was responsible for 9/11.<br/><br/>Clint tries to humanize our hero by tacking on a subplot about Chris's wife, but this storyline- like the rest of the movie- has NO conflict. Chris meets his prospective wife at a bar, dates her, marries her, impregnates her and starts a family with no trouble whatsoever. Why are we watching this? In the meantime our hero goes back to Iraq to blow the brains out of more women and children, and he doesn't seem to lose any sleep over his work.<br/><br/>Back home Chris gets accosted in a Jiffy-Lube by a fellow veteran, and the sequence plays more like a romantic meeting than a heartfelt tribute, as the appreciative vet stares at Chris with moist, dewy eyes while licking his lips. Either way, Kyle is unmoved and displays no emotion. Why are we watching this again?<br/><br/>Sienna Miller as Chris' wife cannot stop touching her belly to remind us that she's preggers. The straps of her fake pregnant belly are visible beneath her bra straps. At one point she hands Chris their child and it is very obviously a lifeless, motionless doll. Why are we watching this?<br/><br/>If you're looking for any type of character development you won't find it here: Chris Kyle is portrayed as a killing machine without any discernible personality. A fellow officer raises the question of why Chris carries a Bible. ""I've never seen you open it,"" he says, and the issue is dropped there. Does Chris believe in God? Does he not? There is no internal life whatsoever.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper does his best to instill this cardboard cutout of a character with some depth, but all he manages to do is say ""Um"" in a Southern drawl before he speaks every line to remind us that he is indeed from Texas. He meets his brother at an airport and the scene is a crime against acting: there is no connection, no exchange, no conflict. Suddenly Chris decides he wants to come home from the war and stop killing people. He does. Then he is killed by a fellow soldier and Eastwood leaves us with TV footage of the real Chris Kyle's funeral: six SUV's driving down the road while a couple people hold signs. Why?<br/><br/>Why was this movie made? What is it supposed to say? Why is this man special, or significant, or evil, or great? Why are we supposed to care about any of this? Why are we watching this? <br/><br/>The good news is: you don't have to.<br/><br/>GRADE: D-"

","(I hope I can get through this review without tearing up)<br/><br/>Viewing this movie in the theatre is different than usual. While you walk in and grab your seat, you may feel that everyone around you is anticipating the same thing ... a powerful story about a powerful man with a powerful purpose. That's a lot for a movie to live up to.<br/><br/>I believe you will walk out of the theatre with many thoughts after watching American Sniper ... and one of those thoughts will be that Bradley Cooper gave unwavering respect to Chris Kyle, his family, his fellow SEALS, his country and the movie industry. He bulked up his shoulders and took on a very difficult role that etches him on the list of ""Great Actors"" as he plays the real life character of Chris Kyle. Simply put - he was believable. His look. His accent. His Texas strut. His dip. His eyes. Watching the film you can clearly see what I assume to be parallel of what Kyle experienced on the battlefields abroad and at home. I can only hope the Kyle family and friends feel the same, as Cooper's acting appears to be a beautiful tribute to a ""Legend"".<br/><br/>While Clint Eastwood didn't break any ground with direction, I do believe he was a perfect choice for this film and did an incredible job telling Kyle's story without putting politics on the screen. This is a rough story to watch no matter your political views ... war is hell on all sides. If Eastwood put politics in the film I believe the audience would have lost the purpose of the piece. This is a movie that liberals, conservatives, libertarians, and ""I-don't-knowins"" can appreciate.<br/><br/>The best movies make you walk out of the doors seeing the world a bit differently. American Sniper gives an eerie look into a world that we, as Americans, are so far away from. Many of us don't know death like this. We don't know what it's like to face the mental and physical challenges our troops face during war. We've never been in the middle of a sand- storm fire fight. Eastwood, his crew and cast provide us with a small glimpse into what our troops face overseas and stateside. After seeing the movie inside an enormous mall, it was a bit surreal to walk out to an Urban Outfitters and Apple store full of Christmas shoppers. American Sniper will push you outside of everyday life to tell you a story that will stir your head and your heart.<br/><br/>Personally, American Sniper brought many emotions about the courageous servicemen, women and their families that have touched my life. Over the years I've had the honor to work with the American Veterans Center (AVC) in Arlington, VA, who host the National Memorial Day Parade and Wounded Warrior Experience among other great events. Some of the veterans who starred in American Sniper have also shared their story during AVC events. If this movie inspires you to learn more about these outstanding men and women, please check out AVC.<br/><br/>American Sniper also reminded me of the bravest people I know -- Lance Corporal Nicholas Erdy and his family. Much like you see on the screen, the Erdy's sacrifice and love for our country is the stuff superheroes are made of.<br/><br/>To the Kyle family, Erdys, all veterans, servicemen and women, and their families ... thank you for your sacrifice and courage. Your stories inspire us to strive for love and peace. To Eastwood, Cooper and the American Sniper team ... thank you for clearly putting your heart into this important American story. Bravo.<br/><br/>Bottom line - the Chris Kyle Story - American Sniper - is a must see."

","This film was a bit different than I expected. Originally I thought it was going to be about all the action during wartime but I was surprised that it was just as much about the family at home. I liked how they tried to show the struggle Kyle had with shooting insurgents and his home life.<br/><br/>The action in this film was top-notch and realistic which I really love. I prefer these kinds of movies to the explosion and bullet packed movies that Hollywood normally produces.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper did an amazing job portraying Kyle and was very believable."
"Pete_Delta1","9","10","13","21 July 2016"," This movie has a lot of morals & message's
","I was hesitant to write a review of this movie. When it comes to military movies yet alone Navy SEAL movies, there is a special feeling that I receive when I watch these movies, not because I love action movies, the reason is as a kid I looked up to and wanted to be a Navy SEAL, Police Officer, and a Fire Fighter. So there will always be a special feeling that I feel about these three subjects. I always have to write a review if the movie is really good, or if it is a military movie. I said that I was hesitant to write this review because I needed time to understand and absorb how I felt. I want to start with this is a great action packed movie, that also brings suspense with the thought of what is going to happen next. But I also felt I was on a emotional roller coaster ride. I read the book and tried to imagine the struggles that he went through. But to watch and see the movie, I believe that really helped paint a clearer picture. After the movie ended I felt down a bit, but the message I received was stronger than sadness. The message I received I will keep to myself and let you decide what you felt independently, but this is a great movie and I am very happy that I finally was given the opportunity to watch it."

Chris was a cowboy turned seal, after examining the movie you can see that this plays a big part in him having drive to be able to make it through the war. As the movie goes on there is a time when Chris is sitting at home staring at a blank T.V. Some dramatic music is playing building tension. Yet the key point is we start to hear screams, and gunshots, they start to get louder and louder until his wife comes and interrupts his thoughts.

I pray and hope the Good American People will come to their senses) <br/><br/>This is a terrific film made by one of my all-time favourite actors & confident directors and you'd be a fool to miss it, a word of warning though, the tears may well fall by the end....EMOTIONAL Stuff."
"The Grand Master","9","10","13","2 April 2016"," Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper excellently bring to life the true story of Chris Kyle.
","Under Clint Eastwood's brilliant direction, he brings to life the late Chris Kyle's novel to the big screen with Bradley Cooper perfectly cast in the titular role. While American Sniper has attracted a lot of acclaim, it has also attracted a lot of controversy with some dismissing it as propaganda, glorifying the Iraq War and labeling Chris Kyle as unheroic for murdering others for his country. All of these criticisms are unwarranted and unjust. That aside the movie is the main reason for this review, the politics and arguments are not the point of this review.<br/><br/>Having previously read the novel American Sniper, I was drawn into Chris Kyle's world as a US Navy SEAL sniper and amongst the many true life novels about the war, this was one of the best novels that I have ever read and I was eagerly anticipating the release of the movie which certainly did not disappoint one bit. The movie stays very faithful to the novel as well as input from other sources.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) just wanted to coast through life as a ranch hand and rodeo cowboy. However when he reaches a crossroad in his life he decided to do something about his life and enlisted in the US Navy where he further qualifies to become a sniper with the Navy SEALS. During his time with the Navy SEALS he records over 160 kills as a sniper, saving many lives and earning himself a legendary status amongst all the US troops. His wife Taya Kyle (Sienna Miller) stays true and faithful to him while he is on deployment and through his struggles adjusting to civilian life and being haunted by the memories of the war.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has done another fine job as a director, and Bradley Cooper who went through a very intense fitness regime powerfully brings to life Chris Kyle. While Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper have netted much of the acclaim, the unsung hero in this movie is Sienna Miller who has done an excellent job portraying Chris Kyle's wife Taya.<br/><br/>If you liked the novel American Sniper you will enjoy the movie. Take a bow Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, you have both done a fine job bringing American Sniper to life on screen.<br/><br/>9/10."
"barev-85094","8","10","13","21 October 2015"," A sharp shooter's view of the war in Iraq from a Dirty Harry angle.
","American SNIPER ~~ Starring Bradley Cooper, Directed by Clint Eastwood, Viewed at SONY Center Cinestar Berlin, March 5, 2015. <br/><br/>It's hard to tell whether Bradley Cooper as real life hero Chris Kyle is a sharp shooting junkie, just addicted to war, an unflagging American patriot, or maybe all three. In any case, a very strong but restrained Oscar worthy performance by Cooper to say the least, in a down and dirty presentation of a dirty war nobody really wanted -- close up in your face -- from a professional point of view.<br/><br/>As a Navy Seal trained super-sniper using state-of-the-art sniper equipment Kyle volunteers for four consecutive deadly combat missions in Iraq leaving his little children and constantly pregnant wife (Sienna Miller) behind in small town Texas. The film opens with a scene of the superstar sniper viewing an Iraqi woman clad in black robes with a little boy at her side suspended in his crosshairs. His finger is on the trigger as he carefully draws a bead, but — a doting new father himself back home as we will soon find out — he is anything but eager to gun down a defenseless civilian woman and a child. However, this is not just any innocent civilian woman and child. The woman slips a bomb concealed in her robes to the boy and whispers something in his ears ~~ obviously instructions to run at the American armored car and soldiers down the street in a glorious kamikaze attack, kill a few of them and go to Heaven. BAM! The boy goes Down as the bomb falls harmlessly aside. The woman tries to retrieve the bomb to complete the suicide mission. BAM again — That takes care of her as well — with a big blotch of blood up against the wall. We then get the back story of how Kyle was trained as a boy by his father in the art of hunting with a rifle, how he grew up in the macho atmosphere of Rodeo bronc-busting Texas and met his future wife during Seal training at a raunchy s-kicking local saloon. Heavy duty physical training on the beach prepare the Seal volunteers for the arduous tasks ahead. Quick no- nonsense marriage. Off to Battle. MIssion One. <br/><br/>Back to the cross-hairs and the grim mission in a battered Iraqi city constantly under attack by Guerrilla Arab defenders. In an action to find Al-Zaqari, ruthless head of the Al-Qaeda enemy, Kyle and his cohorts ruthlessly roust civilian Arab families in their homes. In one seemingly ordinary household a stash of bombs and weapons is found concealed under the floorboards. One Iraqi father is ruthlessly gunned down by fellow Arabs for ""talking with the enemy"". This is a ruthless war on both sides of the fence. House to house and room to room — no glorious battlefield vistas. Endless fierce shootouts ensue that make the Okay Corral look like a Girl Scouts picnic. From the scene of battle Kyle often chats with his anguished wife back home via cell phone. All she wants is for him to come home to his family. All he wants, it seems, is to keep shooting down more of the enemy. Big question: Who needs him more ~~ His country or His family? After a particularly furious battle — in overpowering red darkness filling the screen for many minutes, Kyle has had enough and yells to his wife on the phone over the din that he is COMING HOME — this time for good. <br/><br/>Back home away from the killing fields he is obvious rattled by his lurid war experiences. To keep busy, perhaps as a form of self therapy, he volunteers to assist other crippled and traumatized Iraqi war veterans in recovery at a military hospital. On February 2, 2013, one such veteran shoots him dead. Why? --Professional jealousy? -- war conditioned psychoses? -- rampant killer instinct? --- No clear answer -- But almost as big a shock as all that has gone before! The denouement of the film is the memorial service for Kyle with a stadium in gun totin' Texas named after him. Lots of American flags but not waving too strongly. The end credits roll before a stunned German audience. Nobody leaves until the lights go up. A powerful non-judgemental Clint Eastwood Judgement. The American Gun Dream reconsidered. If anybody, Dirty Harry should know. Alex, Berlin<br/><br/>PS: well, Do any of you bleeding liberal punks out there feel lucky?"

","a real person. The movie is about Chris Kyle, a guy whom was a navy seal and had the highest total of sniper kills in the middle east. It follows him through a few tours and what his life was like when he came home. He was married and had a couple of kids, but was more concerned about America. When he finally gets out, it shows how his mind was still messed up from what he had experienced but was trying to get better when he died.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the war scenes that were shot very well. You get a feeling of what it would be like to be a sniper sitting on top of a building. Soon, that's not enough for Chris and he wants to be involved in the more dangerous door to door. Also toward the end there is an exciting shooting scene where Chris completes the main objective but the group's position is compromised and they must get out with a huge sand storm moving in.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Definitely one of the better films in the past several years.

","I spent 27 years in the US Army, was in Operation Desert Storm (the original), was vehemently opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and thought this movie was one of the best military/war movies I've ever seen. The realism was there, Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, the angst of a soldier during battle was portrayed brilliantly, the decisions we ask kids to make are real and they were realistically shown on screen, and as this film makes clear--war isn't a walk in the park. Anybody who thinks Bradley Cooper is a flash in the pan is sadly mistaken; this guy is the real thing. Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, Charlie Sheen in Platoon, and now Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. You've got to go all the way back to Gregory Peck in Pork Chop Hill or George C. Scott in Patton to get even close to an actor that gave a better performance in this genre. I saw it twice. Couldn't get through it the first time and had to walk out- -I got so damned furious at George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld for murdering all these innocent kids I couldn't watch anymore. Once I got past that I went back to see it again and trust me--it's phenomenal."
"amrikbiswas","8","19","28","24 November 2018"," An Accurate Depiction
","As a reader of the original autobiography, I was quite thrilled learning that a movie adaptation would be made. First off, the book is absolutely incredible. It gives an incredible good depiction of the reality of war and it's effects.<br/><br/>But I'm not here to talk about the book, I'm here to talk about the movie. Honestly the only thing I have to complain is the lack of running time. The whole plot was changed and was focused around an unclear antagonist of an enemy sniper called Mustafa when in the book Mustafa is no real threat. He's only mentioned one or twice in the book.<br/><br/>But that isn't the big deal. What makes the movie so great and so successful was it's accurate depiction of who Chris Kyle was. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller both gives outstanding performances as Chris and Taya Kyle. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the caliber of their acting and just the sort of ethic realism they brought to the characters. Bradley's depiction of Kyle in this film is one of the best feats of acting I've ever seen. You can see the look in his eyes and you can see that that guy is the American Sniper.<br/><br/>Acting aside, the plot was somewhat of a slight mess. The movie was focused around non canon events but they made it work in the movie. The lack of runtime certainly took away the completion of Kyle's war story. But that's what the movie intends to deliver. The movie intends to deliver a depiction of who this man was. He didn't kill because he loved killing. He killed so that the savages wouldn't come back to the States and kill his people. He was protecting his buddies, he was protecting his comrades. That's who he was. To him, it didn't matter how many guys or savages he killed. What mattered to him was how many of his guys were killed. Those were the ones that stuck to him and the movie does an incredibly good job of depicting this. I have to say Clint Eastwood, well done on doing the book grace.<br/><br/>It's action sequences are gritty and realistic and it's depiction of Iraq is top notch and accurate. Honestly for people who haven't read the book, you have no idea just how more gruesome Iraq actually is then is depicted in the movie."
"trublu215","9","571","1095","19 December 2014"," Brutal and Powerful; American Sniper ranks among the best of the year
","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's harrowing take on Chris Kyle's life and his service in the Navy as a SEAL sniper who killed nearly 200 enemy soldiers. The film is relentlessly violent and disturbing but honors the life of the late Chris Kyle in a very admirable way. It doesn't show this man as an invincible legend, it shows him as a mere man with a heart and soul that are clearly broken due to his sacrifice for his country. Bradley Cooper delivers the best performance of his career as Chris Kyle. Cooper didn't merely bulk up for the role, he became this man without any hesitation and doesn't hit a false note. Clint Eastwood proves that he can still deliver a phenomenal film even in his mid-eighties. It isn't only impressive for his age, but American Sniper is an impressive film in general. It doesn't wallow in classic war film clichès, it tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the book and while some creative liberties were taken in telling the story regarding pacing, it is an excellent film. It isn't an all out war film like The Hurt Locker, it is a heavy drama with plenty of gut wrenching scenes both on and off the battle field. The most interesting part of this film is the parallels between Kyle's life as a sniper and Kyle's deteriorating life state side. It is an interesting dynamic to add to a film like this and echoes past films from the 70s such as Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. On a technical level, American Sniper sores with great cinematography that is a bit more colorful when compared to Eastwood's past films and excellent sound design. You see every wound and hear every gunshot with realistic velocity. It is a truly great cinematic experience. Overall, American Sniper is a great film that will tug at your heart strings much like last year's Lone Survivor and even goes one step beyond that film and gives us grade A entertainment with grade A acting. It stands as one of the best films of the year."

","I am not an American citizen and have no right to say anything to American society, but this movie is inspiring to me.
This movie illustrates not only how the locals (in this movie people in Iraq) are suffering from the war but also how American soldiers are. There is s scene that a local boy is carrying ""something"" (a bomb) from a distance and approaching the American army side. And there is an emotional struggle of the sniper whether to take a shot on the child or not. Of course it is not acceptable to shoot a child to death but also he has to save his and other soldiers' lives because they have family too.
This movie describes the complexity of humanity in war; human rights are not to be undermined but some people have to undermine others' to protect their lives.
There are many arguments on this movie but I liked this movie mainly from this perspective."

","American Sniper did a great job portraying an Chris Kyle as the American hero he is. It showed how he did what he had to do while fighting in the war but also did whatever he could do to help others after he came back home and helped himself. The fighting scenes in this film may not be exactly what had happened but it is very intense and appeals to the people who have never experienced it. It is very real to these people and helps you realize what Chris Kyle went through. After all he goes through in the war it destroys the person he was but does not kill him. him or end up killing him. After his war experiences hurt him, he helps himself and gets back to who he used to be. After all the fighting he is killed why fighting others."

America's True War Hero Chris Kyle is portrayed absolutely very well by Cooper. The fact that this movie focus mainly on him and his victories through war and how it effects his family life makes its more of a Drama Movie than a War Movie.Still its a Masterpiece.No doubt adjusted for inflation its the highest grossing war movie.Perhaps the best I saw after Saving Private Ryan.Everything about the film is so much praised because it is deserving it .Although Chris death came as a shock to me and it made me really sad but the best I can do is Salute him. It could have easily won Best Picture Oscar if it was not the Fake Baby and some controversial display for both the Iraq war and Chris Kyle. I really hated the Fake Baby as it destroyed the momentum of the Movie for me and it made me laugh out loud which was not supposed to be there.If that fake baby was not there I would give it a ten.

","I have always said that if a movie is based on a true story you have to judge the movie not the story of characters it's based on and that's why I believe a lot of people have come to hate this movie but I love it. Clint Eastwood's movies are extremely hit or miss but he is always extremely skilled behind the camera and he exceed at his job as a director with flying colours he makes for so many intense and nail biting action sequences along with quitter and more personal moments between Chris Kyle and his wife played to perfection by Bradley Cooper. Cooper is amazing in this movie I believe this to be to date his greatest performance I knew that he could act after seeing movies like Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle but here he just brings his action ability to a whole new level bringing a humanity to his character even during the real life persons more controversial moments. The reasons why Kyle does what he does in the film are extremely satisfying you just get the feeling that he just wants to help his country because he believes in it and what's to do his part in helping it. The rivalry that develops between Kyle and an enemy sniper throughout the movie is extremely riveting it grounds Kyle as a character and makes you realise that he isn't the legend he has been poised to be that he is human and may have met his match. Sienna Miller really impressed me with this film I thought that she had excellent chemistry with Cooper and perfectly portrayed a struggling wife wanting to help and understand her husband. Where the film falters thought is the fact that it never really addresses the controversy of Chris Kyle I have no opinion on the man personally but I just think that it would have overall made the film just a but more interesting. <br/><br/>But Overall I love American Sniper I think it is for the most part an excellent analysis of its title character and creates for a riveting and very intimate movie that perfectly portrays the struggles of war and those who fight in them.<br/><br/>A-93%"

","The film I chose to review was American sniper starring Bradley cooper as Chris Kyle and Sienna Miller as Taya Kyle. This film is about a Navy Seal that has done multiple combat deployments to Iraq. While he is deployed to Iraq, Taya is left behind in the United States to raise their children on her own for the most part. This film takes an inside look into the lives of a family that has to deal with PTSD from the war. Also, this film takes a look at what the families go through while their spouses are on combat deployments. <br/><br/>The theme of the film is the warrior not leaving the solider even when he is home. Chris Kyle did four combat tours to Iraq while he is in the Navy. During that time, he is deployed, Kyle is credited with over 160 kills of enemy combatants. However, seeing his friends get killed while in Iraq had a lasting effect on Chris Kyles mental health. Even when he returned to the states, Kyle couldn't shake the horrors of war from his mind. This led him to be distant with his wife Taya while he was home from his deployments. His contestant need for making sure his comrades were OK left a scar on his mental health that may not ever be fixed. One of the few movies that has that much action with modern weaponry is Lone Survivor.<br/><br/>The Camera work for this film was about as best as they come. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job in capturing the battle scenes in the film. The up close and personal when Chris Kyle was shooting people was amazing. It showed that Kyle was having a problem with all the killing was doing throughout his tours of duty. This film set the standard with the camera angles that had taken place in the film. It made me feel for the characters and the struggle that they were going through. Another great technique was costume design. The military uniforms were flawless when compared to the real thing. Everything from the camouflage fatigues to the weapons and flak jackets that were worn by the Marines and Sailors. It made every scene more believable as watched the film from start to finish. <br/><br/>This movie is a great example of the warrior not leaving the solider even when he is home. I could relate to this film since I was in the Marines and did fight in Fallujah, Iraq when Chris Kyle was deployed there. However, this film really hit home with me when Chris Kyle was having family problems on the home front. It I hard to put into words what we as service member go through while serving overseas. This film does a great job in explaining it for us."
"victuki","8","92","162","10 January 2015"," Gritty and Gripping
","Chris Kyle was the most lethal sniper in the U.S. military history. He apparently killed more than 250 Iraqui insurgents, though the Pentagon only credited him around 160, which nevertheless made him a legend of the U.S. Army. I started to read the book last year but stopped doing it since I first heard about the project. Eastwood and Cooper on board, that is promising. And of course they both deliver, and ""American Sniper"" is dense and blunt, quite like a shot.<br/><br/>Cooper plays Chris Kyle, the ultimate ""American"": religious, patriot and uncompromising in his convictions. He is a noble and honest man regarding every aspect of his life, and that is something to respect. Cooper already played a soldier in ""The A-Team"" remake (Joe Carnahan, 2010), and it seems that he showed great abilities in the military stunts, and showed interest in the work of the army. He bulked up 20 kg and went through a really tough training, including Navy SEAL sniper sessions. Sienna Miller plays his wife Taya, who suffered the effects of war on his husband, despite his strong belief and determination. Her unconditional love was a massive support for Kyle.<br/><br/>Eastwood has made an intense and heartfelt film, one of his trademarks, absent shows and unnecessary politics or philosophy. This is obviously the classic ""American"" patriotic film, but it differs from others in the approach of the man, who is an instrument to a purpose, yet a human being totally aware of what he does.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this film is almost perfect in many aspects, and the only thing that does not hook me is how much it reminds me to ""The Hurt Locker"" (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008). That was way more focused on the adrenaline addiction the main character had, but the behavior of both characters after tours seemed to me pretty alike."

I've read a review by a former Navy Seal (Brent Gleeson) that says it best ""The way the film was directed coupled with outstanding performances by Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller and the rest of the cast made for a heart wrenching and deeply accurate portrayal of the external and internal battles our service men and women face. Not to mention the even greater sacrifices made by the families and loved ones back home."" <br/><br/>I would rate it shear perfection had they spent more time with his recovery and angst driven road back once he was stateside. This is easily one of my top five films of the year."

","We saw an Advanced Screening of American Sniper last week, and it was awesome. This movie was directed by Clint Eastwood and you can see his hand in it. It's not flashy, and it tells the story without adding to it like Hollywood tends to do with all war movies, especially ones about the recent wars our men have served in. You feel like you know at least a portion of what a sniper and his Seal team went through while serving in the Iraq War. But, most importantly, it also tells the story of an Extraordinary Man, a true American Hero, who devoted much of his life to his country, taking multiple tours to keep ""his men"" safe, and to protect his country. What an extraordinary movie. I can't say enough about it. Everyone should see this movie. See what this man did for our country. I would also recommend staying through the credits. All the film shown during the ending credits is from actual newsreels. An excellent movie. I wholly recommend it.<br/><br/>Unlike other Hollywood takes on our soldiers, and the war in Iraq, this movie just tells the story. No fluff, no hidden agendas, it just tells the story of who this man was and how much he did for our country. You can tell this movie was based off a book by someone who actually had fought and lived this life. It's very real, and thankfully the book wasn't ruined, like so many are, by embellishments. <br/><br/>It doesn't have the flashy coolness that studios tend to do when portraying our Navy Seals.It's cool to see that, but then you almost feel like what you are seeing is not real, inaccurate, just a Hollywood version of what our Seals do. Then the other extreme is the hidden anti-war agenda that is always being pushed. This movie just tells the story and after seeing it you feel like you know what it was like to be a Seal in Iraq. What clearing door to door for insurgents is like and what snipers do for not only their units, but for our country as well. How important they are in our fight against those who hate freedom. This story also shows what sacrifices spouses make in order for their men to be away fighting for their country. It also to me shows the best example of the hyper awareness that occurs and can't help bought be brought home when you have to be on guard constantly when deployed in a hot zone.<br/><br/>I honestly went into this movie thinking there was no way Bradley Cooper could portray Chris Kyle, but was totally wrong in my assumptions. He didn't just portray this larger than life hero, he becomes him. Truly amazing piece of work."

","As a movie, outstanding! As for Mr. Kyle, he is an American Hero. His country sent him to do a job, and he did it. Anyone questioning the integrity of this American, can go question the Bush Administration and any other administration that continues war. I believe in Peace. Our troops went because they abide by authority. It is sad to see any human die; Thank you politicians. Thank you Mr. Kyle for helping so many people in such a short time here on earth. Peace is with you... The director and actors amazing. I want to know more about the sand-storm seen. And who filmed the funeral procession footage? It made me cry. I highly recommend the movie.

","Bradley Cooper is simply one of the elite actors working today. He has now been nominated for 3 acting Oscars. It's debatable whether or not he was better than other actors this year, I will judge that once I have seen all the films, but he is definitely Oscar worthy in American Sniper. But he's not the only great thing about this film. Clint Eastwood does a great job directing and the editing and special effects are top notch. It's one of the most intense films I have seen this year and so I have no problem with some of the nominations this movie received.<br/><br/>It's really just an incredible story. At times the film can be heartbreaking. Almost half of my theater walked out weeping. I didn't cry, but man was this a tough one to watch. The fact that all of this (presumably) actually happened just makes it that much more difficult. One of the key scenes from the trailer begins the film and it sets the tone for just how intense it will be. Eastwood didn't really hold back on the brutality of killing over a hundred people, and the aftermath of what it does to a person. I initially thought the back and forth between the tours and his family life would take away from the experience but it really didn't. Sienna Miller did a very good job of giving us that emotion without overdoing it.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper bulked up and also brought the emotional gravitas it takes to lead this type of film. Chris Kyle gets literally lost in fighting this war that he doesn't realize how much this is negatively impacting his family and Cooper perfectly portrayed that. I also don't know if I have seen PTSD better displayed than it was here. Of course I wouldn't actually know how that feels but I do know that the subtly with which Cooper portrayed it was very effective. They also didn't make this person out to be too much of a hero. I appreciate that they didn't take killing this many people lightly.<br/><br/>I also agree with the way Eastwood decided to end the film. Without spoilers I don't think there's any other way you could have served the film and it's real life characters better. American Sniper is a difficult film to watch, but it's one of the better ones this year.<br/><br/>+Cooper's multidimensional performance <br/><br/>+Story structure <br/><br/>+Eastwood's directing <br/><br/>+Doesn't hold back with the top notch editing<br/><br/>8.4/10"

","Few times does a movie remain entertainment yet tell a deep truth, American Sniper manages just that. If one wanted a recent definition of a American Patriot hero it's effectively brought to life by the masterful direction of Clint Eastwood. This movie will be his crowning achievement in a much celebrated career. Such a feat could not be accomplished with just any story however. The life of Chris Kyle, and what he stood for, makes a perfect synergy.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's amazingly real depiction of a ""complicated, yet simple Texas cowboy"" breathes life into a story surrounded by the darkness of war. It single-handedly makes that phrase ""The Greatest Generation"" as one that didn't end after WWII. It wouldn't be a stretch to say Coopers got a lock on best actor after seeing the film.<br/><br/>American Sniper is rare in that it feels brutality honest yet palatable. While folks such as me led a very normal life stateside men just like Chris Kyle were laying everything on the line for the very belief of good we were enjoying. One can't help but feel humbled by what these men accomplished. War is the worst of humanity without doubt, but within war the best of America often rises above both evil and politics. Chris Kyle was assuredly one of the finest examples in all of American history of such and American Sniper is a fine testament of which we all can be proud. See this movie for any number of reasons, but take away the best we as Americans stand for."

","American Sniper is a true story based on Navy SEAL legend Chris Kyle played by Bradley Cooper. Directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie is set in Iraq during the infamous War on Terror following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City. Chris Kyle is a trained Navy sniper from the elite group SEAL Team Six. He is deployed to Iraq over a course of four different tours and is an overseer of military squads performing missions throughout the country. The film follows the life of Chris Kyle before, during and after his Navy SEAL deployment, with various scenes splicing back and forth from his personal life to life as a solder. Growing up in Texas, Chris is an all American cowboy who learns to shoot rifles, hunt deer and ride bulls. Chris's inspiration to serve his country and to enlist into the Navy's program is a direct result of the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 200 people. After meeting his wife in a bar, Chris marries her and soon after is deployed to Iraq following the 9/11 terror attacks. During his first tour, he is forced to kill a mother and child carrying an improvised explosive device approaching a Marine company. This event has a tremendous impact on Chris and he is visibly upset by the kills. Over the course of his four tours in Iraq, Chris becomes the military's most deadly sniper with 255 kills. ""The Legend"" as he is nicknamed, is mentally scarred and as with many military veterans returning from war, suffers from post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Director Clint Eastwood does a fantastic job portraying the life of service men enlisted in the US Military and the various problems they encounter throughout life. Some issues servicemen encounter as a result of military deployment are finding love, family relationships, and most importantly PTSD. Many veterans returning from warfare develop PTSD from the atrocities and horrific war experiences. Balancing life after warfare is hard for many soldiers returning from war, most if not all have some form of PTSD. Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper do an excellent job portraying the life of a solder with PTSD before, during and after war. After defeating his nemesis, a Syrian sniper and almost being overrun by mercenary infidels, Chris decides to come home and life as a solder is over. The following scene foreshadows Chris's PTSD struggles and attempt to return to ordinary life. The scene shows Chris drinking alone in a dark dive bar reminiscing about his past experiences. Once he returns home to his wife, he is vacantly staring at a blank TV hearing the horrors of war all while ignoring the world around him. Bradley Cooper's acting is phenomenal, he perfectly portrays the struggles of soldiers faced with post-traumatic stress disorder. The visual's in the film are extraordinary, Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper do a great job portraying warfare on the big screen. The cinematography is fantastic, one example is the sniper's last kill were the camera follows the trajectory of the bullet into the terrorist's head. These tiny aspects taken into consideration, make the film great. The film's short fall however, are some of the minor details Clint Eastwood might have overlooked. In one scene Chris is holding his baby daughter and you can clearly see that the infant is a doll. Clint Eastwood should have paid the extra money to have a real toddler and not a plastic toy in the movie. Other than minor motion picture errors, American Sniper is a fantastic film worth the two hour watch. The film's patriotic narrative accounts the life of an American Hero who experiences the horrors of war and the great honor he brings to his country."

","""The thing that, uh... haunts me are all the guys that I *couldn't* save,"" said Chris Kyle about the men and women he could not save in Iraq. An action-packed movie, American Sniper, portrays the life of a Texas cowboy seeing the Twin Towers collapse on 9/11then enlisting in the Navy and becoming a Navy SEAL. In American Sniper, Clint Eastwood did not shy away from showing Chris Kyle's emotional and psychological battle in and out of the military. At times in Iraq, Kyle had to contemplate shooting women and children. Kyle learned from his father that the world contains three things: ""sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs,"" who he must defeat and defend. Hunting skills Kyle learned in Texas paid off as he developed sniper skills, which eventually led to confirmed kills—160 in total during his time in Iraq. Eastwood shows Kyle as a selfless and reliable military man, who desires to protect his country. Bradley Cooper plays Kyle with an attitude of edginess and resilience. Also, Cooper portrays Kyle as a true American hero and shows the side of Kyle's PTSD. At the end, a lasting impression of the movie explains Kyle was giving back to a veteran at a shooting range, which ultimately cost Kyle his life. While showing the struggles of a Navy SEAL, American Sniper grips the hearts of viewers who catch a glimpse of a devoted and patriotic American hero. This movie deserves a 4.2 out of 5."
"sickofenjoyingmyself","8","11","15","2 April 2016"," Admirable action tale
","'American Sniper' is a worthy watch and makes for some absorbing and, at times, uncomfortable viewing. The title of the movie for me suggested an almost cheesy and boastful American take on a man that became a legendary character during his time serving as a navy seal. However a poignant and heart felt performance from Bradley Cooper in this well directed portrayal gives serious weight to this legendary, and ultimately tragic tale. Bradley Cooper shows a man living in each of his different worlds, and caught between the two. He shows the delicacy of human nature as he struggles to adjust between a world of safety and comfort and the brutal, dangerous world of combat war. He shows the appreciation, yet embarrassment of the celebrity status afforded to him by his heroics. Ultimately - he portrays the man behind the myth and legend. As well as his inspired performance Sienna Miller is also on top form as his suffering wife. The overall quality of the cinematography and war scenes is extremely impressive and realistic. I didn't really know anything about Chris Kyle before watching this - therefore the last sequence of the film was extremely shocking and emotional to comprehend. Overall this is a particularly thoughtful and admirable biopic."
"tankace","9","11","15","24 March 2016"," A great war movie, which is totally underrated
","The American Sniper is one of the newest movies in the war movie category and it truly shows how the war on Irak affected your protagonist, played by Bradley Cooper,and his family.First thing first, Cooper was excellent to the role,which was a big surprise to me because I knew him as a comedian,but here he really makes you believe that he is a strong yet traumatized warrior .Sienna Miller was also good at presenting to us what it meanings to be with a person like that and as I saw ,it is hard. Also I think that after letters from Iwo Jima this the best war movie that the old cowboy Eastwood has ever made because although it show us that some thing worth fighting for, the cost of war in the soul and body, it makes the gains worthless, if you can not be with your loved-ones. To conclude the people who say bad things about this flick are out of their minds and are either hipster or so called ""film-critics""who love to say that it is not Apocalypse Now, which is one of the greatest movies of all time but,they have pasted about forty years since then and a lot have changed, and lets be honest the war movies of the late seventies and early eighties are great but they are almost hilariously over the top and a bit inaccurate in a historical manner. <br/><br/>In other words here the critics got it wrong and the box office right."

","This is a great movie. The complaints that it stereotypes Muslims and presents them as one dimensional are in themselves stereotypes. The West is at war with Islam but such is the political correctness within the West that the West cannot even define Islam as the enemy. This movie captures perfectly the lacuna between the values of Islam and the West: there is no compromise or overlap in values. Islam makes this plain time after time. Chris Kyle is one small cog in this battle and he personifies what it will take to defeat Islam. The sacrifices he makes in respect of his personal life do have a element of cliché about them but this lack is more than compensated for by the verisimilitude of the battle scenes. Further poignancy to the movie is that Kyle's murderer was at the very least sympathetic to Islam even though there is no evidence that he had converted."

","I went into this movie hesitantly. I haven't particularly enjoyed war movies like these, like Fury or Saving Private Ryan, so naturally I was surprised when I found that I actually really enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>American Sniper is very different from other war movies. The plot isn't the driving force, as usual. The story of a war movie rarely goes deeper than 'kill the others guys because our government decided to declare war on them'. Although I have seen plenty of war movies with good plots, they weren't the kinds that were focused on the actual fighting and more focused on the characters doing stuff while a war is happening. So the plot wasn't the different part.<br/><br/>The movie was much more character driven, and the characters were actually good. Unlike the other war movies mentioned, American Sniper had a heavy focus on not only Chris Kyle, but his wife and their relationship. Their relationship was very well done, and actually felt real. It's expected though, considering the movie is based on true events. Nevertheless, it was really nice to see some effort put into the characters. <br/><br/>Overall American Sniper is one of my new favorite war movies. The characters and their relationships is very well developed, but the plot is, as expected, pretty much non-existent, which is fine in a war movie like this. Most of the war movies I've watched have been very predictable: kill people for 2 hours, then all the main characters die. That wasn't the case for this movie, which was really nice. By the end I was actually wondering how it was turn out, because the rest of the movie had been much more difficult to predict than some others. I've read some other reviews, and I really don't understand why those users didn't like the movie, just because some facts about Chris Kyle or something were missing. Who cares? I don't, at least. In the end I would definitely recommend American Sniper. It's easily one of the best war movies I've ever seen."

Acts of war and human approach are nicely in balance, everything seems realistic, the main character is no dumb killing machine without any feelings, war is not ""fun"", etc., often lacking in movies alike. True, the movie is practically focused on Cooper's character Chris Kyle, there are no comparable performances, but I could hardly find glorification/justification of the U.S. military involvement in the movie in question - wars are initiated by political and/or economic interests, the military is supposed to obey the orders coming from government departments. And there is no place for reasoning during battles - either you kill, or you / your fellows get killed.<br/><br/>All in all, a serious and solid movie.

","'American Sniper' is based on the memoirs of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, written by Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is the deadliest shooter of all time and is called ""the devil"" by his enemies. From 1999 to 2009 he established a record with most murders as a sniper in the history of the US Army. Kyle learned the tricks on this matter when he was a child and would play a prominent role in the fight against terrorism that began after 9/11. Of course, the controversial feature film American Sniper did not win Oscar for Best Movie and would star leader Bradley Cooper head home with empty hands. The Academy does not like politics. They only like the 'appearance' of political engagement. And that's exactly what American Sniper, the first movie about the Iraq War, does: It's not a real representation of the real thing. Clint Eastwood's newest film is not an honest portrait of war and what it does with the people involved; It is an unforgettable homage to the navy, considered by many Americans as one of their greatest legends."

My parents took me to see American Sniper on opening weekend and needless to say, my entire life has changed.

"ironhorse_iv","8","72","135","14 January 2015"," American Sniper hits the bull-eye. It reach its target audience. For others, it was a miss.
","This movie isn't for everybody. It's feel like the usual, over patriotic one-sided America Hollywood film that people will either love or hate. Does this movie seem a bit shallow and propaganda? Somewhat. The movie made it very clear that there were some really bad people in Iraq that had to be stopped. Still, it does question and criticize the Iraq War, without painting the American soldiers in a bad-light. Little to no shades of grey whatsoever. Could the movie go into more detail on the war and felt more well-balanced? Yes, but it's clear that this movie isn't for those people. It was for the people looking for heroes; out of the mess that was the Iraq War. They found heroic and role-model in U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Is it true, that Chris Kyle was somewhat racist and killed dozens of people for fighting for their country, when the US invaded and occupied the country of Iraq? Yes. Yet, on one hand, he is somewhat of victim, because he only wanted to do what seem good and he was misled in thinking it will come from this war. He indeed took a deadly toll, because of that moral belief. I think the movie did a pretty honest biopic of the man. Indeed, he was a hero to some people, and yes, he was somewhat a gung-ho war freak to others. In the end, no matter, what's your honest opinion, on the guy, you have to say that Chris Kyle indeed took his mission, very serious, protect his comrades and becomes one of the most lethal snipers in American history. Directed by Clint Eastwood, and based off Chris Kyle's autobiography American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. The movie tells the story of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) whom pinpoint accuracy, help saves countless America soldier's lives, but also makes him a prime target of insurgents during his four war tours in Iraq, with each tour taking more and more a PTSD ton of his well-being. Bradley Cooper had a gripping central performance as the man that couldn't stop fighting, Chris Kyle. He gain 40 pound of muscle to play his Captain America like hero, but acted like Captain Ahab. He made you believe that the Iraqi insurgents were the manifestation of all that is wrong with the world, and he feels that it is his destiny to eradicate this symbolic evil. Despite the content and the reality of the war, the movie doesn't paint, the people of Iraq in any good light. The movie tries to link Iraq to the tragic events of 9/11, but anybody with a brain, would know, that Iraq had little to do with it. You would think that there would be, at least some good Iraqi people in the film, but no, even the good ones end up, being villains for Chris Kyle to defeat. I try to never understand the logic of the action in this film. Indeed, it was graphic and brutal, but it felt a bit unrealistic at times with all the missions, he probably didn't go through. I guess, seeing him snipe people from a distance, can be a bit repetitious. The movie make it seem like he had to kill this one guy, Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), an ex-Olympic sniper before he was able to stop fighting. In my opinion, I think, the climax would had been a stronger film if he didn't get a chance to kill that character and all the years spent trying to, took the ton on him. Another disappoint is the lack of story after the war. It shows that he face PTSD, but the movie doesn't show the other stress, he had to deal with, like recriminations from lawyers, anti-war commenters and his fellow soldiers. Nor, does it tells us anything about him, writing his book. Most of the stateside scenes were filmed pretty mediocre. Sierra Miller as the wife, Taya seem a bit uninteresting. Her character has no personality, no job, no family and no inner life. Her own purpose in the film is to help Chris Kyle with his inner demons. I kinda hope for a more rounded character for her. It's pretty astonishing how one plastic baby prop can undercut a crying couple's emotional impact. It's also kinda disappointing, that he have no clue who the troubled veteran was, that he was trying to help in the end. Lots of miss opportunities to make the ending so much better. I glad, they didn't add the whole taking down carjackers in North Texas and looters during Hurricane Katrina or the time he 'supposedly' slugged Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura for talking smack about Iraq from stories that Chris Kyle told people. Those stories clearly have ample amount of skepticism. Chris Kyle was known to exaggerate or fabricate his own accomplishments at times, some have questioned if a straightforward adaptation of his autobiography was appropriate. I have to agree, this film was a bit rush in production, way too early to tell if any of this events are honestly 'based on truth'. Whether the movie is pro or anti-war has been the source of much debate. Overall: Was it a good film? Yes. It was indeed well crafted from beginning to end. Could a little more time pre-production, made it a better film that everybody can watch? Yes. Still, it's a must-watch."

","Why do we as a species just keep killing, making war, destroying countries, making surviving soldiers' minds scared and dysfunctional? For those of us who have been through extended combat in wars throughout the last century and into the present answers to those questions escape us. But despite the lurid subject matter of watching men kill men under the umbrella of 'war', films such as this keep our eyes focused on the pity of war. Jason Hall adapted the book of the true events as recorded in their book by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and James DeFelice and form all the facts molded a story that gives us a distilled version of the four tours of duty in Iraq as a navy Seal Sniper that 'won' Chris Kyle 160 kills and in doing so allowed us to witness the moral and mental deterioration of a man's soul. This film SHOULD be seen.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle was a Texan who wanted to become a rodeo cowboy, but in his thirties he found out that maybe his life needed something different, something where he could express his real talent, something that could help America in its fight against terrorism. Post 9/11 happened, so he joined the SEALs in order to become a sniper. After marrying Taya, Kyle and the other members of the team are called for their first tour of Iraq. Kyle's struggle isn't with his missions, but about his relationship with the reality of the war and, once returned at home, how he manages to handle it with his urban life, his wife and kids. It does not end well for anyone.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's direction is razor sharp and he doesn't miss a step. Bradley Cooper brings an astonishingly fine performance in allowing us to see all aspects of this driven man. Sienna Miller is excellent as his sensitive wife, and there are poignant little character vignettes by Jake McDorman as Biggles, Luke Grimes, Sammy Sheik as the Iraqi counterpart to Chris, Navid Negahan, Jonathan Groff, Cory Hardrict, Keir O'Donnell and many other in this huge cast. The cinematography is so realistic it is difficult to watch and the locations in Morocco are disturbing real. The film will keep you awake after seeing it, and it should."

","This is not a movie! This is the new marketing strategy of the American army to get stupid people to join.<br/><br/>Apparently Clint Eastwood was hired by the army to create a 2 hours advertisement on how ""honorable"" it is to be part of the oil wars. This a very political movie, trying to justify why America waged a war over more than one country because of the alleged action of very small group of extremest residing in these countries.<br/><br/>No surprise that the movie had little success on the foreign market. This movie is offensive and is depicting only what is favorable for the Americans in an exaggerating way and missing the reality of the war. For convenience all the kids and women killed in the war, were extremest, endangering the lives of the ""innocent"" solders, while in reality a lot of innocent kids and women who had nothing to do with any extremest were killed. Somehow the torture prisons were also left out and the ""interrogation"" practices.<br/><br/>In the end the movie is trying to be dramatic, showing the psychological consequences of protecting ""innocent"" solder and ""justifyingly"" killing kids and women. The reality, however, is a bit different. The psychological effects on solders were because they were killing innocent people for the greediness of other who were enjoying themselves in luxury in the mean time.<br/><br/>I find this movie disgusting. The fact that it has been nominated for 6 Oscars, shows how objective the Academy Awards are. If you are low intelligent American, you would probably like it. If you are an intelligent American, you will be ashamed of this propaganda. I don't think I have to say what the rest of the world think about the movie."

","Clint Eastwood has done an on point masterpiece of art, creativity, bravery and truth. The movie is factual and simply indicates that 9-11 started a war and that, that war hasn't ended. This is the story of one man who was incensed at the Islamic attacks on his country and wanted to go and hunt down Islamic terrorists and stop the perpetrators of needless self righteous violence. Attacks nearly as horrible as 9-11 have been perpetrated till this day all over the world. The entire world is at war with Islamic extremists motivated by the Koran that fuels attacks and war with its over 100 violent verses that command the slaughter of all that believe otherwise. American sniper is not for anyone who hates America,is delusional about war never being necessary, or that is going to defend a religion that initiates killing. Every single actor was top notch, well chosen and the screenplay was magnificent, worthy of the sacrifice of the main character and it is a story Clint felt was important to tell; ESPECIALLY at this time in the history of the world. A message that needed to get out. This is not a divisive movie, it rather sheds light on a divisive brutal heartless enemy that already has promoted violence and division all over the world and American Sniper shows how peace can to attained, through courage and strength and only.... through courage sacrifice and strength. Mr. Eastwood used his talents to tell the life story of a man he greatly respected. Too bad for 'controllers', he still has the right to do that in America. Great movie. Truly great movie. We still have a few real Americans left. This movie was vastly inspiring. Everybody walked out of the theatre in Owings mills Md tonight moved to the core and breathless with awe and patriotism. You could feel it in the air and one man got so emotionally involved in the movie that he spoke out several times sporadically during the film. It was in no way annoying and I think everyone in there was as moved as he was. It showed how touched he was. I felt exactly the same. The movie was 'edge of your seat' every single moment, and it was a good flick in addition to being totally relevant."

","I'm a big fan of American war movies, but this was horrible. It's basically Team America World Police without the self-awareness. Every American is a hero. Every Iraqi is a 'savage'. The guy invading a foreign country is a 'patriot' and the guys defending their country are 'terrorists'. No shades of grey whatsoever.<br/><br/>It runs way too long, which would't be a bad thing if it was interesting, but it isn't. It's the same old story of a guy changing while away at war, except he was unlikeable at the beginning and unlikeable at the end. Not that compelling.<br/><br/>And anyone from outside the American South will probably need subtitles as Cooper mumbled every line. Just take every mumbled word you didn't quite catch and replace it with ''Murica' and you get the idea."
"smoothrunner","8","78","148","14 January 2015"," Nobody comes back from war unscathed
","What it's like to be a soldier in a modern war? What is the price of military glory? For those, who want answers to these questions, two ways are opened - direct experience or experience mediated by the art of cinema. The more talented movie makers, the more authentic experience they can mediate through their art to public. The ""American Sniper"" is exactly such kind of art.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is as convincing as an actor can be. You don't feel him acting, you just see person, which Cooper impersonates before you. You see his emotions, deeply hidden, but glimpsing from the depth. And there are choices, Kyle made. Choices, about which we, civilians, even don't want to think about. We are mostly living in imaginary world, hiding from horrors of reality. Well, soldiers can't hide from it - they must face it or they'll die. They must make choices, horrible, inhuman in terms of civilized behaviour. And many of them became broken, actually losing their humanity in the process. <br/><br/>The phrases, Chris said - about common people, behaving as usual like there is no war there; that he can't allow himself to be home, while others are still fighting; about military brotherhood - all of them are so recognizable. That's exactly same words, which you can hear from Ukrainian soldiers here. Even dehumanization of enemies (calling them ""savages"", etc.) is understandable - otherwise it would be hard to justify to yourself terrible things you are doing (there is ingenious episode in the George Orwell's ""Looking back on the Spanish War"" where he recalls that he refrained from shooting at ""Fascist"" partly because of a small detail, which humanized his foe:""I had come here to shoot at ""Fascists""; but a man who is holding up his trousers isn't a ""Fascist"", he is visibly a fellow-creature, similar to yourself, and you don't feel like shooting at him""). <br/><br/>This reality they meet, these choices they made - all of it bring soldiers farther and farther into the web of war. And nobody comes back from war unscathed. You can't just go home from war - it will follow you. The things, you've seen, the choices, you've made - they will haunt you wherever you are. If this movie will help others to realize what sacrifices soldiers are really making out there - behind the borders of usual life - what price they are paying, then cinema art is worth its invention.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie from Clint Eastwood - 8 out of 10."

This 2014 American Biographical War Drama based on the 2012 book by The ""Most Lethal Sniper"" in U.S. Military History, U.S. Navy SEAL Team 3 Chief Chris Kyle who was credited with over 150 kills, depicts actual combat events which took place over in Falujah, Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.<br/><br/>The film begins with Chris Kyle played by Cooper and his younger brother Jeff Kyle played by Keir O'Donnell as rodeo cowboys from Texas. After watching news developments of U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanznia and Kenya, Chris Kyle is compelled to join the Navy Seals, so he does. During his training, Chris meets his future wife/mother of his children, Taya Kyle played by Miller at a local bar, they start talking, and in a matter of time they are married, Taya gets pregnant, and Chris is soon deployed four times in to the combat zone.<br/><br/>While over there, Kyle faces challenges of being away from his newly planned family for months at a time, which creates strain on his family-life, killing enemy fighters including children, losing comrades in combat to extremist snipers, coming home transitioning back to civilian life which is difficult due to his combat-related stress, and finally he finds that this war is the war which can't be left behind.<br/><br/>The movie is action-packed, gripping, eye-opening, filled with emotion and definitely well directed by Eastwood and characters portrayed magnificently by Miller and Cooper. If you are looking for a real-life depiction of the challenges/sacrifices American Forces face in the Combat Zone, definitely check this film out! It's 132 minutes long, Rated R, but worth the time to go see. My cinema score is 8/10! ‪#‎maverickradio‬"
"jake-lamotta-batman","8","75","142","11 January 2015"," Great performance by Bradley Cooper in a very good movie, which unfortunately came out in a year full of Great Films and performances.
","To start, this film seems to be over shadowed by the early comparisons to Lone Survivor and with any movie on war people will call it propaganda before in viewing, especially when you're dealing with a controversial figure like Chris Kyle. People can say that this film glorifies America, or that it has strong religious undertones but if a man is religious I don't think it should be cut from the adaption to film. The film itself asks great questions regarding the mental stability of soldiers, and although the questions aren't openly asked you can tell by Bradley Coopers performance that this is a heavily troubled man trying to deal with his demons completely on his own. I don't see the film as glorifying or as propaganda, it simply shows what goes into making these people, the events which started to open their eyes to the path they would eventually take. This film is a lot different than Lone Survivor, which I don't think would stand a chance at an Oscar Nomination no matter how weak the year was. I feel American Sniper could compete and could have won awards had 2014 not proved to be such a strong year for performances and film in general. <br/><br/>Just a side note, I went in to the film not a ""fan"" of Chris Kyle purely because I knew of him more as a guest on Opie & Anthony. I also noticed how often he'd crop up on situations like Fox News, so my political views are quite different than his, and I'm also not religious. You shouldn't allow these things to stop you from watching this film, think of it more as another Good Eastwood movie with a really good stand out performance by Bradley Cooper."
"mukushle2014","10","117","230","12 January 2015"," one of the best war+melodrama movies ever... best of Eastwood in a decade.
","American Sniper is based on an autobiography by Chris Kyle, written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. It's the story of the life and times of Kyle, who had four tours in Iraq, totaling circa 1,000 days, resulting in more than 160 kills credited to him as a sniper. The film is about his experiences and the costs - emotional and psychological - they had on him. It's about how punishing the American Dream can be. The idea to make the film with these themes was brought to Eastwood by an actor to whom this was a personal project about which he was passionate. This deliberate humanizing of the soldier at the center of the story into a tenderhearted family man is what sets American Sniper apart from other recent war flicks like Lone Survivor and The Hurt Locker. Consequently, we really care whether this patriot will ultimately return home safe and sound.

You are the reason why we even have the freedom to make, watch, and review these films.

This movie is the story of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, and his life off and on the battlefield. It's amazing to see just how strong this man was as he left his family for a life on the battlefield. The screenplay, written by Jason Hall, was one of pure brilliance. From the witty remarks to the expressions of pure suspense, Bradley Cooper brought complete life to the role of Chris, a father, husband, and American hero. The visual effects were stunning and believable and the sounds were loud and crisp. At some moments, it feels like you are actually on the battlefield. The suspense that they built was captivating and it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely one of the best war epics I've seen in a long while. When the credits started rolling, all you could hear was the boisterous applause from the audience and then the complete and utter silence of acknowledgement and gratitude.

"jb_campo","7","8","11","15 September 2015"," Interesting story with good acting
","I liked American Sniper because of the story and strong acting. Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) was raised in Texas and taught to stand up for himself by his Dad, who also taught him to shoot. He was living an underachieving life it seemed when events caused him to enlist as a Navy Seal at the age of 30. When he makes it, he gets drafted into the Sniper team, and begins four tours of duty in Iraq I guess it is. The story reports he became the highest performing sniper ever with 160 kills. Chris Kyle is real, and this movie was based on his book.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood directed this story. He certainly added some Hollywood material, like this cat and mouse game between Kyle and an Iraqi sniper Mustafa that plays out continually. Since we have no idea what Mustafa was really like, this whole section was created. <br/><br/>Sienna Miller plays Kyle's wife and does a surprisingly good job of holding her own, delivering some gut-wrenching pleas for her man to return home.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is the acting from Bradley Cooper. Kyle did four tours of duty, over 1000 days of combat, and he never seemed to fully shake what this required him to do - be always vigilant and alert. He obviously suffered medically from stress and other PTSD symptoms. this part of his life was brilliantly scripted by Eastwood and performed by Cooper.<br/><br/>The story itself however holds no major surprises since it's based on a book, and a lot of newspaper material that you certainly heard and read. So the ending is not a shocker, but still sad, and Eastwood, as often directors do, weaves in real-life footage to bring home the point.<br/><br/>Whether all that is shown is true, that's up to you to judge. But I encourage you to watch American Sniper because the story is well written, but mostly the acting was excellent. Enjoy."

","I watched this film with high expectations just because i knew the story would have me engaged after seeing the trailer. And i can say that the film did meet those expectations. <br/><br/>Firstly Bradley Cooper pulls out the best performance of his career. I haven't been a Cooper fan in the past but after this film I will take him more seriously. You can see the sheer effort he puts into his characterization as a way of honoring Chris Kyle's patriotic life. <br/><br/>Eastwood manages to capture the alienation that war can cause in a man very well. The parallels of his time in Iraq and at home are extremely effective in conveying Chris's struggle in handling war. We see he is more alive whilst with his 'brothers' in a war zone than with his wife. The battle scenes are extremely realistic and suspenseful, the sound mixing does justice there. The scene locations are very entrancing and realistic. There was an element of what i call 'Hollywoodness' in setting up the narrative at the beginning but that didn't diminish what was very satisfactory watch. I did feel there was something missing from the narrative but Eastwood was being authentic in the sense that he told a truthful story in tribute to a soldier. <br/><br/>In short this film is an insight into the mind of a gifted hunter, who sacrificed his normality for a sense of fulfillment and duty. Eastwood doesn't go down the metaphoric route like 'Apocalypse Now' but rather explores war through the psychoanalysis of one of history's most potent killers. Drama/Suspense/Action."

Fun fact terrorist hits 3 guys, super great sniper only 1 despite having an advantage in technology, training and what not. What an incredible bad testimony to the US military, to honor such a failure and child slaughtering maniac as a ""hero"".<br/><br/>Also the movie appears to be one of those super long commercials to lure young folks into serving in the army, fighting wars no one knows why, obediently serving the cash money brothers from wall street.<br/><br/>Oh yeah i forgot: Allah Hu Akhbar!

","I have read multiple reviews here calling the guy a hero. Why? Because he was an American killing people in their own country illegally?

There is no evidence other than his own word that he didn't kill many unarmed civilians in reality, but we are supposed to believe his word.<br/><br/>What a coincidence that the kid he doesn't kill has a bible. More American southern style Christian propaganda too. I'm from the same western country and not religious, but still the glaring hypocrisy and contrived bits like that stood out.

Especially when tens of thousands of unarmed civilians were killed during the real war in the middle east and their families have no recourse.<br/><br/>Yet here they make out that the ""other side"" has no empathy and doesn't see from a different perspective. Any wonder this movie will be so popular when many American's would still high five individuals who abused people at Gitmo (who had no trial and were mostly only protecting their own country). Mostly released after the pictures of their abuse came out (under the radar too like a country with empathy would do- sarcasm).."
"rousis","9","61","117","6 March 2015"," Try judging Chris Kyle as a drama figure and not as a symbol of American propaganda
","First thing first: i am not a resident of Texas, not even an American citizen and that means that i have no intention to say some inconsiderate statements like ""God bless America"" as a conclusion to my review, but also i would not dare to characterize the movie as a disaster because i don't like USA's foreign policy.<br/><br/>After all that let's get to the point. We all know that Eastwood prefers to use characters that are tormented by ethical dilemmas and that's exactly what we see in American Sniper. Chris Kyle is a man who tries to balance between the dictates of his own conscience about what truly means to be a soldier and being a good father and husband. Bradley Cooper has succeeded to present the psychological portrait of a man who tries to survive a war, protect his comrades and also deal with the burden of every death he is responsible for. And that's where the eternal question comes: has anyone the right to take a life if he is saving in this way more lives? If the answer is yes, what are the lines between offensive and defensive behaviour and when a sacred (for him) purpose is becoming crime and murder?<br/><br/>These are the purposely unanswered from the director questions that have to put into thought each one of us. And that's the point where the spectators of this film are unfortunately divided into two groups: the first one thinks that the film is an hymn to American patriotism and the second group that blindly reprobates the film because they cannot separate art frοm politics and every member of this group believes that the movie is a vehicle of American propaganda.In my opinion, they are both wrong. The director strongly disapproves the practices of any war but also wants to show to the world how difficult is for a man to live with the war wounds both in his body and his soul.<br/><br/>Finally a special reference must be done for Sienna Miller who had an excellent performance as the wife who has to support her husband in his life choices but cannot raise a family by her own and plays the role of the equalizer in Kyle's life."
"GioMenabde","10","78","153","18 January 2015"," American Sniper Best of The Year <3
","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's harrowing take on Chris Kyle's life and his service in the Navy as a SEAL sniper who killed nearly 200 enemy soldiers. The film is relentlessly violent and disturbing but honors the life of the late Chris Kyle in a very admirable way. It doesn't show this man as an invincible legend, it shows him as a mere man with a heart and soul that are clearly broken due to his sacrifice for his country. Bradley Cooper delivers the best performance of his career as Chris Kyle. Cooper didn't merely bulk up for the role, he became this man without any hesitation and doesn't hit a false note. Clint Eastwood proves that he can still deliver a phenomenal film even in his mid-eighties. It isn't only impressive for his age, but American Sniper is an impressive film in general. It doesn't wallow in classic war film clichès, it tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the book and while some creative liberties were taken in telling the story regarding pacing, it is an excellent film. It isn't an all out war film like The Hurt Locker, it is a heavy drama with plenty of gut wrenching scenes both on and off the battle field. The most interesting part of this film is the parallels between Kyle's life as a sniper and Kyle's deteriorating life state side. It is an interesting dynamic to add to a film like this and echoes past films from the 70s such as Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. On a technical level, American Sniper sores with great cinematography that is a bit more colorful when compared to Eastwood's past films and excellent sound design. You see every wound and hear every gunshot with realistic velocity. It is a truly great cinematic experience. Overall, American Sniper is a great film that will tug at your heart strings much like last year's Lone Survivor and even goes one step beyond that film and gives us grade A entertainment with grade A acting. It stands as one of the best films of the year."

This movie shows the difficulties not only for the active duty soldier but for his entire family and his struggle with PTSD. Bradley Cooper did and exceptional job of displaying Chris Kyle and everything that the American Hero Stood for. Chris Kyle is an American hero and if you haven't seen this movie you have to.

","This is not it guys. I'm sorry but I have to be very negative. I realize some can't stand any negativity, so I ask you to read this at your own discretion.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the movie. No spoilers. Just let me say it wasn't much better than the usual straight-to-TV movie. The budget was somewhat higher, but this is where the good stuff pretty much ends. Don't expect awesome sniper-stuff or anything like that. In fact, the little bit you saw was utter nonsense. I served myself and I can tell you, not even regular troops were like that; very unrealistic and unprofessional. You get to look through the scope, so let me tell you it's a made up nonsensical thing they came up with.<br/><br/>This movie is a drama first and foremost. It's about the inner person of Chris Kyle, his partner, his life. As mentioned before, none of it was done right, convincingly nor was I moved to care.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a book of a soldier who's known to 'shoot first, ask questions later'. This is what his comrades said. This makes the 200 kills suspicious from the get-go. Needless to say that his colleagues put this carefully in the media and anonymous. And needless to say that the main stream media didn't pursue this angle.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle is the same person who needed to ridicule Jesse Ventura in his book. He supposedly floored Ventura. Ventura sued the Kyle estate and won the case. What's interesting is that no SEAL witness could produce a consistent story even though they were there. This angered the Jury, as they explained in the media, and hence allowed Ventura to win the case.<br/><br/>They (the anti-Ventura SEALS) subsequently complained in the media that 'what happens inside should stay inside'. It supposedly is a unwritten SEAL code (cliché cliché). But none of them was consistent enough to mention that Kyle ignored that very same rule! In fact, he ridiculed an ex-colleague in a commercial and publicly available book. How is that for double standards? Even though Ventura won the case, he is practically out of job since then.<br/><br/>American Sniper is the same guy who bragged about shooting looters after Katrina. I'm sorry but bragging about it is not right.<br/><br/>I'm aware of the popularity of the SEALs around the globe. But because of their policy to be visible in the media (they made that choice few years ago), their ugly side shines through as well. Too often they communicate and behave like stereotypes who use too much anabolics.<br/><br/>Thank you and see you next time!"

","I have a husband and father with PTSD from combat and found this film (with all its little inaccuracies that other reviewers insist on pointing out) a window into their experience, that they can never tell me about. I didn't focus on what was credible or not, just the emotional intensity of the tours and the readjustment back to family life. Whether or not Kyle's views where accurate didn't taint that he was doing the best he knew how with the information he had. I can agree that America is manipulated by the government/media and they used this influence at 9/11 to start a war, but that was not what this movie was about IMHO. It was about family... and specifically, a soldier's family. I love my husband, and feel so separated from him at times because I can not understand.

"Al_The_Strange","8","43","80","11 March 2015"," Dramatization of the deadliest sniper in US history
","It's easy to romanticize about soldiers, but snipers have their own unique and alluring shroud of mystique. Any gamer can tell you how cool it is to play Call of Duty and be the hotshot camping out on some rooftop picking off bad guys all day long. In films, you can look at Enemy at the Gates or Barry Pepper's character in Saving Private Ryan and marvel at a sniper's deadly prowess. Far be it for me to comment on what experiences soldiers of any kind go through, I have no doubt that the reality of being a sniper is nowhere near as glamorous as the media makes it out to be; it's a burdensome duty in which one has to take lives indiscriminately in order to save lives. I can't even imagine the stress of having to evaluate who lives and who dies - to include women and children - in the heat of the moment.<br/><br/>The deadliest marksman in US history - Chris Kyle - is the focus of this film: the real-life Navy SEAL who served four tours of duty in the Iraq war. The movie tracks his career across all four tours, with occasional breaks where he reunites with his wife and has difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Thus, the film dishes out two different conflicts: the fight against al-Qaeda on one hand, and the struggle to adjust to life after war on the other hand. Both narrative strands offer their share of compelling scenes; the combat is quite intense and harrowing, while the family drama emphasizes stress and emotion aptly. Together, it's a consistently-engaging experience that will truly underscore the intensity of war, and the hardship of overcoming post-traumatic stress.<br/><br/>I have no idea how close the film adapts real-life events, but a few contrivances can be spotted easily. It is quite the black-and-white film that glosses over the complexities of the war. I almost pegged it as a pro-war movie, until the last act started to emphasize the futility of the war effort and illustrate the hardships of veterans. The film does outright refer to Iraqis as ""savage;"" it's probably meant to label the regime rather than the entire country or culture, but it can be taken the wrong way easily. There are strands of jingoism that will rub some viewers the wrong way.<br/><br/>All that being said, I was personally enamored by the characters; I found them easy to follow and relate to, and it made their journey in and out of war a compelling one. The film sets up an actual villain sniper that Chris has to take down; I don't know if this was invented for the movie or what, but I thoroughly enjoyed the sniper-vs-sniper plot. The film has its fair share of messages; on one hand, the film does emphasize the ""this is why we fight"" message, but on the other it digresses into the physical, emotional, and psychological damage on the characters and their families. These aren't subtle themes at all, but I felt the two together formed a point and counterpoint that keeps the film rather well-rounded.<br/><br/>This film uses good-looking photography and punchy editing. Bradley Cooper is excellent as the main character, and the other actors aren't too bad either. Writing is okay. All the sets, props, and costumes look authentic and creditable. Special effects are sparingly used, and mostly okay. Sound design is superb. Music is okay.<br/><br/>American Sniper is for snipers what The Hurt Locker is for guys who defuse bombs. I favor American Sniper more though, because it doesn't have nearly as many stupid parts as The Hurt Locker, and Chris Kyle is a far more compelling character. The character is ultimately what makes the film most watchable, and with quality acting, it is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"
"bix171","10","43","80","7 February 2015"," A Deeply Personal Piece Of Bravura Film Making
","Clint Eastwood's powerful meditation on war fits squarely with the themes that have informed his body of work, primarily the belief that with the absence of God, it is up to the individual to do God's work. There's a lot going on in Eastwood's and screenwriter Jason Hall's examination of Chris Kyle, considered the most ""successful"" military sniper in American history (and portrayed by Bradley Cooper in a performance that elevates him from above-average to outstanding): he's a patriot but also an employee, a man who has found his career and is simply doing his job. There is some very graphic imagery to reinforce war's hellish nature but there's also an awful lot of banality: Kyle and his colleagues spend time during lulls in their missions discussing the mundane things that people typically talk about during work breaks. Eastwood and Hall are clearly admirers of their subject (the film's final images prove that point) and they do give him the benefit of the doubt (the film's sole flaw is that it acknowledges Kyle's PTSD while stateside yet by the conclusion he's inexplicably cured), but they're realists when it comes to the job he's hired to do and make no bones about his lack of concern about the morality of his mission. (As one character astutely points out, he carries a Bible with him but never opens it.) The film is galvanizing in its combat scenes; they move with an immediacy and adrenaline that surprises you, considering Eastwood's age. But he never blinks. Tom Stern provides the excellent cinematography, filming with a brightness that sharpens the action. (The film's final battle, though, takes place during a sandstorm, blanching and obscuring everything--it's harrowing.) Like all great Eastwood films, ""American Sniper"" stays with you after it's over, encouraging you to meditate about everything it's trying to tell you (it's about a lot more than has been discussed here) and inviting you to argue back at it. It's a conversation well worth having."

"japamo","8","41","76","9 April 2015"," This War Movie is Both Straightforward and Ambiguous, Like Its Protagonist, Who Emerges as a Bit of An Unknown Soldier.
","At least in the post-Vietnam era, arguably, good war movies should make poor military recruitment videos. In other words, they should make you want to stay as far the hell away from the hell of war as possible. By this standard, director Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" (hereafter ""AS"") is at least partially a good movie. Even though its protagonist, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), appears to be a decent, good-old-boy, patriotic Texan eager to enlist in the U.S. Navy and become a Navy SEAL after hearing of U.S. embassy bombings, his Iraqi Gulf War military experiences, I don't think, would make most people want to visit Iraq and kill terrorists. Nevertheless, ""AS"" also seems to retain some of the gung-ho spirit of straightforward pre-Vietnam movies to make the case that this is a ""worthwhile"" war in the sense that it was necessary to protect American security. Perhaps AS is both straightforward and ambiguous, both in its depiction of wartime heroics and atrocities, and its depiction of a soldier that revels in, and is damaged by, his role as a sniper.<br/><br/>Through the obligatory, practically-cliché montage of boot camp training and bellowing, obscene drill instructors, Chris manages to distinguish himself as a SEAL and particularly a sniper (perhaps the modern-day equivalent of a quick-draw gunslinger). Before shipping out to Iraq, post-9/11, he clumsily but earnestly woos Taya Renae (Sienna Miller) in a bar and eventually weds her. In ""AS"", Taya serves as the back-home, civilization counterpoint to the war, and the gauge of Chris's personality changes. Even though some may see sniping as a safe, unmanly way to fight a war, ""AS"" convinces us that that is not so. From strategic rooftops Kyle essentially provides a kind of reconnaissance for the other American troops by correctly identifying and picking off potential guerrillas and hidden assassins. It is intense, nerve-wracking work not only because he has to nail the killers before they blow up the troops, but also because he has only a split-second to determine IF they are killers, and not innocent bystanders. It is possible that a mother and son can be a deadly threat.<br/><br/>Chris proves adept at killing the ""right"" people and earns the name ""Legend"" from his grateful squad for his numerous hits. But perhaps to hedge his bets about proving Chris's bravery, Eastwood also has Chris fighting in the streets alongside his fellow soldiers and helping them hunt for the al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; during house-to-house searches in abandoned areas. After Chris's and an interpreter's intense, heated interrogation, an Iraqi father and son offer to lead Chris to al-Zarqawi. The search is thwarted by al-Zarqawi's sadistic lieutenant, ""The Butcher"" (Mido Hamada) who literally likes drilling soldiers and civilians alike. Chris fails to save the father and son from the ""Butcher"", which haunts him after he returns home from his first tour. Although, grimly and humorously, if improbably, Chris keeps in touch with Taya by cellphone during lulls in the action, including learning of his wife's impending pregnancy, he finds it hard to settle into civilian life.<br/><br/>After that, ""AS"" settles into alternating, occasionally tedious, warzone/homefront scenes as subsequent three tours makes it increasingly more difficult for Chris to adjust back to home life. Guilt at being unable to save all fellow soldier lives, Post-Traumatic-Strees Disorder, and his vengeful desire to kill not only the ""savage Butcher"" but a rival, equally-skilled, Olympic- level Iraqi sniper Mustafa (Sammy Sheik) compel Chris to go back to the warzone . Of course this frays his relationship with Taya. Chris generally succeeds in carrying out his vengeance, and through a blinding sandstorm, returns home to stay. It's still a struggle to get acclimated to home, as encounters with a nurse and an overactive hound saw, but Chris, especially with help by a VA hospital, finds peace counseling fellow wounded, maladjusted veterans. But in that healing, counseling process, Chris ironically and tragically meets ""friendly fire"".<br/><br/>""AS"" is a quite more-than-adequate ""War is Crazy Hell But Sometimes Necessary"" movie that also manages to advance the old adage of ""Hate the war but love the soldier."" Despite his alienation from his family and his sometimes racist regard for the Iraqi's, Bradley Cooper manages to depict Chris as a fundamentally solid, good man who may have been warped by his war experiences. Whether that assessment is true for the real, departed Chris Kyle will always be open to spirited debate (hero or barbarian?), because in spite of ""AS"" the movie and the autobiographical novel which inspired it, he will always be something of an unknown soldier, even to his grieving, loved ones, personal and public."
"squirrel_burst","8","41","76","15 March 2015"," Emotionally complex and also filled with compelling action
","I'm just going to start off with saying that ""American Sniper"" is not going to be the movie I'm cheering for when it comes to the 87th Academy awards, but that in no way means that this is a bad movie. When it comes to the acting, it's truly excellent. When it comes to the drama, it's also very good. The action is compelling and the story very interesting. If the title worries you (as it did for my very Canadian butt) don't worry about it because this is in no way a jingoistic pro-war, kill all Arabs movie. Actually I found the film to be profoundly intelligent in the way it handles the wartime events portrayed in the life of the main character.<br/><br/>Based on the book ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History"" by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the titular ""American Sniper"" with Sienna Miller playing his wife Taya Renae Kyle. The plot, it's mostly self explanatory, but concerns for the most part the reason why Chris Kyle decides to go into the U.S. war, how he deals with his job, which is nothing but killing people, and how it affects his life back at home.<br/><br/>Out of this Clint Eastwood effort, the thing that stands out the most for me at least, is the way that it has several elements that remind me of a western as much as a war film. You don't become the most lethal sniper in the U.S. Military without getting a lot of attention. In the way that the people in the story responded to the presence of Kyle (I'm talking about the character in the movie now) it reminded me of so many sharpshooting lone gunslingers I've seen in films set before the west was won. The man becomes notable because of his own skills, sure, but it's the way the people around him perpetuate the accomplishments that turns him into a legend. There's a mix of pride in being so highly regarded, but also an enormous amount of pressure. Thanks to Bradley Cooper's performance, I felt like I could truly feel the weight being dumped on the man's shoulders as he pulled the trigger again and again. If a regular guy misses a shot, it's not a big deal, but can you imagine if the guy you've heard hushed whispers about missed, how disappointed you would be to hear that? You'd cover it up and perpetuate the myth, and then it would become a self-fulfilling truth that the guy is the deadliest sniper ever. Additionally, if I may quote ""Predator"" for a second, ""If it bleeds, we can kill it"". I would think that becoming such a great sharpshooter might go to your head and that you would think yourself invincible, at least a little bit. If you miss though, not only would you recognize yourself as a regular guy, but the people that you've been intimidating with your legend, they would recognize that you're just human and that you can be quite easily (and in a most demoralizing way) be taken out.<br/><br/>These ideas fascinated me. How much pressure can a normal man that's being asked to perform like a god take, particularly when there are any number of people gunning for him to fail, and a lot looking to take him down to raise themselves to that Olympian status? The other element of the movie that I really liked plays hand-in-hand with this wester/legendary gunman idea. It's the portions of the film where the story is not set on foreign soil or on the battlefield, but at home where Chris has to try and readjust to normal life. I was surprised to see that as much as this film shows in great detail what happens on the battlefield, it also takes the time to show the consequences of this in normal life. Chris is not OK when he returns home because no human being should be asked to take that many human lives. The film deals heavily with post-traumatic stress and how pulling a gunshot does not end when you pull the trigger. His job isn't like a normal soldier's job where they are shooting people right in front of them, people that pose an immediate threat. For the most part he's very far from where the action actually is and he's picking people off in a very matter-of-fact manner. That has a heavy emotional toll on a person and I felt it.<br/><br/>What sold the movie for me was Bradley Cooper's performance. He is completely genuine in it and helps make all of the complex themes and emotions tangible. He also handles himself very well in the action sequences (I guess doing ""The A-Team"" was good for something) and I felt like there was some good, and complex chemistry going on between him and Sienna Miller. I can see why this film was nominated for so many academy awards, and I'd say when it comes to several of them (best actor and best adapted screenplay for example) the praise is fully justified. Best picture though? I don't know about that. It's not a big issue though. They can't all be ""the best movie"" and I think this is an intelligent movie that you will enjoy, I certainly did and not only because of the really intense action scenes. I was very impressed by how much emotion and how many complex themes were present. If you're worried that this is going to be some cheap piece of propaganda disguised as a film, that's not the case; ""American Sniper"" is a great movie.

","This movie was very good at depicting how soldiers feel and I don't think it could have been better at explaining it because it was so well at showing it. Bradley Cooper did an amazing job acting in this film and the graphics were considerably good knowing it couldn't have possibly been filmed in real time war setting. I especially liked how they referred to veterans and disabled vets trying to deal with being back from tour. Being a veteran myself I know what it's like to want to fight for our country and it was a great job showing that in the soldiers that were in the film. It was sad to see the soldiers die but there wouldn't be truth to the film if it didn't show soldiers die and kids and women trying to kill our soldiers. There might have been too much truth but that's what made the film so beautifully executed to show the truth to that particular soldiers story. Great job on this movie!"
"lukrezia","1","102","207","7 February 2015"," Texas cowboy goes to Iraq to kill savages
","I went to see AS without reading any review beforehand because it's directed by Clint Eastwood and his movies have never disappointed me... until now. This film disgusted me. I stayed until the end only because I was hoping with all my heart there could be some real development... But no, I had to admit at the final sequence that I spent two hours absorbing American imperialist propaganda. I watched the glorification of the sniper who killed most people in US history. I felt dirty.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle, the cowboy turned sniper, is a two dimensional character. At the beginning of the movie his father tells him that he's like a shepherd dog protecting his weaker fellows, the sheep, from the wolves; he also explains that in this role he has the right and the obligation to finish those bad guys. So when he grows up Chris, moved by the 9/11 attack on his compatriots, becomes a navy seal and goes to fight in Iraq where he kills an enormous number of people, or should I say bad guys . Or, in his words, ""savages"". Basically he is John Wayne in a black and white western. After such a strong characterization I expected the war to change Chris and force him to question his values and beliefs. I waited for him to be shocked by the cruelty of war and begin the hero's inner journey of self discovery... I waited in vain. His conscience is always at peace, his only regret when he finally retires: he can't kill more bad guys. His identity, the purpose of his mission and his life and the reasons behind the war are never questioned. After all he's seen and done, the only real change inside him is a higher blood pressure. <br/><br/>Like him, the only female character is underwritten and just a stereotype: the whiny wife seen in too many movies. She doesn't have a life on her own, relatives or any friend to talk to, she's always alone and only shown inside the home or in a hospital bed. Her only activity and purpose in the movie seems to be making babies, complaining and crying. When hubby is away, "" Babe come back!"", when he's home, "" Babe you're not the same!"". Over and over again. It doesn't help that the screenplay is so unimaginative with an extremely repetitive structure: first mission in Iraq, back home with unhappy wife and new baby, second mission, back home with unhappy wife and new baby... Repeat for two more times.<br/><br/>On the other side of the gun, Iraqis are savages and, as such, they're all a threat to America and a legitimate shooting target, even the kids.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie. It is just plain and simple, quite boring, not at all subtle imperialist propaganda. Also, it's racist."

","The movie is about the cumulative effects of combat in the Iraq war. The main character is based on the life of Navy SEAL and sniper Chris Kyle. The movie the pivotal times in his life, how the terrorist attacks on 9/11 influenced his decision to join the military, his relationship with his wife and family.<br/><br/>What the movie captures is how he changed over the course of four 9-month tours to Iraq because of the effect war has on him.<br/><br/>As someone who also deployed 3 times I can tell you that this was what I believe Eastwood was focusing on and not any political agenda or propaganda as some critics have suggested.<br/><br/>I'll ask you this if you think otherwise. Was the 1978 film Deer Hunter about the Vietnam War's politics or the effect it had on it's main characters played by De Niro and Walken? In the 1953 movie From Here To Eternity was the fact that we dropped the A-Bomb a factor in judging that film? The thing that all those films, and most war movies include, are the effects of combat. They called it soldier's heart, shell shock, or PTSD. It's had over 80 names since the Civil War and it effects each soldier differently. It also effects Police, Firemen, survivors of trauma from accidents and disasters and terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>If you didn't serve it may be difficult for you to truly appreciate the character of Chris Kyle but judge him and Eastwood's direction of the film separately from the politics of the Iraq War."

","Chris Kyle's character has correlated well with Clint Eastwood's savvy. The story alone grabbed attention, and this lively movie puts the ""Legend"" into humbling perspective. An unsuspecting Texan has saved the day, which is the truth, this time. Illustrations of childhood moments, romance, familial responsibilities, and sacrifice have intertwined genuinely into a patriotic biography. Using slow motion during fight scenes and sniper shots would have been a Hollywood treatment of this biography. Non-fiction does limit the powers of film makers, yet opportunities there for modernized movie action without losing realism have been missed.

As for this depiction of Chris Kyle ex SEAL and ""American sniper"" be prepared to be shocked and I am not talking about the trauma of soldiering. Clint Eastwood is a modern day propaganda emperor and master of spin and when you peer through the patriotic veil and through the facade of idealistic America we have a story of an uncompromising sadistic killer who has no remorse for any of the victims. If you take Kyle's statistics along with the Navy's we are looking at a figure of 166 to over 250 kills in a 1,000 days in Iraq across four tours. This means every fourth day or less a person which was man, woman or child was killed. We are all supposed to accept that every person killed was an insurgent ready and armed and in the process of murdering an American soldier. This statistic is absolutely questionable and at no point in American society has this been addressed. On the contrary Kyle is lauded as a sword of American value and freedom at the expense of the savage Iraqi people. The saddest fact is that History is wrote by the victors and the victors are not as honourable and noble and forthright as Hollywood will have us believe. if you like lots of Hollywood sugary moments of perfection with lots of ooohhh aaahhhs and unbelievable heroics then it's a go.... It's ironic that Chris Kyle himself dies from an unexpected bullet going about his normal everyday life."

I do believe that many of the people writing these types of reviews have not even seen the movie, and are essentially acting upon a Pavlovian reflex to hate and curse all things pro-American-yes; this crowd's handlers certainly have their drones well trained. While it is true that Eastwood has handled his directorial duties with a more subtle hand in the past, this is a well-directed, well-acted effort that deserves its Oscar nominations, but will probably not win the biggies. Chris Kyle's story is compelling and gut-wrenching, poignant, sad, and uplifting. Bradley Cooper deserves the best acting nod. While modern-day Hollywood loves to spit out blood, gore, ultra-violence, and soul-rotting perversion for every taste, all in the name of ""entertainment"" (ala Rome before the fall), nothing offends that community and its supporters more than a non-satiric, non-revisionist, look at a subject like patriotism, family values, or any theme based in Judeo-Christian morality.

","Putting aside the controversy that surrounds this film, I would defend it as one of the best films of 2015.<br/><br/>My hat of to Bradley Cooper, who just gets better with every film he is in. Respect to his gym gains, to go from the tall and slender man we all know to the bulky bad ass can't have been easy and is one of the best actor transformations I have ever seen. He gets the character down perfectly, in fact, there were times I did'nt even think I was watching Bradley Cooper, I felt as thou I was watching the real Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>The film's atmosphere was great. This probably the most intense war film I have seen since Glory (1989). There are scenes where the stakes are so high, you feel like you could faint at any moment.

"classicalsteve","10","37","69","24 February 2015"," A View of American Middle-Eastern Military Intervention at the Ground Level
","Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper in an Academy-Award nominated performance) was a trained military sniper, maybe the best who ever pulled the trigger from among hidden locales, usually the rooftops of buildings. According to the film, during military tours in Iraq in the early 2000's, Kyle had 160 kills to his name, mostly males, but sometimes females and even children. Was Kyle engaging in right and moral behavior whose efforts should be applauded because he protected his fellow soldiers and helped wrest Iraq from Saddam Hussein? Or was he a brutal mass murderer, whose exploits should have brought him before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity? However, I think the point of this film is to answer neither of those questions. This is simply Kyle's story.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Chris Kyle, an outstanding Navy Seal sniper who began as a would-be rodeo star who had experience hunting and shooting when he was young. In an interesting flashback scene, his dad claims there are three kinds of people in the world: sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. The sheepdogs are the ones who protect the sheep from the wolves. The idea becomes a metaphor for who Kyle becomes and the role he will play in the US military. After having failed at being a rodeo star, Kyle signs up for military service in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. To the surprise of his superiors during basic training, he shows exceptional ability in shooting targets at long distance. He's the kind of material who could be a sniper for the Navy Seals.<br/><br/>The film chronicles four of Kyle's tours-of-duty in the Middle East. During each mission, his role as a sniper is primarily to assist his fellow ground soldiers, sometimes with them on the ground, while at other times in hidden places, usually atop small buildings. In one mission, they are assigned the impossible task of finding Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the primary heads of Al-Quaeda. In probably the most disturbing sequence, Kyle and his fellow soldiers sporting heavy-duty automatic firearms enter houses looking for Zarqawi. One older man with his family claims to have information, but for a price. Then a scene or two later, Al-Quaeda operatives, in particular one nicknamed ""the Butcher"", force the family to pay a deadly price for speaking with the enemy. Instead of receiving payment for their information, the family receives the ultimate punishment. And yet, the scenes play out such that they have no choice but to cooperate with the Americans and yet are pressuring Al-Quaeda to retaliate against them, at least from the terrorists' point of view.<br/><br/>Another fascinating element of the film is Kyle's ""mirror"", an individual on the other side who has a similar position and/or ability to Kyle. Kyle realizes a sniper is taking out American soldiers and other combatants at nearly the same success rate as himself. Essentially, Kyle has found his middle-eastern counterpart, a sniper with the same abilities as his own, except he speaks Arabic. Kyle and the American soldiers then realize they are engaged in a violent chess match in which Kyle and his counterpart-enemy are the most deadly pieces on the board.<br/><br/>One of the best and most poignant war films ever made, similar in style to ""The Hurt Locker"". The question which looms above the entire story is whether or not Kyle is doing the right thing. I think the film tries and succeeds to make the case that the issue is not whether Kyle was either moral or immoral. It's about the United States. Should the United States have engaged in an all-out assault on Iraq? In terms of military tactics, snipers are necessary to carry out missions. So the question is not whether or not Kyle should or should not have been sniping. The question is whether the ""powers-that-be"" in Washington D.C. should have deployed troops in the first place, which would necessitate the use of a cracker-jack sniper. It neither condemns nor applauds war. It simply shows what it's like from ground-zero. <br/><br/>As a footnote, the film ends with real footage from Kyle's funeral procession in which people waved American flags as they passed. (Kyle was killed by a fellow soldier suffering from PTSD after her retired from military service.) Does this mean the filmmakers viewed Kyle as a hero? Not necessarily. It simply showed Americans viewed him as a hero and he received accolades for his efforts. At the same time, Kyle did the duty he was trained for. We in America must debate and elect leaders who will make the right decisions in terms of military deployment. We must take responsibility for the fact that we need snipers when we put our soldiers into harm's way."
"joekool1000","10","37","69","21 February 2015"," Comparable to Hurt Locker
","Like The Hurt Locker, American Sniper provides insight into how war impacts the psyche of soldiers. Although Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is celebrated among fellow soldiers, director Clint Eastwood lends as much time portraying the strain the war had on Kyle's personal life, specifically his wife. Bradley Cooper (who trained for three months to gain 40 pounds of muscle) plays the conflicted Kyle, who forces himself to develop a hatred of the enemy, referring to Iraqis as ""savages,"" so he can justify killing them. The action scenes provide an adrenaline rush, but it's the intentional moments of silence — such as when Kyle, with finger on the trigger, is deciding whether to kill a child who is holding what appears to be a bomb — that make American Sniper an outstanding movie."

"steveo554","8","35","65","23 February 2015"," A True American Classic, no matter what anyone says
","Most people turn the other cheek at certain criticisms, especially when they come from the internet. However, I take issue with some of what people are saying about both American Sniper and the subject of the film, Chris Kyle. I will get to all of that in a moment, but first, about the movie.<br/><br/>American Sniper tells the story of the late Chris Kyle, a Texan who became a Navy Seal and the most lethal sniper in American history. With 160 confirmed kills out of 220, Kyle became a force with which to be reckoned. When he was honorably discharged, he spent time close to home and working with PTSD soldiers. It's a shame that he got killed while doing so. The movie powerfully tells this story through eyes that are rarely seen in cinema nowadays: through that of the soldier.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's direction and Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Kyle do stand out as a powerful tribute to the sniper, nicknamed ""Legend"" by his peers. Cooper's Texan ascent and the beard made him really blend in and take control of the character. The movie and the portrayal definitely deserved the nominations as both show the harsh realities of war. The radical extremists that the American forces had to fight used actual civilians for weapons. The opening scene has Kyle scoping down a mother giving her son a grenade to unleash on a tank of U.S. troops. Hell, there was a scene where he put a boy trying to lift an RPG in the cross hairs begging he put it down. All the while, the movie goes back and forth between the war in Iraq and the war back home. You witness his personal life get rocky as he takes a lot of it with him. He can't escape the harshness of what he had witnessed, but he never regretted a second of it.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly powerful all the way to the end which brought tears to my eyes as you hear Ennio Morricone's ""The Funeral"" play the solemn memorial trumpet tune to clips of Kyle's funeral. Just when Kyle started to feel more at peace back home, tragedy struck.<br/><br/>The issues that I have with the movie weren't necessarily in the writing or directing, but rather the events that were left out or dramatized. Kyle was initially turned down by the SEALs because of an injury sustained in his arm. He never joined as the result of the terrorist attack in Libya; he always wanted to join. It just launched his chances. Certain characters were created as amalgamations of other people.<br/><br/>That being said, the facts still remain: Chris Kyle killed over a hundred enemy combatants; undoubtedly ruthless sociopath extremists that killed not just Americans but their own as well. Kyle saved many American lives with what he did on the battlefield as well as off it. The movie is an incredibly strong film that shows the true testament to the ugliness of war and the struggle to find peace.<br/><br/>However, some people find issue with the movie's portrayal of the war and Kyle. Not because the movie tried to portray the war as just because it didn't. The events in the movie (Libya, 9/11) weren't from the perspective of Americans but from the soldier. The issue that these people had was that it didn't condemn the war as unjust. It didn't portray the American government as crooked e as movies like ""In the Valley of Elah"" or ""Syriana"" did. Leftist critics like Matt Taibbi and Cynthia Taub miss the point of the film or worse try to twist it.<br/><br/>OAF Nation released an article that succinctly makes the point: this is not a movie from the perspective of civilians or from journalist but rather from the soldier. The soldier didn't care whether Saddam Hussein had any correlation with the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. All it meant was the possibility of going into theater. Every soldier goes in wishing that he or she could prevent the deaths of fellow soldiers and friends because nothing is worse than seeing a loved one die let alone in combat.<br/><br/>The worst example of twisting the situation comes from everyone labeling Kyle as a ""killer"". Yes, he killed Iraqis, but he killed Iraqis who killed Iraqis as well as Americans. Why defend the sociopaths? The biggest issue was that Kyle had no regrets for what he did. No kidding, he didn't. Nothing is pretty in war. People want to kill you because you believe in something that they don't and see you as the threat for such a reason. He saw an evil in these people and wanted it to be fought. He didn't kill innocents; those that he killed intended to kill Americans. So why do people consider their own to be the villain in this fight?<br/><br/>American Sniper deserves the accolades it receives and more. It deserves the box office revenue it received. Bradley Cooper deserves the recognition for the portrayal, and Chris Kyle deserves better than what he's been getting since the movie came out in December."

","American SNIPER ~~ Viewed at Cinestar Berlin, March 5, 2015. <br/><br/>It's,hard to tell whether Bradley Cooper as hero Chris Kyle --- is a sharp shooting junkie, just addicted to war, an unflagging American patriot, or maybe all three. In any case, a very strong but restrained Oscar worthy performance to say the least. As a Navy Seal trained super-sniper using state-of-the-art sniper equipment he volunteers for four consecutive hazardous combat missions in Iraq leaving his little children and constantly pregnant wife behind in small town Texas. The film opens with a scene of the superstar sniper viewing an Iraqi woman clad in black robes with a little boy at her side suspended in his cross-hairs. His finger is on the trigger as he carefully draws a bead, but -- a doting new father himself back home as we will soon find out -- he is anything but eager to gun down a defenseless civilian woman and a child. However, this is not just any innocent civilian woman and any child. The woman slips a bomb concealed in her robes to the boy and whispers something in his ears ~~ obviously instructions to run at the American armored car and soldiers down the street in a glorious kamikaze attack, kill a few of them and go to Heaven. BAM! The boy goes Down as the bomb falls harmlessly aside. The woman tries to retrieve the bomb to complete the suicide mission. BAM again -- That takes care of her as well -- with a big blotch of blood up against the wall. We then get the back story of how Kyle was trained as a boy by his father in the art of hunting with a rifle, how he grew up in the macho atmosphere of Rodeo bronc-busting and met his future wife during Seal training at a lowdown local saloon. Heavy duty physical training on the beach prepare the Seal volunteers for the arduous tasks ahead. Quick no- nonsense marriage. Off to Battle.<br/><br/>MIssion One. Back to the cross-hairs and the grim mission in a battered Iraqi city constantly under attack by Guerrilla Arab defenders. In an action to find Al-Zaqari, ruthless head of the Al-Qaeda enemy, Kyle and his cohorts ruthlessly roust civilian Arab families in their homes. In one seemingly ordinary household a stash of bombs and weapons is found concealed under the floorboards. One Iraqi father is ruthlessly gunned down by fellow Arabs for ""talking with the enemy"". This is a ruthless war on both sides of the fence. House to house and room to room -- no glorious battlefield vistas. Endless fierce shootouts ensue that make the Okay Corral look like a Girl Scouts picnic. From the scene of battle Kyle often chats with his anguished wife back home via cell phone. All she wants is for him to come home to his family. All he wants, it seems, is to keep shooting down more of the enemy. Big question: Who needs him more ~~ His country or His family? After a particularly furious battle -- in overpowering red darkness filling the screen for many minutes, Kyle has had enough and yells to his wife on the phone over the din that he is COMING HOME -- this time for good. At home he is obvious rattled by his lurid war experiences. He volunteers to assist other crippled and traumatized Iraqi war veterans in recovery. On February 2, 2013, one such veteran shoots him dead. Almost as big a shock as all that has gone before! The denouement of the film is the memorial service for Kyle with a stadium in Texas named after him. Lots of American flags but not waving too strongly. The end credits roll before a stunned German audience. Nobody leaves until the lights go up. A powerful non-judgemental Clint Eastwood Judgement. The American Gun Dream reconsidered. If anybody, Dirty Harry should know. Alex, Berlin<br/><br/>PS: Do you bleeding liberal punks out there feel lucky?"

In fact Cooper completely deserves his nomination for best actor in a leading role, he is terrific in this film and gives an excellent performance. Plus, the cinematography does look very good, action sequences are fairly well handled, there is definitely some suspense and heart pounded scenes as well. There are a lot of controversies surrounding this film, in the fact that a lot of people don't really think that this man should be idolised because of some of the things he has said on his own biography. What I liked is that this movie doesn't glorify war with the usual American honor and medals. The movie first trailer, with this kid carrying a RKG grenade, was the most intense trailer I've ever seen. The question is do I shoot him or not? Those decisions are one big/important key theme of the film and the fact that it's weighing down on this man; because no matter who you are you can't go to war, pull a trigger, have someone across from you die and don't feel anything. You do. It shows how ugly and damaging it is for a person. However Eastwood's approach of this story is a little too black and white as the subject matter is kind of a grey area. The movie itself does not explore any of that, it basically depicts him as a perfect war hero who rescued a lot of people lives but there is this downwards spiral in which the more he takes tours and the more he loses himself. There is this dark hidden story of this man who's deeply damage. It doesn't properly get into the more deep and darker aspect of what PTSD can do to someone and how it can truly affect a family. Some scenes show that Kyle is a wounded man but it doesn't get once again in the emotional core of it. Do you remember this clown from The Hungover? You can be sure that this man is going to stick around for a couple more decades. <br/><br/>Overall American Sniper is a well directed and acted war epic drama looking at certain point of a The Legend' life without truly exploring the depth of his emotional damage and PTSD."

","I feel so bad for Chris Kyle, regardless what he did he quit doing it till that psycho shot him dead. It must be kinda frustrating that you'll survive all those years in Middle East but then you'll get shot by your own people. I know this is partially propaganda and I'm against American endless war tours around the globe, but still. Think yourself in his shoes. It must be really hard to come back from there and try to live normal life. But that could've avoided by not starting the wars in the first place. What comes to 9/11, it was put in action by either your own people or Israelis, you can stop putting it in every war movie you'll do."
"MikeShama","8","33","61","22 February 2015"," Heroic and Heart-wrenching. A story of not just the war of bombs and bullets, but also of the mind.
","Well I'm no movie reviewer, but these are my thoughts on American Sniper.<br/><br/>If you're wanting to watch a movie about snipers you're coming to watch the wrong film. American Sniper isn't a ""Saving Private Ryan"" romp of violence and carnage, though there are the scenes depicting events which took place over the various tours of Iraq that Chris Kyle undertook as part of a US Navy SEAL team, and I mention team for a reason. Bradley Cooper's performance is impressive, and has clearly done a lot of work for the role. I think Sienna Miller (portraying the wife Taya Kyle) was nuanced and sensitive, and though her time on screen is limited it is memorable and touching.<br/><br/>I've seen and read many reviews that describe this film as a glorification of US military, how it creates the polarisation and massive over-simplification of the conflicts that the US (and her Allies) have gotten into in the Middle East (Iraq, Afghanistan etc) and that it establishes the US as the good guys with the natives as the bad guys, how American Sniper is nothing more than shoddy film making that acts as merely a recruitment tool for the US Armed Forces. My overwhelming feeling is that those who reviewed the movie as such most likely have never served in their nation's armed forces, and fail to grasp the essence of what Clint Eastwood is putting before us. <br/><br/>American Sniper isn't about the glory of war, far from it. Using the lens of this one man's life of service to his nation, Clint Eastwood bares the soul of every serviceman and woman who is willing to make that sacrifice for their country, their people, their way of life. That these high ideals might initially motivate recruitment, but that through the fires of selection and training, and the forge of operational deployments, brotherhoods are created that cannot be understood fully by the average person back home.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle, like so many other servicemen and women in the US and British forces, was a Protector. He cared for every battle-brother out there (though he met a fraction who would have actually deployed), and that desire to protect took him into the hell that is war so that others might live, to take the fight to the enemy to prevent it from festering like a cancer and spreading to his own shores, a sentiment shared by many that I know. John 15:13 ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""<br/><br/>To those that saw that movie as some sort of tool for glorification and recruitment, I would say that their left-wing liberal agenda had their minds made up before they went to watch that film. The emotional trauma that Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) goes through is brutal. It quite literally threatens to tear his family apart, it robs him of his humanity, it brutalises his soul. This movie doesn't shy away from letting us see the naked violence that simmers just below the surface as he embraces his wife or kids, of the darkness behind the eyes of a man living in a peaceful world, having just returned from hell.<br/><br/>I saw American Sniper as the story not of some super-man, but rather of a real man with real depth and vulnerability, who takes on that role of Protector and swallows the poisonous violence, horror, and despair that is war, all so that others will not have to be exposed. There is a huge societal threat from mental health illness in our current and former service personnel and I think it is marvellous that a mainstream Hollywood film is shining the light into this dark attic of our collective mind. <br/><br/>Are the characters in the movie the most complex and evolved? No. Would it have been nice to see more character development? Yes. To do all that we would have needed a series of films as this story spans many years, and I don't believe that this would enhance what Clint Eastwood is offering to us.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing, but go in looking for the human story, not one of wild special effects and teeth rattling explosions. Finally let me leave you with a quote that is close to my heart personally, and that sums up my feeling of American Sniper the film:<br/><br/>War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. John Stuart Mill (1806 - 1873)"
"IndridC0ld","1","98","202","11 February 2015"," A PAINFULLY Awful Navy Recruiting Film
","Let's get one thing out of the way before I begin my review. I did NOT pay to see this film. I downloaded a copy of an Academy Awards preview disk. Many thanks to the housekeeper who intercepted this disk in the mailbox of some Academy reviewer. As is often the case, you saved me ten bucks I would have paid had I mistakenly chosen to see this stinker film in a theater. <br/><br/>American sniper is little more than a film that will, regrettably, encourage many young men whose lives have been stunted by the effects of the Great Recession in to join up with the military. No doubt, thousands of kids for whom the most promising job prospects include ""would you like fries with that"" will enlist in the travesty against humanity that our military has become.<br/><br/>In some ways, American Sniper is quite accurate. Our soldiers often DO act like mafia thugs who break down your door, rough up your family, and kill you if you don't cough up the requested military intelligence info. Yes, our Army in the 21st century, is little more than a thuggish collection of leg-breakers and hit men. They care not in the least that you are innocent or guilty of anything. You are not American, so your stupid A-rab ways are a target of scorn, and we have the god given right to extinguish your life as we would a cockroach's's. <br/><br/>This truly sickens me. Every time I saw a depiction of violence against civilians in this film, I again wondered why GWB, Dick Cheeny, and Donald Rumsfeld had not been arrested for crimes against humanity. If I EVER had any reason to question why America is so hated in so many parts of the globe, this movie answered all of my questions. <br/><br/>As to the film's production value, editing, and scripting, I found myself laughing at some of the dumbest dialog ever given voice in a motion picture. You'd have to examine the scripts of such Hollywood ""gems"" as Porkeys, and The Hollywood Knights, to find such trite, adolescent dialog. The banality of it left me speechless (though sadly the same cannot be said of the actors.)."
"kaushikbharadwaj","10","10","15","24 September 2015"," The best war time portrayal.
","People who know war, those who really know it and not those who say that they will find this movie home. It is the story of every solider, people who are on either side of battlefield. The way the character of Chris Kyle has been portrayed is legendary. Bradley Cooper was the only one who could justify it. A character who is so complex. One who is very moral in what he does. A sniper in his position would not hesitate to kill the kid who picks up the bazooka. But he patiently waits for the chance to let him drop it and run. Yet he it accurate when he needs to shoot. He cries when he realizes that when the first enemy to die in his hand was a kid. That's the nature of war. It is a necessary evil. If you see the entire movie in a stretch, the last two minutes are the most amazing minutes in the entire movie. The entire streets filled with people waving for Chris Kyle. An exceptional movie."
"rtwatson","9","32","59","14 March 2015"," American Sniper, Is Chris A Hero?
","The movie, American Sniper, has many aspects in it that make it great. Many people say that Chris Kyle was not a great man and that he did not do great things. No matter his personal background, in the movie we get to see all of the lives that he saves to the specific skill sets that he decided that he should put to a better use. The movie itself has a wide variety of battle scenes from intense fire fights that keep you on the edge of your seat to long range battles between Chris and his counterpart on the enemy side. <br/><br/>Chris is fantastic in war but the turmoil that he has with his family is a main focal point of the whole movie. In one of the scenes Chris gets home and does not even go straight to his family but instead straight to the bar. His wife calls and he tells her that he is home and needs some time to clear his head before he comes home. It takes Chris a while to realize that he is tearing his family apart. His inner turmoil is that he could not a save enough guys while he was overseas. Sure, he killed a lot of the enemy, but to him that does not make up for all the men that got lost or hurt while he was over there. <br/><br/>One final thing I want to say about the film is that it did leave out a lot of good scenes that could have made the movie better. They could have easily made this a better movie even if they had to make it into a two part movie or a three hour movie. A perfect example of this is towards the end of the movie in his last tour of duty he gets left behind in a sand storm and all you know is he gets rescued and that is all. There is no story behind how it happened or anything and it could help make the movie a little more interesting instead of jumping around as often as the movie did.<br/><br/>In all American Sniper was a fantastic movie and I think everyone should go see it. It shows how brave our men and women were during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and how much they all gave up in the process. It also shows how much heroism can be displayed by not just one man, but by all of our servicemen and women when they work together towards a certain goal and purpose."

","American sniper it's a story about Navi seal Sniper Chris Kyle who had 160 confirmed kills from 250+ possible.

The movie is violent , disturbing and it captures the sense of sorrow around this story . IT shows Chris as ordinary man not a superhero or a legend , a man who is very patriotic and believes in his purpose to protect his country. Film shows how war does affect soldiers and their families after they come home will it be enemies you killed , violence you saw or comrades you didn't save .The only problem i have with the movie is they showed Chris Kyle a little more anti-war person than he really was , who after going all this still kept loyal to what he believed . Eastwood focused more on his humanity side which i have to admit worked damn well . Bradley Cooper gives an amazing Oscar worthy performance , best one in his career , he transformed not only physically but mentally too. Directing is very good everything works around main character , helping us to understand him more and using close up shots letting Cooper Shine as a diamond . overall movie is shot very well battle scenes are real and very very intense sometimes you just hold your breath , the stories transition between Iraq and U.S. is done in right moments so the story wont suffer from it . the movie keeps good balance between action and drama and the cinematography is really good something not so usual for Eastwood tho a little to colorful for his movies one of the best movies of Clint Eastwood and definitely of the year go watch it"

","Well, the best part of this movie is its ending! Such ""hero"" could have easily turned into a horror movie story to kill his entire family and then suicide. Now, in regards to the film, it is the purest form of garbage you will ever see! Nothing in it is either factual or realistic. Sadr City did not have any Syria Olympian. And certainly the part where they kill dozens of insurgents is pure fantasy. On the battlefield, a man is worth one man and it is just ridiculous that film makers actually still shoot scenes where one man kills 20 or more by himself. It is just laughable! Regarding the children participating in the war and violence. It is, again, the purest form of bull****! No proof or account could ever confirm this and I certainly have not heard or seen such a thing. All in all, the film portrays ALL Iraqis to be evil, savages, and backstabbing. Yet it forgets that the Americans were the ones who attacked and used violence for economic and political reasons that have nothing to do with the freedom or security of American citizens. <br/><br/>In short, the film demonizes Iraqis. It is definitely a fictional film that does not relate to reality what so ever. Just shameful!"
"s3276169","3","120","252","8 January 2015"," Simplistic and fraught with contradiction
","I'm not going to spend too much time on this film as in my opinion there is not a lot worth saying. This is war movie that may appeal to a specific US demographic but, based on my experience, I question whether if it will appeal to those outside the US. <br/><br/>American Snipers simplistic jingoistic overtones combined with its shallow, sanctimonious religiosity and lack of respect for humanity in general is a caustic thread that runs the length or this dreary, depressing and at times genuinely callous film. There is also a minor but rather nasty dash of throw away misogyny offered up early on to round things out. <br/><br/>What really stood out for me however was the glaring contradictions found throughout this flick. A US citizen defending their country is a patriot, a person from the Middle East defending their lands is a terrorist. Killing over 150 people including children is treated as somehow heroic rather than an awful consequence of war. Why? Why too is the US in the Middle East to start with and why is this a good thing? Aside from vague references to the attacks on the US on September 11th (which had virtually nothing to do with Iraq) this is not explained or justified. Why too is the key characters emotional issues that eventually result from the work he does never really examined or reconciled? <br/><br/>In my estimation its high time Mr Eastwood put away his directors chair. Three out of ten from me and only because the acting is not totally dreadful, even if the film is."

","On February 2nd, 2013, an American hero was lost in a traumatic shooting. American Sniper not only honors Chris Kyle, but also those valiant warriors who fight for our nation's security so you and I may sleep peacefully at night. <br/><br/>American Sniper places the viewer in the boots of Chris Kyle, a lethal Navy SEAL who served four years over seas in the deserts of Iraq. Kyle serves as an armament for his fellow soldiers, for his family, and for the United States of America as he puts them first above all else. This film exposes the hardships these warriors undergo from the first-hand experience of Chris Kyle. American Sniper illustrates how war is not the only battle these soldiers are fighting. Chris Kyle experiences internal conflict and family conflict, in addition to the four years of war over seas in Iraq. This movie depicts the family sacrifice these warriors experience as well as the greatest sacrifice an individual can make; an honorable death of dying for one's own country.<br/><br/>The movie industry often presents war movies as representations of the beauty of conflict. However, American Sniper provides another view of how war is not beautiful, but obligatory. Chris Kyle's remarkable stature and incredible skills as a sniper embody the professionalism of the United States Navy SEALS as well as his dedication to serve his people. However, his time as a warrior causes PTSD and tensions at home.<br/><br/>Kyle is not the only warrior presented in this movie, his wife, Sienna Miller, endures many difficulties as well. Sienna Miller is a loving wife and great support for Chris Kyle, however she undergoes numerous challenges due to Kyle's long absences in Iraq. This passionate excursion of not being able to see her husband for extended periods of time, knowing he could be killed at any point in time during deployment, and not being able to stay in constant communication reveals the life of all American soldiers' wives. American Sniper depicts this challenge that these women are facing today and their warrior-like attributes that they reveal on a day-to-day basis.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a film that is able to relate to the men and women who give all for America and captures what conflicts they experience. This motion picture honors these courageous souls and brings to light their heroic stature as guardians and symbols of America."
"TheSquiss","3","115","244","6 January 2015"," Pro-Americanism plunders a passable film. Distasteful.
","Alas, I think that sad day has finally arrived. I think it may be time to wheel Clint Eastwood off to the home for the aged and once-great Hollywood royalty. His (intermittent) acting ability finally gave up the ghost with Trouble With the Curve and now, with American Sniper, his directorial prowess has gone south, too. The king is dead, long live the king.<br/><br/>I suffered his latest offering and death knell with my viewing companion, Bag. He approached it with enthusiasm having loved Chris Kyle's autobiography of the same name; I approached it with trepidation having given up half a chapter in after suffering an emotional allergic reaction to the jingoistic, gung-ho, Team America (you know, ""America! F*** Yeah!"") attitude.<br/><br/>We both hated the film.<br/><br/>American Sniper is the story of America's 'greatest' sniper, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), a Navy SEAL who put bullets through the heads and bodies of over 160 men, women and children; a man we are supposed to celebrate as a bona fide hero; a man that we are supposed to believe is a good man worthy of our eternal adoration because, according to Eastwood, he opted not to kill one particular child and carried a (stolen) bible (that he didn't read). How odd, then, that a point is made about a Moslem sniper carrying a Quran as well as a rifle and therefore being evil.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is a painful experience. Eastwood veers away from anything that could possibly be construed as 'un-American', painting Kyle and his companions only as hard working, loyal heroes to whom we owe our hearts and minds. No thought is given to it being an illegal war, that what occurred accounted to little more than an invasion, that the majority of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in the war were peace-loving civilians and not terrorist aiming to destroy America.<br/><br/>And yet when, in the final scene, Eastwood has the opportunity to depict honestly the psychological damage war does to humans, even those apparent 'saviours' of the world, he shies away from it, preferring to cut and leave us to work it out. Why the apparent aim at subtlety now when he has hammered home his aggressive point all the way along? Heck, even in the credits there is no let up as we are bombarded with news footage of the 'hero's' funeral procession and the deafening silence so that we, too, can show our awe and respect to a man who chose to take a job with the sole aim of being paid to kill.<br/><br/>But forget the politics. American Sniper still stinks. According to Bag, who has read the book more times than I have fingers, screenwriter Jason Hall has shown little evidence of having actually read it fully himself, such are the liberties he has taken with the content, characters and 'facts'. I thought it was just me, but as we emerged into peaceful daylight, my companion muttered ""I know that book inside out and I still couldn't follow which character was which."" <br/><br/>Eastwood's hearing is presumably shot, too, as for much of the time it was impossible to discern what many of the actors, Cooper particularly, were saying. Maybe he gave a solid performance, perhaps the Kyle family will be over the moon with his portrayal of the sniper, but it doesn't count for much when most of the audience (in our screening room anyway) are leaning to their neighbours and asking ""What did he say?"" I suppose their comments added variety to exasperated sighs, raised eyebrows and longing stares at the ceiling.<br/><br/>Sienna Miller makes a valiant attempt to bring something of quality to American Sniper as Kyle's wife, Taya, but she is lost in this noisy, bulldozing mess. What happened to the Clint Eastwood who delicately crafted the sharp brutality and the violent nuances of Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima and Bird? There is little evidence of his skill here.<br/><br/>It was a long drive home as Bag fumed. Judging from the sounds many other cinema-goers, they, too, were relieved to see the back of American Sniper.<br/><br/>For my part, to end on a positive note, it didn't make me quite as angry as 2012's Act of Valor but I still needed something frivolous with which to clean my mind out.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"david-stennett-211-862301","10","51","101","6 February 2015"," Are you ready for a reality change in military war?
","Once again Clint Eastwood proves his mastery of the art of filmmaking with American sniper. In an entertaining way you are provoked to transcend your preconceived mindset and the conventional wisdom. While the movie has reignited American public debates about the virtue and value of the conflict in the Middle East, it is the internal moral conflict confronting the American sniper that captivated me the most. As you weigh the decisions, your mindset is revealed and your heart is challenged. For me this reality change is what a great film is all about. I love its great camera work and atmosphere but it is the emotional power and depth of the story which makes it a classic. <br/><br/>This film closely captures the mood, so you really felt present during the latest Iraq conflict and the everyday rebellion and insurgency combat in the streets. Only the US soldiers wear uniforms, they can be surprised and attacked from any quarter and by any man, woman and child. The action is close and personal so that it hits the heart of the viewer. The term non-military age man, seems to mean a child of 6 or 7 years, who proved unable to hold an anti-tank rocket launcher and fire it at a US vehicle 20 meters away. Chris, a crack American sniper watches every second through his gun sights, deliberating whether he should wait a little longer, or to fire now. When US troops use force in house to house searches, they are confronted face to face with Iraq's families at home. Children, babies, women and military age men are terrorized by American soldiers in their search for one Muslim terrorist. As a Muslim sniper starts shooting US soldiers, it seems that he is acting in the same way as the American snipers. The films shows how both sides are brought closely together. Could it be that they are becoming almost indistinguishable?<br/><br/>The moral conflict in Chris's mind and heart threatened to tear him to pieces and also his family on his return to the USA. Yet he declared to his psychologist that his 160 kills was well justified in his efforts to serve his country and save his brothers in arms. In his thirst to kill, Chris has lost his moral war without realizing it. Eastwood carefully sequences the scenes of heroism and of moral corruptions to provoke viewers to evaluate the true meaning of heroism and war. The 'just war' waged by the US has turned the very people, the ordinary citizens of Iraqi, it is trying to rescue (from terrorism) into its enemies. The US may have captured the land, but it lost the hearts and minds of the people in the land. <br/><br/>For the perceptive one, this film dramatically also shows that those involved in military war are presented with the moral conflict more intensely than in nearly any other situation. <br/><br/>I watched the movie in California with two American Vietnam veterans on each side of me. The film ended and there was an intense and heavy silence in the whole cinema. If the goal was that to shock the audience to a deeper reflection, then this film is masterful. Could this film have unveiled the reality of ""just"" military wars? One of the veterans told me, what he had probably hid for years, that this was also his experience of Vietnam. The other reeling emotionally, said ""I can't talk about it, I have to get home quickly. It brought too many memories back.""<br/><br/>The war in Vietnam finally ended as the American public rebelled, when confronted with the terrible realities on TV in the comfort of their homes. Personally I think that #Clint Eastwood will prove to be the real hero who has reignited the public debate on the moral of the modern American wars with this film.<br/><br/>The next day working at Playford Games, I felt a change inside. I design the Moral Conflict games to encourage players, to weigh their hearts and their actions. My illustrator in Germany and I have been mulling over our latest title picture, where we portray the agony of the 1945 moral conflict within the soldiers, children and women in the streets of Berlin. After seeing Clint Eastwood's work, I am inspired to make this picture count and reach the hearts and minds of as many as possible."

Clint Eastwood really does a great job of truthfully telling and displaying the horrors of war and how it truly does affect the soldiers after they come back home from war. Bradley Cooper was amazing as the lead role, Chris Kyle. Sienna Miller was also very spot on with her performance as Chris's wife back home. The visuals and the war violence were very real, and really showed you how the were in Iraq really was for the soldiers, and how truly disturbing it was, not only for the soldiers, but also for their families. I was very entertained and satisfied with this film. It should've won Best Picture in my opinion, but maybe I should see Birdman before I say that. This film really left me speechless and I was truly moved and touched by not only the actors performances, but also how they portrayed the war in Iraq!"
"evanacosta-176-501755","2","140","302","9 January 2015"," Saddest attempt of a pseudo war movie family drama
","I went to see this movie as I have read the book also. I was expecting to see an intense action packed movie. To my complete disappointment this is simply sad. Sad in every way i could possibly think about. It is neither an action movie nor a drama, just a very weak attempt at both. The action scenes are too spread out and blended in with the a brief overview of a gut-wrenching Post Traumatic Stress Disorder soldier with a crying wife. It is Clint Eastwood's interpretation of old fashioned US patriotism and in reality it is just a mild portrait of abusive soldiering and bullying of local population. You are neither captured by the excitement of a proper war picture or feel any emotions moved by the family drama.<br/><br/>It portrays a simple minded Chris Kyle who is conflicted by a sense of patriotism and what his colleagues and family think about the righteousness of the war. We all know that war sucks and that soldiers are pretty messed up in the head. As if his family drama wasn't enough we are bombarded by his pseudo-edginess as a result of trauma. Clint Eastwood is too old to understand what a modern movie is all about. He does not know how to use visual effects to his advantage at all. I went too see a movie about the accomplishments of the deadliest sniper in US military history and ended up seeing a sad sad movie. <br/><br/>I am a big fan of American war movies like platoon or black hawk down. However, this picture was just simply garbage. Do not waste any money on this. Probably the worst performance of Bradley Cooper ever and shows that Clint Eastwood has no idea how to bring out a war epic onto the large screen. The book had loads of material for a cool movie which is probably the saddest thing ever. Clint Eastwood has successfully ravished it into what seems like low-budget piece of rubbish. The movie gives you a sense that you have been robbed by the box office. Give me my money back!"

","This was an amazing movie and the book was as well. As for others saying that it was not true is a load of BS.<br/><br/>Chris kyle was sued for slander but not because the story he told was untrue. Kyle was sued for saying in his book that he punched out a celebrity, and later in an interviews came out and said he was talking about Jesse Ventura. So Jesse Ventura sued Kyle and before the case was closed Kyle was murdered and then Ventura kept pressing charges against Chris Kyles widow and got 1.8 million dollars. Just because there was a case for slander doesn't mean it had anything to do with the movie. The untruths were resolved before the movie was made.<br/><br/>On another note the movie was very emotional and suspenseful. It makes you realize how lucky we are to have our fellow Americans put there lives on the line everyday to protect us from terrorists."

","After an unprecedented stream of ridiculously bad movies, Clint Eastwood returns to his roots with another violence worshiping plunker. Here, he and his comrades fan the flames of division and war with this deeply irresponsible film glorifying American terrorism in Iraq. As usual the SEAL team occupiers are portrayed as heroic tough guys while the local Arabs are reduced to child murdering, drill-killing ""savages"". The caricatures are so backwards and silly it's hard to believe a film like this is being made in 2015. Presumably this is being marketed to the bible belt and anyone that hasn't actually seen combat. The cartoonish reductions of the people and situations involved are offensive to those that have served, let alone Iraqis. The film is so 100% paint-by-numbers that we even have scenes with the upset wife at home to break up the battle sequences. American propagandists should hold themselves to a higher standard."

"saralr1221-95-171939","1","121","261","14 January 2015"," A man-centric war movie mess
","I had two major problems with this movie.<br/><br/>The first would be that the wife character has no personality, no job, no family and no inner life. She is totally flat and all we see her do is drink some shots, read a magazine in the middle of the day and wear lingerie. After that she gets married and becomes a baby incubator for the main character. I found this one dimensional female portrayal to be so ridiculous it was offensive. If women are going to be portrayed in movies they should be more than flat cut-outs from Esquire magazine. The second part of the movie was supposed to focus on their relationship, which is couldn't do because the wife wasn't a real person.<br/><br/>My second problem was the child torture and death scenes. I understand that war is violent and that this movie was trying to 'realistically' portray the horror of war but I think that could have been achieved by the first two death scenes. The second child death scene was overkill and made the movie unpleasant to watch. There are far better ways to portray the horrors of war that by showing graphic violence against children. I didn't find it entertaining at all.<br/><br/>This movie is unrealistic, unpleasant to watch, has crappy character development and couldn't suspend disbelief for me. The editing was terrible, the story didn't flow and again, unless you like watching kids get tortured and killed I would skip this one. My husband is in the military and loves war movies and he hated this one just as much as I did. I would have given it zero stars if I could."

He states in his interviews that he spent quit a bit of time learning Chris Kyle's habits and the techniques taught during SEAL training. I thought the bulk he put on to play the character was video enhanced. Apparently not. Bradley put in the effort in the gym to bulk up. Kudos.<br/><br/>Hats off to the military men and women who laid their lives for the rest of us. We appreciate you more than words can say. <br/><br/>God bless."
"nmlal68","1","86","181","24 January 2015"," When do they shoot a movie about the thousands of murdered Iraqi civilians?
","Very good acting, competent technical direction and boring unimpressive story about an ignorant cowboy, who thought he was fighting evil, when in fact he was fighting for oil and territorial dominance while evil was comfortably sitting home and had three names: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld.<br/><br/>This is another republican propaganda flick, not about an hero, but about a tragic figure among so many, who was brainwashed with the most vicious and obscene propaganda into believing that Iraq and Saddam Hussein were involved in 9/11 and had weapons of mass destruction.<br/><br/>This movie is a moral inversion of a greedy and stupid war, which caused the chaos in the region and still kills innocent people every single day. One should be ashamed of portraying the main character as a hero over the corpses of hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, who are the true and only heroes in this disgusting bloodshed."
"cometoricks","1","58","118","20 February 2015"," Inspector Harry takes on Iraq
","American is a highly detestable film with not one single redeeming feature. The so-called 'hero' is depicted as a simple-minded good for nothing who can only find a goal and a bit of excitement in his empty life when he kills Iraqis in their own country, generally safely hidden on a rooftop - and he does not really know why. All Iraqis are depicted as one-dimensional, cowardly, cunning, double-crossing characters who betray their guests, families, and fellow-countrymen. <br/><br/>Kyle himself does not undergo the slightest change over the 2 hours of the film - he never asks himself a single question. He only suffers bouts of PTSD which are supposed to raise compassion among the spectators but of course no compassion should be felt for the 200 Iraqi citizens he has ruthlessly executed. <br/><br/>Let us now imagine the reverse situation. Let us imagine an Iraqi film called 'Iraqi sniper' in which the hero carries a copy of the Quran and takes random shots at US soldiers invading his country. Then the film would be booed and hissed, unanimously rejected as a shameful instrument of Islamic propaganda and the main character would be called a terrorist. Yet, a half-wit who shoots a fawn at age 8 and a child 25 years later is hailed as a hero. This is truly baffling.<br/><br/>American Sniper feels like the good old 80's again, with a simplistic Reaganian/Rambo II/Inspector Harry ideology. Even the cinematography seems to be stuck in a time warp with not one single interesting shot or angle. The director has obviously gone past his sell-by date. He should watch and get some inspiration from The Hurt Locker or Black Hawk Down and the likes. Or just retire. How the same director can come up with Gran Torino and then with this hagiography of a nitwit is truly mind boggling."
"justin-peterson-1971","8","26","48","20 February 2015"," Pro-war propaganda? Did we see the same movie?
","I am utterly baffled by the litany of accusations leveled against this movie as jingoistic, propaganda, racist, etc. Did we see the same movie? I saw a moving, utterly convincing and surprisingly neutral portrait of a soldier who did what he thought was right, and struggled with the consequences of the life he had chosen. The absence of any taking sides about whether his decisions were valid or not was actually conspicuous in the film. The protagonist returns to a country where he finds it difficult to fit in, and complains about its lack of understanding of what is going on overseas. His health is placed in danger, his family is strained, and he obviously suffers psychological damage. And this is pro-war propaganda? Strange propaganda indeed. Moreover, other characters in the movie provide voices for those who thought the Iraqi war was just madness, and judgment is not passed on them either. The style of the film is stark, realistic, totally convincing - and remarkably devoid of side-taking. Hence, I find the outburst of indignation against the movie shocking. On a technical level, the battle scenes are amongst the best ever done, transmitting the sensations of stress, anxiety and fear in war. Cooper is simply stellar. The drama he lives at home is somewhat predictable, and clichéd, but quite well done, and, again, devoid of judgments about who is ""right"". Ironically, those who obviously hated this movie because of its alleged bias, are really revealing their own extreme prejudice against any movie that does not have a clear anti-military, anti-war agenda. Anything else is, apparently, ""propaganda"" in their eyes."

","Glorifying a cowardly murderer in order to encourage impressionable children to join the world's biggest terrorist cell is quite disgusting.<br/><br/>The film portrays the religion of patriotism, the only religion to still revel in human sacrifice, as if it is acceptable.<br/><br/>Patriotism is the refuge of the cowardly, the stupid and the evil. This killer is in all three categories.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that American children don't realise that the rest of the world pities their plight as brainwashed, brain-dead victims of the world's rogue state.<br/><br/>Why couldn't they make a good film about the only known American hero, the amazingly courageous Chelsea Manning? Now that might help cure some of the huge damage that the US terror has done to the reputation of America."
"Amthermandes","10","76","159","16 January 2015"," Powerful and thrilling, hits the mark
","American Sniper is a film based on the true events that surrounded Chris Kyle, a heavily skilled and determined American SEAL, and his brothers-in-arms in the Middle East during a time of war and crisis. It's a story about a boy who grew up to be a man and yearning to fulfill one specific duty: To protect men, women and children from those who seek to do evil and harm.<br/><br/>The movie takes us through a bit of his early life and training, and then juggles between his 4 tours in Iraq and his life on US soil as he struggled with internal and external dilemmas. It's an accurate portrayal of the life of Chris Kyle, and his confirmed 160 kills that saved many innocent lives. <br/><br/>The film is not perfect, but aside the minor editing flaws, fake babies, and a few sub-par directing decisions, it's a movie well worth seeing for the action, the drama, the laughs (there were some good ones), the cries, the story, the characters, and the patriotic tribute to the men and women who serve. I would also like to mention the respect given to Chris Kyle and his family is well executed in the film, and I've never seen a theater packed with people so silent as they filed out as the end credits rolled, silent save a few sniffles. <br/><br/>There's a lot of controversy regarding the actions and beliefs of Chris Kyle. Do not let this mindless squabble tell you who Chris Kyle was, go and see the movie yourself and learn of the sacrifices he and ALL troops made to keep the US (and others) safe. This isn't a story about a blood-thirsty killer, this is a story about a man who was committed to his God and his country, and who ended blood- thirsty killers. <br/><br/>You can do some protecting for yourself and others in the theater, just bring some tissues to protect those around you against running makeup and wet cheeks. <br/><br/>God bless our troops."
"saseitz-705-31959","9","32","61","4 March 2015"," Profound and Unsettling
","I suspect a lot of people appreciated American Sniper for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>I say this because director Clint Eastwood has a long history of using violence to attack violence. It's a long time since Dirty Harry glorified vigilante justice to cheering audiences; as a director, Eastwood has chosen material dealing with the consequences of violence, and it's never, ever sugar-coated. He forces us to think about the consequences of violence, and in this American Sniper is no different.<br/><br/>Thanks to a well-publicized trial, most of us know Kyle's life story; he grew up in redneck Texas, and after the September 11 terror attacks decided to join the Navy Seals. He racked up more dead enemy combatants than any other soldier in history, only to be murdered by one of his fellow veterans in 2013.<br/><br/>I'm sure there were many in the audience who cheered every shot which felled an enemy combatant, but not Kyle, as portrayed by Bradley Cooper. Two of Kyle's early victims were a mother and a small child, and it's only with the greatest reluctance that he pulls the trigger. It's easy to see why Cooper was nominated for an Oscar; it has to be hard for someone in Kyle's position to keep a grasp on his humanity, and you can see the struggle reflected in Cooper's eyes in every frame. To Cooper's great credit, Kyle takes no pleasure in the chore he does so well.<br/><br/>Even in those scenes where Kyle is home, it's clear the war has not changed him for the better. When Kyle goes to get his car repaired, for example, someone using an automatic drill spooks Kyle into thinking there's an enemy attack for a moment. Those moments are marvelous and subtle, perfect examples of the actor's art.<br/><br/>Kudos as well to Sienna Miller, who plays Kyle's wife, Taya. In one of the most harrowing scenes I've seen in recent years, Taya and Chris are talking on their cell phones when, suddenly, violence erupts. All Taya can hear are explosions, gunfire, and yelling. Miller's face runs any number of dark emotions: fear, loss, sudden abandonment. Her terror is real. (There's also an all too brief scene with Miller in lingerie; how the hell could Jude Law cheat on that?)<br/><br/>Eastwood pulls no punches in the war segments, and nothing is glorified. Eastwood's Iraq is at the gates of hell. The soldiers can't trust anything, and they never know when something's going to blow up, or when bullets will start to fly. They don't know if they're being lured into a trap when invited to dinner at a local's home. Sometimes sophisticated technology fails. I don't know about anyone else, but I felt as scared and uncertain as the soldiers on the screen. I shudder to think what real war is like.<br/><br/>People will see many messages in American Sniper, and I saw a very clear one: Chris Kyle is yet another victim of America's gun culture. Played by Ben Reed, Kyle's father raises his kids to shoot and his dark and ignorant view of humanity should frighten everyone; it's no surprise Kyle became such a proficient killer with an upbringing like that.<br/><br/>Eastwood does not show Kyle's murder, but most of us know what happened: Kyle spent plenty of time with his fellow veterans to give them the help he so often needed himself. Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield took Eddie Ray Routh, someone they suspected was mentally unstable, to a shooting range. In retrospect, it was a very stupid thing to do. Had they gone to a bar, or a basketball game, it is likely they would have survived. You don't give guns to crazy people.<br/><br/>This is Eastwood's most profound film on the consequences of violence since Unforgiven. I can't imagine anyone leaving the theater waving a flag and cheering after seeing this film; just a deep sense of sadness and loss."

"coltonvaughn10","10","32","61","23 February 2015"," An excellent film about a TRUE hero
","This review will be two parts, film review and backlash for the unnecessary hate. First and most importantly, what you should think about before you watch the film. Clint Eastwood delivers his best film since Gran Torino. Direction A. Bradley Cooper's portrayal of the American icon should have won the Oscar. Acting A+. The general movie score/props/cinematography is solid, points off for the fake baby though. B+. Overall rating, 9.8. Now for the Liberal badgers of the film who didn't see the flipping thing. You DARE call Bowe Bergdahl a hero and call Chris Kyle an abomination to the country and racist?! Chris Kyle did his job. He killed EVIL people, in the act of war, who did evil despicable things and you dare call this man a monster?! I'd like to see every Liberal who bashed this film under fire from RPGs and AK-47s and see if they think that 150+ kills he tallied was unjustified. As for him calling the Arabs savages, he's right. Call me racist I don't care. The Arabs have done one thing their entire life, and that is butcher their own people and the Jews. Don't believe me? Look at history and Lawrence of Arabia's struggle to get Arabs to work together FOR THEIR OWN GOOD, and they couldn't. I realize not all of the Arab people are terrorists, but there's obviously a gigantic amount. He called the Arabs savages because of what they do to their own people. We would be savages too if L.A. decided they were going to run a genocide of Oakland. The bottom line is, if you kill your own citizens to the point you cannot be safe, you are in a savage land. Screw political correctness, express yourself. (To a reasonable extent) I am appalled by the hate for Chris Kyle. You are indebted to that man for his service whether you AGREED with the Iraqi War or not, and being glad he's dead is just unfathomable. Michael Moore and his left wing buddies are the reason why the Korean, Vietnam, and Iraqi Wars were failures. They were reasons that soldiers didn't want to fight. Why? Because they didn't believe that what they were doing was right. The belief that you are on the winning side in any war is essential to winning it. Michael Moore and his beliefs are what is poisoning this country. We need more men like Kyle to bring it back around. Men that are courageous, loving to their families, willing to what is asked of them by their country, and kind at heart to give a helping hand. If more people were like Chris Kyle America would once again be the greatest country in world."

The mixed blend of what he had to offer for his country, his fellow soldiers along with his wife and children was extremely good. The movie offered love, romance, adventure and action all rolled into one. Upon leaving the theater, there was a man standing there saluting the screen with tears in his eyes. There was no doubt that he too has seen what our brave young soldiers have seen and have been through. Perhaps he was in Iraq and perhaps it brought back memories? As for me personally, I truly liked the movie and found it to be something that I will remember for a long while."
"billcr12","7","64","132","10 January 2015"," Good Film
","Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the most prolific sniper in American military history. It begins with the thirty year old Kyle as a cowboy type who is searching for meaning in his life when he becomes a navy seal. After rigorous training he is sent to Iraq and becomes a legendary sniper. The war scenes look very similar to Stanley Kubrick's often used ones in Full Metal Jacket. The camera tracks from behind the soldiers as they move forward. The action is fast paced and well done by director Clint Eastwood. The melodramatic family moments are fairly typical, with the suffering wife holding the home front while hubby keeps the world safe for democracy. I found Sierra Miller annoying as Kyle's spouse, but Cooper was cast right in the lead role. Although a bit too long at two hours and fifteen minutes, it is still one of the better films of 2014."

","This movie is a must see. Bradley Cooper's performance was definitely worth the Oscar - he delivers such intensity in his performance that manages to transport you and fascinate you at the same time. This intensity is one of the key factors this movie is successful. On top of this he is literally transformed - to the point it's hard to think you're watching the same actor you're familiar with. A truly unique performance. American Sniper is a war movie at its best: it is gut wrenching, hard to watch at some points an beautiful in its mise en scène and reconstruction of war torn landscapes and sets of conflict. Eastwood is a proved strong director and this another great movie - a high point in my opinion."

"truthsee","2","74","155","17 January 2015"," Boring
","I watched this movie expecting something which was going to have a magnetism. The moment came and went in the first 15 minutes - when our hero was forced to shoot a child. This was his first ever kill. From there it got very boring as we go through the motions of watching person a kill person b. person c defend against some bad guys. It unfolds just as any war/action movie would but just in a cold slow manner. I nearly gave up and stopped watching. The whole thing dragged on way too long and then as soon as it had started it ended in an abrupt way which suggested to me that director Clint Eastwood had run out of ideas.<br/><br/>I know this review will disappear amongst the tirades of positive patriotic outpourings - but I go with the reviewer who called this film Team America. Its all about how the US can go into someone else's country and flatten it under the false premise of weapons of mass destruction which were truly false and then take the moral high ground. The main character felt compelled to go to war because of the WTC attacks. I thought it was Saudi Arabia that planned and paid for all of that. Yuk in my book."

","I am really sorry to say, but this movie is a shame for Mr. Eastwood and to his directing career. Saying it like he is my favorite actor and director in the last 20 years. I have seen all of his movies, and I never thought I will have to write anything close to this.<br/><br/>Let just stay at his works about interpreting wars - of course, U.S. involved wars. He is a U.S. patriot, and there is nothing wrong with that, in contrary!<br/><br/>The movies: Flags of our fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Gran Torino...<br/><br/>They show heroes and respecting the enemies, with a perfect balance.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is one of the best movies in the history of cinema about the subject, how a stubborn, redneck, ""killthemall"" veteran can realize that yes, his long time enemies are also not just ""sandbags"", but living and lovable human people. <br/><br/>American sniper... fails to do this. But it also fails to be a movie, in every aspect. We got to know a flat, boring character of Kyle, who has nothing to do with heroism, he is light years away from it. The story - there is no such thing in the 135 minutes. It's a documentary about a soldier's 4 Iraqi missions, without any character development. <br/><br/>But my greatest problem of all: Representing a soldier as a hero, who's risking their fellow soldiers' life for a stupid duel with the Iraqi sniper - it's a quilt in my eyes! This act deserves punishment by court Marshall! Showing this fact to the young generations as a heroic act, shameful and stomach turning...<br/><br/>Mr. Eastwood, please apologize!

","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's tour de force. This is a masterpiece in every way. The story of Chris Kyle had to be told to a free world and it had to be told to keep our world free. This is a love story, a war story, and a drama all rolled into one. Most importantly for me is the psychology behind the man. I am a psychologist and I spent Christmas day with the veterans at a local VA hospital. I lived that scene that Bradley Cooper brilliantly portrayed at the hospital. That doctor did exactly what I would have done to help Chis Kyle with the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Many of our heroes in the military suffer from this debilitating illness. One of the most famous was Audie Murphy, America's Most Decorated World War II Combat Soldier. He also worked to get better treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for all military veterans. <br/><br/>On so many levels, American Sniper is a work of art. It shows the humanity of our heroes in the military. Chris Kyle was motivated to keep our world free. His love of children was depicted extremely well. His undying love of family was beautifully portrayed. Chris Kyle is a legend but I am sure he would want to give credit to everyone who puts on the uniform. The men and women in the military have my undying love and this movie shows why we all should."

Kyle becomes a living legend.<br/><br/>Cooper plays Kyle as a dedicated killer who loves his team, and is a patriot.He is certain of his mission and the wider cause that has brought the United States to Iraq.

The gradations he and Eastwood have chosen to show - of Kyle's character, personality and disease - are perfectly graded ... and if that isn't exactly the man Chris Kyle was, it's an indelible movie character. The film is not, by any fair measure, a battle hymn or a call to arms.

","This is the first movie in my life that I walked out of.<br/><br/>American Sniper is the real life story of Chris Kyle, a SEAL in the United States Army. At 84 years old, Clint Eastwood has proved once again that he should not be directing nor doing anything in the film industry anymore. <br/><br/>The movie travels through Chris Kyle's four tours to the middle east, played by Bradley Cooper. He stares off into the distance a lot and doesn't say much of anything useful. He does of course say those basic one liners like calling Iraqis ""savages"" and all the other army characters like to say ""die mother-f*****"".<br/><br/>It felt like a bad video game. The characters had no personalities, the storyline was as plain as could be, there was propaganda everywhere, and it repeated the same shot of Bradley Cooper shooting his sniper rifle over and over and over. <br/><br/>I thought they accidentally showed the first cut of the movie because the special effects were so awful to the point where I felt insulted that they thought people would buy that. Calling it early 90's CGI would be a compliment. There was a couple scenes where they CLEARLY were using a prop baby as a baby. In an especially tense scene they liquefied its little baby hand to look like it had life and movement. To laugh at such a pivotal moment is frustrating to me as an audience member and shocking that such an experienced director would make a choice like that.<br/><br/>This movie did not advance filmmaking in any way, except hopefully flushing out those Iraqi war movies once and for all. Clint Eastwood's last good movie was made in 1992 yet he keeps making movies because they make money and he's still alive. Unfortunately I can only control one of the two and next time I'll choose not to give him any more of my money."

","I didn't know the story behind Chris Kyle (the most lethal sniper of U.S history) until that final one liner played across the screen following the last frame of the movie. Undoubtedly the greatest role Bradley Cooper is to have portrayed to this date. The three times Oscar nominee, receiving nominations three years running is now part of an ensemble of ten actors to ever have achieved such; Russel Crowe being the last. American SNIPER is not just another movie of war. Instead it delves into a deeper and more sensitive core of how war challenges and changes those in the hot center of it and the ripple effects on the families left behind. Directed by Clint Eastwood, finally to me THE HURT LOCKER steps down to number two! This is a must watch.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is a Texan lad who grows up and takes up the Texan way of life and aspires to be a cowboy. Kyle and his brother are brought up in a household where his father mans a tight ship. Into his thirties Kyle seeks into a deeper meaning into his life. He enlists himself with the US military as a Navy SEAL and is soon decorated for his 4 tours in Iraq accumulating 160 confirmed kills which earns him the nickname ""Legend"" amongst his fellow SEALs. American SNIPER unfolds the story of Kyle from the moment he fires his first shot up until that moment he is honorably discharged from the US military. The question that hangs over our head is will he be able to leave his days of the battlefield behind?<br/><br/>Don't go seeking for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN instead look for some of the deepest acting you will witness in a war hero. Cooper displays passion. Cooper displays determination. Cooper displays nothing but the want to make sure the audience feels and understands the days of Kyle and his unit in Iraq. The explosions did not impress neither did the faint CGI nor the blood. They were by far the weakest links of the picture. Cooper instead pulls a Tom Hanks Cast Away move by actually being the only person on screen that matters. I mean no disrespect but the supporting cast disappears in the background noise of Cooper's ridiculous acting skills. At intervals it is felt as quite parallel to that of LONE SURVIVOR but Wahlberg is left way behind. The man behind the camera in this instance cannot be overlooked. Director Clint Eastwood is no D – League ball player. He is an All Star. I can only imagine how intense his chats with cooper may have been. For a character that speaks and does very little, the depths the character plunges into is astounding. To all you readers, watch out for that moment in the movie when you feel Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood has given it all they have and then. ""BAM"" out of nowhere there is more.<br/><br/>132 minutes of intense drama, 6 Nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, the next big question is does it have what it takes to be the name in that envelope on February 22nd 2015?

","A terrific war film, that is more about the inner war than the external one.<br/><br/>Based on the 2003 Iraq war, the movie is about Chris Kyle, the sniper who recorded 160 deaths from his own shoots officially. It's tough to kill someone, but when you are paid to kill, it becomes a profession, a duty. War involves a lot of killing and it does show up. Every soldier who killed someone perhaps goes through a lot of emotion after he the killing. It's because soldiers learn how to value a life.<br/><br/>In this story, we have a protagonist whose conflict within keeps him going and makes him stronger. Seldom have I seen a protagonist with such integrity and who is true to his profession. Vulnerability is something he innately possesses but he does not succumb. This protagonist has almost all the qualities of an ideal man. If the real person, Chris Kyle, on whose life the movie was based was someone as tough as shown in film, I salute his spirit and courage.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, who played the role of Chris Kyle, gave a poised and a nuanced performance. Though he shoots most of the time, he pierces any sensitive heart through his expression. To be ruthless is hard but to act being ruthless and yet empathizing is tough. I sincerely believe only few actors can pull off a role as tight as this one. Thankfully, Bradley pulls it off with aplomb.<br/><br/>Above all, I appreciate Clint Eastwood. I hardly know any director, who is not only maniacal but also rolls out a film almost every year. <br/><br/>Watch it for real action, no nonsense stuff and for the spirit of Chris Kyle. Above all, watch it for Clint Eastwood's vision.<br/><br/>A 4/5 for this."

","This movie, while it may have been an excellent film if it were completely and utterly fictional. The fact that it is based on a true story and is suppose to be a biography of sorts makes it seem you will get a more real view of everything. Not be left with the feeling they are trying to make a war criminal look like a hero.<br/><br/>There are good people out there in the army, in every army in fact. However, the particular man this was about was a liar and a monster. Let's look at his ""kill count"" to start. He has said that he killed people after Hurricane Katrina during looting from atop the super dome. The problem with that is the fact that no one was reported as shot by sniper rounds, a soldier or any good person would not kill anyone over looting and he would have been seen atop the dome by somebody. Self claimed unrealistic kills begin to paint the picture of a liar.<br/><br/>He has also said that he'd have killed anyone with a Quran if he could. That is not something a hero would say. More like a terrorist.<br/><br/>Mine and many who've seen this film all agree, our problem is not with the movie its self, it's a decent film. But it has been based off of a ""true story"" with a very skewed view in the form of propaganda. He was no hero and it should have not tried painting him as so. So because it is supposed to be a biography film of sorts that did nothing to tell the true story, it gets a very poor rating.<br/><br/>(Note to anyone who would say this review is not helpful: Stop being a patriot for just a moment and realise that this film is nothing but propaganda and for the genre they made the movie, it falls short of the truth)."

","This is the flawless movie on what a war is like from a soldier's perspective. Unlike philosophers sitting in a couch criticizing on justice and peace, the soldiers have to be both mentally and physically tough in order to survive and triumph in the battlefield. This movie successfully portraits such a soldier who triumph over enemies and overcome the mental scar the war carved on him. If you want a war movie that discusses philosophical issues about what is justice and righteousness, then this is not a movie you'll enjoy. But if you want to see the bare truth of war, the physical and mental wreckage brought to everyone (Iraqi people, especially children, American soldiers and their family), and really think beneath the scenes, then this is a very good movie. <br/><br/>*** Spoilers *** <br/><br/>There was one scene where an Iraqi mom gave her child a grenade to throw it to American soldiers and was killed by Chris. This is a very brave scene that is a big target for criticism. but it is just real battlefield story that cannot be taken away simply because of the over-simplified belief that children are innocent. There was also another scene with the same inconvenient reality where a seemingly-respectable man was shot dead and protesters carried his body and marched towards retreating army vehicles. Plain real stories reincarnated on screen. <br/><br/>Unlike another movies that try to instill some view about war to the audience, this movie presents the bare reality and leaves the reader thinking about the complexity of war."
"bankofmarquis","9","46","93","19 January 2015"," Just about the best of 2014
","I had two unusual things happen when I caught Clint Eastwood's American SNIPER last night.<br/><br/>Usually, when I go see a movie on Sunday nights, it's not unusual for our group to have the place to ourselves. What happened last night? The 9:30 showing of American SNIPER was SOLD OUT!! We had to attend the 10:00 showing – which was about 90 percent full.<br/><br/>Secondly, and most importantly, when the movie ended and the credits rolled, instead of hearing the usual crumple of paper, murmuring of people and movement to the exit, the theatre was DEAD SILENT with NO MOVEMENT as the credits bathed over us.<br/><br/>Such is the emotional impact of American SNIPER.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper – rightfully nominated for an Academy Award – stars in the true story of Navy Seal Chris Kyle, the proclaimed ""LEGEND"" who saved countless lives with his accurate shooting. But this movie is more than a ""war"" story about an American shooting the enemy from afar – though it could have been and it still would have been a good movie. Director Eastwood, along with screenwriter Jason Hall, crafts a story that is much more than that, switching between Kyle's 4 tours of duty abroad to his acclimation (or lack thereof) back home. It is in this toll on Kyle that the movie finds it's heart. Sienna Miller – far removed from the tabloid headline grabber she was earlier in her career – is sensational as Kyle's wife who tries to bring Kyle back to the real world. Her acting was a revelation to me, I quite simply didn't think she had it in her. Make no mistake, however, this movie is Cooper's and he more than steps up to the plate. Gaining weight (40 lbs!) and a gravitas heretofore not seen on screen from him, Cooper brings the steely eyed determination of ""killing the bad guys"" with the internal trauma that this job created. This is Cooper's 3rd straight year of being nominated for BEST ACTOR and I hope, this time, he wins it.<br/><br/>I was moved by this story and would rank this right up there with 2 other movies that tell the story of our recent wars overseas – THE HURT LOCKER and ZERO DARK THIRTY – quite possibly, the best of the 3.<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","I don't want to give anything away from this powerful and very real film. So I'll just bring up a few little things that hopefully won't ruin the film for you.<br/><br/>I read and hear about this movie. I was expecting to see a character that didn't care about people, about his country, or even about his family. I thought it was going to be a two hour film about a guy who liked to kill people. To people who say it's a film that celebrates a war hero or a man who loved to kill human beings, I have to disagree. It is not an entertaining film and it is not a horrifying film either. It is not littered with propaganda and it isn't overly dramatic about patriotism. It is simply... a story. A real story about Chris Kyle and his life as a country boy turned family man turned soldier turned ""Legend"". <br/><br/>When Chris kills a civilian while protecting his convoy and his spotter congratulates him on the kill he tells him ""Don't f-----g touch me!"" He's not proud of what he did. He's not proud of what he does! He has simply been trained to kill. He is doing his job. He was raised to be a strong defender for his family and now he has grown up and he needs to become a strong defender for his fellow soldiers. He has a strong sense responsibility of being the sheep dog to the sheep as his father says. Later the film really shows Chris' whole feeling towards protecting his brothers in arms. Some times though it does not have a positive affect. <br/><br/>In ""The Hurt Locker"" they say 'War is a drug'. Once you start getting involved with it you can't stop thinking about it. The same thing happens to Chris as he goes through his tours. War becomes his entire life and he can't shake off the things he has seen when he comes home after each tour. In fact these things begin to affect his relationship and his behavior and actions not just at home but overseas as well. He becomes distant, emotionless, and paranoid. This is where I saw the true heart of the film come out. It's showing us the affects war has on ordinary people.<br/><br/>This may be the only real review part of this review but after seeing this tale of an ordinary Texas boy turned American Patriot, I have changed my entire perspective of movies and of life. I will never forget this film and it's impact on me. <br/><br/>Other people can say what they want about this movie. I don't care what they think of this movie or my review. I can't really explain why I love this movie so much, I just... do. I love it. And That's my Opinion."
"brian-64169","10","19","34","3 June 2015"," Excellent production and acting.
","As an American, this move really evoked a lot of emotion. I walked away feeling like I sort of knew Chris Kyle. Bradley Cooper put in a convincing performance and deserved an Oscar for this one. The many one-star reviews are sadly misguided. They are nothing but political propaganda and whining by left-wing lunatics who think their soft, comfy beds and recliners don't come at a cost. Of course, a huge majority of them come from non-Americans who couldn't defend themselves if they were attacked by the Boy Scouts. Rather than reviewing the movie as a MOVIE, they based their reviews on their Sheep-like political views. I believe these types of people were mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very good and quite realistic for the most part. The sound was excellent as well. It was the kind of film I didn't want to end. It's portrayal of war and the ugliness that takes place is quite sobering. Although Chris Kyle is an American hero and seemed to adapt to civilian life, I am sure he had many struggles in dealing with what he went through. Nobody can see what these guys had to see and not be affected by it. It's probably the best movie yet on the Iraq war.<br/><br/>If you're the anti-American powder-puff type, then this movie isn't for you. But if you can appreciate an American hero with more courage and bravery than the entire EU, then you won't be disappointed."

","Let me first say it: I hate war. I think war is a sick, sick concept. It's a legal way to kill people. That is what war is. It's absurd. Chris Kyle was a stone cold killer, just like any serial killer. That's my opinion on that. (man will this review get a lot of dislikes from war vets and gun nuts)<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie! I really liked this movie. It's tense, entertaining, and just well made. The story is fascinating, the pacing is good, it barely drags on just a tiny bit towards the end, but just barely. Not enough to have a negative impact.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie glorifies war or the US, it shows the grimness of war quite well. Also it tackles how people get disturbed in the head from killing, in a good way.<br/><br/>And Bradley Cooper, oh my. He is just excellent! He isn't Bradley Cooper, he is another person! (I would say he's Chris Kyle, but I don't know how he was) Cooper does a fantastic job. And I'm not talking about the weight gain, which anyone could do, I'm talking about his acting chops.

Turned to IMDb and was astonished to find the number or reviewers giving one star on the basis this was undiluted pro-American propaganda. As one example: a reviewer complained that Kyle killed women and children without comment.<br/><br/>No, the movie did not tell you this was wrong. It showed you: though Kyle's hesitation, through his delay, his expression (great acting from Bradley Cooper); through his inability to adjust to normal life, through his desperately heartfelt relief when the child carrying the anti-tank missile dropped it and ran, through his post-traumatic stress disorder. What do such reviewers want, someone jumping on a soap box to make a speech telling the viewer war is wrong?<br/><br/>Actually, American Sniper shows that even the simplest, most black-and-white patriot, convinced of his duty, can be torn apart by the horrors of what he had to do.

He gives real-life Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle wonderful charisma, yet he keeps the portrayal grounded, making for a charming every man.<br/><br/>Narratively, I think Eastwood does a wonderful job of deconstructing a myth about this fellow, who came to be known as the deadliest U.S. sniper in Iraq. The film's pacing is intense, and (after seeing Fury) it cemented for me that war movies are my horror movies (and I saw this film at home via a screener during voting for the Florida Film Critics Circle). <br/><br/>American Sniper just rattled me, and many of the performances are suitably intense, from the villainous bully intimidating the locals called ""the Butcher"" to an especially heartbreaking Sienna Miller as the wife waiting for Kyle back home.

Therefore I must give the creators of this outrage the lowest rating, a 1 for awful. These people are NOT the filmmakers who crafted ""American Sniper."" These people are the specific IMDb reviewers who have rated this film based on political dogma rather than artistic merit. They are the snipers. They are shooting from the wrong location (IMDb) at the wrong victims (the filmmakers). IMDb is not a political forum. The rated 1 reviews predominate the top of the user review list. So the casual visitor is likely to gather ""American Sniper"" is a VERY bad movie. As a result, the film is shot in the back unfairly. After all, the overall rating is 7.5. That is quite good. But the better reviews do not show up in any fair quantity until several pages into the user review list.<br/><br/>In fairness, some of the negative reviews were thoughtful and demonstrated that the writers had actually watched the entire film. They separate the art from the message. And certainly, films with a political point of view are fair game for political opinion. My beef is with the many reviews which are undisguised political diatribe. The ones which make little or no notice of the film as entertainment, craftsmanship, or art. There are countless forums for this kind of free speech.

He's that good. Also first meeting Chris Kyle, we don't warm to him, when his then girlfriend gets involved in altercation, before she is sent packing her bags. In fact, I found him obnoxious. Near the end of the movie, where Cooper finally decides to quit touring, his mental state kind of breaks, where his iron fisted resilience keeps him in check. I thought that may'be there could a little bit more light thrown onto his mental state. But again this pic is up there with other true story anti terror tales, where Cooper's explosive performance is unforgettable, from an actor who just gets better. Sienna Miller, perfectly cast is very strong and sexy as his wife. Of course the actors are always better looking than the people they betray. This is one of the great films to start off the year, with some moments so intense, they're gold."
"thomas-w15","10","39","78","21 January 2015"," Intense and powerful!!! Great way to end awards season!!!!
","American Sniper: Powerful and intense. Two words that perfectly describe American Sniper. From the moment Chris Kyle is deployed to Iraq, the intensity in the film never lets up. Without a doubt, this is the most intense film I have ever seen. I thought good action movies kept me at the edge of my seat, but American Sniper is the true definition of an edge-of-a-seat film. At some points of the movie, I almost had to stand up and take a deep breath because my heart was beating so fast. I could tell everyone else in the audience felt the same way. With Clint Eastwood's best directing since Gran Torino, career best performance from Bradley Cooper, and the most powerful scriptwriting I have seen, American Sniper excels in nearly every category. <br/><br/>I just want you guys to know that some may find this movie biased because it calls a lot of the Iraqi's savages and seems very one-sided in it's view point of the War. This movie is about a soldier's life, and no way in hell a Navy SEAL is gonna think the work he does is not important or the men who try to kill his teammates are nothing less than scumbags. All of us would think this way if someone tried to kill our friends. <br/><br/>The trailer for this film kind of makes it seem like the movie is a little boring, but that is literally the opposite of what this film is. All of the emotion and intensity they are able to convey behind a sniper scope and with no one talking is astounding and very impressive. It draws you into the story with those emotions and intense scenes and you feel like you are living in the story with him. The script was near-perfect as well for the story it was telling as well. I will never know how hard it is for military men to acclimate back to their lives back home, but now I at least have a better understanding of the fight they have to go through from hearing gun shots all day to expecting to be normal at their son's birthday party. It is exactly like what Taya Kyle, played by Sienna Miller, says to Chris Kyle, ""if you think this war hasn't changed you, your wrong."" The power it was able to convey in nearly every scene was incredible, the script, the music, the acting, just everything went together perfectly. The audience felt exactly what Clint Eastwood, the director, wanted us to feel. I think it might even be his best work since Unforgiven to be honest.<br/><br/>When I saw Bradley Cooper in the trailer for this film, I could not believe it was him. He looks so different which is just a testament to how much dedication he puts into his roles. He worked for months on end to put forty-plus pounds of muscle on to play the most deadly sniper in military history. His acting was phenomenal. He has a perfect Texas accent and plays the born and bread country boy down to a tee. He definitely deserves every inch of that Oscar nomination he received. How perfectly he played not only a Navy SEAL, but a SEAL who has to find some impossible way to go back to the life he has home is amazing. <br/><br/>This film again is extremely intense and some scenes in Iraq do get a little graphic so make sure you are ready to see this film because it is not one of those films you can just pick up and watch whenever. If you can handle it though, I highly recommend American Sniper as your first choice walking into the theater. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","""American Sniper"" is basically equivalent to ""Stolz der Nation"", the fictional Nazi propaganda film directed by Alois von Eichberg in Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"". That was a masterful film, full of moral ambiguity, character development, and other such devices one would look for in a thoughtful, intelligent piece of art. This one, however, is completely bereft of any redeeming quality whatsoever.<br/><br/>It's certain to be divisive for political reasons, but leaving politics aside and judging it purely from a filmmaking perspective, this is a wreck of Kursk proportions. There's a scene where a convoy of Humvees are attacked. One smashes into an Iraqi car, and the viewer can see considerable damage occur to the front of the Hummer. Jump cut to the next shot, and the front end is good as new. Clint Eastwood by now could be considered a bit of a veteran; how then could a film rife with errors in continuity and other fundamentals be nominated by the Academy if not for truly insidious reasons owing nothing whatsoever to do with the film's quality? By the by: The trial of Eddie Ray Routh just so happens to commence next month, only a few short weeks after this film's release.<br/><br/>In truth, it makes me ashamed to be an American, if indeed Chris Kyle is the quintessential American Mr. Eastwood would like each of us to aspire to be. I shudder to think that's something anyone would aspire to and that this deplorable rubbish might be seen as representative of us in the slightest. Then again, this is a film directed by a man that talks to empty chairs about a man that lies about punching former professional wrestlers turned governors and murdering his own compatriots with pride. Maybe we shouldn't take it so seriously."

","One of the most powerful, true to life productions ever to hit the screen. It is now often that a true American hero can be portrayed accurately and with this emotion. Bradley Cooper far surpassed any other roles he has performed. The interaction with his Navy Seal and Marine brothers was both moving and accurate. This movie was a masterpiece and proves that Clint Eastwood is a modern day genius of moving making!<br/><br/>Siena Miller does an amazing job of portraying the effect on Chris Kyle's family and show the lengths a true hero will go to for his country. Cooper's portrayal of this hero, along with all the flaws and damage war does to his persona is amazing!"
"Matt-144-792009","7","52","108","10 December 2014"," Bradley Cooper is Right On Target as Chris Kyle, American Hero
","In American Sniper Bradley Cooper plays Chris Kyle, a real life Navy SEAL sharp shooter. The story is based on the Autobiography by Chris Kyle and chronicles his life and legend where he is reported to have over 150 confirmed kills in his career as a SEAL. The movie, directed by a legend in his own right Clint Eastwood, opens in the midst of battle where Kyle is about to make his very first confirmed kill. From there the movie jumps around with a series of flash backs to get you up to speed on the background of Kyle from childhood to how he ended up as a America's most deadly sniper. After the flashbacks, the movie takes you from one gruesome battle situation to another highlighting some of the more noteworthy kills of his career; all while trying to hold down a family, marriage and his own sanity.<br/><br/>Overall this is not Eastwood's best work. There is no real visual style here. I wanted this badly to be on the level of Lone Survivor (2013). Yet with the exception of Cooper and Sienna Miller who plays Kyle's wife, there are no other real marquee actors. The performances seem flat and the world created seem one dimensional. Think the level of acting seen in Act of Valor (2012). Yes, there are some real military in here similarly, yet the actual paid actors are nothing special. That being said I think Eastwood was a very good choice for directing in this film. In order to truly honor the life of Chris Kyle the direction of the picture can't be politically motivated. There are many directors in Hollywood who would have loaded it too message heavy. This film does exactly what it sets out to do and highlights the life of the man and his family. Out of respect for the family I feel a lot was left out about the end of his life. It's very hard to fight back tears at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>The real magic in this film is the performance given by Bradley Cooper. Cooper has been signed on to do this film since before Kyle's untimely death in 2012. Cooper briefly spoke with Kyle and met his family to get a feel for the role. Cooper is much smaller in comparison, so he put on nearly 40lbs to play the role. Along with the change in appearance his mannerisms and Texas accent are down to the proper detail. There are moments in the movie where you forget it's the A list actor Bradley Cooper. This is a career defining role that transcends the movie itself. With a dip of Copenhagen in his mouth, hat on backwards and Punisher emblem emblazoned on his armor, there is almost a superhero like quality to it all. And why not, here is a real life man who was the best at what he did, and he did it all for truth, justice and the American way. Like Batman or Superman Cooper's portrayal of Kyle is larger than life. I have no doubt the Academy will take notice of this performance.<br/><br/>If you liked this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"

","Such a beautiful film! Bradley Cooper was on a completely different level with this role. You could see every conflict he was faced with through his eyes and his breath. He embodied the character so well that you completely separate him from who he is playing. Im always astonished by the lengths an actor will go to portray their characters truthfully. The story itself was laid out extremely well and the final scene was chilling. I've seen almost every movie nominated this year and in my opinion, American Sniper deserves everything it is nominated for. Hopefully everyone sees that and it gets the reception it deserves!

All in all I would not recommend to watch this film. Even as a film without the political back story it sucks balls.It is an uninteresting blow out of proportion story that while it could have been a good story has been raped and bound to a point where the reality of the war has been obscured by the loving and supporting people back home who do not understand what happens there. And this movie which I hoped would have brought a better perspective to the war and the difficult choices soldiers have to make every day, has only let me down.

"Theo Robertson","7","28","54","29 March 2015"," Typical But Superior Example Of Eastwood's Work
","After seeing the extremely pornographic war porn of FURY I then decided to watch this movie which was not only multi-award winning but also has the somewhat shocking stat of being the biggest grossing war film unadjusted for inflation of all time . I had to double check the box office figures . It didn't exactly spend weeks and weeks at the top of the British box office film charts and didn't really garner the sort of critical acclaim it was getting in America . This is understandable though . Even the title featuring the words ""American"" and Sniper"" conjures up all sorts of visions of ethnocentric stereotypes of jingoistic rednecks from the good ole USA zapping bad men with brown screen and beards who are bad men simply because they've got guns , don't speak English and aren't American citizens where as the good guys have got guns , many have beards and simply the goodies because they are Americans . Add to this the predictable but understandable aspect that people have to bring their politics in to the arena and you notice people are simply voting either a 1 or a 10 for this film due to being against or for the invasion of Iraq . I resisted this and simply watched the film as someone who enjoys cinema <br/><br/>The truth as far as I can see it is it's neither the quasi-fascist propaganda piece nor the masterwork many people are claiming . What this film is a film by Clint Eastwood and one of his better ones . Now to be fair Eastwood isn't in my opinion an outstanding director . He doesn't have a unique noticeable style similar to Tim Burton , Martin Scorsese or many other directors but is a good at making character driven films devoid of any flashy gimmicks . Instead he keeps the camera relatively still and let's the performances carry the film . He also does his best at bringing an empathy to protagonists who at first glance who are unsympathetic characters which is probably what a film like this one needs in order for it to work . It is interesting the amount of pedantic minutiae some critics have gone in to such as Chris Kyle's motives for joining the Navy SEALs or his reaction towards shooting a woman and child but bare in mind you're watching a Hollywood and not a fly on the wall documentary . One thing that has been embellished is the long running duels between Kyle and enemy sniper Mustapha but this is no doubt to give a much needed structure to the narrative that's in danger of being disjointed and episodic <br/><br/>In short AS isn't a perfect film but is one of the better films to have been directed by Clint Eastwood . It is also one of the better films to have been released last year . Where it earns my respect is the fact that it is the biggest money earner from last year that saw the box office being totally dominated by fantasy and superhero movies and one genuinely hopes this might lead a mini revolution in Hollywood in to making serious and sombre films featuring real topics as their premise . I live in hope"

","Most of the negative reviews of this film are centred around the ""unjustified"" war in Iraq. However this entirely misses the point of the film. There is no statement one way or the other about Iraq apart from the most general ""war is hell"". Criticising the film on this point is like judging a cooking contest and complaining about the weather. Those harping on this are letting their own political biases skew their judgement.<br/><br/>Do I think the war in Iraq was unjustified? Yes. Deplorable American intervention which has directly led to the refugee crisis we are seeing today in Europe. But does this influence my appreciation of the story? No. This is a classic tale of a tragic hero. It doesn't matter if the hero is facing Nazi Germany, the North Vietnamese, the Persians or the Yankees; here you have a guy that was very good at his job and went beyond the call of duty to help his fellow warriors, both in the battlefield and later at home. The great tragic irony, which we feel throughout the movie as we know what happened in real life, is that he perishes at the hands of someone he was trying to help. Building up this tension and emotion is the film's master stroke.<br/><br/>Watch it again, without prejudice. Chris deserves your respect."

Oh And after one year famous American director Clint Eastwood has made this awesome movie about life of Chris Kyle, true American Hero. Well, Americans could be proud of their Country. In my mind he was brave man, protector of freedom not only of his country but also protector of this values like Freedom, Equel Rights, Free choice about religion and more different things. And for us, for Europe, thus values is important too. I don't want to start big discussion here, but terroristic groups on Middle-East don't think this values are right. They are killing people of America and people of Europe and that is because for me Chris Kyle is hero too. But if will not speak about all this global things anyway that is simple life story of one man and his family. Its a tragedy and story of brave heart and true love Movie is awesome.

"shadowyx12","8","22","41","4 March 2015"," American Sniper maybe a distortion of reality, but it will have you on the edge of your seat.
","DISCLAIMER No matter what anybody says, American Sniper is still propaganda at its core really well-made propaganda. It is my personal belief that no one movie (or anything for that matter) should ever have a significant impact on your beliefs or values. For example, anyone who claims to be knowledgeable about JFK's assassination because they saw Oliver Stone's JFK should probably be ignored. Be smart and do your own research. <br/><br/>I'm going to review American Sniper solely based on its merits as a film, and nothing more. <br/><br/>SHORT REVIEW:<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's direction is great as always (the film is incredibly realistic). Jason Hall's script suffers from a lot of pacing issues and weak character development. You'll really believe you're in the middle of battles as the editing and sound design are top-notch. Bradley Cooper is fine early on in the movie, but his performance gets better as his character's PTSD worsens.<br/><br/>VERDICT: See it in theatres if you can look pass the propaganda and blatant lies.<br/><br/>LONG REVIEW:<br/><br/>American Sniper will probably stand as one of the more memorable war films of this decade for years to come. Although this film is nowhere near the complexity and quality attributed to Letters from Iwo Jima (another Eastwood film), Eastwood still puts his best foot forward in recreating the streets of Iraq with as much intensity and realism as he did with the battlegrounds of Iwo Jima. Unfortunately, Hall's script prevents this film from reaching its prime as it suffers from severe pacing issues and weak character development for the supporting cast (even Sienna Miller's character seemed one dimensional). I also didn't like the fact that Hall played the 'child' card whenever he needed to raise the dramatic tension (although all these situations could have very well happened in real life) – it was just overdone and felt like a cheap trick after a while. <br/><br/>Despite this, I believe very few people will have any problems keeping track of the story's plot-points and who the central characters are. If there is one thing that Jason Hall can be applauded for, it would be the penultimate scene of this film.<br/><br/>Eastwood's regular team of collaborators (cinematographer Tom Stern, editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach, etc.) shows no shortage of effort in bringing their A-game to this film. As well, the sound department did an exceptional job in making me believe that the crew somehow managed to find a way to turn back time and shot the film as the Iraq War happening.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's performance as a young Chris Kyle eager to join the Iraq War is fine, but it gets progressively better as his character makes the rounds with each passing year. By the end, you no longer see an actor in combat gear – but instead, a father, husband, and soldier who has truly suffered the consequences of having participated in such a war. Although it would have been interesting to see another actor take on the role (Cooper wanted Chris Pratt), Cooper made a valiant effort in portraying Chris Kyle as a conflicted and sympathetic figure."

"Screen_Blitz","8","46","95","19 January 2015"," American Sniper is a powerfully riveting biopic assembled by the absorbing efforts by Clint Eastwood
","American Sniper is one of the most powerful war movies Hollywood has unleashed in recent years, as well as one of the most controversial. Concerning the one of America's most celebrated Navy Seals Chris Kyle, this movie offers an enthralling, if not masterful inside look on an American soldier who's been showered with endless respect for his duty in the Iraq War (like many soldiers who set out to fight overseas), while remaining a questionable figure by some of the public. Chris Kyle has varied in what many called a true American hero for his active duty, while condemned as a cold-blooded killer by others for his callous attitude towards Iraqis, at least what was described in his autobiography. Nonetheless, Hollywood mogul Clint Eastwood brings his appealing cinematic talent to the screen to this admired American figure to life in a riveting form. By no means in this biopic a masterpiece, but it firmly demonstrates true talent both in front and behind the camera. This film focuses on the true story of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), a U.S Navy Seal who garnered fame upon racking up over 150 confirmed skills during his duty in Iraq. The story follows Kyle during his four tours in Iraq and the struggles he faces back his Post- Traumatic Stress symptoms and the strain in his relationship with his family, particularly his wife Taya (played by Sienna Miller).<br/><br/>This movie is not the first time Clint Eastwood has tackled on the casualties of war. After all, he was the director behind 'Flags of Our Father' and 'Letters to Iwo Jima', both of focused on World War II in the Pacific Theater. This film however, sees Eastwood focusing on not an entire platoon trudging through the heat of a bloody battle, but a single figure who was forced to deal with the punishing horrors of war both on the battlefields and the psychological and emotional state of his character. The combat sequences set in the urban areas of Iraq are exuberantly shot and executed in a way that showcasing the sobering nature of active combat. Soldiers are brutally killed, and some of which we get to know very well. While the political complexities of the war are only thinly explored, Eastwood doesn't fail to show that war is hell. The scenes taking place off the battlefield is where most of the emotional resonance hits hard. As his active duty takes a toll on his wife who's disheartened by his physical and emotional absence, the story opens up a wider and brighter light on the complicated nature of Chris Kyle. In particularly, Kyle is brightened with a powerful performance by Bradley Cooper who fuels great fortitude and versatility in the role. While Eastwood makes the effort to portray the centric character as a hero, the controversy surrounding the man may give those who are less of a fan of him a cold shoulder, mainly due to some claims about his callousness towards the Iraqi mentioned in his autobiography. In the end, it is somewhat easy to see both sides of the argument of why he is respected by some and hated by others. <br/><br/>American Sniper is a powerful, riveting biopic that excels with the immersive talent of both Bradley Cooper and director Clint Eastwood. Like many war movies, this one hit hard, enough to have driven my friends and I to tears as we walked out of the theater. Although the patriotic tone of the story and the portrayal of the Iraqi may prove to be a bit too jingoistic for some, there is certainly some talent on and off the camera that deserves to be admired."

","American Sniper will split the audience in two (or maybe more) groups. Pacifist will see it totally different than people who were in a war or at least aren't totally against it. A biography of a young man, a sniper...he has to kill mothers and children...he becomes a father by himself and can't kill a kid that easy anymore...he wasn't able to protect all his fellow soldiers...he has to fight against a guilty conscience...against post-traumatic stress disorder. The film is often like the mission of a sniper. It happens nothing for a long time and you just wait for something...for some action. And then, all of a sudden you get more action than you can handle. Coincidence? If yes it's a weakness of the movie, because there are really boring parts...but if that's no coincidence, if they wanted to make a film about a sniper which is like the mission of a sniper...well, they did and it's brilliant."
"tonybertocchi","2","81","177","18 January 2015"," Sadly myopic and anachronistic
","So I saw American Sniper yesterday, I must say I wanted to like this film. I wanted to like it because while Clint Eastwood has been a part-time, chair-addressing GOP buffoon, at other times he has been a masterful director. The film sets up its polemic pretty quickly, and extremely bluntly. You can either be a sheep (of course a blind follower, and easy victim, and likely 90% of the world's people), a wolf, (pure evil, Al Quaeda), or a sheepdog (irrationally driven to kill the wolf and protect others with no questions asked, America, Navy seals, our hero). Over the course of the next two hours we watch how adherence to the need to kill the wolf slowly affects our titular hero Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper). My jury is still out on Cooper, and this film doesn't help. I think he approached some really good work in American Hustle, acting as a bad acting undercover agent. But it's hard to take some actors seriously when they have a large catalogue of teen comedies under their belt. Maybe he just hasn't had a chance to show whatever chops he might have by being able to show at least some internal turmoil in a film. Not that there shouldn't be a chance here, as the film recounts a sniper who over the course of four tours gains the rather ignominious reputation as the killing-est sniper ever. And as we watch him progress from playground attacks to from killing animals to picking off citizens, Eastwood and the writers keep hitting us on the head with the sheepdog metaphor. And this is the blunt part. However, such on-going carnage is certain to affect a guy – even our sheepdog, and he becomes withdrawn, and displays some vague PTSD symptoms. Things get worse when he almost kills the family dog. So we get it killing might be bad for you. And this part tries to be less blunt, but instead is a bit vague. However, herein lies the whole problem with the film. Eastwood, and the script (based on Kyle's own recollections) never allow this examination to stray beyond the central metaphor. And the question that needs to be, but is never asked screams throughout the entire film – that is – if you invade a country looking for made-up WMDs after somebody else bombed your big city, are you really a sheepdog, or merely a vengeance hound? And yet while Kyle slowly is affected by his massive bloodletting, he never questions the central metaphor, his place, and by extension, America's right to be the ""sheepdog"". So when children try to free their country with whatever means they have, he still murders them, absolutely guilt free. He murders and murders and murders and murders – never question the central existential premise of why am I here? In other words, he's an excellent robot for the kind of thinking the military tries to instill. And the film subtly, through omission, and through its devotion to Kyle, tries to underscore this same sensibility. And it is this that is most offensive about the film, even after 12 years and hopefully some clearer-eyed reflection, it still proudly beats its chest with the right of America to pretend to be a sheepdog (and anyone that questions that will meet the fangs of that hound). But should we be surprised? You can look up film titles with the name America or American in them. Over 200 exist. No other country even come close – no such hubris could possibly manifest itself, even in other patriotism-giddy places. One cannot imagine a film titled ""Scottish Sniper"", ""Nepali Grenadier"", ""Frenchman Fusilier"" or ""Lithuanian Artillery"", unless they were a comedy. The attachment of the national adjective, for the rest of the world makes us groan at such presumptive self-importance. But in its home market that adjective still breeds reverence. The notion of American exceptionalism - the unsubstantiated idea that America is 'different' and thus 'anointed' somehow for 'special' responsibilities and 'rights' to the rest of the world's business - is still consistently driving that culture, regardless of the growing greater body of evidence that it's based on lies, myth, and hokum. Kyle spews a short diatribe about it himself very early in the film, in a recruitment office. His boast is hilarious on its face, but ultra-creepy given the conviction he puts behind it. But perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. It is this same navel-gazing mixed with perpetual myopia that prevents Kyle from looking at his murders rationally, and by extension prevents Eastwood from seeing the 1,000,000 or so killed looking for phantoms WMDs that contextualize his film, and from 300 million from seeing that adjective as anything other than a fantasy of entitlement."

","You're instantly sucked it though you may be thrown back when it goes into the first flashback as your left on a cliffhanger which is only shown towards the end. It shows immense patriotism that majority of American's have but at a point leaves you questioning war due to actions like killing a child to save comrades and residents being stuck in-between and risked by US Forces and Militants thus the audience is forced to have a wider understanding in the complexity of war. Especially as both sides are essentially fighting for the same reason; 'what right'in their eye... When Kyle is able to shoot his target to save his comrades and 'an eye for an eye' the audience ends up rooting for Kyle to kill another being... at the very moment I realised I was rooting for another mans death and this was the time the audience is most empathetic with Kyle. When he returns home each time you see the change and growth in dehumanisation. The end foreshadowed Kyles death well.. It's truly sad to know its all true events."

","Three weeks into American Sniper's record-breaking release, you likely already have an opinion on the film, even if you haven't seen it. In a tweet, comedian Seth Rogen famously compared it to ""the movie that's showing in the third act ofInglourious Basterds,"" whereas documentarian Michael Moore called it a ""mess of a film."" The debate has largely focused on the portrayal of Chris Kyle, American Sniper's protagonist. Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall depict him as an ""anguished soul"" (in the words of author Max Blumenthal), torn between saving his country and the weight of deciding who deserves to die.<br/><br/>But the real-life Kyle was anything but tortured and morally conflicted. The Guardian's Lindy West (also a contributor at the Daily Dot) reminds us that Kyle was ""a racist who took pleasure in dehumanizing and killing brown people."" Kyle's only regret was that he didn't kill more."

","Usually Clint makes intelligent, well conceived and executed films. This is a major exception to that rule.<br/><br/>I am quite shocked at the degree to which American Nationalism seeps into the core of this film, and even more surprised it would be considered for an Academy Award. <br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the premise of the film, and the technical execution is great... it is what the plot does, and more what it does NOT do, which is such a disappointment.<br/><br/>The issue of America's appalling track record of interference and manipulation in Asia is well known and documented, but aside from a few subtle comments from minor characters in the movie, the presiding flavour is one of heroism and sacrifice. That, is offensive to most the people living on this planet, myself included.<br/><br/>The flag waving and conversation about ""em savages"" would all be well and good... IF it was done ironically, or to counterpoint the underlying message that a war like that is pointless, destructive, if not illegal. Those sentiments do not come across. There was no attempt to show the Iraqi people as normal people who just want to live their lives with their families, in peace. The only time we see an Iraqi family who show kindness to the American troops by offering them a meal, guess what? They turn out to be ""evildoers, terrorists, on the side of the bad guys.""<br/><br/>Awful, Mr Eastwood, seriously bad."

","Clint Eastwood adapts the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who had the most confirmed kills in the Iraq War. The film pretty much takes the same tack as The Hurt Locker in examining how war effects a man. There's obviously a lot more combat here than in Hurt Locker, and it's very much a war action movie. I didn't find it exploitative, though. Unlike the recent turd Fury, the combat sequences are intense, not ""fun."" The violence is wince-inducing, and you're just hoping to get through it. The film does question, just a little, the purpose of the war, but the protagonist never does. He never did. He was a soldier, and this was his job, to protect his men, and he was good at it. The film hinges on the performance of Bradley Cooper, and he is very good. Sienna Miller has the unfortunate role of the wife who worries and begs him to come back (all this material was done far better in The Hurt Locker)."

","NO FILM CAN be 100% realistic, no matter how carefully crafted, well intended or highly budgeted it may be. We believe that this effort makes the best possible representation of the serious business and unthinkable horrors of war to have been committed to the cinematic screen.<br/><br/>WE BELIEVE THAT it was U.S. Army General William Tecumseh Sherman who stated that ""War is Hell!"" in response to some critic's expressing some disdain for his ""scorched earth"" tactics during our Civil War. Combat is a kill or be killed proposition and there is no way of getting away from that. Regardless of whatever are the reasons for men being in harm's way, the brutal game is the same one that the enemy armies face each other.<br/><br/>IN THE DEVELOPMENT of this story on screen, Director, Mr. Clint Eastwood, opens with battle in Iraq in progress and introduces us to main character, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), a veteran of many an operation, already out in the field and protecting his fellow soldiers (Marines). Making great use of the flashback, we are given a biography of the young Chris Kyle and how his being raised in a rural Texas ranching community was so influential in his attitudes and his prowess with the rifle.<br/><br/>RECENT HISTORY IN both the U.S. and the World conspire to lead the young man from his role as a bucking bronco rider on the Rodeo Circuit to his decision to join the Navy Seals, following the atrocious events of September 11, 2001 ( 9/11). He meets and marries Debbie (Elise Robertson) and they have two kids, all during his active service and four tours in Iraq.<br/><br/>THE STORY BECOMES a sort of marathon of wills as Chris Kyle displays such devotion to duty that he is left with some very serious problems in readjusting. He does manage to repair his damaged psyche by assisting other veterans. His redemption in civilian life is based on his strong conviction for protecting and aiding his fellow man in battle.<br/><br/>AS FAR AS there being an ending of the story, it could not have been more contemporary, as the real Chris Kyle was killed by another veteran on February 2, 2013. This was a most ironic an end for someone who had undergone the dangers that he did, having done four tours in the Iraqi War. It is truly an example of ""Truth being Stranger than Fiction."" <br/><br/>WE KNOW THAT there are some who have discredited both the film; as well as the memory of Chris Kyle. That's very sad; because, although we do believe that all are entitled to their opinion, we must remind them that if it weren't for ""ordinary"" citizens like Chris, we wouldn't be able to be having this discussion right now. <br/><br/>THIS WAS NEVER more relevant a truth than it is today. Just take a look at the headlines on any given day. Remember that we in the USA are continually referred to as ""the Big Satan."" <br/><br/>JUST AS AN example of how different our time are from previous decades and past wars, just contrast the concerted effort that Hollywood made to snub American SNIPER at this year's Oscars with the accolades heaped on Gary Cooper's portrayal of the title character in SERGEANT YORK. Shame on you Hollywood! <br/><br/>AS FAR THIS attack on the men and women who serve our country in the Armed Forces, we are reminded of an Old German Proverb:<br/><br/>""If you want Peace, prepare for War."""
"bushidoie","10","25","48","15 February 2015"," Great film, somewhat tainted by political and philosophical perspectives
","I have to say, straight off the bat, I loved the acting in this movie. Bradley Cooper is excellent, completely different to any of his previous roles. There's a lot to be said for a film with the quality of acting on display, and I personally believe it deserves the awards it received.<br/><br/>Storyline: Very well done, the style and back-and-forth portrayal is really appropriate, I ended up feeling like the story was well- nurtured and that I really got a chance to get to know Chris Kyle throughout the movie. I hope the portrayal is true to the man.<br/><br/>Action: Excellent. Very well shot, fast-paced without being blurry or confusing, really crisp sniper shooting scenes, and tense moments, along with some big decisions that as a viewer I found myself ""along for the ride"" with.<br/><br/>Cons: The on screen rapport between Cooper and Miller feels a little forced at times. It's not a deal breaker though, it just doesn't feel like they have a great connection.<br/><br/>Overall feelings: Really enjoyed it. I'd definitely recommend the film to anyone who wants to see a good action film, with some strong human and moral elements. I sat entertained for the entirety of the movie, and I think Clint Eastwood has shown his ability to make a great movie yet again.<br/><br/>On an aside, I think anyone viewing this from the perspective of political or philosophical terms is really running the movie into the ground. It's a humanistic story, about an interesting and significant person, who you get invited to know throughout its telling. He deals with human issues and it shows you that journey. This isn't a film that stands on a pedestal and seeks to preach to people as to the ethical implications of war. It isn't trying to make a political statement, it's just telling a soldier's tale accurately. I'm not American and I don't feel any allegiance to the country or its actions or political stances, but I did greatly enjoy this story and the portrayal of the main character in it. I wouldn't agree with everything that character stands for or the things he would say or believe in, but regardless of that, he's a very real character and I appreciate that aspect.<br/><br/>I give the film 10/10 because its pacing was superb, it never drags, the action is great, and the acting is top-notch. A really great film that I'll definitely watch again in the future."

","I noticed a lot of the reviews say this is a war propaganda film... that it depicts Iraqis as bad people... that only mindless republicans will enjoy it. Well... i suppose if your a mindless democrat you may say that. A democrat that has no idea what REALLY went on. And Chris Kyle did not go around shooting ""innocent"" people. If i saw someone walking towards one of our convoys with a bomb strapped to them, I'd shoot their ass too. The Iraq war wasn't about oil or WMDs. It was about genocide and the thousands of innocent people that were murdered by Saddam Hussein. Not to mention it was a safe haven for terrorists. The majority of Iraqis killed deserved to die. The world is better off without them.<br/><br/>This movie was very genuine in regards to the Iraq war. It wasn't filmed in Iraq but the scenes made it feel almost like I was back over there. Yes it was trumped up a bit for Hollywood, but over all it was very well made.<br/><br/>Sorry you didn't like the movie... maybe you should go watch Boyhood or Fifty Shades of Grey instead."

","This film made me realise the value of life and that's why i want the two hours i spent watching it back. <br/><br/>The portrayal of the Iraq war is skewed, all background of how Al Qaeda first built strongholds in Iraq due to the power vacuum caused by the removal of Saddam Hussein is entirely overlooked as are the coalitions reasons for entering Iraq. Director Clint Eastwood uses glaring omissions to portray the idea that Al Qaeda insurgents linked with the 911 attacks were present in Iraq prior to the US's entry into the country, when in actual fact they only enters Iraq later and were at the time mostly based in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. <br/><br/>Politics aside the film was deeply flawed, the main character struck me as a small minded unlikeable bigot, which then in turn made me care very little about what happened to him. The whole situation was painted in black & white good versus bad rather than the shades of grey that are necessary for war pieces. Furthermore all of the patting on the back, boasting and lauding of a man based upon his supreme ability to kill other human beings, seemingly remorselessly sickened me throughout. Other problems were areas of predictable cliché poor pacing and repetitiveness. I usually enjoy bad films as they make me laugh, this one actually made me angry. To me it watched like a piece of trashy propaganda that felt like it had been commissioned by the fox network. I have never written a review or rated a film before but created an IMDb account just because i hated this film so unbelievably much.

"timbermisc","9","43","89","17 January 2015"," Tight, Elegant, Combat Scenes
","A story of the highly talented Seal Sniper Chris Kyle. This film avoids the complications of the political reasons America occupied Iraq. In its place, we follow the personal motivations of a young man who enjoys physical activity as a cowboy rodeo rider. His personal morality is summed up in just a few sentences: Don't be a bully. Don't be a victim. Be the protector that eliminates the bully. And so it logically follows that as a SEAL sniper he can practice what he preaches.<br/><br/>Kyle protects fellow Marines as they enter a war zone and do house to house searches. He has no qualms about killing anyone who is in the area to do harm to the Marines; and this includes women and children. While the viewer may blanch at the thought of killing children; please remember that these children are armed and used to destroy Marines in various ways. So far so good.<br/><br/>We follow Chris Kyle into his family life. Director Eastwood keeps the focus on the protagonist's Post Traumatic Stress. And Eastwood uses manipulative symbols to place the viewer in the shoes of Chris Kyle. Thus, I left the theater with a mild case of Post Traumatic Stress. Someone on the elevator said, ""What is that, there?"" and I freaked. I was still 'in the movie'; I was still in the war zone. When a movie does this to you, place you in the protagonist's position, it has elevated itself to a remarkable movie. I now understand Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. This movie is not entertainment. Rather, it is a journey in another person's life.<br/><br/>This movie has its references to the American Flag, yet it does not explore reasons why we are occupying other countries. It seems that American values such as the freedom to speak freely, to make personal decisions about religious choices; to make occupational career decisions freely; are enough justification to feel good about America.<br/><br/>Kyle is pictured as an honored legend, a protector of soldiers. He is not referred to as a ""hero"" in the movie. Certainly to volunteer for combat means he is placing his emotional life in the balance. And this movie follows him and displays the consequences of Post Combat Stress Syndrome. This means his memory will not let go of the combat environment which he has been in when he ""comes home"". <br/><br/>I have read many of the bad reviews of this movie. It seems that most of them are a personal try at propaganda making, exaggerated, emotional statements that roam from political views to moral views. These people simply damn Kyle for being a sniper. Yet, in Kyle's view, his conscious is clear. He is on a side, and he protects the soldiers of the side he is on. He does not return to the U.S. in any way confused as to his loyalties.<br/><br/>The elegance of these scenes has to do with Eastwood's direction and timing. He manipulates the viewer to live the stress, the wonder of combat in a sandstorm. Every scene follows logically and flows. <br/><br/>Is the movie simply a recruiting vehicle for the Navy? My answer is no. It shows the real life consequences for volunteering for war duty. To be propaganda, we would have to be placed in a state wherein we are making machine decisions using our emotions while the underlying facts are twisted. Since there is a great deal of discussion on IMDb, this discussion will make you ""immune to propaganda"" before you see the film. Discussion and free speech is what disables the propaganda machine. You won't be volunteering for duty tomorrow, or next week like a robot.<br/><br/>Is the movie true? Probably. The scenes are mostly ordinary incidents which are intensified by the fact that combat happened somewhere, sometime. You will follow Kyle's journey. This movie is not a Rambo movie. Kyle is never pictured making over the top advances towards the enemy. I recommend you see it."

In real life Chris killed more than 255 of the radicals and set an example of what is required to exterminate the evil whose only goal to kill the rest of us.

"jerryhooper99","10","28","55","22 February 2015"," Happy to offset a bad review - Spoiler Alert
","What is with all these negative reviews? I wonder if half of the reviewers even saw the movie or if they were paid to do a cheap shot micro-job here. Contrary to some of the reviews, I did not see how this movie glorified a man as a murderer. Didn't anyone see the uncertainty and anguish at times when our sniper had to do his job as a soldier? Did anyone notice his shift in attitude ending in a desire to go home? Did anyone see him shoot someone who was not trying to kill American soldiers? Do those bashing this movie remember the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein? We went to war with Iraq because we were aiding an ally and pushing his army out of Kuwait and back to Baghdad when diplomacy failed. Iraq was harboring Osama bin-Laden who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks on the US. Like it or not, the US felt justified in pushing into Iraq and looking for bin-Laden. <br/><br/>The negative critics want this movie to be about politics and murder when its a movie about one patriotic man who loved his country and was not afraid to die to keep terrorists off our soil. He was a man doing a job. The job was protecting his fellow soldiers from the enemy. It is a job well played by Bradley Cooper. I believe most soldier will tell you that they go to war for their country but they fight for their buddies. Chris Kyle did his job to protect his buddies and paid the price with PTSD-like symptoms. He was doing a job created by politicians. In the movie, many referred to him as a hero, but the character never felt that way about himself. If you don't like what he had to do, don't elect people who create the job for men like him. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie because it tells the story of how a man came to be the best at job that few can do and the heavy price he paid for that job. Is it historically accurate? Name a movie that doesn't take liberties. Does it tell Chris Kyle's whole story? Of course not, how do you boil down 38 years into two hours? This movie focuses on the pressures, pains and consequences of being an American Sniper. That's what this movie is about and Clint Eastwood did a masterful job making this a movie about the business of war which is never pleasant or pretty but is always necessary thanks to the human condition."
"kailomonkey","10","28","55","16 February 2015"," what issues really challenge America's deadliest sniper
","Before anything else... Why are all of the first 10 reviews 1 star reviews? It looks like a deliberate sabotage when comparing to the 7.5/10 average rating and coats the first page of reviews. Moving on from this but not entirely I would like to address criticisms of the film in general and try to explore why I liked it.<br/><br/>To start then, I liked this movie! I hate masculine bravado action movies, badly scripted family back story and promoters of popular racism against (currently) Arabs. This movie is none of those things! I'm not a great fan of American patriotism either, especially when used to make a black and white us and them. And this movie isn't those things either. In fact if you're looking for that junk here you may well be disappointed. So why have some critics claimed it is some or all these things?<br/><br/>Well the film is called American Sniper for a reason: It's about a very patriotic sounding Texan man who does say why he wants to go to war. And what do most soldiers (I imagine) have for reason to go to war if not to protect their own. But that isn't what the movie itself SAYS. It portrays it sure but very gently when compared to some other super macho charged action war films. But that's not all. Even the very ""American"" sniper isn't an Arad hating macho man. (spoilers) The film shows him learning his root purpose for protecting sheep from wolves as a sheep dog, from his father, and this is only the base of his morals to protect and not take advantage, not a direct illustration of his views by race, as we see in every situation where he has to make the call to kill or not to kill. Yes there is a clerical side to making the right call, but throughout the film we're given the impression that behind his default patriotic mask of answers, he's covering the great humanity he holds and trouble he has with what he does, despite holding true to his dedication to protecting American lives, which is his job and a conflicted result of his development of purpose.<br/><br/>He's dealing with complex psychological challenges, but he's ""dealing"" with it the way most do, by ignoring it. Which I guess is why some people missed it. I did find the sudden escalation of his exhibiting signs of trauma nearer the conclusion a little off, and yes as a theme the PTSD side of war could have been explored more, but actually showing it so underlying was far better. I might like to have also seen more of the war widow angle but one film can only do so much. This one stuck to ""the legend"" as the human and, I think, perfectly illustrated the biography.<br/><br/>The family side was completely real, not another forced back story. The film moved well and wasn't off putting to watch despite some stark, unsettling subjects. The climax and continuation didn't sit perfectly as a typical movie but that's reality for you, it ain't always like in the movies. And yet they did throw in some extra elements to moviefy it (blame Spielberg for that apparently, who had the direction originally) but Clint keeps them in check and does things well in every aspect.<br/><br/>I can't really fault this movie. That said it might not be for you if you're sharply on either side of war opinion. If you want a macho Arab killing frenzy, it's not here. If you want a patriotism is scum message, it's not here either. If you want to see a human destined into the middle of such a world that shines a little light onto some of the issues that really challenge America's deadliest sniper. Take a look."

","I didn't know the story Chris Kyle before the movie was made. I've since heard a few things about him and one of the most frequent things I've read is that the reason he had so many recorded kills was because he went out of his way to do so. Regardless of whether this is true or not, it doesn't take away from this movie. This is a top five war movie in my eyes of all time. It doesn't just concentrate on the war part but on his family and home life as well. It's that conflict for him that's so compelling on screen.<br/><br/>His first kill isn't how he envisioned it and maybe that changes him and takes him on this ride of emotions through his four tours. While at home, he's very on edge and his wife can tell he's changed. All he wants to do is go back, fight and protect our country. Not thinking of the consequences he's leaving behind at home with his family.<br/><br/>The action scenes are tense and fascinating to watch. Especially the last gun fight that ensues after he does something not many people in this world can do. I was hooked from beginning to end and it was an unfortunate and tragic ending. If you don't know what happened to him, I suggest you read up on it. A solid 9/10."

","Another outstanding accomplishment by Mr. Eastwood. There is definitely no candy-coating in this account. People either like Clint Eastwood, or they do not – I happen to be one of his fans. I also think Bradley Cooper did a very fine job portraying Navy SEAL, Chief Kyle. (Subliminal suggestion – A-Team II) Hell the entire cast did an awesome job. All of these people were superb. Oh, and by the way – why didn't that guy, Kevin Lacz, get a nomination? Some of the finest acting I have ever witnessed – just saying. <br/><br/>I like how Clint took a real script and a real story and put it up on the big screen. Granted, time constraints always limit what is and is not displayed - I think (or hope) most people know that. I also understand many will not get it, and I doubt they ever will. The dead giveaways are the immediate references or comparisons to other movies; or ideologues blaming the 'other side'; or those blindly blaming brave individuals and conveniently omitting their politicians, etc. it's pretty easy to tell. This man did his job (like many who are lost in forgotten lands, far-far away.) He was a Navy SEAL; very professional and I assume the missions caught up to him. I am not a combat related PTSD professional, but what these veterans suffer through has to be horrible. <br/><br/>There is also a question of the whether this guy should be referred to as a 'Hero.' Some very, very, very, very fat people have posed this question (they seem to think it is a very easy job – like eating a jelly donut - maybe?) Fair enough. You are a Marine patrolling very hostile territory. You are given a choices for your heroes. You have a pretend superhero who can leap tall buildings, is faster than bullets and is really powerful; or you have a pretend one with a cowl, a fancy car and utility belt; or you have a real person who happens to be very dependable and a very effective sniper...or...maybe that donut will protect you. <br/><br/>You don't have to rack your brains thinking about the answer – ask a Marine (or any military personnel from any country). If you are surprised at all by the answer – how in the hell did you manage to read this far into my review? <br/><br/>(Sarcasm) I am somewhat offended at the Academy Award Committee for rudely considering this masterpiece for anything. Apparently, 'American Sniper's' emotional depth is too deep, enabling it to effortlessly navigate beneath the committee's hubris-fed puerility, which has been repositioning superficiality over quality for quite some time. This movie probably should not have won 'Best Picture' - fine, but some pointless bird-movie. <br/><br/>The story of Chief Kyle is pretty amazing. All these men and women defending our country are pretty amazing people. As a 20 year vet myself, I am glad that this story is out there, and I thank those who put it together.

","In 2002 President George W. Bush said in a speech that the leader of Iraq Saddam Hussein was connected to the attacks in the US on 9/11/2001 that killed over 3000 people.<br/><br/>The reason for attacking Iraq changed several times in an attempt to justify a war Bush had talked up since the day he took office including WMD's (that were never found), and saving the people of Iraq because Hussein was killing his own citizens (which happened ten years earlier)<br/><br/>We were told the US would be seen as liberators and ""welcomed as heroes"" by every high ranking US official.<br/><br/>We of course now know all this was a complete lie.<br/><br/>Now picture this: A film about a German sniper in WW2 who is full of the patriotic stuff of god and country, breaking a record for killing Polish civilians who dared to fight back against an invading army who took over their country for no apparent reason. This soldier is patted on the back for killing children and women and touted as a hero. He has no remorse and even says he enjoys what he's doing.<br/><br/>That wouldn't be such a pleasant film would it? But what if we added that the German had a wife at home who loved him and a baby on the way? What if he had a younger brother who was in the war too that he could worry about? What about a scene where another German soldier thanked him for saving his life back in Poland?<br/><br/>This would be a great film, for a propaganda piece in 1942 but today, to anyone who is not blindly patriotic and full of the hatred of all things Muslim it comes off as cruel and out of touch.<br/><br/>In the film the Iraqi ""insurgents"", who would be known as ""patriots"" in Poland during WW2 are portrayed as all being ultimately corrupt because they don't welcome their invaders with open arms and help them kill their own friends and families. They are called evil and savages because they just don't get that Americans are there to somehow help them by destroying their country.<br/><br/>We are supposed to feel sorry for him later when he develops a conscience of sorts although never admits he was part of a crime.<br/><br/>Kyle was well known for his outright lies about his life including his claim that he killed 30 Americans in New Orleans during Katrina from the Superdome's roof, killing two men who tried to steal his car and of course knocking out Jesse Ventura in a bar. That last lie cost his estate $1.8 million dollars after his death. <br/><br/>In the end Kyle is killed on a firing range, shot down by a fellow soldier much in the way he killed 160 people in Iraq.<br/><br/>He is hailed as a hero, with flags waving and lots of tears, but I wonder if his name was Matthäus Hetzenauer instead of Chris Kyle would we feel the same?<br/><br/>""I couldn't give a flying F about the Iraqis."" ""I hate the damn savages"" said Kyle in his autobiography."

","Clint Eastwood was in top form for American Sniper, his 34th feature film as director. An Oscar nomination for Best Director would have made very good sense to me. At 84 years old, the man should be an inspiration to geriatrics the world over and the rest of us who hope to live that long. And who better to take a page out of Quentin Tarantino's book by using a great old Ennio Morricone tune? <br/><br/>Neither the perilous hell of battle nor the depths of human wickedness have been more powerfully and realistically depicted in my cinematic experience. Furthermore, they dutifully honor Chris Kyle's perspective without it being a pro-Iraq War propaganda piece. It is a skillful balancing act for what is not a political film per se. To say that the film needed an anti-war agenda is tantamount to saying that it would have been better if only they had disrespected the man's memory. Though I myself do not approve of the Iraq War, it is not in black and white terms. I much prefer a challenging, thought-provoking film to an anti-war spoon-feeding.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper seems to take nothing for granted by giving his all to one good role after another. The part of Chris Kyle is his most demanding and transformative. I have liked him in many roles and have long understood him to be a real go-getter and capable actor, but this one stands out as a remarkable achievement. It is one of the better performances that I have ever seen. He insisted on achieving believability and succeeded beyond doubt.<br/><br/>There is so much I like about the film that I almost feel like I am pawing in the dark to criticize it. However, another early scene developing the relationship between Kyle and his wife Taya would have been appreciated. Well, that and a preposterous fake baby that I hesitate to mention since I was fooled by it in the theater. But I figure almost everyone who reads this review will have already seen the film.<br/><br/>Snipers have a way of captivating the mind and are therefore good film subjects. It is the precise art of marksmanship, the idea of playing God, their strategic importance in warfare, and as the makers of this film understand in spades by having included a sharpshooting adversary named Mustafa, the idea of the hunter being hunted.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle risked his life over four tours and roughly 1,000 days in order to protect his fellow soldiers. This was courageous and he is an American hero, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. He is a hero to all people who support an aggressive stance against the enemies of civilization. He had a real and important job to do and did it exceptionally well. This much should be agreeable to anyone in their right mind, however ill-conceived they consider the war. Nevertheless, I have observed a moron explosion in response to the film and fueled by the marvelous success of it. I regret to see such one-note, mouth-breathing opposition to the war in lieu of measured arguments. Snipers also have a way of stirring up emotions."

","Synopsis: A good guy goes on a 10 year killing spree in which bad men, women and children ""make his day"" while a nation rejoices.<br/><br/>Verdict: I'm afraid my expectations were far too high going into this. First, the reviews were too good to be true. Second, Eastwood has excelled at handling violence and the impact on men in Unforgiven, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. He's also managed to portray both sides of a conflict fairly. American Sniper fails to do any of that. It is a very simplistic film that moves from scene to scene propelled by cliché and jingoism. Thus, it seems like it was made-for-TV.<br/><br/>Sienna Miller - why are people praising her performance? The only thing she's done here is an average job, which I guess is a huge step up for her. Bradley Cooper does a fine job, I thought. Eastwood completely bungles the ending with an awkward - almost absurd - scene followed by news reel footage that feels tacked on.<br/><br/>People have claimed that Chris Kyle was no hero. That is unfortunate, but what ""hero"" is perfect? Somewhere out there is a far better, more balanced film waiting to be made - perhaps a documentary. This is NOT that film - nor is it as good as other sniper cinema, such as Enemy at the Gates, or even Sniper. American Sniper is my choice for the most overrated film of 2014."

","The only kind of people who dislike ""American Sniper"" are Leftist scum or Islamo-fascist sympathizers. I urge one and all in the decent human being world to go see it. What they will find is both an exciting war movie combined with a very human story of a life well-lived; a true American hero in every sense of the word. Chris Kyle embodied all that is best about America: courage, honor, commitment to duty, love of family. It is little wonder that this film is smashing box office records not only here but around the world. The tone is just about perfect, throughout the movie. This is due to Clint Eastwood's excellent directing. It is quite refreshing that a real American hero - not one of Hollywood's phony PC cutouts - and his time serving his country and struggles and triumphs at home are the subject of an epic such as this one. The only ""controversy"" is a contrived one by the liberal media and the scumbag American Left. Again, I cannot recommend this movie enough."
"darraghmurphy777","8","41","85","21 January 2015"," Good film, unfairly judged.
","Having not read American Sniper the book, I have to take this film at face value and I have found it to be a good film which is being unfairly hounded in the media and even on here on IMDb.<br/><br/>I have seen in many outlets this film is being slated as over-the-top pro American, anti-Muslim and as glorifying the war and depicting all Iraqis as terrorists. I think this is a very harsh judgment. There are elements of that (not nearly as bad as I was lead to believe) but we must remember that we are telling one man's true story here. If these are his experiences and those are his views then it is not unreasonable to depict them.<br/><br/>From the criticism I had heard before seeing this movie, I was half expecting a Die Hard style film where Cooper kills all the bad guys while shouting some bad a** catch phrase and saving the day. Instead it shows a sniper who (to me) seemed to take no glory in killing or his title as America's most lethal sniper. He has a simple pride that he was doing his job well and that every life he took meant saving the life of at least one of his fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>Having not read the book, I can't say if Clint Eastwood was being unfairly selective in what he chose to include in the movie, but if this is how it happened, who are we to judge? You may not agree with the war itself (I don't) but this is not the place for such debate. <br/><br/>The film itself was solid. Bradley Cooper did a great job in becoming Chris Kyle. There were moments of good action, serious drama, and couple of laughs for good measure. There was a good balance between ""action"" in Iraq and life at home showing the family drama and personal struggle while trying to settle back in to normal life.<br/><br/>This might not get my vote for the best picture Oscar but it is a good movie that does not deserve all the negative press it is getting. Ultimately I think people will have to make up their own minds on this one, just don't be swayed by anything you might hear before seeing it."

","I hardly take the time to review movies, but I had to review this movie...I watched American Sniper in the very front row of the movie theater because it was sold out and we had a large group. I had a headache, felt nauseous, and my eyes hurt from sitting that close....and this movie was worth all of it. I was so sincerely moved by this movie and the acting was incredible. I can't even understand the negative reviews from some people. I was reading someone's review complaining about how this was like all the other war movies like the Hurt Locker. This statement is false. This movie was based about a specific Navy SEAL's life. Do you know how many movies there are about football or sports? Do you know how many movies there are about superheros? Just because there are many movies made about similar topics, doesn't mean that it's the same and doesn't mean that they aren't all unique and great in there own way. This movie made me want to know more about Chris Kyle and made me understand a little bit better about how much our soldiers sacrifice and how much the war affects them. Bradley Cooper was amazing in this movie. I think this was his best role yet. He was so believable. Clint Eastwood has done it again...He is such a talented director. This was one of the best movies of the year."

","Struck by a vast amount of ignorance, boy, it did cost me to watch this movie until the end. How is it possible that the main character, a mass murderer, is portrayed as a national hero? I mean, this is a kind of realistic Iraq war environment, a story based on memoirs, not a SF movie. Incredible that this movie follows the same simpletons way of 'thinking' that led to the very war, repeated behaviour that in fact contributed hugely to current Muslim hate and terrorism all over the world. How can it be so uncritically blind? It represents a macho wicked-Christian extreme right white dominant autistic oversimplified view of the world. No questions raised between 9/11 and the attack on Iraq, a country which had nothing to do with 9/11 whatsoever. No, our hero marches on to kill the ""savages"" (all Iraqis, who didn't ask for an American invasion), because it is his patriotic and religious duty and honor. Well, we evolved from apes a long time ago, but Clint Eastwood is still in denial... still the cowboy who believes the Indians are wild godless people who we should exterminate, and proud of it. So actually I should give the movie 10 points instead of 1 as it is very instructive, it shows us the way of (non) thinking which led to so much destruction and turmoil. O sorry, I didn't mention his cliché family yet, a sobbing wife, indoctrinated child and the sniper trauma. Well, I fear the movie will be praised by no few people who possess the same quality as the movie: mindless. So 1 point (0 is not available, alas)."
"mattdav-91523","10","27","53","7 March 2015"," Masterpiece Misunderstood.
","When I saw the horrible reviews this was getting I had to write something. This movie is amazing, and clearly people are taking it as an attack when it has been written and shot in the eyes of the main character (Chris Kyle) It isn't glorifying war, or ""attacking Iraqis"". It is simply telling a story (Based on a book which is based off a true story) through the eyes of this certain American. Clearly people are misunderstanding the films views and taking offence, to then call this movie stupid and then labelling all Americans as stupid - is kind of ironic. (By the way I'm Australian) Okay now that that is out the way and we are now on a neutral page the review. The movie shows an American with a skill of a sniper going into war and how it affects him and his family. The toll it takes not only on his mental side but everyone around him. The character development is amazing and the movie is well directed and acted to deliver this. The story has a medium to fast pace and i got quite involved in the characters very short on. I rate it a 8.5/10 but it was getting so many stupid 1's that i felt the need to rate higher. It needs to be watched with an open mind and taken from a view point and not a previous stand point on war and soldiers. It is a war film so it isn't going to be pretty or for everyone."
"adrian-m-miller","3","78","173","8 January 2015"," Conflicted Going In
","I have to admit that i was conflicted going in to this one...i had read the book when it came out, and it left a very bad taste in my mouth. So for me watching the film was mostly an exercise to see what if any of the character of Mr Kyle would come out, because in the book, at least i was left not liking the man a whole lot.<br/><br/>The film...it cant possibly cover the material in the book in linear fashion, but would it tread the correct line and balance between the tours and killing and family life back home? Did it attempt to? Did it manage to? The answer on that is no. The film is primarily an action film with cutaways...thats been done before i hear you say, yes but the cutaway scenes lack any semblance of background set up, context or any real sense of satisfying displays of human interaction. Even the birth of his children is, to me, dealt with on an almost cursory level and like every other non-action subject secondary to the killing.<br/><br/>Did Mr Eastwood leave in some the objectionable parts of Mr Kyles personality, such as referring to inhabitants of the countries he served as ""savages"" and references to wanting to have killed more...yes. One wonders if this is what you hope it to be, balance and faithfully representative of the man, or an endorsement of those narrow minded views. Having seen Mr Eastwoods other films, particularly Gran Torino, where racial epithets were thrown left and right, in context i must say, making it the hardest to watch of any of his films (the first time around at least), and in the hands of any other director would have been incendiary, i choose to believe that the less attractive sides of Mr Kyles views were left in due to balance and and faithful representation.<br/><br/>There was a lot of license taken in the film as to locations of activity and the whole enemy sniper arc, Mr Kyle never killed the enemy sniper who's story is portrayed in the film. This alone is a disappointing event in what is based on his autobiography. That is the biggest plot hole though.<br/><br/>As to the actors, there's no faulting them, Bradley Cooper is solid and transfixing in this role. He almost made me forget about the flawed man he was portraying. And this is where we get the to the man behind the film and his flaws.<br/><br/>The actors are the only reason i rated it a 3.<br/><br/>Since this is based on an autobiography i feel its fair comment to address the person on which this is based.<br/><br/>This will no doubt be the longest part of this post, but i feel its important to address.<br/><br/>As i said, i read the book when it came out. Having been in the long range shot business myself in my countries service, i was aware of his reported feats and grabbed the book when it came out. It promised to be the best read about sniping since the books of the exploits of Gunnery Sergeant Hathcock, whos shadow looms large over anyone who has ever peered through a scoped rifle.<br/><br/>What started with high hopes and at times bordered on respect for the craft was quickly overpowered by the sense that this man was a sociopath who disliked anyone not draped in red white and blue, and that he had a bloodlust often expressing the wish he had killed more. The language in which he expressed his utter lack of willingness to view inhabitants of the countries he served as anything less than ""savages"" was just the start.<br/><br/>I know from my own experience when enlisting that, under the system in my country, Mr Kyle would have been weeded out as a potential sociopath or undesirable via the psych eval during the process to enlist, or if displayed at any point thereafter. And thats just basic admission, not officer candidate enlistment. My country has, i must say, a different process of enlistment, where it is more discerning about who gets through , when i was enlisting 25 years ago, i knew people who were having to repeat the last grade of highschool to improve grades to be accepted or to perhaps mature a bit more. During basic i saw more than few people shown the door as they seemed only interested in being in with the sole purpose of killing people, or on other occasions using colloquial derogatory terms to describe inhabitants of foreign countries. Those people were weeded out, never to set foot on foreign soil to represent their views wearing the badge of our nation, and im glad of it.<br/><br/>You can however end up with people like Mr Kyle, who loathed and reduced those who he faced on the battlefield to the level of referring to as savages, and with a hatred that transcends the fog of war and exposes a vein of both racism and ideological rejection.<br/><br/>Mr Kyle says in his book (and is paraphrased in the movie as saying) that he doesn't give a f@@# about the Iraqi people. Having served with, and know many of my countrymen who have served overseas, this is a strong component of their service, to improve the lives of the non-combatants of the countries they serve in. There's no hint of that from Mr Kyles own lips. This is for me the sign of a confirmed sociopath.<br/><br/>Where im not conflicted is finding out only at the end of the film that he was killed by someone with suspected PTSD, someone he was reportedly trying to help. No child should have the grow up without their father. My honest condolences go out to them especially on the loss of their father, who made it home, only to be taken miles from it."

"LloydBayer","8","37","76","21 January 2015"," Made with palm-sweating tension and based on a real life military sniper, this is Clint Eastwood's best war movie in a long time.
","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's second 2014 film (after Jersey Boys) and the best we have seen from this veteran film director in years. Contextually, this film looks and feels like 2008's Academy Award winning Best Picture, The Hurt Locker, but with Eastwood's deft storytelling, American Sniper is equally Entertaining and thrilling, yet dramatic and tragic, and wrung with palm-sweating tension throughout. <br/><br/>Based on memoirs of the highly decorated US military sniper, Chris Kyle, the film opens in Iraq in 2003, and sets the tone for the rest of the film. Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is in prone position on a rooftop, rifle in hand, and tasked with over watch as an infantry unit kick down doors in search of insurgents. He sees a woman and child approaching the unit but must make a split-second decision on whether they pose a threat to his fellow soldiers down below. His spotter reminds him that he could ""fry"" if he kills an innocent woman and child. His gut tells him otherwise. Just when his finger is wrapped around the trigger and ready to squeeze, we are taken back on a 25-minute flashback. We see him raised in a conservative Texan family, then through rigorous Navy SEAL training, and then courtship, marriage and parenthood. It's a vital segment that makes us want to care about him and the decision he is about to make. It is also where we learn Kyle's three main priorities – God, Country, Family – values that would go on to make him a ""Legend"".<br/><br/>It takes four tours of Iraq and 160 confirmed kills to earn that proclamation but we don't get to see as many kill shots. Between taut firefights in Iraq and coping with the anxiety of his wife (Sienna Miller) in Texas, we get hard-wired into Kyle's psyche thanks to a career-best performance from a bulked-up Bradley Cooper. After Academy Award nominations in Silver Linings Playbook and last year's American Hustle, Cooper is on a hat-trick and this is definitely a side of him we have never seen before. Miller, on the other hand, gets to portray the wife of a soldier and she delivers with seasoned skill, but these scenes are too few and short for a screenplay intended to venerate a war hero. And how it does! With about 90 percent of the screen time dedicated to Kyle, we are given a complex character study of an individual tasked with preserving or taking life. Unlike other war films where soldiers kill counterparts 'in the line of duty', Cooper's Kyle often finds himself wrestling with an almost obsessive compulsive disorder but one that ensures his wife and kids remain free and safe in the motherland. However, the ramifications are close behind. As much as Kyle is revered by his peers and commanding officers, the price on his head swells, and so does his reputation amongst insurgents as ""The Devil of Ramdi"". <br/><br/>In the wrong hands, American Sniper could have been misconstrued as American propaganda. Look no further than Peter Berg's The Kingdom, a right-wing hoopla that literally screams ""us versus them"". Instead, 84-year-old Eastwood shows restrain for political subletting, especially given recent headlines on the on-going ""war on terror"", by telling a well-knit story of courage, determination and patriotism. Not since his very own WWII double-feature, Letters From Iwo Jima, and Flags of Our Fathers (both in 2006), has Eastwood been so confident and controversial in an action film. Dusty, smoky, war torn Iraq feels authentic and that's before some frantic gunfights reserved for the many action sequences. While action scenes can get quite heavy and violent, at times it feels like a portion of a first-person-shooter video game. Then again, American Sniper is all about Chris Kyle, his POV, and why the US military could benefit from more soldiers like him. Towards the end, one scene has Kyle pull off a near impossible shot with utmost precision. It's one of several reasons why Kyle will always be known as ""The deadliest sniper in US military history""."
"DareDevilKid","9","40","83","7 February 2015"," A Great War Film that Beautifully Merges Heart, Courage, Patriotism, Duty, Passion, Family, Reality, and the Horrors of War
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.3/5 stars<br/><br/>Powered by Clint Eastwood's sure-handed direction and a gripping central performance from Bradley Cooper, ""American Sniper"" delivers a tense, vivid tribute to its real-life subject. Director Clint Eastwood has crafted his best film in nearly a decade, as he fully captures the horrors of war and the brave men who put their lives on the line to defend our country. What's truly amazing about Eastwood's direction is that without resorting to any form of hagiography – something that could have easily crept and possibly been forgiven in a subject and theme like this – he triumphs with a measured, morally complex, and utterly gripping snapshot of what war can do to the men who fight it. Our old-horse auteur is less concerned with action heroism than the consequences of deadly action, and how it chips away at the fabric of the living. Still, whenever they transpire – and that's more than a few times – the action sequences are edge-of-your-seat stuff – Eastwood, a veteran exponent of action, especially gunfights, since his acting days, once again teams with his long-time collaborators to deliver some of the best-edited (in terms of both video and sound), masterfully handed combat scenes assembled in a war film.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was nothing more than a Texan man who wanted to become a cowboy, but in his thirties he found out that maybe his life needed something different, something where he could express his real talent, something that could help America in its fight against terrorism. So he joins the Navy SEALs to become a sniper, and ends up being heralded as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. Soon after marrying his sweetheart Taya (Sienna Miller), Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield, and as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname ""Legend"". However, his reputation also grows behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head,and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to ""leave no man behind."" But upon returning home, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.<br/><br/>Irrespective of whether you're American or not, any self-respecting national can feel for their soldiers through Cooper's evocative, nuanced performance, and Eastwood's assured hand while dealing with a topic of such sensitivity and complexity. We literally get to feel Kyle's detachment and disorientation, as Cooper – in his finest performance yet – fully embodies Kyle and the PSTD he deals with, and we quietly cheer as he gradually tries to overcome it in his own uniquely patriotic way – one where he finally manages to strike a balance between his family and the inherent, overwhelming desire to perpetually serve his country and fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is slowly but surely amassing an enviable, versatile filmography slate, garnished with star turnovers in wholesomely- entertaining blockbusters, and memorable performances in universally-loved and widely-applauded films of award-worthy stature. Three Oscar nominations in as many years, and a string of hits – from the first ""Hangover"" movie (I thought the third one was quite good too, though the sophomore entry just passed muster) to the underrate thriller ""Limitless"" to one of the most brilliantly constructed cinematic heists to his voice-over in one of the most exalted superhero films of all time to his most recent effort (even his serious dramas like ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and this one make money) – are all the proof you need of his perennially rising status as one of Hollywood's most revered actors and box-office draws. Yet, Bradley Cooper isn't the first actor you'd consider for such a macho role, making the impact of this portrayal more remarkable. The word ""transformative"" is tossed at Steve Carell's role in ""Foxcatcher"", which is largely latex makeup. Cooper's is a more complete transformation, with convincing Texas swagger and twang, packing an extra 40 pounds of muscle, and plumbing new dramatic depths. His performance is precision personified – from the mannerisms to the accent to the gradations of Kyle's character, personality, and trauma. If this isn't exactly the man Chris Kyle was, it sure as hell is one indelible movie character.<br/><br/>Eastwood reprises that Old West melancholy in ""American Sniper"" with New West warfare in Iraq, extending the killing to enemy women and children, if necessary. Eastwood's sympathy for Chris Kyle (and his increasingly frightened and frustrated wife, brilliantly played by a career-best act from Sienna Miller) is palpable. Kyle is justifiably portrayed as a true American hero with an overriding almost desperate need to ""serve his country"" over everything else in his life. At a famous concert in 1969, country music figurehead, Johnny Cash, called himself a ""dove with claws"" when it came to his stance on The Vietnam War – basically claiming to be an anti-war proponent without giving over to all of the gushy, hugging, New Age palaver that's supposed to come with it. It's an evocative term that could also – on the evidence of his new film – be applied to director, Clint Eastwood. In this bold, in-your-face, true-life drama, he bristles unhesitatingly at the horrors of war, but is metaphorically in the trenches with its soldiers, passing them ammo and lighting their cigarettes.<br/><br/>The tragic irony of Chris Kyle' death – shot by a disturbed, fellow soldier he was trying to help once back home – suits his legacy at a profound level; that death came from thin air, when least expected. It's a hell of a thing."

","American Sniper is,in my humble opinion,alongside with ""The Imitation Game"", the best biopic of the year. Clin Eastwood and Bradley Cooper team up and bring us a good film, well filmed, with good performances (Cooper is particularly excellent; Sienna Miller is also making a name for her,she is almost unrecognizable) and a strong and coese story based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle,the man who is named the most lethal sniper in the history of US. Although all its virtues, American Sniper is a linear forward driven film. It lacks some more deep exploration of the human relations. Don't get me wrong, Kyle's relationship with his spouse Taya is well explored but, some characters, namely his brother Jeff aren't too explored and there isn't too much depth in their relations with the main protagonist. In the beginning of pre-production, Steven Spielberg was attached to direct, but then Eastwood stepped in. Well,not depreciating Eastwood, I think that Spielberg would have given that depth and would have helped to make this film something bigger. In spite of all that, the film is worth watching and the Oscar Nominations talk for themselves. When I left the theater one question echoed in my mind : What is the movie message? Go to war? Is War a demonstration of power and strength? Of course it is. Do not go to war?War is the worst human creation. Well, I think that Eastwood didn't want this to be a Pro-War movie, he wanted to depict the horrors of the war seen by a Sniper perspective. However, in the end, the message was not that straight. It was standing on that thin line. This happened because of the portray of Kyle. In the end, he was a patriot fighting for his country. He wasn 't a neutral person. I really believe that the message wasn't a Pro-War one, but, shamefully, it wasn't a Anti-War one either. That's because Chris Kyle can be considered a war hero by some, and at the same time, a cold blooded murdered by others. He lived is life in the grey zone. Because life isn't just made of black and white."
"michael_sutherland","8","30","60","21 January 2015"," An American Sniper
","Clint Eastwood is a patriotic man. Whether he's politically involved with social issues, making films like Heartbreak Ridge and Flags of Our Fathers, or condescending to an empty chair in front of a crowd, Clint has shown his love for this country. His film, American Sniper, shows his love for an individual who deserves much more recognition than some talentless celebrity with a fat ass (take your pick). Though based on a book, Eastwood honours Chris Kyle's memory by making a good film that doesn't teeter-totter with political b.s. This movie has an almost claustrophobic feel to it, in that the camera is close to Bradley Cooper's (The A-Team) face for a lot of the film. What works with that perspective, is that you can see the emotional toll that it takes on Cooper as he disconnects more and more throughout this movie. Cooper does it right. Long before the film is over, you forget that you're watching the jerk from The Wedding Crashers, and you see more than just a character on the screen. His wife in the film, played by Sienna Miller (G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra), is the only other actor in the film worth mentioning. Because of the constant focus on Cooper, everyone else in the film has only bits and pieces, including Miller. But what time she does have is a believable performance that makes you feel for her character. When she and Cooper are on screen together, everything falls into a warm, comfortable place, even when they're fighting.<br/><br/>www.acoupleofaveragejoes.com"

","This is very disappointing, it is clear that Eastwood wanted to glorify a man who has killed over 160 people but to be credited as 'tasteful,' he attempts at showing the darker side of war. In between the American triumphs and numerous killings, there is a minute amount of screen time being given to the mental pain that people in war go through. It is pro-American and pro-war propaganda and felt like a high budget recruitment film. Its primary message was that the sniper felt no torment about the people he had killed, but the people he couldn't save - further emphasizing that to kill someone is okay. <br/><br/>Very disappointing from Cooper and Eastwood, as I thought they would be above this kind of political stimulus. The film should reflect every aspect of war, the torment of every man and their families. I also could argue the underlining islamophobia throughout the film but I could be looking too deeply."

","American Sniper is a film made particularly for 8 year old kids who have no knowledge about anything. Make no mistake. This film is not about recording history. It's about making money. The film is a hideous attempt at making a war film. Clint Eastwood made this film in order to gain attention of some stupid people. It is unnecessary to get into the merits of a film so completely devoid of truth. The Iraq war was waged for the financial gain of the oil, gas, and defense, industries. Iraq had no WMD, was not a threat to this country, and did not become a democracy. This lie of a film was made for the same bloody money that the war was waged for. That country had nothing to do with 9/11.<br/><br/>The film makes a hero out of a person who savagely killed hundreds of innocent people including women and children. Nowadays, if you kill innocent people, everyone will label you as a ""Hero"" and if you die protecting your land when some jokers try to invade your country, you'll be labeled as ""Terrorists"". This is a pathetic world we're living in. If you've power, you can invade anyone's country, kill anyone who is not of your country and steal other's resources. The film's approach is to display every Iraqi man, woman and even child as intent on murdering ""good"" American troops and therefore deserving of their fate, both at the end of Kyle's rifle and under the boot of American troops generally. To sum it all, this film is just a stupid propaganda."

We have destroyed so many countries. We have tortured and killed and maimed and raped around this planet.

","""American Sniper"" is far and away the best movie of its genre. It tells the true tale of Chris Kyle, an American sniper. He four tours of duty in Afghanistan before he finally decided to get out of the business, so to speak. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper gives a spectacular performance as the main character. From his accent to his body language throughout the movie, Cooper again shows he is one of the most under-rated actors of this time. After watching this, I feel he should have won the Oscar for best actor. He never seemed out of his element and because his portrayal was so honest, it was easy to feel sympathy for him. <br/><br/>Much has been said about how Hollywood could portray a ""murderer"" as a hero. I would like to point out to all who have a problem with this: GET OVER IT. Could I do what he did? Hell no. But war is war, and sometimes in order to survive you do what you may not WANT to do, but what you HAVE to do. To Chris, his duty was to protect his country and his men, and he did that with no apologies. In the movie, Kyle tells a psychiatrist that he was prepared to meet his maker and answer for every shot he took. <br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is a gritty look at an even grittier ""job."" For people to damn this man is unforgivable. If it were not for men like Chris Kyle, this country may not have most of its taken-for- granted freedoms.<br/><br/>The movie is rated ""R"" for graphic violence and language. It is HIGHLY recommended."

The action scenes were very realistic and the way that the director portrayed Chris Kyle's selfless commitment to his Warrior Brothers was moving. If you are a Military man you will love this movie and will be reminded of those relationships that you shared with your battle buddies in a most profound way. I also found the coming home scenes to be very accurate as often readjustment to life in the materialistic culture of the western world is hard to do after what combat operations put you through.

","I saw ""American Sniper"", starring Bradley Cooper-The Hangover movies, Failure to Launch; Sienna Miller-G.I.Joe:The Rise of Cobra, Layer Cake; Luke Grimes-Taken 2, Brothers & Sisters_tv and Sam Jaeger-Eli Stone_tv, Behind Enemy Lines.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a true story about a Navy SEAL sniper, credited with being the deadliest sniper in US history, with over 160 confirmed kills. It's directed by Clint Eastwood. Bradley plays Chris Kyle, a native Texan, that grew up wanting to be nothing more than just a cowboy. Around the age of 30, he decided to do something to fight terrorists and joined the Navy SEALs, where he became a sniper-growing up, he was a good shot, so that kind of influenced him just a little bit. Before his first tour of duty, he meets and marries Sienna. He has a son before his second tour of duty and a daughter before his third tour. Sam plays a SEAL Lt. and Luke is another soldier. One of Bradley's fellow teammates reads comic books-the Punisher in particular-and so they decide to use the skull symbol on their shirts and equipment. There is an Iraqi sniper that is sort of a counterpart to Bradley and he kills lots of US soldiers and even tries killing Bradley on several occasions. By his fourth tour of duty, Bradley was getting a little PTSD-post traumatic stress disorder-which was to be expected after all he had been through. After getting some help for himself, he decided to help other vets that suffered from PTSD by visiting and talking with them-sometimes even taking them out and shooting targets. It is not shown on camera, but as the end credits start, you discover how he died in 2013 and the actual funeral procession is shown in Arlington, Texas. It's rated ""R"" for war violence-it is graphic-language and sexual references-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

"Sleddog_Afterbirth","1","68","151","23 January 2015"," Best jingoist film about American hero worship Ever!
","American Sniper is another Uber-jingoistic piece of American ""Oorah"" cinema. As the years have moved on from 9/11 and the United States has become more insulated from the rest of the world; its citizens seemingly have begun to take these fully fictional stories that are ""based"" on real people and have held them up to a fervour of almost religious pitch, beholding this film as the gospel truth.<br/><br/>""Best War Movie Ever""<br/><br/>Making it worse, is the reaction of these Americans when anyone criticizes this film for being dangerous in the ways this film is perceived as a true story. Automatically labelling anyone who criticizes as ""liberal"" (as if valuing human life these days has become an affect of the deviant). So, as a liberal person viewing this movie and in seeing how its audiences are quick to praise this portrayal of a man who has killed women and children, I condemn not only Clint Eastwood for making such a trite piece of cinema, but I condemn any person who holds this film up as a great representation of film making because they so blindly believe that this version of Chris Kyle is the American hero they wish to worship.<br/><br/>Firstly, American hero worship in this day and age doesn't require much. Farting through a straw on a windy day will get you called a hero as long as it's aimed at some non-American ""Other"". Gone are the days when Americans seem to uphold values shared by people from all over the world. Values based on dignity and honour. This war on ""terror"", this war on a nounan idea, has turned Americans into the biggest bunch of blood-thirsty, cut-throat people-haters I've ever seen. I don't believe all Americans are like this but if you truly believe this is a great film because this rendering of Chris Kyle makes you think that he is what the definitive picture of a true hero is, then I think you fall into this blood thirsty category of Americans that make you no better than the scum of Islamic afterbirth fighting in Syria and Iraq today.<br/><br/>There is so much wrong with both this film and its portrayal of the central protagonist that when you do even a small amount of searching about the real Chris Kyle, this perversion of a ""true story"" makes you realize how cynical Clint Eastwood really has become. I won't even go into the white washing of truth about why Americans went to Iraq. Most don't even care it had nothing to do with 9/11.<br/><br/>The film is an overly simplistic representation of a shooting gallery, the kind you play with at the County Fair. No more than that. Eastwood would have you believe that his Chris Kyle eventually found the strength to have enough emotion to actually begin to care about his own family. When in reality, the real Chris Kyle was a pathologically psychotic killing machine with zero remorse and fabricated stories about killing American citizens in New Orleans during Katrina. He's been judged in American court as being a liar, telling untruths to profit from the sales of his book.<br/><br/>Whichever Chris Kyle you uphold as a hero; the Eastwoodian emotionally challenged hick from a testosterone soaked heteronormative universe, or the real pathological psychopath with a thirst for child's blood and penchant for telling untruths, the fact that you see this man as a hero says a lot about you.<br/><br/>You likely don't question what your Authority tells you. You're likely superstitious and believe in a god risen from a middle eastern desert thousands of years ago. You probably think that the rest of the world wants to kill you and you probably have bars on your windows at home and maybe a gun or two in your nightstand. You're the type of person that believes that the whole world should be an American world and you're surprised, IF you find the courage to leave your safe little country, that they don't speak ""American"". You may even be the type that hatesI mean just HATES liberals without even understanding the values they believe in. You hide anonymously behind your screen and keyboard and spout obscenities and join in the derision of people whose ideas are different than yours and you proclaim the USA is the greatest place on earth without having been anywhere to compare it too.<br/><br/>You don't watch a lot of movies but you know, you just KNOW that this is the greatest film made this year and it deserves ""best picture"" for sure! Why? Because he's an American Hero."

His wife Taya (Sienna Miller) is fearful that she will lose Kyle as he keeps going back to the war.<br/><br/>We have all heard that wars change people. This may be a case in point. From the movie we get the impression that Chris Kyle always felt guilty when he came home as his ""brothers' were fighting and dying thousands of miles away and he wasn't there to protect them. Nothing Taya could do could shake him from that period of isolation he kept himself in. <br/><br/>The war scenes were brutal, and sometimes quite bloody as we learn about a Taliban sniper who liked to use a drill on his enemies and this included children. That was some heart wrenching scene. When someone is shot we see the blood spurting out at times. <br/><br/>The home scenes were much quieter with Taya not making much progress to ""get her husband back.""<br/><br/>This movie should tell Bradley Cooper to stay away from unfunny, raunchy alleged ""comedies"" as he became Chris Kyle and he raised his game to new heights. In a true story we really never know if everything we see is true or not, but Director Clint Eastwood gave us a pretty good scenario of what the war and the home front was like for Chris Kyle, and for Taya too. Chris kept to himself at home so that the images of war would not enter Taya's head and disrupt her life and he believed this protected her. For the most part I saw that Chris Kyle was very level-headed. If the war changed him, we really didn't see him go over the top.<br/><br/>There were 2-scenes whereby a child was involved as Chris Kyle took a bead on each one. And, it was here, at each time, that we gasped. Will he or won't he? <br/><br/>The acting all around was excellent. The cinematography was unbelievably good and most of the war scenes were filmed in Morocco. When Chris Kyle was getting to know Taya in that bar I was waiting for him to ask how she got the name Taya. Funny but that was what I was waiting for. Didn't happen. Whaaat?<br/><br/>Keep a box of Kleenex handy for the last few minutes of the movie. The tributes and funeral procession for Chris Kyle is impressive. Chris Kyle did 4-tours overseas with 150-kills, and that was more than any other sniper. He was truly a Legend. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Bloody gore: Yes, at times. Language: Yes."

And his sudden untimely death, by a veteran he was trying to help, is nothing but a massive shame.

What does sadden me is the reviews people are putting saying how the film glorifies the war and what they do,which I feel is totally wrong and disagree. I think the film just tries to show someone doing what he feels right and convincing himself for his country but he doesn't enjoy it or brag about it like some people have said. Just a film trying to show the brutal truth through someone's eyes (war isn't pretty but is happening and no hiding from that) and how he copes with it while having an effect on his family life.

"noelcox","2","65","144","22 January 2015"," one of the most polarising movies of the decade
","Though technically well done, this film is one of the most shocking films of the decade. I say not because it isn't well enough made - as a mindless action movie it would be successful enough - but because of its message and the response to it. <br/><br/>Americans, by and large, are extolling its virtues, the portrayal of a good American, a patriot. Non-Americans can generally see the broader perspective, and are less positive. <br/><br/>It is very unfortunate that Americans who criticize the film are condemned as unpatriotic or radical lefties. The truth of the matter is that I, though a non-American, am socially and politically conservative, yet find the message of the film to be offensive. Good patriotic conservative Americans, as well as those of other persuasions, should also condemn the ideas that the film glorifies. <br/><br/>The key messages are that Iraqis are bad and Americans are good, and that it is fine to enjoy killing the baddies. Kyle was a proved fabricator - the law suits by Jesse Ventura are proof of that - but that is beside the point. Boasting of enjoying killing anyone, enemy or not, is a sign of a serious mental disturbance or illness, or at the very least, a sign of the societal sickness in the USA that applauds the ""right"" to bear arms, and to use them with wanton abandon. Killing is what war is about, but there have always been limits to such conduct, and the film shows precious little of that restraint. <br/><br/>Obviously this is a fictional film, and not necessarily accurate, even allowing for the inaccuracies in Kyle's largely factual book, upon which it is based. But if the common American attitude to Iraqis, Arabs, Muslims and anyone else they see as the enemy, is as shown in this piece of mindless, gung-ho, chauvinist propaganda, then God help us all. Such an attitude can only alienate those who should be the Americans friends and supporters and will ensure that political instability, terrorism and global chaos prevails for generations to come."

I don't know much about Chris Kyle's history so I cannot comment on the accuracy of his story but what impressed me with the film was the accuracy of combat operations. Eastwood was very meticulous to capture every detail of team operations, uniforms, communications, equipment, vehicles, etc. I can usually pick apart hundreds of details in military films but he did his homework. I even noticed an Army NCO with a 2nd Ranger Battalion tab working with the team on a few missions. Most Directors would have just shown Seals, presuming the public doesn't know any better but SOCOM operations often include troops from multiple branches. Also, from a technical perspective, Eastwood managed to get some outstanding action footage. There were several extended, low light and varying light tracking shots that were executed flawlessly. During the whole film, I could see the meticulous attention they gave to color and light matching. Taking all of that into consideration and the performances by the cast, including non-professional actors, I think Eastwood delivered big time.

Bradley Cooper really tried and so did the supporting actors.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are superb thanks to Mr. Eastwood.<br/><br/>As I said, my main problem with the film was definitely the propaganda.

"ericbobg","9","19","36","18 February 2015"," American Sniper & the heroism of difficult decisions
","My full review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2015/02/film-american-sniper- heroism-of-making.html<br/><br/>I think the real heroism of the character that Eastwood and Cooper give us in American Sniper is not in his courage in the face of death or in the combination of talent and determination that feed his skill at shooting, but in the resolve of character that allows Chris Kyle to make difficult decisions. This much is clear as he reflects on a letter written by a fallen soldier and comrade after a funeral. Although a poor decision and a surprise enemy onslaught resulted in his friend's death, Kyle says it is the doubt expressed in the letter that really caused him to die. Some may describe it as willed ignorance or justification of the many lives he ended from his eagle-eye perch, but it is actually a result of his facing the reality of his role as sniper and the reason for his service - in other words looking at the worst full in the face - that allows him to achieve calm acceptance of who he is and what he does. He is able to cordon off sections of debate that don't fall under his purview as a soldier. The reverence and clear respect for his situation allows him to consider shooting a child picking up a gun at the same time he scolds fellow soldiers for congratulating him on a kill.<br/><br/>While there are many life-affecting decisions that Chris Kyle makes in the film, two are key to the development of the character. The first is made in the spur of the moment by a cowboy waking up to the reality of the larger world. The second, made just as quickly, comes to a man realizing when it's time to come home. Watch for the symbolism of where Kyle puts his gun as a sign of this. As a sandstorm engulfs a messy, nearly-fatal operation for Kyle, and after scrambling to phone his wife mid-battle and tell her he's ready to truly leave the war, you'll see his gun, ammo, and helmet left in the sand signifying he's ready to accept and give in. Conventional wisdom might say the decision to go to war is the most difficult and self-sacrificing, but it's the choice to live that becomes so understandably elusive for many veterans. And as with so many suffering from withdrawal of one kind or another, Chris aids his own recovery by offering his friendship to veterans stateside after he's finished his military service."

","Patriot Porn and the Celebration of Psychopathy..... Yup, Hollywood just made another war-film.... (It seems as though producing the blockbuster Movie Of The War is now as much an integral component of the USA's murderous and insane Zionist-inspired foreign policy as the theft of oil, installation of Rothschild Central Banks, or privatization of water supplies.) Needless to say, we get the usual mix of re-written history, racism, and brain-rotting propagandist bullshit ....<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>Iraq War veteran Brian Turner wrote : '' In American Sniper, Iraqis are called ""savages,"" and the ""streets are crawling"" with them. Eastwood and his screenwriter Jason Hall give Iraqis no memorable lines. Their interior lives are a blank canvas, with no access points to let us in. I get why that is: If Iraqis are seen in any other light, if their humanity is recognized, then the construct of our imagination, the ride-off-into-the-sunset-on-a-white-horse story we tell ourselves to push forward, falls apart.... In American Sniper, Iraqi men, women, and children are known and defined only in relation to combat and the potential threat they pose. Their bodies are the site and source of violence. In both the film and our collective imagination, their humanity is reduced in ways that, ultimately, define our own narrow humanity.<br/><br/>....There's a scene — scenes, actually — in American Sniper where Chris Kyle struggles with the decision to shoot a child. Those scenes dredged up memories of Mosul and Baghdad, where I once heard the words ''You are authorized to shoot children'' come crackling over the radio. I also remember watching soldiers in my own platoon lob plastic water bottles filled with their own urine at village children who would run to us as we drove by — thirsty children who motioned with their thumbs to their mouths in a gesture pleading for water''. <br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>Sadly, this kind of pernicious indoctrination actually works..."
"mm-39","8","22","43","22 February 2015"," Thought the movie would be better, but still good!
","I read the book, and thought the movie left much out. Regrettably, we would have had a 8 hour movie if the whole book was filmed. What worked: American Sniper followed the book accurately. The emotional spectrum acted by Bradly Cooper followed, was preformed perfectly. The ranges of guilt for not helping more soldiers, and the stress of combat weaves perfectly with Eastwood's direction for the movie's experience. The savagery of war, and the stress of completing the combat missions resonates with the viewer as the story unfolds. What happens after the mission is over was a perfect ending for the movie. Service, commitment, bravery, humility, were displayed as the characteristics of Chris Kyle were done in a fitting well measured character development. What did not work: Some scenes which would tell more of the American Sniper book were shorted, omitted, condensed, in the American Sniper movie. Maybe for time and or continuity reasons. Still a good movie. I give American Sniper 8 kills out of 10."
"tavm","8","22","43","25 January 2015"," American Sniper was a compellingly dramatic depiction of the heroism and hardships of Chris Kyle
","I consider myself an independent though I usually vote Demoratic. With that in mind, I viewed this movie with an open mind concerning the character of Chris Kyle and his motivations for fighting in the Middle East as well as how he coped with his post-war life and home life concerning his wife and his children. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller do fine in their roles as first single people getting to know each other before they get married and he then goes to a far away country protecting people in a foreign land from committing terrors against other peoples. Clint Eastwood compellingly depicts the hardships involved in doing the job and making it back not only in one piece but also with some lasting issues in trying to get back to a normal life after all that calamity. So on that note, I recommend American Sniper."

They show clips from his real funeral procession and memorial service at Cowboys Stadium as the credits start rolling.<br/><br/>I was in a completely packed theater in a northern suburb of Atlanta watching this film. During the previews, there were several high school aged young men making a racket, yelling F bombs and being idiots in general. No one uttered a word (that I could hear) once the film started, but the truly amazing thing happened at the end when the credits rolled and they were showing the procession.<br/><br/>Not one person got up until the credits showing the funeral scenes were over. And no one spoke a word until they were completely outside the theater.<br/><br/>For a film to create that much reverence in what was previously a slightly unruly crowd, says a lot.<br/><br/>I don't care if CPO Kyle made up stories, bragged about shooting looters or what. He was a true American Hero, and the kind of man I am glad that there are so many of defending our country. Anyone who criticizes him or this film, and who has not been in the line of fire themselves, is not to be listened to in my opinion."

This one has it all - outstanding acting by lead, and superb performances by all involved. Direction is confident, clear, engaging and superbly paced. At running time 2 h this movie never drags. Set design is superb, you really feel like you are in location during the whole movie, and outstanding cinematography just enriches the experience. No shaky camera (although i don't mind of it) - it's really rare thing to see a war movie shoot in old fashioned way. Sound design is also outstanding - there is simply not one weak point in this movie (well there is one actually with the definitely fake baby, which kinda distracts for a moment, but it's a to minor complain. There is a lot of down to reality action, there is a good and solid drama, and it's a war biopic that shows its central hero from child till his last days.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Sniper"" is a superb movie. It tells interesting story and although it's nothing groundbreaking original, but everything here is done so well that you will be glued to your screens during the whole movie.

"txhackertracker","8","42","90","10 December 2014"," Well done - and six of the guys with me agreed!
","I want to start by acknowledging some comments by other reviewers and add some personal observations. I sincerely want to comment on the movie and not the other reviews, but I feel the best way to do that is to call out comments made by other reviewers that differed from my experience.<br/><br/>To the reviewer that suggested the training was unnecessary, I would offer a counter argument. I thought the witty one-liners brought a levity to the movie that helped balance the weightiness of the movie. You'll notice that as the movie developed, the levity/humor at the beginning of the movie were displaced with a much heavier/somber tone.<br/><br/>I agree with the reviewer that commented the baby looked fake. It wasn't in anyway a critical flaw, but I agree I wish it had been handled better. That said, to ""laugh"" as one reviewer suggests they missed the point. At that point in time, the movie was showing the developing tension at home and what he was leaving behind to serve.<br/><br/>To the reviewer that commented the movie spent to much flashing between @home, @war, @home, @war... I found purpose in that as well. It helped develop and maintain the story of what the struggle that developed as he battled with the the balance between a family at home and a patriotic sense of duty and obligation to care for the soldiers he served with.<br/><br/>I understand some reviewers didn't care for the ending where it relegated the murder of Chris Kyle to a closing caption... on the other hand thought, I thought it was wise to handle it the way they did. To spend film time on his own demise would have detracted from everything that had been built up to this point. I'm personally glad they chose to focus on the life of Chris Kyle rather than his death.<br/><br/>Now that I'm finished defending the movie against comments I take issue with, I want to add some observations that I do believe have validity (and have been pointed out by other reviewers in slightly different words). This movie tries to take on a LOT- arguably too much- and as a result doesn't do any of it excellently. I found all of the following elements underdeveloped: the sense of patriotic duty within a soldier, the obligation to defend those he served with (arguably the most developed theme of the movie), the conflict at home with his wife and family, development of family relationships (with his father and his own son), the trauma and intensity of war, the PTSD experienced by returning soldiers and the loss they suffer, the personal battle that develops between Chris Kyle and the enemy (the other sniper, the government ransom, etc.), the morality and evil of war, and the legacy and heroism of the man that is the most lethal sniper in American history. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Understand in advance everything the movie was trying to encompass and just let yourself experience the movie. I suspect you'll be drawn in. I and the six other guys I went with found it well done and we were very happy we got to see the sneak preview in advance of the release."

Because they survived, they must carry the never ending burden of war horrors for the rest of their lives. How anyone EVER is able to go back to a 'normal' life to me is impossible after such an experience. Our country should be DEEPLY ashamed that there are commercials airing 24/7 imploring monetary donations to care for our military people who GAVE THEIR LIVES EVEN THOUGH THEY LIVED. Unacceptable, intolerable and completely unnecessary that this situation exists. I thank GOD and these incredible men and women who are charged with doing whatever is necessary in a war we will NEVER win. Anyone can sit back and judge a movie that is simply a director's depiction and interpretation of events, but perhaps people should look beyond that to the deeper story of what is given up so that we can have the right to sit back and judge things most of us never must face."
"Danusha_Goska","8","31","64","19 January 2015"," Virtuosic Filmmaking
","War movies are not my genre of choice. I am a romantic comedy fan. ""American Sniper"" is such an excellently made film that it demanded my full attention and earned my esteem. This is a violent, bloody, war movie with a sad ending. The film is so expertly made I left the theater exhilarated. Such is the power of art. <br/><br/>It is astounding that this film was made by a director, Clint Eastwood, who is in his eighties. ""American Sniper"" is fast-paced, gripping, suspenseful, and the most truly contemporary film I've seen in a while. It addresses what we are all thinking about: the West's confrontation with violent Islamists. The film feels as if it was peeled out of our brains during our nightmares. There is no elegiac feeling here. No nostalgia, no backward glances. It is all now, now, now, now, with the forward motion of a locomotive at full tilt. With ""American Sniper,"" Clint Eastwood has outdone himself and set the bar very high. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is flawless. His commitment is one hundred percent. This is a performance for the ages. <br/><br/>""American Sniper"" tells the true story of Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in US military history. The film depicts him as having been taught to hunt by his father. His father also taught him that there are three kinds of people in the world: wolves, sheep, and shepherds. It is the shepherd's job to defend the sheep from the wolves. Kyle became a rodeo bucking bronco rider. <br/><br/>After terrorist attacks, he decided to join the military to defend his country. He was sent to Iraq, where he did four tours of duty. He covered soldiers moving into urban combat zones in cities like Fallujah. He would lie on rooftops, survey surrounding areas, and shoot at suspicious characters, including women and children assigned to bomb troops. Interspersed with his tours in Iraq, Kyle married his wife and fathered two children. After his return to the US, Kyle aided returned veterans who suffered from PTSD. <br/><br/>""American Sniper"" follows this story in a completely straightforward, unadorned fashion. You can't help but think of other war films when watching ""American Sniper."" The flamboyant operatics of ""The Deer Hunter,"" the heavy-handed, manipulative, almost propagandistic politics of ""Coming Home,"" the graphic combat of ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""American Sniper""'s style is almost no style. The movie simply meticulously recreates what Kyle did and saw. There is a scene where American soldiers raid the headquarters of The Butcher of Fallujah. There are shelves on which human body parts, including at least one severed head, are stored. The camera does not linger on this hideous and telling sight. The moviegoer sees these body parts for only as long as the soldiers running through the headquarters sees them. <br/><br/>There are no White House scenes, no Pentagon scenes, almost no scenes of reporters commenting on the war. There are no lingering shots of gas stations hint hint â€“ petroleum caused this war! One soldier does begin to question; he dies. Kyle attends his funeral. A mourner begins to read a document questioning the wisdom of the Iraq war; she cannot finish. The three-volley gun salute drowns her out. <br/><br/>The movie soundtrack begins with an ominous male voice intoning ""Allahu akbar."" Characters who are obviously Arab and Muslim are shown doing very bad things, including one very brief but disturbing scene of a man torturing a child to death in a hideously inventive way, in front of the child's father. American soldiers are shown being dedicated and trying to avoid civilian deaths. <br/><br/>Politically correct moviegoers will decide that what is missing from this movie is the heavy hand of an interpreter reaching in and telling you that the war was a mistake, that it was all about petroleum, that the American soldiers were all racists, that the Arabs were merely attempting to defend their homeland from invaders, that truly evil men like the Butcher of Fallujah were the products of failed US foreign policy. <br/><br/>I found ""American Sniper""'s minimalism to be an incredibly courageous and innovative stylistic choice. Eastwood must know that every moviegoer enters the theater with his or her own opinion about the Iraq War, about the West v Islam, about terror. We know that Fallujah is now under ISIS control. We know that another war looms. <br/><br/>This isn't the viewer's movie. It isn't the politician's movie. It is Chris Kyle's movie. The movie veers wildly from scenes of incredible tension and horror in Iraq. Kyle goes on leave and is back in the US. Suddenly the biggest issue is getting a collie to behave at a family barbecue in Texas. Kyle sits in front of an empty TV screen, reliving Iraqi battles. The film delivers no lecture about PTSD. It just lives Kyle's PTSD with him. <br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is a gripping, suspenseful, involving, virtuosic film. I am glad it is getting the Academy-Award nominations and record-setting box office and audience it deserves."

Cooper certainly deserves an Oscar nod if not a win (although I'm kinda rooting for Eddie Raymond, tight competition this year). <br/><br/>What ticks me off is 1.)

Some of these reviews are from Italy or the UK, which frankly I don't get because their opinion has no merit. and 2.)

"akocevic","1","33","69","2 February 2015"," Egregiously pro-American and ridiculously biased!
","The movie American Sniper has been lauded by critics throughout the world for showing and subsequently glorifying the bravery of the American soldiers in their fight against vicious terrorists, the primary goal of whom is to wreak havoc on the free world. The plot is pretty straightforward and not too unfamiliar to those even vaguely familiar with the prevalent paradigm of the U.S. foreign policy. American soldiers are dispatched to Iraq in order to kill as many terrorists as possible. <br/><br/>I watched this movie last night with two of my friends. What strikes me the most is that not only is it appallingly pro-American but also extremely prejudiced, biased and grossly chauvinistic. It portrays all Iraqis as potential terrorists and further exacerbates the already widespread stereotypical view of the people in the Middle East. Everyone is presumed a potential terrorist, be it a small child, a woman or an old man. Even a family that offers the American soldiers some food turns out to be involved with terrorists. There are no shades in this movie, it is all black and white. Americans are depicted as the good guys with altruistic motives whereas the Iraqis are depicted as barbaric, evil and a malignant tumor that must be eradicated at all cost. One cannot stress enough the level of induced polarization that pervades the entire plot. <br/><br/>Guess what? The world has had enough of this atrocious Hollywood propaganda. It makes you want to puke, it is so transparent and ridiculous that no person with the slightest knowledge of anything could possibly buy into this crap. How hard can it be to understand this simple fact? The superpowers choose to intervene in conflicts not because they safeguard human rights or because they want to spread liberal and democratic ideas but because they have economic and imperialistic motives. Every single military intervention is driven by geopolitically strategic and economic interests. One must be gullible and naive to believe otherwise. <br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie, the main character keeps reminding his comrades of what might happen if the Americans do not get to the bottom of this; that is rooting out all the terrorists. They will allegedly pose a very serious threat to the Americans and will eventually end up on the American soil if the Americans fail to exterminate every single one of them. If the U.S. genuinely cared about human rights and democratic values, why is Saudi Arabia one of its biggest allies? Given what we know without a shred of doubt about this egregiously repressive regime, why does the U.S. government choose to collaborate with them and why are they allowed to own a substantial percentage of the United States? One does not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that it has to do with economic interests. Everything else is but an excuse to justify the illegitimate invasions of other countries under false pretenses. <br/><br/>I wish that people would wake up and start asking questions. Also, it is time to realize that many American soldiers who return home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after witnessing and in some cases participating in horrific atrocities. They have to sacrifice their own lives for a purportedly noble cause, when in fact the truth is that they are sent to war zones to secure the economic interests of the U.S. government. <br/><br/>American Sniper is a disappointment in every imaginable way. Its sweeping over-generalizations and oversimplifications make it unbearable to watch. I do recommend it though, but a word of warning is appropriate here. Utilize your critical skills and do not simply be a passive recipient of the vicious propaganda conveyed by this movie."

"bayardhiler","10","27","55","28 January 2015"," Superb Tale of the Horrors of War and One Man's Experience
","It is very rare for me to experience feelings of such emotion and thought over a film as I have over 2015's ""American Sniper"". You probably already know it's about the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. history. And you also probably know that the likes of Michael Moore and Seth Rogen have denounced the film as being propaganda and a pro-war piece. Well ladies and gentlemen, nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, it is true that the film takes place during the Iraq war, and it is also true that the late Chris Kyle believed very much that the Iraq war was justified. But folks, this is not a pro-war film; this is a film that makes a valid attempt to show the full realities of war while staying true to Chris Kyle as much as possible. Before I go on, let me just say that I was not a supporter of the Bush Administration's decision to invade the present day country of Iraq (and ancient land of Mesopotamia). It didn't make sense to me then and it especially doesn't make sense to me now with all the tragedy going on in Iraq at the time of this writing. Be that as it may, I still believe we should honor the sacrifices of all those who served in that war and ""American Sniper"" achieves this.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the desert land of Iraq with Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper in a tour de force role) on a rooftop scouting for a column of Marines on patrol when he is forced to make a decision of whether to take out a young boy walking towards the column with a grenade or stand down? Then the film all of sudden gives us a peek into the Kyle's past, from his time as a boy to his experience at BUD/S to the meeting of his wife, Taya (the stunning Sienna Miller). From there the film provides as accurate as possible look at Kyle's four tours in Iraq and the subsequent affect they have on him and his family. Bradley Cooper, the lead man in the wolf-pack from the ""Hang Over"" films, gives what may be his best performance so far. With his Texas accent and swag, bulked up appearance, and dogged dedication to the role, he doesn't just play Chris Kyle; he BECOMES him. Indeed, when I first saw Bradley Cooper in the previews, I didn't even put two and two together that this was the same man who played the lead role in ""The Hang Over"". His performance is that good! The same can be said for Sienna Miller in her role as Chris' dedicated wife Taya. With her dark hair, Texas charm and looks, she looked every bit like the late Chris Kyle's real life wife.<br/><br/>Directed by the great Clint Eastwood, the film doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the ugly realities of war. When Chris Kyle kills someone, the camera doesn't pull away. We see people die from his point of view, and believe me it's not pretty. Eastwood should be congratulated for having the guts to make the film in the first place and do so without trying to sugarcoat for the audience. As one can imagine, seeing this death on a daily basis begins having an effect on Kyle's mind and family life and after his last tour of duty, decides to take the step of getting help. He does so by finding solace in helping other veterans who've seen the horrors of war by taking them out to the gun range, a decision that helps many but would sadly cost the life of Mr. Kyle. In short ladies and gentleman, ""American Sniper"" is a film that anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, can appreciate if they go in with an objective mind, not one already made up. By showing Chris Kyle's experiences, the film shows the experiences of all men who go to war the subsequent challenges of reintegrating into society. A word of warning, though, the film leads up to an emotional ending in which it took every ounce of strength in me to hold back the tears. Whether you supported the war in Iraq or not, whether you are a pacifist or hawk, one thing is for sure: ""American Sniper"" is one of the most powerful films of this year and is a must see for everyone who appreciates our military and their sacrifices. God bless all those who have served and may Chris Kyle rest in peace."

"virek213","9","20","39","20 February 2015"," Chris Kyle: Not A Hero Or A Cold-Blooded Killer, But A Man Doing What He Believed Was The Right Thing
","Iraq is a war that, like Vietnam, will continue to divide America for decades and generations to come; and any film that has ever focused in on any aspect of that war is bound to be controversial. So it is with American SNIPER, the 2014 war film from legendary producer/director (and former actor) Clint Eastwood that is based on the memoir of perhaps the most lethal sniper in the history of the wars that America has undertaken, Chris Kyle. Pundits from the Left and Right have had a lot of things to say about the film; but a very careful and clinical look at the film will find out that many of the rantings from each side about it are not necessarily accurate.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has the very tough job of portraying the life that Kyle, a Texas native, had growing up, and how the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa influenced his decision to join the elite Navy Seals. It is 9/11 that inevitably sends him into a trajectory towards Iraq, where he served four punishing tours of duty and became a ""legend"" (to his fellow soldiers there) for his accuracy at hitting ""the bad guys."" But as tough as Kyle was, he pretty soon got tired of being referred to as ""Legend""; and, given the gradual emotional distance between him and his wife (Sienna Miller), he, like hundreds of thousands of veterans before him, began to suffer from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Once he got back home after the fourth tour, during which he engaged in a firefight with an Iraqi militia leader who actually had a $180,000 bounty on his own head, he came back to do his part for veterans who suffered not only from PTSD, but the more obvious physical injuries that war often inflicts on the people who fight them as well. Unfortunately, on February 2, 2013, one of those veterans did what no Iraqi or Al-Qaeda militia fighter could to Kyle, which was to kill him. At the end of American SNIPER, Eastwood utilizes actual TV video footage of the massive funeral procession given to Kyle in his home state of Texas.<br/><br/>Cooper doesn't have the easiest job in the world of accurately portraying Kyle, whose attitude toward all Iraqis in his memoir was that they were all ""savages"", but he succeeds at this toughest of tasks quite well. For the moment, though, it is, inevitably, that ""savages"" part of the memoir, which is slightly tampered down by Eastwood in the film, which is the most fiercely debated and spun aspect of the piece. I personally feel, having seen the film, that both the Left and the Right have gotten American SNIPER wrong in a number of ways. The mistaken criticism of the film by liberals is that Kyle was a product of American warmongers like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and was ""made"" into a killer, when those same liberals have to share some of the blame for allowing the Iraq war to go forward for fear of being branded ""unpatriotic"" and ""supporting terrorism."" The more egregious championing of American SNIPER by those on the Far Right, especially wing nuts like Sarah Palin, is that Kyle should somehow be ""celebrated"" as a hero for being trained into becoming the best ""killer"" the U.S. military ever had, which unfortunately is a terribly dishonest distortion of what war really does, for those who must fight it (like Kyle) and those caught in the middle, both on a physical and on a psychological level. Kyle is not a man who should be either lionized or demonized, but should, like every man and woman who served, be given their due for doing what he believed was right, however much we may have bitterly disagreed with that war.<br/><br/>The perception of Eastwood as a right-wing ideologue, which is not the whole picture, obscures the fact that both he and Cooper are even-handed in portraying Kyle, and what our men and women saw in Iraq. It would be enormously misleading to think that this film supports either that war or what Kyle did, because, for one, it doesn't; and for another, it does show what repetitious battle can do to the human psyche, even to one like Chris Kyle. That is how I hope, in the not-too-distant future, American SNIPER can eventually be seen, and not from too many politically distorted angles."
"uptonian","9","29","60","23 January 2015"," Review: American Sniper (2014) - A Powerful War Thriller
","""You can only circle the flame so long."" <br/><br/>From the opening frame, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a gripping Military Drama. The trailers and adverts for this film set me to expect merely a study of Chris Kyle's dual life as a loving father / American patriot ""sheepdog,"" and it does function as that (exceptionally well), but what I wasn't anticipating was the superb war cinema that it became at points. The action sequences feel inspired. They are captured with an unrivaled attention to detail. The cameras and their positioning are tailored to depict gripping, no-holds-barred firefights and movement through the Iraqi battlefield. Bradley Cooper makes the incredible transformation into Chris Kyle, ""The Devil of Ramadi,"" as Eastwood explores his anguished psyche during his time in both ""The War on Terror"" and stateside with his family between tours of duty.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle is a character that deserved to have his story told, and it is done lovingly, here, by Eastwood. I am ecstatic to say that Eastwood has made a triumphant return to directing after some arguable lulls in his directing career (Hereafter, J. Edgar, Jersey Boys). This film isn't just Oscar-bait- it succeeds on all proposed fronts, with the panache of a unabashed war film, and the intimacy of a film strictly identifying as a character study. A delicate balance executed surgically by the cast and crew.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is emotional and engaging, setting up the rest of the film more than adequately. A brief portion of the film near the beginning is spent in flashback, effectively and succinctly providing the motivations behind Chris Kyle's burden to become the legend he remains today. His relationship with his wife, Taya (played by Sienna Miller) is explored beautifully. From the first time they share the screen, and as they start a family with their varying circumstances looming overhead. Chris Kyle is torn between his responsibility to his family and his sense of duty to fight in the war overseas. He sees his passion to protect and help other people coupled with his skills with a rifle as almost a holy endowment.<br/><br/>The depiction of Kyle's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and his disability to reconcile the effects of war while home from battle is done with heartbreaking authenticity. Most notably in a scene where he encounters a Marine he provided aid to whilst in one of his prior tours of duty. Bradley Cooper embodies this pain and frustration powerfully on screen. Most films fail to capture the baggage brought home by soldiers the way that American Sniper does so exquisitely. This film is a success; a masterful piece by director Clint Eastwood, and a great show of skill from Bradley Cooper, who is, with every role, proving his expansive diversity in acting."
"derpypotater2013","9","16","30","2 March 2015"," A thrilling and enjoyable war movie
","Clint Eastwood did a great job with the movie, and Bradley Cooper fits his role very well. American Sniper is a movie based off of Chris Kyle, a sniper in the US military who served four tours, but unfortunately died early on in his life. Over all, it was a good movie in itself.<br/><br/>You will see a lot of people bashing this motion picture because they say it idolizes Chris Kyle and puts him on a pedestal, when in reality he did some pretty bad things. I cannot disagree with those claims nor can I back them up, for I do not keep up with the news very often, and hearing his name a couple times while the nightly news is playing in the background will not provide me with enough information.<br/><br/>I CAN agree, however, that the movie puts Chris Kyle and the US as a whole in the ""good guy hero"" slot. It's expected. All movies have a protagonist and an antagonist. Plus, it's about people in the US military, the movie is made in the US, and the director is a US citizen. It is completely normal to expect to see the US military portrayed as the protagonist, especially in a war movie.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, it is a good movie. Some might think it is bad for improperly portraying Chris Kyle but I am sure that if you watch it out of context, you will enjoy it regardless of what your stance is on this man."

Bradley Cooper gave an amazing performance that went deep into the life of the real life Kyle. This is not a propaganda film, as some people say, it is a full on biography of this American soldier's incredible life. Though some situations were stretched from reality, the overall point was still reached. It shows the incredible brutality of war in general and what it does to people's lives, the soldiers and the family's. This film brought out what sacrifices every military family has to take. One major point that was not reached though, was the character development of the Kyles' friends in his life. Director Clint Eastwood was so set on bringing out Chris's life, that he completely forgot about his friends. He did have well development on Taya as well. A lot of Chris's life was about the people around him, and this film did not do that at all. I think that it was safe to say the trailers and TV spots ruined the emotionally intense scenes. I'd seen then so many times advertised and you just don't feel the impact while watching in the theater. On the other hand, it showed great patriotism, great storytelling (apart from the real story), strong acting, and a great tribute to the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","68","157","7 January 2015"," Not too bad but, not good at all even tried to watch the 2nd time
","Update 3/17/19 after the 2nd time viewing:<br/><br/>Would still maintain my early review when the movie was released. I've also found the directing, the screenplay and editing still sucked big time! How the sniper would like to have a blabber to be his spotter? A spotter is the extra eyes for the sniper to help him spot some target he may or may not find quickly or soon enough. The spotter should be as alert and focused as the sniper in the combat zone as well as the killing zone. Yet this sniper's spotter couldn't keep his mouth shut, he didn't pay any attention to where the sniper focus, he just laid on his back and kept blabbing, running his mouth off.<br/><br/>Then, a sniper when working under the blazing sun, all things around him were so bright, yet this sniper didn't use his cap to cast a shade for his eyes, but wore his baseball hat reversed. The sniper when positioned himself under the blazing sun, he at least should put some black tar paint under his both eyes, just like the football players, to reduce the flare of the sunlight reflecting up into his eyes. Yet this sniper neither used his baseball hat's visor used for blocking sunlight from the eyes, nor applied black tar paint under his eyes. With the excruciating Middle East sunlight, he might lose his eyesights pretty soon. Yet he just did the shootings like nothing happened. What a joke!<br/><br/>Then just during the nanosecond before the shooting, the camera ridiculously shifted back to his boyhood, shooting deer, sitting in the church, stealing a mini-bible, helped his kid brother beating up the bully at school.....on and on, the craps simply couldn't stop. Why, because if just tried to tell this sniper's military killing records, there might not enough footage for this lame movie, so lot of unnecessary craps had to kept adding up to prolong the movie time.
If you want to know why people always cursed by saying: ""A loaded crap!"" Just watch this movie, and you'd understand immediately.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/><br/>I got a very mixed feeling when watching this film. i got an impression that the screenplay is kinda a patchwork, the playwright did not quite really understand the life story of this sniper, and there's not too much to tell, so the guys who wrote the script had to use lot of flashbacks and to fill up the empty spaces. the whole movie didn't give the audiences a present, an uptodate current feeling, but just a poorly assembled tidbits of this sniper, his simplified boyhood, his cowboy period, his finding about the first girlfriend cheating on him, and in between the trainings after he joined the navy seal, meeting the love of his life in a bar, then became serious and then married her.<br/><br/>There's nothing well-developed almost on anything about this guy's back-then storyline, just some superfluous jumping-around meaningless dots. i also noticed that navy seal's sniper training a bit shallow, those guys lied on their bellies, recoiled and moved their bodies by every shot, and that's not good to show a really good sniper would reacted during and after every shot.<br/><br/>The other thing i like to point out is the formulaic and popular sound track, the loud and huge vibrating sound during his sniping mission. those loud ooooommmm sounds were also became so popular in movies such as 'gravity', 'preditor', 'alien', 'intersteller', 'star wars', but using it in this film only sounded more inappropriate and ridiculous, since when a sniper doing his jobs, his mind would be totally zoned out of any sound and noise around him, if those loud booming sound were used to describe his on-site mind condition, he wouldn't be possible to shoot a target, yet this loud out-space sound would appear in every scene of his shooting, and it's stupid. a sniper used a satellite phone talking to his wife during the mission? a sniper never stopped involving small talks or joking around with his team mates during the missions? the American soldiers always shooting blindly to all general directions where the sniper already long gone, these American soldiers were only showed their arrongance, poor training, naievity all the time. those stupid yada yada annoying dialog, unnecessary wedding, funeral and hospital visiting at the nursery, the v.a. hospital, the arguments in bed with his wife....all and all, just formulaic unnecessary scenes that usually dominated in mediocre movies. Mr. Eastwood just did a mediocre directing job in this mediocre film, a poorly patch-up shallow work that didn't bring me deeply enough to be moved and only turned me into a bystander. the more i watched it, the less star i would give to this film."
"Zulfmanauthor","9","9","15","8 June 2015"," Amazing portrayal of a soldier !
","The controversial and highly acclaimed movie from director Clint Eastwood; 'American Sniper' is a compelling story that is brilliantly told. Bradley Cooper gives an epic performance as Chris Kyle, the Navy Seal who was an expert marksman dubbed 'legend' by his peers. He killed over one hundred and fifty people while defending his fellow soldiers. This fact in itself should not be celebrated as killing in any field, should never become revered however it is Kyle's patriotism and passion which make him a likable character. The film never tries to make a political statement or give the audience any arguments of whether war is right or wrong, however it focuses on the casualties of combat and how soldiers return from a war zone and can never be the same again. The film reminded me of Oliver stone's masterpiece; 'Born on the fourth of July', but wasn't quite as great as that. However this film remains compelling viewing made in Eastwood style of being uncompromising and honest, whatever your view of the war in Iraq and the US role in the middle east, put it aside and just watch this film and especially Bradley Cooper delivering a classic performance. The one thing this film lacked perhaps was the domestic life of Chris Kyle, it seemed the action in Iraq took precedence over Kyle's turmoil at home. However the film still left me strangely admiring a man who may have been a serial killer for some and a war hero for others. Don't worry about that, just enjoy a great film! @zulfmanauthor"

","Intense character study of the country's most prolific sniper. The point is made in the film that Chris Kyle's motivation came from trying to prevent terrorists from coming to San Diego or New York, a point that's lost on critics of the Iraq War and our current effort against ISIS and a host of similar minded extremist groups. Of particular note was the discussion around the dinner table with Kyle's father describing the difference between sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. I had never heard that analogy before and it seemed a fitting way to describe the way populations find themselves being categorized. The picture is a character study in the effects of war on a warrior; I didn't see it as particularly pro-war or anti-war, though one's filter will probably see it along political lines. The destructive effects of a soldier's life that affect his family is given the emotional treatment that's called for, and director Eastwood provides the steady hand a story like this deserves. Which begs the question of how Spielberg might have handled it. My understanding is he dropped out of consideration to direct the picture after the screenplay became unmanageable. A Liberal versus Conservative treatment provides plenty of food for thought and it would have been an interesting contrast to see. Nevertheless, what we have is the story of an American hero, defending the rights of critics who can only find hatred in their hearts for soldiers who love their country."

OK let's talk about the film. I know it got some controversial reviews from left and right, but that's because it's treated more like a political thing than just a biography that our hero wanted us to know about. Chris Kyle was a legendary sniper who killed more terrorists than any sniper in the 21st century. A respected man by the military and a feared warrior that earned him the name Devil of Ramadi by the Islamic terrorists. The movie does not only portray him and his career, it also portrayed him as a loving husband and father. His struggle with PTSD gave him a new mission: to help other vets who also struggle with PTSD. Bradley Cooper did a fabulous job at portraying our American warrior along with Sienna Miller who plays the beautiful Taya Kyle.

"nboyer17","9","29","61","23 January 2015"," Cooper's Commanding Turn Secures SNIPER's Legacy
","American Sniper is a subtle emotional powerhouse packed with outstanding action sequences and anchored by Bradley Cooper's intensely realistic portrayal of a man clinging to his principles in the crucible of war. <br/><br/>SNIPER is challenging on many levels. It demands that the viewer have a high tolerance for wartime horrors. It implores us to ignore the United States' politically ambiguous motives for invading Iraq. In fact, the film almost completely disregards the big picture in exchange for the understated drama of the individual soldier. The result is a fairly detached account of Chris Kyle's trials and successes during his four extensive tours in the Middle East. Since Kyle proves such a superman on the battlefield and unflinchingly sacrifices everything for his country, SNIPER runs the risk of being perceived as America propaganda. Even more problematic is the film's rather unflattering depiction of the Iraqi enemy, the ""wolves"" Kyle has sworn to defend his ""sheep"" against. <br/><br/>If Eastwood succeeds at anything, it's allowing Kyle's fanaticism to linger calmly under the surface of the proceedings. By the end, whether or not we agree with his actions or code of honor, we've grown and lived with Kyle, and come to realize that the war is not a place where decent men can flourish. Kyle, indeed, is a decent and moralistic man, perhaps oppressively so, but Eastwood convincingly places him above the judgment of his audience. Although it may not be easy to come to terms with, Chris Kyle did what he believed was necessary. It's not a question of right and wrong, it's a question of what the character believed was right and wrong. Of course, some viewers will disagree with him on an ideological level (I know I did) or reprehend him for his seemingly callous treatment of his wife and children, but this does not make the film opinionated, but rather unbiased. Sure, Eastwood glosses over his reintegration into society, he mitigates some of the moral dilemma of sniping by demonizing the enemy. But that's how Kyle got through it, by making himself believe certain things just to get by.<br/><br/>Cooper succeeds admirably at wrestling the humanity out of a man who has killed so many so unapologetically. It's undoubtedly the finest performance of his career, and definitely deserving of the Oscar nomination he received. Sienna Miller, though sidelined for the majority of the film and given precious little wiggle room by the script, also pulls her weight.<br/><br/>It's a gorgeous film to look at; it puts BLACK HAWK DOWN to shame stylistically. Overall, American Sniper is a quietly potent film from Clint Eastwood, and though some will adore it and some will despise it, I can say from a fairly unbiased perspective that it has a universally moving quality if you can put yourself in Chris Kyle's shoes, even for a moment."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","8","13","14 September 2015"," A masterpiece about the cesspool in which we are now.
","This is a great film not so much by the true story it tells as by the meaning Clint Eastwood tries to set on the table with force and poignancy.<br/><br/>In spite of all the heroism, the patriotism and the courage of these American men (note there are no women) sent to Iraq the war is lost and totally sinking in a quagmire of a cesspool because it is a useless and absurd war: there is no support for the Americans? There is no gratefulness from the Iraqis. The American troops only speak one language which is Arabic, and with interpreters in-between, which cuts them off from the vast majority of the population who speak Kurdish or Farsi, two Indo-European languages. Arabic is the language of the minority Sunni Iraqis, and what's more the language of the ""tyrant"" the Americans came to rid the country of. <br/><br/>The film shows in the worst possible horror the fact that this war has no future, had no future and it has led to an even far worse situation than before. And it was all based on a lie.<br/><br/>But the film can in no way be reduced to that. <br/><br/>The film is about the real damage done on these men (once again no women). They come back traumatized and blocked in their patriotism that becomes the cover-up of their trauma. They are going through a Post- Traumatic-Stress-Syndrome and no one can ever negate that. This sniper killed more than 160 people, most of them one by one in direct one-on- one fire since he was aiming his gun at them with the will to kill them and no others, and with only one bullet for each one, with the excuse that it was to protect his fellow soldiers. That goes against the very human instinct of survival which is that of the species and that should mean killing non-human dangers. That implies the enemies are not human. That implies the sniper is then completely deadlocked in his artificial though perfectly real mental coffin. He cannot speak. He cannot relate even to his children or to his partner.<br/><br/>That in itself is a crime against humanity. And yet Chris Kyle manages to get over it by dedicating his post-war life to helping the veterans who are suffering like him. By helping them he alleviates his own suffering. And that's when the film is a masterpiece for something like five or seven minutes. He is killed in the USA by one veteran that he takes one day to some kind of one-on-one session of physical exertion to help that veteran step over his PTSS. He is killed by one of his own side who cannot bear the consequences of his actions in Iraq, who has become insane with that Trauma. Clint Eastwood is of course extremely cautious not to imply, like a series is doing on TV, that this veteran was more or less manipulated by the insurgents in Iraq. This is here a pure act of insanity caused by the PTSS of one man.<br/><br/>This film is also very interesting because it shows with the periods between the four tours, with the birth of the children and their growing up, the passage of time, of years, and yet at the same time from one tour to another there is no change in Iraq itself the way the film describes the situation, we can even wonder if it is not getting worse. The final killing of the insurgent sniper by this American sniper will not change anything because one disappears and probably two or three can rise, or pop up where they are least expected. <br/><br/>That's when we really understand that we made a mistake by going there in the very first place. The fall of a ""dictator"" has to come from the ""victims"" of this ""dictator"" and not from foreign troops. Saddam Hussein was not Hitler with his armed forces occupying about twelve countries if not more. We completely overlooked the linguistic and cultural situation, and we go on doing so. The Kurds are in the front row against Isis but some factions of these Kurds take advantage of the situation to restart the civil war against the Turks. And some in the West want to send troops on the ground? There is no folly that is unreachable to some politicians. They never learn. <br/><br/>And how many Islamist propagandists are among the ""refugees"" that are trying to flow into Europe right now? It is so easy to be a war refugee since by principle war refugees have lost everything and first of all their identity papers and birth certificates. We humanely must help these ""refugees"" but we have to know that they are not all ""refugees,"" which implies they go through sorting out camps where they will be humanely treated but also identified and cleared up on their motivations, and also that they are going to be the new slaves of the west because they will have to work sooner or later. They are not doctors and engineers most of them, probably even nearly all of them.<br/><br/>This film tries to make us feel that when one mistake is made there is no end to it and even stepping out of it is not an end because the problem comes back through the window when it has been swept out through the door, and if there is no window it will use the chimney. The war in Iraq was a typical 19th century colonial war and it led to the very same catastrophes. Will we ever learn the lessons of Vietnam and Algeria, to give two examples? I guess not.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

All the people who hate this movie are saying ""He murdered over a hundred people, without looking them in the face, and that is just cowardly!"" You people who think this are forgetting what might be on the other side of the choice. If Chris listened to all of the people who complain, hundreds of US soldiers would come home in a box. And saying he didn't feel anything and called them savages? Every time he shot someone part of him would die with the person. You can't go to War, Shoot people who don't know they are about to die, and come home not feeling any different. This movie didn't glorify Chris Kyle at all-it just made him what he really was. And the 'savages'? When you've killed over a hundred people, you have to find a way to stay sane. Chris' way was to realize that those 'savages' would have killed his fellow SEALs and Marines. Him calling them savages was just his way of thinking, and if you don't agree with that, you can't change it and you shouldn't try to change it."
"bkoganbing","8","6","9","6 July 2015"," The Most lethally effective sniper the USA ever trained.
","Although American Sniper did take one Oscar home for Best Sound Editing, it is Bradley Cooper's performance as Chris Kyle, the Audie Murphy of the Iraq War.<br/><br/>I say that because after reading Tony Curtis's memoirs where he tells of working with Murphy when they were both young contract players at Universal-International, Cooper's performance really resonated with me. To say the Iraq war of intervention is controversial is putting it mildly. Murphy's war by the history written was a 'good' war where all who served were somehow heroes. Murphy the most decorated soldier in our history was described by Curtis as suffering post traumatic stress similar to what Cooper shows us in Kyle. Curtis recalls that he and others gave Audie a wide berth at Universal, never knowing when a hair trigger temper would go off.<br/><br/>Still Murphy left the war behind other than doing a war picture or three in Hollywood. By contrast Kyle never left his war behind with four different duties in Iraq. His skills were essential, the most lethally effective sniper our Armed Forces ever produced. <br/><br/>Seeing what we see in American Sniper will make no one a cheerleader for the Iraq War. It certainly unnerved Chris Kyle. His lifeline to a normal existence turns out to be his wife Sienna Miller and his family. Far more than in a marriage to a civilian or even with most military marriages. Without Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle would truly have been a lost soul.<br/><br/>The war is realistically depicted by director Clint Eastwood. Eastwood unlike John Wayne with The Green Berets had the good sense not to make a World War II film for this conflict. Which with Isis now on the scene may still not be over.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing American Sniper for the strength of Bradley Cooper's performance and the overall ensemble performances of the cast. It is so far the best depiction of the Iraq War on screen."

"atlasmb","8","28","59","6 February 2015"," A Well-Acted Story of Loss
","There seems to be a dearth of reviews that stick to the merits of this film. I will try to do better, though the intent of the director is a valid discussion point.<br/><br/>First of all, I think the acting is excellent. Bradley Cooper is believable as a gung-ho marine and Sienna Miller really conveys the heartache of a spouse who feels she has no control over her life and her future.<br/><br/>The scenes in the battle zones feel authentic, with a real sense of danger and uncertainty. The house to house fighting feels claustrophobic, adding to the suspense.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is based upon a true story. Sometimes it is difficult to discover what liberties are taken, but those I have read about are significant, if few. I really wish that filmmakers who take liberties with history would add a post script in the credits that details the facts that are changed. This would be a service to everyone and demonstrate the filmmaker's dedication to transparency and the truth.<br/><br/>Hero. It's a word that is used too easily and too often. Those who, upon watching the film, declare Chris Kyle to be a hero, are, I think, imposing their own agenda upon the film's narrative. In scenes, we see that Chris is programmed by his father from an early age to view the world in simplistic terms. Once he accepts the world view of his father, he is little more than a bullet waiting to be fired. Yes, he has free will, but in a world where the United States is almost always involved in military conflict, he is destined to join the armed forces. In his case, 9/11 is the trigger.<br/><br/>In the film, Kyle is a victim, not a hero. Once he fulfills his destiny and signs up, he is compelled to continue on this track. He cannot even admit to himself that he suffers from mental illness, let alone to his wife or an analyst. He becomes incapable of truly showing his love, even to his wife or children. Note that he never smiles when on leave, but he frequently laughs while on duty, even on missions. <br/><br/>The movie also points out the pervasiveness of the gun culture--for those who seek it. Kyle is raised to value guns and to cherish the stopping of ""a beating heart"". It is natural that his military experience would center on his talent with a gun. Unfortunately, in his job as a sniper, he must make moral judgments from a distance--something that is virtually impossible to do without error. This fact comes to be the source of his mental decline, though he never admits the source of his breakdown. Because he never identifies the issue, he easily continues his attachment to guns afterwards, something that eventually destroys him.<br/><br/>To those who will watch this film with an open mind, it does have lessons to learn, though it appears the director tried to subvert those lessons in the final scenes. Regardless of the director's intentions, the film speaks for itself and it tells a story of loss, not the story of redemption that some choose to see."

What we are left with is something that is both seriously unrealistic and panders to the mainstream appetite.

","There has been controversy over this film. The problem with those against it is that they don't understand what this film is about. It's about following one soldier and his experience in combat and what happens to him. People are beside themselves over the ""politics"" of the film. Well, I don't see any politics. Maybe that's enraging to some just because the politics of The Iraq War are never discussed.<br/><br/>I personally was against our going into Iraq. I remember watching ""We Were Soldiers"" with Mel Gibson just before the war started. This was another movie that was about the soldiers. The war in question there was The Vietnam War. Yet, that film didn't have any politics in it either. It was about the soldiers who fought. They signed up to serve their country. They didn't sign up for serving their country if they agreed with the war. They fought regardless. That is what soldiers do. If you have any questions about our nation deciding to wage a war, the only people you need to address is our elected representatives. They make the decision. Then, the soldiers fight. The soldiers have no say in the decision to fight that war. Once the soldiers are in the war, their lives are about doing what they've been ordered to do. And, it's about watching over each other. That's it, and that's the way it is.<br/><br/>This movie is about Chris Kyle, and what happens to him and to those around him. That is the structure of the movie. So, if people have a problem with that, that is up to them. I don't. I understand what Clint Eastwood intended to do with this film, and I think he, his cast and crew did a tremendous job.<br/><br/>The depiction of combat is nerve wracking. But, it is the effects on Kyle and his men that cut to the core. It should remind everyone what our men and women in the military do for their country.<br/><br/>********* (9 Out of 10 Stars)"

I haven't read the autobiography of Chris Kyle but I think the director has succeeded in presenting the gist of the book with a very graceful touch of cinematography.

","Finally got to see American Sniper last night and I loved it. I thought it was a detailed account of the life of Chris Kyle. Yes it was full of American propaganda but what American War film isn't? At the end of the day, say what you want about this film but I think Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job by bringing the life of Chris Kyle onto our screens. Many people on here have said that they think Chris Kyle was not a hero but a murderer. He was doing his job and protected his fellow soldiers like he should have. I do not believe that Clint Eastwood made all Iraqi's look like 'Terrorists' as many of you have said, if you actually listened during the film you would have heard that everyone was evacuated from their homes for their safety but the ones that remain were mainly looking to fight. They were barging into peoples homes but that home should have been empty, there should not have been families inside as they should have fled the area for their own safety. They were not glorifying war, in fact they were doing quite the opposite and showed how the war can effect your mental health. My brother came home from war and he needed medical help to get him back to the way he was before he went on tour. To summarise, I believe this film portrayed an American HERO (that's right, he was a hero), his story was incredible and his family should be extremely proud of him. Yet another amazing film by Clint Eastwood and brilliant acting by Bradley Cooper. Bravo!"
"Troy_Campbell","9","22","45","23 January 2015"," Gripping, gruelling and gritty.
","After his film version of Jersey Boys failed to light the world on fire last year, Clint Eastwood has wasted very little time getting back on the horse. Based on the true story of Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. history, Eastwood's latest is flush with heart-stopping action, nail-biting tension and dread-building drama. Clint has always excelled in presenting the dark corners of humanity – see Unforgiven, Changeling or Mystic River for proof – but at 84 years of age, it's astounding how grittily authentic he can portray a modern war. His long- time director of photography, Tom Stern, must get a large portion of the praise; his atmospheric cinematography and bold camera movements are the driving force behind the unnerving suspense that underpins the entire movie. It's also cleverly edited, utilising jump cuts to take you from warzone to home front in a split second, emphasising the sharpness of Kyle's emotional frustration when not on the battlefield. Which leads to Kyle himself. An everyday Texan who enjoys rodeo, loves his country and happens to be a crack shot, Kyle is likable, grounded and just the right side of patriotic and macho, thanks to a mesmerising turn from Bradley Cooper. Deservingly amongst the awards chatter, Cooper demonstrates how wide-ranging his talent is by adding yet another stellar performance to his C.V, placing him in the very highest echelon of actors working today. A gruelling, raw and wholly compelling peek at a niche military job: American Sniper is this year's Hurt Locker."
"robert-378","10","29","62","21 January 2015"," Way better than the book
","I not sure how I stumbled on the book, but I listened to it a few months before Chris Kyles death in 2013. I liked the book, but I would certainly not rank it in any top ten list. Since then I have learned a lot more about his life after the war including the help he gave other soldiers with PTSD that ultimately cost him his life. The movie gave a much better depiction of how Chris Kyle changed and developed as a person over his life that you could ever get from the book. I read somewhere that the screenwriter used many sources outside of the book to develop the script and I believe it. This is an absolute must see movie if you can handle the obvious violence that comes with modern day war movies. It grips you from the opening seen to the solemn ending. I am from Minnesota so I must add - shame on you Jesse Ventura."

","Binding of American weapons and comes cot, at least in some regions, a tradition that passes from father to son. And Chris Kyle main character of the film was born into these families, where as a child learns to shoot and hunt, learn to defend his younger brother, father raised him who can hit and hurt if you have an argument. Then-Texas, working in rodeos, see on television the terrorist attacks on American embassies and World Trade Center, then resolves save as much as possible their compatriots, enlists in the army, following hard training to become a sniper. This is very exalted, patriotism, is a film dedicated to it. Amid the tension war is great, any movement on the street must be carefully analyzed, the shooter virtually alone decides what to do, this voltage his first death is cause great impact on the viewer. Here comes a shooter on the side of terrorists who kill Kyle's partners, the task now is to finish him off. That comes and goes, are 4 trips, which last about 6 months each, conflicts with his wife, great concern to leave his post for the rest, generates a gradual stress, adding further stress to the viewer, looking than at any time will freak out. A great movie, good story, the film is virtually Bradley Cooper, not leaving another good performance. I enjoyed the moments of tension, somewhat reminiscent of the movie ""The Hurt Locker"". At the end when Kyle returns from war, we still have a dramatic piece of history, dealing with your stress, trying to treatment, we see the most humane movie, even a great hero can not win all alone, it is also a victim. It was worth it and point. Now the question is whether you will be awarded, is a good candidate."
"jjustinjaeger","3","74","177","7 December 2014"," Saw this with six friends, everyone agreed, poorly done
","Let's begin with the editing. The film was generically paced throughout. The editing served no greater purpose than to show what was going on and make it look like an action movie. At points during battle scenes the sequences of shots became meaningless and not progressive as we are just fed a usual diet of ""cut to guy shooting, cut to people getting shot, cut to other guys, cut to some other people getting shot,"" rarely with interjecting character and emotion. Additionally, some scenes were just unnecessary, like the training scene at the beginning, at which point I was like, ""why are we seeing this? Oh yeah, because every war movie just has to have the drill sergeant and training montage."" Lame. The film is over two hours and there is little ebb and flow in story. We're at home, then combat, then no combat, then some more combat, etc.<br/><br/>Now the cinematography. Like the editing, it couldn't have been more standard. At points it even failed to light the characters' faces properly. The images were often flat and uninteresting. The cinematographer could have chosen to do something interesting with the sandstorm scene and maybe had the characters silhouetted, but no. It looked like a brownish filter was put over the lens so all we get is a murky frame. Very standard.<br/><br/>Now the writing. It's based off of a very nationalistic memoir, so don't expect it to dig into any moral or political issues of war. Honestly it does justice to the troops that we should be honoring and the protagonist in particular. But the protagonist is also pretty shallow. He has a one-track mind, that a soldier's duty is to kill, and he abides by this and nothing really challenges his ideas. The end. The protagonist also holds very masculine ideals of himself that it seems most males in America are socialized to hold. It doesn't question this. It embraces it. Especially in the scene where the father and son are going for some good old American hunting. The development of the character lies in his PTSD which would be interesting if it were dug into more, but the development of that remains surface level. I would complain that the housewife with the baby is a cliché if it weren't based off of a true story. The housewife actually has an emotionally compelling story but we don't see her out of the house and she remains loyal. And then the movie kind of just ends. The story never really felt like it climaxes, although I wasn't waiting for more. It's dedicated to its message of honoring those who fight for our country.<br/><br/>Your turn, Clint Eastwood. You get credit for the mediocre work of the cinematography and editing as well. You get credit for the unwavering patriotism evoked in the film and the bias towards the story. When we look at a film such as The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, we get riveting action, deep character study, and objectivity in examining political issues. Those films are infinitely more perceptive than Sniper.<br/><br/>Now the acting wasn't bad. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller were both good. They did well with what they were given. <br/><br/>And lastly I just want to mention THE F***ING BABY. There is a scene between husband, wife, and baby and the baby is clearly a f***ing doll. It was laughably fake. Cooper holds the child in a medium shot where the doll's limbs are dangling, not clinging like babies do, and it looked really unnatural. People in the theater laughed out loud, including me. And the scene was supposed to be very serious."

"Wuchakk","7","12","22","26 April 2015"," Tribute to Hero Chris Kyle (R.I.P.)
","Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" (2015) is similar to 2014's ""Lone Survivor"" in that they're both straight war flicks based on true stories, the former taking place in Iraq and the latter in Afghanistan. While these movies are similar in theme, tone and quality, I give ""American Sniper"" the edge.<br/><br/>Most reading this realize that Kyle was murdered in 2013, along with Chad Littlefield, as they were helping some piece of sheet with his post-traumatic stress disorder. In February, 2015, the scumbag was sentenced to life in prison without parole.<br/><br/>Since ""American Sniper"" is about a recent American hero with, by far, the most kills of any American sniper in history (on record, that is), it's obviously pro-American and, consequently, indirectly ant-liberal. As such, the film gets raves from conservatives and utter loathing from far-left types. (Why a loony leftist would even want to see a movie like this is puzzling. Who goes to a movie they know they won't like? Which goes to show that many of the leftists who give ""American Sniper"" the absolute lowest rating didn't even view it). As for me, I don't evaluate movies based upon their patriotism or political leanings; I grade them according to their quality, the most important thing being whether or not the movie is compelling. Someone can make a movie that perfectly agrees with my perspective on life, but if it's mediocre, unimaginative and boring then it's not a good movie and I'll say so.<br/><br/>That said, I found ""American Sniper"" worthwhile because it's the first movie I've seen to offer a first-hand look at what it was like to fight in Iraq. Bradley Cooper is very convincing as the humble yet resilient Kyle. So this is a solid war flick that somewhat addresses the negative effects of war and it's sure to please (particularly) conservative/patriotic types, but it lacks that special perspective or flair that marks great war films, like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Fury,"" ""The Thin Red Line,"" ""Where Eagles Dare,"" ""Glory,"" ""Ride with the Devil,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""The Young Lions"" and ""Paths of Glory."" <br/><br/>The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Morocco and Southern California.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

No empathy, no morality and absolutely no ethics. But, when I started to sense that Chris had PTSD, it caught my interest. I thought ""Maybe I didn't quit catch the meaning of this movie until now?"" He was careless, only thinking of war, protecting his baby girl, attacking a dog (IRL he killed two people) and when he pointed a gun at his wife, I was so sure he'd shoot.

I have many friends who were close to the front lines and heard varying stories about what they did and saw. Unless you've served the military in some capacity I supposed it'd be hard to understand what Chris Kyle did. Some have called him a coward...and that's just absurd. He personally saved hundreds, maybe thousands of military and civilian lives because of his expertise. This film crafted by Clint Eastwood and superbly acted by Bradley Cooper was a character study...never intended to be any kind of a political film. It tells the story of how Chris Kyle used his extraordinary talent to support his fellow military during 4 deployments to the war zones. It also shows how conflicted Kyle was...he wanted to be there for his comrades, but also be a good husband and father back home. I thought the film did a very credible job of capturing that struggle. Again, unless you've been deployed or worked with those who have, it would be more difficult to understand what Eastwood and Cooper tried to portray. The showing my wife and I went to was attended by mostly senior citizens. As the credits were rolling, there were very few dry eyes in the theater. Some stayed in their seats so shaken and emotional they needed some time to leave. That's what filmmakers strive to do...to move their audience. And on that score, Eastwood and Cooper certainly did."
"foehammere419","10","17","34","16 February 2015"," A Must-Watch Film
","Ever since I read the book I had high expectations for the film. That being said, the film went above and beyond what I was expecting. I was completely blown away. Bradley Cooper truly delivered on his finest role ever (in my opinion at least), and Clint Eastwood's directing was outstanding. The film made it seem like I was on the battlefield with Chief Chris Kyle (even though I'm not in the service) and looked death in the eye like he did. But it also reminds me of those who do serve/have served, and my appreciation for what they do to protect our country has gone up so many levels. In closing, American Sniper is a must-watch film, and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. To all those who serve/have served our country: thank you for your service, and God bless America!!"
"supersohail","2","42","97","22 January 2015"," Somewhat Entertaining but Brutally Dishonest
","Great action movie but unfortunately there's barely a shred of historical accuracy to this film. It somehow links the embassy bombings in Kenya and 9/11 to the Iraq War, then skips a few more years to show Al Qaeda in Iraq. It completely leaves out the fact that Al Qaeda took over Iraq and now runs most of it THANKS to the Iraq War. It leaves out the fact that ""wmds"" were the reason we went to Iraq and this later turned out to be a manufactured reason. In reality, Chris Kyle basically installed ISIL in power in Iraq. Does that still make him the good guy? The movie shows him as a ""victim"" and essentially all Iraqis are evil or faceless. This is basically just a war propaganda movie along the lines of something North Korea would release - but better special effects."

","So we just saw this movie at the Dollar Theater. I wasn't pro on seeing it but I went anyway. I'm very glad I did. It was very worth it. It's right up there with Saving Private Ryan and Sergeant York. It doesn't glorify war or glamorize it. But it is honorable, patriotic and a bit of a tear jerker. Bradley Cooper is a great actor but I was impressed by Sienna Miller. I have been always been against us going to Iraq but I feel I understand better the reasons men go. Now it's a movie and semi-autobiographical, Clint Eastwood takes a few indiscretions. So for some people that's a reason not to see it. However the story was told very well, it had some very tense moments and it's an important fresh part of our history that needs to be told."
"hopsinglinglao","3","46","108","16 January 2015"," Should be titled ""Telegraphing Everything to the Audience""
","Firstly, Brad Cooper is a shining light in this film and deserves some or many awards, no doubt the acting was amazing. The film, story, ham handed script, and visual effects, not so good. I was surprised this serious material was turned into another Hollywood fantasy video game filled with bad, expendables level CGI blood effects, terrible fake rubber babies, and mustache twirling terrorists that are apparently led by a parkour loving sniper & phantom of the opera style, cape wearing villain. I half expected these one-dimensional caricatures to start yelling out ""durka durka durka"" -- Dear Hollywood, people DO NOT TALK LIKE THIS. Idiots in this movie may as well have been winking into the camera while delivering exposition like ""YOU DID IT"" and ""THEY ARE EVIL"" and ""GET SOME"" .. ridiculous 6 year old level writing that belongs in a Stallone film. No matter what your politics, one thing is for sure, this type of material should be taken more seriously and not turned into just another blockbuster action film with made up scenarios that did not happen in the true story. And speaking of which, is it protocol for snipers to just decide they want to suddenly leave their position and join foot soldiers in house raids? And can snipers also just start pretending they are in CSI Iraq and run around interrogating people to gather intel on high level targets? If so, then, OK. Either way this film is laughably simplistic in its delivery of the ham fisted messages, especially in regards to forcing us to feel one way or another during any given situation. WE GET IT OK? Let us for once think for ourselves and see beyond just black and white caricatures who speak their every thought aloud and always with prolific clarity. Hollywood does not seem to realize that they keep making war films with war heroes who act like they KNOW they are in a movie and KNOW they are being paid millions for it. I will say some of the very obvious non-actor veterans also shined in the film but overall this movie is empty, action for the sake of action, telegraphed, garbage that people seem to swallow these days as serious. It is one level above Team America in that regard, Have fun but no thanks on this one."
"garak99","2","41","95","22 January 2015"," A Tragic American Life
","The reviews of American Sniper consist of two camps 1-Pro War 2- Anti War I feel neither is correct I think it was a simple tragic film. The Tragic Life of Chris Kyle a American Military Sniper. A early scene was Chris as a young boy was taken hunting by his father deer hunting and let Chris shoot and l kill a deer whereby his father praised him for the killing Chris felt he did something cool and manly. Although it's never said in the scene it does suggest this is where Chris first feels the thrill of killing a thrill not unlike every serial killer that ever lived has felt We jump ahead a few years to where Chris is watching the CNN news coverage of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. Which proms Chris to become all patriotic joining the navy and not just the navy but the nave SEALS. During four tours in the Iraq war Kyle looses all humanity referring to the Iraqis as ""Those Savages"". shooting and killing those savages Men, Woman, Children it mattered not to him it was just another day at the office. During those four tours rotating from his home in Texas back to the war it Iraq as if it was normal to do so. What ruined Chris Kyle's life was misguided loyalties that he put that God and Country nonsense ahead of his family His attention, loyalty and his entire being was his fellow soldiers and protecting those back home by doing this his wife and children became a afterthought just another piece of furniture in the room. He did not realize this until he was in a battle during that fourth deployment. All during the film a verse of RESCUE MISSION a Kris Kristofferson song written by Kristofferson, Roger McGuinn and Bob Nuwirth that goes ""The hell with all your heroes and the wounds they hope to show I'm just a simple soldier with one more year to go"" meaning do your duty then get the hell out and let someone else take over where you left off. The war scenes were loud, bloody and violent but director Eastwood does not not go as far as what the late director Sam Peckinpah knows for his bloody battles would probable have done. In the end Poetic Justice was served as Chris Kyle's life ended in the same way he lived it at the wrong end of a bullet."
"md621","10","18","37","10 February 2015"," Fabulous portrayal of how war tears at the human sole
","The only reason American Sniper gets 1 ratings is because some people hate to see a pro-American war movie succeed. However this movie is more than soldiers killing the enemy and vice-versa. It is powerful in its depiction of how war molds people and the burden they carry long after the battle is fought. Chris Kyle, make no mistake, is an American hero. He is torn between his commitment to his wife and children and the soldiers he so dearly wants to protect. He does 4 tours and the emotional damage is evident with every return from the battles. Whether you like to dislike the real life Chris Kyle, one cannot say this was a bad movie. It is gritty and gut wrenching. Like Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven - perhaps he best western ever, American Sniper is one of the best war movies ever made. This is not your John Wayne rah, rah propaganda. This shows the horrors of war and the tolls it takes on the survivors. It is not to be missed."

"rmax304823","5","9","16","4 August 2015"," Center Mass?
","It's a gripping movie about a sniper in the Navy Seals who serves four tours in the Middle East and then is killed at home by a veteran he was trying to help. The scenes of action are well done, positively spooky, especially a fire fight in the middle of a sandstorm, where no one knows where anyone else is, or, if they see a figure, whether it's friend or foe. And it's informative. It never occurred to me that in the middle of a battle you could make a phone call to your home between bullets.<br/><br/>But I was confused as to the movie's intent. If we take the story at face value, it's almost a cartoon. Very polite Texan boy learns to shoot on the prairie, then becomes a sniper after watching 9/11 on the television. ""Those men are my enemies."" ""I have to defend my country."" Are we to take that literally? Some of it sounds like a World War II comic book, the kind of remember so well. Not that Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle has much to say. He's a bulky man with an ordinary face who says ""Yes, sir"" and ""No, sir."" He swears little.<br/><br/>And his career takes him to the Middle East where he becomes a hero. The shooting of an armed woman and an armed young boy doesn't bother him, nor does it bother the viewer for more than a second, nor is it shown in a way that should bother anyone.<br/><br/>The fire fights are vivid and there is no question of Kyle's bravery. But then neither do we get much of Kyle's character beyond what little the film is prepared to tell us. Only once, does his tension break through that composed surface, when he almost kills a dog that is playfully wrestling with someone at a picnic.<br/><br/>There is his wife and child at home, of course. He clearly cares deeply for them. Sienna Miller doesn't have much to do except unfurl the stereotyped role of the wife who wants her husband at home, not risking his life overseas. John Wayne's wives and girl friends always had the same complaint.<br/><br/>Kyle's character is capable of making the kinds of harmless insults and jokes that abound in companies of men. He jokes about his wounded brother's having a two-inch penis. And he smiles. But then he always smiles except when there is no expression on his face at all. He's sincere throughout and dies ironically and, nicely, off screen in an epilogue.<br/><br/>The movie leaps ahead and skips lightly over his SEAL training and all the rest of his initial adjustment to the military. And there are other gaps. We don't see him become the Number One SEAL sniper, a hero. We're told that he's such. The morality of the Iraq invasion is never brought up. That glimpse of 9/11 was enough. ""Blackhawk Down"" never questioned our presence in Mogadishu, but was a far better film.<br/><br/>I had a hard time making heads or tails out of his military career, his family life, or anything else about him, except that he's sincere, selfless, and motivated by patriotism. That's not telling very much about what's going on inside his head. And, not being the sort of man given to introspection, there may in fact not be much else. <br/><br/>For whatever reason, he appears to have exaggerated his decorations. He claims two Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars with valor. More detailed records from Kyle's personnel file only reflect one Silver Star and three Bronze stars instead of the five he wrote about. <br/><br/>As I said, I found it a confusing film into which almost anything can be read -- or it can be taken as the simple, integumental story that we see, without thinking about it.<br/><br/>I find it more difficult to grasp what Clint Eastwood is getting at as he grows older. His early films were mostly junk about comic chimpanzees and uninteresting cowboy figures. But then he directed ""Unforgiven,"" which raised a multitude of challenging questions.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" poses a question too: What is ""American Sniper""?"
"midas-jacobs","8","9","16","15 May 2015"," pretty enjoyable movie
","The movie follows the live of Chris Kyle, Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. history. <br/><br/>The movie starts of kind of lame, it's not a bad beginning, but it could've bin better. In my opinion, I thought the kid actor, who played Chris, couldn't act. that's what bothered me the most. and then when Chris grows up, the movie get's better. Bradly Cooper did a really good acting job, and it surprises me that he didn't get an Oscar for his acting preformens. A thing that also bothered me was that I didn't really got the chance to get to know the characters. Like when Marc and Biggles died, I didn't really feel sad. When I was reading the book and they died, I felt sad. So in my opinion they should have followed the book better up. But what I really liked from the movie was the sound and directing. Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job on directing it, he made every shot look like a piece of art. and the sound was very good, it was good edited, and it sounded really good.<br/><br/>So overall i think it is a pretty good movie. I don't know what score I am going to give it, yet. And one last thing, I don't understand why people see this as propaganda. It is the life of a person who served his country. I don't get why this should encourage you to go to the army. In the book he explains better what kind of hell war is. But in the movie you can really see what war has done to him. how he got paranoid and thought that everything was some kind of danger."
"archydarkside","1","32","73","2 February 2015"," Laughable & disappointing waste of time
","STORYLINE FAIL: So why 1 out of 10? Here is why: While Cooper's acting was commendable, the movie itself lacks any connected storyline. Even the events that are shown in the movie fail to present how he was in the eyes of marines, what they thought of him, his behavior while off duty etc.<br/><br/>CONCEPT OF A HERO: What makes a hero? A hero is not someone who invades other country on false CIA intelligence and kills innocent people who had nothing to do with 9/11. Most of the hijackers were S.Arabian but Iraqi people paid the price in blood. Chris Kyle did nothing heroic - he killed people who defended their homeland from invaders. Even if his actions saved the lives of American marines, those same marines and he himself were sent there on a CIA lie. You want example of true American hero snipers? 2 Delta Force snipers Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon who covered the rescue of wounded peacekeeping soldiers in helicopter crash in Somalia. (Events are portrayed in Black Hawk Down movie)<br/><br/>Simo Hayha is Finnish hero sniper - he killed Russians who invaded Finland. Vasily Zaytsev is Russian hero sniper - he killed Nazis who invaded Russia. Chris Kyle is an American murderer who killed not only Iraqi people but also people in America. He spat lies about Jesse Ventura. And the only good thing this film did, is to make money so his widow can pay Ventura's lawsuit now. That and illustration of PTSD influence. I'll give it points for that.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: If you still decide to watch the movie, do it by all means. However, think about what propaganda is being SOLD to you, and maybe, just maybe if you decide never to join the armed forces, because you realize that those are not in service of USA people anymore but in service of big military company's lobby, then this film will open your eyes and do good for you."
"seenu1473","2","35","81","27 January 2015"," A Disappointing movie....surprisingly by a very good Director
","A disappointing war movie or should I say an ""amazing"" movie promoting the American war on Iraq....No price for guessing Clint Eastwood's intentions on making this movie. Ignoring the political angle to this movie and if I were to review this only from a movie's perspective and nothing less, it still fails miserably. <br/><br/>The storytelling in the movie was just plain flat. The movie left me with no afterthoughts about war and the collateral damages that it brings along with it. There was no character building of Chris Kyle nor did the movie stimulate in me, any connection with Chris Kyle's character nor garner any sympathy towards him. It was funny how Chirs Kyle's character seems lost (although a bit forced it may seem) while he is on a break at home between his four war tours, but seems perfectly fine when he is back on war front. It almost seemed like he was having a great time killing people during war, but was depressed when he wasn't, back home. <br/><br/>Seems Clint Eastwood made this movie just to cash in on the emotions of a particular segment of die hard American's who blindly believe that the Americans are the victims of terror and the rest of the world...particularly anyone from the Middle East are terrorists and butchers.....including Children. AND, the invasion of Iraq post 9/11 is totally justified although Iraq has nothing to do with 9/11. <br/><br/>Please don't waste your time and money watching this poorly made movie. In stead, if you want to watch a good Sniper movie...please spend your money on buying a copy of ""Sniper"" (1993 Tom Berenger) or better yet ""The Enemy at the Gates"" or if a plain war movie is your flair....then you are better off with some classics and older movies like ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""The Hurt Locker"" to name a few. <br/><br/>So in summary....a beeeeeeeg thumbs down to American Sniper and Clint Eastwood."

","I'm speechless for the amount of bullshit they tried to feed the audience with this movie and I am eager to know what order was behind the production of such a sham! I do apologize to the family of Chris Kyle (the real sniper) for writing this review in this tone, I know he was murdered recently and the pain is still fresh but I guess they made themselves ready when they sold the right of making a movie based on the deceased's book. Chris Kyle's book title is ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History"" Autobiography of the most lethal... means the guy was so proud of being the most lethal and in my opinion, whoever is proud of being ""The Most Lethal"", has serious mental problem, period! So we are not dealing with a hero, we are dealing with a 2 bit bully redneck who was brought up with guns shooting animals he was not going to eat... (I'm not against hunting but I believe if you kill an animal, you have to eat it! If you kill an animal for pure pleasure, you are mentally unstable). The cheesiness of the movie begins with Kyle being touched with seeing the news of bombing US embassy. Its' not pleasant for anyone to hear that a place got bombed and people got killed but his reaction looked like a senator from Senate's foreign affairs committee not a redneck somewhere in Texas. So he decides to sign up. Now what's the real version? He was probably a redneck out of job and options, signed up for military to get the sign up bonus and get his life on track, not heroic but respectable decision. He is being trained as seal. Good for him but even a kid knows that the identity of seals is almost kept secret if not top secret so a seal goes to the bar, drinking and probably speaking about the secrets of the U.S. Navy, that may happen but that is deemed as irresponsible act punishable under martial and even civilian law and I highly suspect that was not how he met his wife. People like to lie about these things and they have years to come up with a glorified version! I wouldn't be surprised if they originally met in a Yahoo! chat room! Now 9/11 happens. Again that senatorish look while seeing the news but I know what is behind that look ""Fuck! Now I have to go to war!!!"" They go to Iraq. It's war, it's fair game. Americans kill Iraqis. Iraqi's kill American. On the battle field, none are evil, they just follow the orders and its fair game, its just business. No need to mention that USA was on the evil side, invading a country on totally unacceptable pretext! Like those of Hitler's on invading Poland. In Iraq Kyle meets his arch enemy. An Arab sniper who we never know who he was and for the rest of the movie he wants to hunt him down. He will eventually but I suspect that the whole story is fictitious. Kyle was not a hero. He enjoyed killing people as he enjoyed killing bucks, he was probably highly delusional who wrote an autobiography based on his delusions.<br/><br/>Eastwood instead of trying to decipher a sniper's real personality and mix it with some events from the book so he can tell that the movie is based on actual events, decided to make a movies 100% based on Kyle's delusional book and capitalize on it in which he succeeded greatly. He did a great job of depicting the obsolete concept of ""Americans are always right and everyone else is evil and stupid"" once more! By making this movie he put everyone in difficult situation. Kyle's family now have to hear these harsh word on their beloved decease, a murder suspect may not get impartial trial because of this movie. Who knows? maybe Kyle had some problems, maybe he was murdered while trying to bully a trouble veteran while given his record, no one would have questioned him. He was murdered in 2013 and a movie was made in 2014. Maybe Eastwood taught he was too old and for him its now or never.<br/><br/>Overall an awful one dimensional movie, do not waste you money as I did!

One thing i know for sure, it won't win!!<br/><br/>the film is a series of clichés, one after the other, totally predictable from start to finish, and rips off many war films lacking in originality to the story. the whole film feels so familiar and you would seem to feel you have watched it before in countless movies and TV shows before, the whole American soldier struggling with emotions and effects of war, the PTSD, just lame and done soooo many times before, its old!<br/><br/>I also understand that at times, you need to retell stories, and remake certain genres of movies and reintroduce them with a new twist or take, but here, the visions of Eastwood as director lacks big time and he does not add anything special or worthy to the film.<br/><br/>Bradely Cooper does a good job, he is a good actor. but again, his role here was typical and the storyline did not help.<br/><br/>some nice action sequences here and there, but nothing that tops a Call of duty game action scene.<br/><br/>the whole film feels empty, it suffers from void. and despite the prolonged character development, you still don't get strongly attached to the characters, especially the wife who keeps complaining that Chris is always away, and when he is at home, he is not really there!! we really don't see her suffering, and so she ends up being a whining lame wife. <br/><br/>A weak film, predictable, average at best."

","Read more @ Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)<br/><br/>Demonstrating competent war scenes, along with an astounding and near unrecognizable performance from two-time Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood's new film ""American Sniper"" falters on storytelling and thematic developments. Continuously going back to the sacrifice that our military men and women make, which is perfectly fine, but beating the audience over the head with the sacrifice they make is something we've seen before. <br/><br/>The tagline of the poster reads: ""the most lethal sniper in American history."" You'd expect to see a lot more sniping that led this man to becoming a ""legend,"" which is what everyone calls him. The inner turmoil for a soldier is understood, but what more does Eastwood and scribe James Dean Hall have to say? Evidently, not much. If you're looking for a tribute to a soldier, than the film suffices. If you're looking for a good movie, then this oddly constructed, and often times uninteresting piece will leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>Eastwood has taken on war films before with ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" One of those is gorgeously constructed and moving. Eastwood is obviously pro-soldiers, as we should all be however, the film often rings false as Chris Kyle goes from cowboy, to enlistment, to watching the twin towers fall, and wanting nothing more than to continue to serve. Surely that can be the case in real life with the real Kyle, and this is no disrespect to his sacrifice and memory, but hardly anything that is presented on-screen feels authentic.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has proved his worth for the past two years with work in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle."" As Chris Kyle, this could be the best work Cooper has done yet. Unrecognizable and emulating the works of a Heath Ledger and/or Jeremy Renner, Cooper creates Kyle from the legs up, giving him beats that elevate the material. One scene in particular will rid any doubts that anyone has ever had as him as an actor. He's a marvelous wonder to behold.<br/><br/>Sienna Miller is vastly wasted in a character that will go down as one of the worst of the year. The supportive wife equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, an overwhelming feeling of annoyance is present every time Miller shares the screen. <br/><br/>Tom Stern's camera has finally been given a flash lens as we're finally able to decipher what's going on. A dust storm is expertly shot that helps create palpable tension. The best scene of the film. <br/><br/>This is one of the Eastwood's strongest attempts at recapturing his magic from ""Million Dollar Baby"" but he comes nowhere within its vicinity on quality. I'm unapologetically a person that didn't find ""Invictus"" a catastrophe and that remains one of his better efforts as of late. ""American Sniper"" will have its fans but Bradley Cooper is the only take away from the picture. That's a marvel to watch. Everything else, not so much."

","American Sniper : I remember the same time last year i was watching the lone survivor and it was one of the best movies of the year and this year i have started with the American Sniper one of the best movies of this year so far , American sniper is true story of the deadliest sniper in the US Army Chris kyle , Bradley cooper was the right choice for the role as he delivers a power packed performance and arguably his best performance till date and what can i say about Clint 'The Great' Eastwood he has once gain delivered an intense action movie which will have you at the edge of your seat ,I am not sure why there is lot of hatred around this movie as i don't know what people expect a sniper to do or why so much discussion about the moral compass of Chris has been made , you don't go a war to make friends and whatever Chris kyle did for his country was commendable to say the very least and he did save a lot of his fellow seals and marine's , he was a true national hero , the one who didn't get the recognition he deserved. In reality there are no Avengers or Xmen to save the day it is people like Chris kyle who are true heroes and who lay there lives everyday in the battlefield. "" I was just protecting my guys, they were trying to kill... our soldiers and I... I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took"""
"alindsay-al","8","13","26","28 January 2015"," a great film that highlights an incredible life
","I have seen many different perspectives on this film but for me I think it is great and I think that people should see it. This film documents the life of Chris Kyle who is the deadliest sniper in the US military of all time racking up a body count of almost 200 kills. Now Bradley Cooper is fantastic in this film and has really brought Chris Kyle to life and make the character a person we can believe in. He deserves his Oscar nomination and I think he does a great job in the tough guy role. Siena Miller plays his wife and she also does a great job really being the emotional centre of the film and making you really care about her families situation. They introduce a rival sniper and give him a little backstory and his character is cool even though he isn't that important. I do wish that more of the side characters had done more and made me care about them more. The story of his life is incredible and you see him on his tours and you really see the emotional pain that war has given to this man that is a true casualty of war in his mind. However, I do think this film Treats Kyle as a white knight and a war hero even though what he did becomes a bit more grey and you could argue he did some bad things, I just wish we had seen more of the complexity. The script is great and Clint Eastwood did a great job mixing the drama really well with the occasional humour to make these characters feel human and relatable. The style is beautiful and I love how it made war look dark and gritty instead of making it look lovely and over dramatized. Overall this is a great film that should be seen."
"keyos27","9","15","31","28 January 2015"," A movie in which everyone can emotionally relate to
","A lot of times, a well-edited trailer with a bit of cliffhanger at the end entices you to watch the movie out of curiosity and often get the wool pulled over your eyes. Gladly, it has been a while since I have encountered a powerful war film that is based on a true story about the most lethal sniper who had over 160 kills under his belt in the Iraq War.<br/><br/>The title really lives up to the hype and breaks down the cliché of standard war movies that are known to be showy and frantic as there are valuable perspectives and immense emotions you are able to embrace, sympathize, and get the most out of this film. Although, it does not deliberately cover the true color of the deceased sniper, Chris Kyle as well as the relentless and aggressive sides of American soldiers against innocent citizens, I believe the director's focus is on America's point of view, especially the context of military family.<br/><br/>Despite ""American Sniper"" not being impartial, this is a type of movie in which everyone from various countries with different cultural backgrounds can witness disparities in poverty, lifestyle, and humanity. If you are a peacenik, you will discover the necessities of war. If you are the member of military, you ought to experience the intensity and agony of your brethren whose devotion and patriotism are realistically depicted. And for a family member of the military, the priority conflicts between your family and the country will move you because it is a well-directed, well-staged, and well-acted film."

","Not since United 93 has there been an honest feature film portrayal of the madness that has been brought about by the Quran. If there was ever a movie in your life to see in the theater rather than at home, this is definitely one of them. An amazing thing happens When the credits start rolling. Not a single person leaves the theater, then suddenly rousing applause breaks the silence. There are very few movies in life that make you feel special to have been born and raised in the U.S. and this is one of them. The fact that this movie has completely blown away the year's top grossing Oscar winner five times over in terms of ticket sales can make anyone restore their faith in this country. Thank the Lord for the few patriots in Hollywood like Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>As I read the negative reviews of this movie, it makes me wonder what the hell kind of world we live in where we have Internet trolls on our home soil who in the most vile, offensive way possible make our Navy Seals out to be the bad guys in the war on terror. The men and women of our U.S. military are so heroic and fearless that leftist idiots like Hillary Clinton and Brian Williams try to appear as one of them by fabricating their own epic fail stories about being under fire. It's a good thing that the people who make their mark in history are not the idiot congressmen with their pie in the sky policies that always blow up in their face or the people who vote for them, but the people who actually change the world like Chris Kyle. If terrorists were out there plotting another attack on my home soil, I would take comfort in knowing that people like Chris Kyle were there to take them out rather than some vain, pencil-neck Alinskyite who claims in their usual leftist sophistry that if we reason with them and offer them jobs, that will miraculously cause them to rethink their terrorist ways! The only jobs they're qualified for are as butchers and there are only so many of those jobs available! This movie flies in the face of everything the media and our college professors tell us about our military and I can see why leftists use it to spew their hate-filled trash-talking rhetoric.<br/><br/>I never would've imagined on the day when 9/11 occurred that the people who committed those atrocities would one day be publicly embraced by our president of all people who refuses to even say the word ""terrorist"" and who claims that they have ""legitimate grievances"" against America. Nowadays, even the people who are guilty of some of the biggest acts of terrorism such as Che Guevara and Dzhokar Tsarnev are glamorized as rock stars. I guarantee you that if the terrorists cut the heads off of cute little animals rather than people and posted the video of it on YouTube, that would finally elicit a reaction from the left and even then, they would still probably blame Nakoula Nakoula for it."

","This movie was just bad. Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, was so unlikeable and stuck-up and such a d*ck that I was actually hoping he would get shot. It dragged on and on and was just extremely tiresome and boring towards the end. The directing is nothing special and Bradley Cooper's performance did not at all impress. It is extremely biased and, as usual, shows that Americans are always the heroes and that all Arab Muslims are murderers, instead of telling people there is good and bad in every single society in the world. It showed very little of Kyle's training and how he got to be nicknamed 'legend'. It quickly skipped from one part to the next and his post-traumatic stress syndrome was not elaborated. His death in the end was really expected and ironic. This does not deserve a single Academy Award nomination let alone best picture."

","Blown away by American Sniper. Not a single false stroke. Every swath reveals a perfection of monotone. Clint Eastwood is a modern day propaganda genius.<br/><br/>It achieves exactly where Still Alice fails but Green Zone and Zero Dark Thirty succeeds. It brings back watching paint dry or watch water boil as exciting as Call of Duty skirmish. But then again...this movie WAS A COD skirmish. Wait.<br/><br/>Cooper is a really favorite actor of mine and he did alright and in the tire repair shop when the man thanked him it captured the black-and-white tone of the film.<br/><br/>I do not know why it is Clint Eastwood's fault that his movie is interpreted as yin-yang tension between good and evil because all he did was take some of the most boring scenes of an army officer's life and increase it eight fold by letting camera roll and dragging on just like this sen...yawn ...tence.<br/><br/>I don't hate the message, but the messenger. It was extremely awful to watch, so dry and boring, and if I wanted to watch a film about sniper might as well watch an exciting documentary on Youtube if not COD footage.<br/><br/>The one-dimensional monotonous drivel carries on and on without a specific plot or structure. I know it is supposed to be a slice of sketch about Kyle's life and I actually read the book, but it is hard not to fall sleep.<br/><br/>I actually had to watch Andy Warhol's 8 hour ""Sleep"" to keep me awake.

","""You can only circle the flames so long."" Chris Kyle (Cooper) is an elite sniper. The deadliest sniper in American history. His feats have made him a legend. When he returns home from battle it is harder to adjust than he expected. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof. Millions have seen it, everyone else has heard about it. I was late in seeing this so I had all the hype behind it in my mind before I even started this. I will start by saying I am not a huge Bradly Cooper fan, but this is by far his best role. This is the first movie I have seen him in where I thought he was a very good actor. The one downside of this movie is that I wish there was more sniping scenes. There is a lot of war scenes but the actual sniping isn't really a focus. All that said this is a very good movie that I enjoyed, even with all the hype behind it. I didn't think it was as good as I have heard, but my son also said this is the best movie ever...that may have had something to do with it. I do recommend this though. Overall, a very good movie that is worth the accolades it received. I did think Enemy at the Gates was a better sniper movie though. I give this an A-."
"maurice_yacowar","8","10","19","22 January 2015"," Heroic army sniper traumatized by war
","The debate over whether Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is pro- or anti-war seems to miss the point. When civilization is threatened by Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and especially ISIS that question does not arise the way it did over Iraq, Vietnam, Korea, and back to WW I. After 9/11 America unavoidably felt under attack and could not simply turn the other cheek or two. Eastwood's point is rather the cost of the individual soldier's duty in war, not whether it is currently necessary.<br/><br/>The film gives no sense of what cause the enemy may be promoting. The 9/11 attack and the subsequent guerrilla warfare are presented simply as a murderous threat to America, pitting lethal civilians, women and children against the US forces. After killing one child, Kyle is relieved not to have to kill another, who drops his rocket launcher in time.<br/><br/>Even as the film traces Chris Kyle's growth into The Legend, America's all-time greatest sniper, it limns his hardening as a human being and the war's traumatic effect on his psyche. While his kids play, in front of a blank TV screen he hears a war movie going on in his head. He erupts at a playful family dog and when his infant daughter isn't treated fast enough in the hospital. The sniper hero returns a time bomb. When he reluctantly visits the crippled vets their shattered limbs and prosthetics are emblems of his psychological damage. Though he manages to pull himself back into norrmalcy his murder by another troubled American veteran leaves Kyle still the example of the war's damage to its heroes—and by implication the country's failure adequately to provide for them. <br/><br/>The opening shot is the classic war movie shot of an invincible tank crushing everything under its cogs: the war machine. Kyle's story reminds us that wars are fought and won and suffered not by machines but people. The Legend is also a man, whose war doesn't end when he gets home, whose wounds and even crippling aren't necessarily physical. <br/><br/>The epilogue shows how closely the film's central couple resemble the originals and focuses on another war machine: the funeral cortege and Kyle's real memorial in the Dallas football stadium. The imagery cuts two ways. It celebrates American patriotism and its hero. But the brightness and rah rah spirit ring hollow against the suffering we've seen the vets carry. <br/><br/>The film works in a couple of old traditions. The collation of deer hunting and war recalls the metaphor for the loss of innocence at the heart of Michael Cimino's 1978 Vietnam classic The Deer Hunter, as well as Norman Mailer's 1967 hunting novella Why Are We In Vietnam? Here Kyle's first kill — of a child and his mother — is paused for a flashback to his first kill as a hunter, shooting a deer with his father. Both are examples of his ""losing his cherry."" He repeats the cycle by taking his son hunting between tours of duty. As the country boy who goes off to war as a champion shot he also recalls Gary Cooper's Sergeant York (1941), a similar biopic without the psychological investigation and graphic suffering. Moving from the latter Howard Hawks film to this is like moving from Blake's Songs of Innocence to Experience.<br/><br/>The film's first key scene is the family dinner discussion where Kyle's father divides people into three: sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. ""We protect our own,"" he insists, warning his sons not to be either the sheep or the wolf, the victim or the predator, but to act as protector. As he hides his emotions, the traumatized Kyle insists he feels less guilt about the people he killed than about the comrades he failed to protect. In his last encounter with his shell-shocked and disillusioned kid brother, we see how rare the successful protector is. <br/><br/>In the key later scene Kyle imperils his comrades by taking the long-shot to kill his enemy sharpshooter Moustapha. There his vanity may get the better of him. To confirm his own Legend against his rival perhaps here he shifts from sheepdog to wolf. Avenging his fallen comrade Biggles and knowing that Moustapha had US soldiers in his gunsight may not adequately justify the carnage that Kyle's brilliant and successful shot caused. That's the point where he realizes he's ready to go home. In war even more than in peace the hero has to know when to quit."
"zardoz-13","10","20","44","26 January 2015"," Commanding Stuff!!!
","In his gritty, 132 minute, R-rated, combat biography ""American Sniper,"" producer & director Clint Eastwood treats the life of real-life protagonist Chris Kyle with unmistakable reverence. This tragic but heroic account of the deadliest sharpshooter in U.S. military history is compelling as well as propelling from fade-in to fade-out. Similarly, ""A-Team"" actor Bradley Cooper delivers a career best performance as the legendary Texas native who racked up 160 confirmed kills as a sniper during four tours of duty in Iraq. Cooper packed on nearly 40 pounds so he could impersonate the beefy Kyle, and the actor assured ""Men's Health"" magazine that the 6000 calories-per-day diet that he shoveled down constituted a challenge in itself. According to ""People"" magazine, real-life Navy SEAL sniper Kevin Lacz, who fought alongside Kyle, taught Cooper how to handle the sophisticated sniper weaponry. This sober but never simple-minded saga about the Iraqi war doesn't so much ponder the polemical politics that prompted America's participation in the fighting as much as its use as a historical setting. Indeed, Kyle was gung-ho about serving his country after suicide bombers had blasted the Marine barracks to rubble in Beirut in 1983. Meantime, people who have read Kyle's 2012 memoir may complain about some of the liberties that Eastwood and ""Paranoia"" scenarist Jason Hall have taken in their adaptation of the New York Times bestseller. Nevertheless, Eastwood has fashioned a realistic but patriotic film with a wrinkle or two that has mesmerized domestic audiences. For example, Kyle believed in what he was doing in Iraq while his younger brother abhorred not only the war but also the country. Eastwood celebrates the sacrifices that these citizens made without turning ""American Sniper"" into a rabble-rousing, Rambo fantasy.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" opens in Iraq with Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) sprawled belly down on a Fallujah roof-top checking potential threats to the Marines on the street below as they rattle one door after another in search of hostiles. Initially, Kyle spots a military-age, Iraqi native on a balcony. Chatting on a cell phone, he is watching the troops approach him. This suspicious fellow vanishes from Kyle's sight. Moments later, a mother dressed like an angel of death in black emerges onto the street with her son. The mother hands her son a grenade, and they approach a tank with troops following it. Just as Kyle is scrutinizing these two civilians through his sniper scope, his spotter warns him that he could land in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth for shooting friendly civilians. This issue arises more than once in ""American Sniper."" Civilians in combat zones without a good reason created a quandary because our guys couldn't be sure who was either sympathetic or unfriendly. Anyway, as Kyle caresses the trigger of his sniper rifle, Eastwood flashbacks to Kyle's life as a Texas teen shooting his first deer. Eastwood and Hall furnish us with a montage of Kyle's life along with his God-fearing father's philosophy. We see Kyle rush to the rescue of his younger brother Jeff on the playground at their elementary school as an obese bully beats up Jeff. At the dinner table, Kyle's stern father Wayne (Ben Reed of ""Scanner Cop"") categorizes humans into three types: predatory wolves, sheep, and sheepdogs. Brandishing his rolled up belt for emphasis, Wayne warns them that they will neither be predators nor sheep, but instead sheepdogs. Wayne promises to punish them for anything less. During his military service, Chris behaves like a sheepdog. Repeatedly, he risks his life to save his fellow Marines. Occasionally, ""American Sniper"" lightens up and lets you laugh with Chris about his romantic conquests both good and bad.<br/><br/>Aside from a protracted flashback sequence early into the action, ""American Sniper"" adheres to a conventional, straightforward storyline, chronicling the high points of Kyle's experiences under fire. Comparatively, director Peter Berg's ""Lone Survivor"" (2013), starring Mark Wahlberg, could serve as a companion piece to ""American Sniper."" The big difference is Bradley Cooper's SEAL team hero displays no compunctions about shooting kids, whereas Mark Wahlberg's real-life SEAL team hero Marcus Luttrell couldn't bring himself to kill an innocent goat herder's son. Meanwhile, ""American Sniper"" alternates between our hero's harrowing battlefield exploits and his home front activities with his wife and family. Eastwood doesn't immortalize Chris Kyle as an invincible, larger-than-life, titan. Actually, we watch in horror as Kyle unravels with each tour until he can no longer tolerate the traumatic pressure of combat. In this respect, ""American Sniper"" doesn't pull any punches about the caliber of warfare that our guys had to contend with in Iraq. Mind you, it isn't gripping in the same slam-bang sense that ""Black Hawk Down"" was, but ""American Sniper"" still qualifies as a tour-de-force, first-rate, action yarn. I don't think Bradley Cooper will clinch the Best Actor Oscar, but you will know that Cooper takes his craft seriously. Aside from Cooper, the only other three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood character is Kyle's long-suffering wife, Taya (British actress Sienna Miller of ""Foxcatcher""), who goes toe-to-toe with him.<br/><br/>Primarily, Eastwood filters everything through Kyle's perspective, and you don't witness any of those standard-issue scenes with natty politicians and high-ranking officers arguing about strategy at headquarters. Eastwood rarely shifts the focus away from either Kyle with his family or Kyle with his buddies. Of course, Kyle and his buddies form a tightly knit group from their rigorous beachfront SEAL team training to the devastating combat in Iraq. Predictably, warfare dwindles their numbers. Particularly shattering is Kyle's loss of his buddy Biggles (Jake McDorman of ""Aquamarine"") who survives long enough to die in surgery. The camaraderie between Kyle and Biggles is sometimes hilarious as well as distressing. Kyle's younger brother Jeff (Keir O'Donnell of ""Wedding Crashers"") drifts into and out of the action. Jeff accompanies Kyle on the rodeo circuit in Texas and later follows him to the battlefield in Iraq. Altogether, ""American Sniper"" ranks as a memorable military actioneer with some salty dialogue."

","So, these Germans invade Poland, do a huge amount of damage, are completely in the wrong, yet the Germans are good soldiers and are told they are protecting the fatherland/homeland by killing the hell out of ""Poland"" yet those pesky Poles just don't seem to be that appreciative and mount a resistance, as would anyone whose land is invaded. The good German soldiers think they are in the right and that the resisting Poles are savages and there are some really good German snipers who kill lots of ""savages"" and are considered heroes and protectors of all that is right in the world. Maybe these Germans are actually decent people who want to believe that what they are doing is a really good thing, although from any vantage point outside of Germany, these soldiers are considered monsters and heinous invaders. No matter that when one of these ""heroes"" dies and is honored by other Germans for his heroic and patriotic service, the whole enterprise still remains barbaric and monstrous. The fact that these soldiers experienced the horrors of war, killed and watched their comrades die and then were plagued with PTSD begs the question, why the f__k were they there in the first place? Oops, I got confused.... I meant the US invading and destroying Iraq, the fact that US soldiers, true believers who are easily swayed, become psycho killers, had problems on returning from their country destroying efforts, no matter how well intended fails, (what a surprise), to give the proper context. So, Eastwood makes a decent, up close and personal account of doing battle against the bad guys, bad guys here include little kids and women, which also begs the question, why would kids and children want to do bad things to Americans, the bestest people in the whole world? They must, just must be savages/monsters.....So, yes, this is propaganda, a bit more nuanced than usual, but no different than zero dark thirty claiming that torture worked, or any of the other movies of this ilk. To be clear, if it isn't already, we, the US, are the bad guys, the evil Germans if you will, the invasion of Iraq was illegal and a war crime of vast scale, the fact that decent and possibly not so decent US soldiers were involved and had their patriotism used in service to this awful purpose is the story that must be told, but probably won't. Instead, we have the end of the movie where the roads are lined with those honoring the dead psycho-killer who in his own biography bragged about his unquestioning murder of scores of Iraqis who may or may not have been soldiers."

","I knew a fair amount about Chris Kyle before seeing this, so I wasn't watching it waiting for any surprises (other than creative liberties, which made it even more interesting). This was well done, and I have a new respect for Bradley Cooper that he could play a role like this so well.<br/><br/>What I don't understand are the people who review it or comment on it and say ""Oh, he called the people he killed savages"" (they were) or how he equates to a Nazi sniper (he doesn't).<br/><br/>The people he killed WERE savages, and what people have troubles understanding (for some reason) is that isn't the same as calling all Iraqi's or all Arabs savages. He did not randomly shoot people - he shot the enemy after studying them and determining there was a threat to the troops he was assigned to protect. That is a big difference from randomly shooting people, as a Nazi may have done.<br/><br/>As for any erratic behavior he may have had afterward (and he did not claim to kill people during Katrina), I think if anyone had to shoot 160 people to protect his troops, and through the stress of oversight every day, they would have some readjustment issues as well. But instead of being grateful, there are those who hate America who insist he was ""Psycho"" or use other derogatory terms to describe him. I feel sorry for those people who are such shallow thinkers and can't see Kyle for what he was - a great American hero."

"ryklinker","9","19","42","18 January 2015"," The story of a US Navy SEAL's four tours in the Iraq War, and his days on the home-front in between.
","United States Marines breach the doors of a neighborhood, and he's there on over-watch. On his very first tour in Iraq, Chris Kyle has been tasked with surveillance and protecting the men on the ground. As the Marines continue to bust down doors and clearing houses, a son and his mother appear in a doorway. The two people seem inconspicuous, but when the woman removes a Russian grenade from underneath her clothes and hands it to her young son, her status as a potential threat is definitely affirmed. Chris is hesitant, and we understand why. How can he kill a young boy and a woman? In a split-second decision, he assures himself of the need for the trigger to be pulled, and he takes the shot. Growing up, Chris always wanted to be a cowboy. He went hunting with his father, fought off the bullies that tormented his little brother, and he rode broncos for a while. But after realizing the need for a brave man like him to be in the dangerous streets of Iraq, he signs up as a SEAL. After the rigorous training, he graduates from his class, and he meets someone. Her quick wit and initial dismissive attitude towards Chris is harsh. ""My sister was engaged to a SEAL once, so I've got you figured out."" Apparently Chris was the exception to her preconception, and they were married soon after. Once Chris finally deploys, he is an instant asset to the forces in Iraq. Quickly acquiring the label ""Legend"" by his teammates, Chris is the hottest shot in Iraq, and he realizes the need that his fellow soldiers have for him. After each stint back at home, he is becoming less and less able to adjust back to civilian life, and he repeatedly returns to the battlefield. He's not bloodthirsty, he just feels like his duty is to protect his friends. With the enemy still running rampant through the area, Chris has to choose between the men on the ground and his family back home.<br/><br/>About 2 years ago, I was in search of a book to read for my vacation, and I stumbled upon this book. It seemed interesting, and I've always had a strange fascination with snipers, so I thought it would be a good read. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, which is written in the words of the real-life SEAL, and the announcement that a film adaptation was being made excited me. As a movie, I found the story of Chris Kyle to be just about an exact replica of what I had imagined as I flipped the pages of the autobiography. Director Clint Eastwood's version of this story is well- thought out, and it doesn't glorify the war, it just tells a story. Though it does obviously show some of the 160+ confirmed kills that are marked on Kyle's file, it doesn't make it all about the violence. A large part of the movie focuses on how the distance between Chris and his family tears him apart, and how he has to cope with the tragedies that come with war. Nominated for Best Picture, American Sniper is most likely going to be drowned out by the success of Oscar front-runners like Boyhood, Birdman, and The Imitation Game. I attribute this prediction to the fact that the conflicts in the Middle East are unpopular the minds of some, and this may deter the views of numerous voters. In my opinion, however, I've found this film to be very worthy of its nomination, and it is a shame that it will probably go unnoticed in this category. Much of the success that this movie has achieved can be attributed to the brilliant performance by Bradley Cooper as Chris. Cooper's portrayal of Chris covers each aspect of the character perfectly, and he captures the essence of the hardships that Chris faced throughout his life. Not to my surprise, Cooper has been nominated for a Best Actor award in the 2015 Academy Awards this year, which is the third in his career. Based on what I have read and heard from various sources, I unfortunately do not think that the third time will be the charm for the actor. With highly lauded performances by both Michael Keaton (Birdman) and Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) this year, I fear that Cooper's great effort will not end with an Oscar win. Outside of the acting, the action was quite good. In contrast to the blood-heavy approach by other war films, this movie prefers to show only what is necessary for the proper effect of the violence. Another part of the action that I appreciated was the realistic idea that not every shot is a kill, and not every sniper kill is a head-shot.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who appreciates the man that saved an uncountable amount of lives, and also someone who obviously doesn't mind the violence and language that go along with a rated R war flick."

","Don't be fooled by the praise. If you're not an extremely patriotic American, you don't want to see this movie. This work of propaganda represents everything that is wrong with the world and America in particular. Not only is Chris Kyle portrayed as supporter of the right to bear arms and the hunting of animals, he's also portrayed as someone who supports the war on Iraq 100%. This level of patriotism is not even realistic in the real world. He's even more patriotic than John Rambo. Throughout the movie I could only think what an idiot the main character was and I didn't feel sorry for him for a second when he died in the end. Nice ending of your career Clint Eastwood.

"Seraphion","7","21","48","11 January 2015"," Nicely realistic and fair depictions of a war hero
","Chris Kyle is a Navy SEAL sniper deployed in Iraq circa 2003. His main job is assisting house searches as an over-watch sniper. His duty lets him take decisive shots, quickly building his reputation a sniper legend. But those shots face him at split seconds to moral contradictions. Once he shot a child and his mother who carries a grenade toward a convoy. Feeling he hasn't done enough, he joins the ground search himself, finding an old man who talks about The Butcher, the Al Qaeda in Iraq's number two man. But as the soldiers return to the old man's house, The Butcher arrived earlier and teaches the man's family a lesson for talking to the Americans, killing the man. Chris and the soldiers are held back from helping due to The Butcher posted a skilled sniper, Mustafa, who covers his back.<br/><br/>At another recon op in hunting The Butcher, Chris and his fellow SEALS are welcomed to a dinner by the man whose house's second floor is used as the recon post. But Chris finds that the man actually works for Zarqawi. The SEALS manage to neutralize the threats but The Butcher flees the scene. Back home after his third tour of duty, Chris gets more and more distanced with civilian life and fights with his wife about his will to redeploy. At his fourth tour, his team finds that engineers in Sadr City are being killed one by one from as far as 1000 yards away, strengthening the guess that it's Mustafa. The team inserts to position at a rooftop despite an imminent sandstorm. Another soldier gets sniped and Chris says he sees Mustafa. His fellows finds it hard to believe him as Mustafa may be at about 2000 yards away.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the base tells them that the ground surrounding their location is now crawling with threats, a shot from them will bring them under attack. Chris strengthen his nerves and takes the shot. He succeeds in killing Mustafa, but threats soon hail shots at them as their backup still hasn't arrive. The SEALS made it out as the backup arrives in the sandstorm but Chris gets shot and retires after that. Back home, Chris struggles to connect with daily life. But a doctor introduces him to the veterans group to which he then provide support work, sometimes taking the men to shooting range and teaching them to shoot sniper rifles. But Chris loses his life when he tries to help a disturbed young marine.<br/><br/>The story nicely encompass fair depictions of how war can affect harshly to someone even as skilled as Chris Kyle. We get to see that even a war hero, a sniper legend, gets stuck with the war syndrome. The movie serves the harsh truth of the threats the military face, and the severely blurred line between doing what's right and doing it right while countering those threats. And those threats are depicted fairly real, that an enemy deeming suicide bomb is just a standard plan of attack may even take notch even further by ordering women and children in on an assault with a grenade on their hands.<br/><br/>The action feels nicely authentic. In general Eastwood greatly directs the action so that it doesn't seem hyperbolic, that the action moves fluidly natural. The actors get to act parts like how a body lumps down after being shot in the head, or how a body doesn't really jerk uncontrollably when it's barraged with full auto shots from close range. <br/><br/>As someone experienced I first person shooter games, the sniper shots seemed real enough. Yet for me, there's discrepancy between the shots from the rifle's scope and how Chris uses his scope. The scope footage shows the cross-hairs following potential targets, which means Chris must be panning his rifle significantly far enough to show on when he's shown back peeping at the scope. But when it does go back to him, his posture doesn't really change.<br/><br/>The acting is nice overall. Bradley Cooper again nicely shows he knew that the movie's focus will be almost entirely on his character. He did very well on those close up shots, portraying the right emotions and expression variations between the tour time and the home time. Sienna Miller completes the movie with her performance n the needed critical role of the spouse.<br/><br/>For me American Sniper (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's a good entertainment that shows nice realistic military gun fights and is completed with the fair depiction of a post tour effect on a soldier."
"vishaal811","8","5","8","1 August 2015"," A Brutal Look at War!!
","American Sniper, helmed by director Clint Eastwood is the biopic of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in U.S. History. The film deals with the aftermath of 9/11 and the extensive measures that were taken by the Americans to prevent terror attacks by sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays the lead role of a SEAL and he is thoroughly believable due to the nuanced performance that he delivers. As the conditions in which he lives in the U.S. and Iraq are completely disparate, he finds it hard to adjust to regular life after experiencing the atrocious conditions of war. Even though he makes four separate trips to Iraq, he is still not satisfied with his achievements and longs for helping more of his fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>The director does a pretty good job at vividly showcasing the brutal, egregious acts of the militants. As it deals with the war in Iraq, it has certain similarities to another war movie, The Hurt Locker. <br/><br/>American Sniper is a moving, honest look at the life of a great human. I don't believe that this movie was good enough to be an Oscar contender but is still a fairly decent war flick."

","Why are so many people complaining about this movie? I saw this movie with a friend in the movie theater, and I found it to be an engaging movie. It is about a man who decides to fight for what is right and to help his fellow men in the heat of battle (whether or not the Iraq War is justifiable is a moot point here, and is thus irrelevant, for this is not a movie that is intended to be preachy, but rather one that dissects life from the point-of-view of Chris Kyle). I am personally against the Iraq War, but I still loved this movie, and I still have a very healthy respect for those who fought in that bloody conflict! 'Based on a true story' movies are usually not my cup of tea, either, but I still loved this movie. More movies should be like this."
"seanjdunn85","5","31","76","27 December 2014"," I wanted to like it, but Clint Eastwood...
","As someone who read American Sniper, and admired the mentality of Chris Kyle, I really wanted to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>But unfortunately the narrative was sometimes stubbornly chronological and lurched rhythmically forward like a kid learning to drive a stick shift. Cooper did a great job portraying Kyle and the efforts of him and his co- star were pretty much the only thing that saved this film.<br/><br/>The halting pace was bad enough, but whenever the writer or Eastwood departed from the truth, they did so in a way that made Chris Kyle look... kinda bad or reckless. Shooting a kid who was attacking troops (he never did that, or at least never had to), Disobeying an order and exposing the position of his team by taking a shot at a glimmer of light from 2100 yards that he determines is an enemy sniper. Its just disappointing that a film will glorify his accomplishments while downplaying his abilities in weird ways, and then saying he had ""a gift"", which Kyle denied and said he finished middle of the pack in sniper school. He also calls his wife in the middle of a firefight and says he's quitting the military. I think he'd be a little irritated by that. Also, the Marines are portrayed as babyfaced wide-eyed teenagers and i think kyle would be irritated by that as well, since he gave them so much credit in his book.<br/><br/>At one point two women in the theater started cracking up and said ""ITS A DOLL"", and I noticed that the baby that bradley cooper was holding was basically a toys-r-us doll and he was trying to stop her from crying. it was really bizarre. yikes.<br/><br/>all in all i gave it a 5 because the acting was top-notch. clint eastwood really boxed out anyone who would've done a good job with this story. so disappointing."

"dustin_abraham","7","19","43","2 February 2015"," American Sniper - propaganda or not?
","There seems to be an unwarranted amount of controversy surrounding Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, American Sniper. Many left-wing celebrities, feminists, and other liberals are crying ""propaganda!"" All art forms have the possibility to serve a political or religious agenda and many are meant to do so. From anti-war protest songs to Michael Moore documentaries to religious texts. I guess it's easy to forget that the main goal of art is to entertain. Two things about me: 1. When it comes to most political topics, I consider myself a liberal, 2. I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan. I am also, for the most part, anti-war. Most films about war can be considered anti-war films, but there are a few pro-war films. Those films might be considered propaganda, but at the same time might be considered enjoyable and even great works of art. Three movies off the top of my head that take a seemingly pro-war stance: Sergeant York, 300, and the latest installment in the Rambo franchise. The best of those, Sergeant York, is the one most blatantly a propaganda film. Yet, I still enjoy the film. So I believe that when you watch a movie, especially by a master such as Clint Eastwood, you should put your political beliefs aside as well as the political beliefs of the artist(s). It's perfectly possible to love the works of Ted Nugent and Sean Penn at the same time.<br/><br/>I've never read Chris Kyle's book. I don't know how closely Eastwood's film followed the book and I don't know how honest and true the book was. For all I know Chris Kyle was a great and kind man or Chris Kyle was a complete and total douche bag. Maybe he's a xenophobic, jingoistic, warmongering asshole. Maybe Clint Eastwood is one of those too. I don't know, and frankly I don't care because it is completely irrelevant to the point of this review or the point of American Sniper.<br/><br/>As I watched it, I was unable to put aside all the politics and pro-war sentiment stuff because I was searching for it. As it turns out, I was searching in vain. I could find no war mongering. I could only find a little of the flag-waving pseudo-Patriotism. The fact is, I found plenty of anti-war sentiment. It did not show me, in any way, that this war Chris Kyle and the others were fighting was just. It did, however, show the ""War is Hell"" theme common in almost all war movies, whatever their political leanings. Many of the negative reviews point out how all the Iraqis were called ""savages."" Yet, Clint Eastwood was not trying to say that all Iraqis are savages any more than Quentin Tarantino tries to say that all black people are n*ggers in Django Unchained. The characters in the movie use the word savages. I would guess that this is authentic language and an accurate portrayal of the folks fighting over there. I just can't find any basis for these negative reviews, that seem to judge the politics of Kyle and Eastwood more than they judge the film. Let's not forget that Eastwood directed Letters from Iwo Jima, a highly anti-war picture.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a solid film. Bradley Cooper gives a strong performance and Clint gives us another competently directed film. I did expect to see a little bit more snipering, as it were. There was some in the beginning and then not anymore until the climactic scene. Chris Kyle kept going back to war partially because he felt like he had unfinished business, and mostly because he couldn't cope with his regular life in the states anymore. This shows the negative psychological impact that war has on folks and how, much like someone who has been released from prison after years, they are unable to adapt to normal life. Kyle's inability to cope is similar to the main character in The Hurt Locker (a movie that was not branded as propagandist garbage or given bad reviews). This difficulty to conform to stateside life after being in war is further studied in films like The Best Years of Our Lives.<br/><br/>At first, when I saw Chris Kyle and his wife watching the tragic events of September 11th on TV, I sort of rolled my eyes and felt like that could have been left out. Looking back, I don't think it was used as a propaganda device, but rather shown as a motivational device to Mr. Kyle or just shown as an important event in their lives, as it was in all American lives. So is American Sniper patriotic? To be sure. Is it sentimental? At times it is, but great art often is sentimental (see Norman Rockwell or Charles Dickens) because it invokes those warm fuzzy emotions in all of us. I actually think that American Sniper was able to accomplish something remarkable, and that is it was able to tackle the subject of the second Iraq war without judging it either way, good or bad, just or unjust.<br/><br/>Bottom line, American Sniper is a good film, but it's not a great film. It can't touch Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales or Million Dollar Baby. I came into it curious about it's politics, but not obsessing over them. It was entertaining, and that is the first and most important thing one should consider when reviewing a film. Then you think about how it made you feel and then you think of how it looked and sounded and how well the performers performed and maybe lastly you can think about it's politics.<br/><br/>American Sniper is not as good as Sergeant York. It's not as good as Letters from Iwo Jima. It's not as good as The Best Years of Our Lives. American Sniper is as good as American Sniper and that's good enough for me. 7.5 out of 10"

Bradley Cooper plays a gung-ho Texan who can't wait to serve his country (although what Iraq did for the U.S. is unclear). The military, as it always does, tortures and brainwashes him until all he cares about are his buddies in arms. OOH RAH! So he leaves his new family and reenlists for 4 tours, each one of which is exactly the same as the others. He gets up on a rooftop and shoots the bad guys. Every once in a while he comes down off his perch and breaks into Iraqi houses with the grunts. He's ultra-macho and a very good shot.<br/><br/>That had some appeal during the first tour, but what happens after that? More of the same. Chris Kyle shoots and shoots and never changes. His personality is fixed. His wife does develop over the years, but Kyle is insensitive to it. Get him back on those roofs!<br/><br/>I don't attach any political significance to ""American Sniper"".

"bob the moo","Null","14","30","31 January 2015"," The events driven approach limits the film to being a very one note and simplistic film and character piece
","I have seen a lot of Awards Season films in my years, and at some point I suspect that I will take the approach that I take towards summer movies now – which is to let them and their hype pass, and come back to those that outlive their publicity and marketing. However, with American Sniper I was intrigued to see it for myself on the basis of the reported controversy; with some slamming the film for glorifying someone who killed so many people, while others saying that the hero marks the life of an American hero who put himself in harm's way in the service of a mission given to him by his country. I approached the film open to whatever it chose to do of these, and curious as to what others were seeing, but the odd thing is that the reason that the film is accused of both extremes, is that it does both of them.<br/><br/>As a narrative the film is events driven, starting in childhood, training, deployment, tours, and finally a return home. It is understandable in its structure and it is not its fault that these places and experiences almost feel too familiar now thanks to video games and films making heavy use of them as entertainment. The film focuses totally on Kyle, keeping the camera very close to him even to the detriment of other characters and situations. In a way this makes the film more engaging because we do stay involved with one person rather than the fog of war, but at the same time it also limits the scope of the film to his perception, his actions, his bottled up feelings. In this way it really plays it so straight that you can take it how you want to find it – which was maybe the aim of the film. So if you feel Kyle was deeply affected by having to kill women and children in a war without end, and threw himself into his mission rather than confront his own actions, then the film doesn't do anything to dissuade you from that; but if you think he was a square-jawed hero doing what he needed to do without question, then the film also gives you that. So the extremes of the argument get to be happy with the film – or unhappy with it (which to watch them fight, you would be fair to assume is the same thing).<br/><br/>The problem then is that for anyone who is not coming in with an agenda to feel a certain way, the film actually does very little, because this ""straight shooter"" approach provides very little of interest. Cooper does what he can with his face and body, while Miller plays it reasonably well; however it is all very straight and there is no nuance or room for thought or extension. In his direction Eastwood delivers good tension and action on the ground; okay he uses artistic license quite heavily to build in a specific narrative tension, but it works for what he wants to do. With his characters though, he cannot find much outside of scenes that exist specifically to perform that function – of which they are generally late in the film and as functional as they sound.<br/><br/>There is lots of online fighting about who Chris Kyle was, what this film does, and what it is trying to say; part of this does come from the way that the film doesn't really take a stand, hinting at things, avoiding others, muddying other aspects to produce a mostly event driven film that broadly tells a tale, but never really gets anywhere close to the person, people, or place."

And so, with that in mind - I ask you - What sort of hypocritical statement is this 2-faced director making when he produces a film that glorifies, admires and respects a generation of Americans whom he clearly despises?... Like, hello!? - That sure seems pretty screwy to me.<br/><br/>Anyway - This ""big-bad-sniper-turns-crybaby"" movie was so shamelessly padded out with endless battle scenes and snivelling ""back home"" soap opera that it all really boiled down to having no valid story at all."
"cantinaklen-miroslav","2","21","49","8 February 2015"," Eastwood is really losing it
","I have read about this movie,prior to watching it,so I roughly knew what to expect. At the end,I was quite surprised,that it wasn't as much of a right-wing war apology and propaganda,as I thought it would be. It's a realistic display of war horrors,militants will see it as pro-war,normal people will see it as anti-war. It is simply a story of that time,told the way one simple,bible-belt,all-American,gun-crazy,southern man with no future,would see it. But I expected Eastwood to deliver a complete,solid movie,not leaving me any room for complaints on hes behalf. Instead,he gave us a documentary with extra special effects and some fancy cinematography. Being a European,all I knew about Kyle,was what I read in the New Yorker article,which was wary bountiful in details. Knowing all the things about Kyle,that he deliberately left out of the movie,leads me to believe,Eastwood played it safe,avoiding the possibility that Kyle might turn out something else,than a hero and defender of the nation. Instead,he used 2/3 of the movie on action scenes,and the rest on portraying his characters,instead of doing vice versa. And that makes this movie a fairly,large disappointment,not worthy of any artistic Oscar nominations,yet alone,awards. If he gets any,it will be another shot in the Academy awards credibility."
"matthewssilverhammer","3","31","77","24 January 2015"," A Mess of War Morals
","Eastwood is an interesting director for me. He has made some of cinemas most acclaimed and beloved films (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby), yet I often find myself on the opposing side of many people's glowing praise of him. Despite having a powerful true-story behind it and one of the greatest trailers I've seen all year, American Sniper is overly preachy and a mess of war morals. Chris Kyle's story is undeniably telling and dramatically tragic: the most deadly Navy SEAL sniper in history learns how to deal with the things he's seen and done while fighting the War on Terror. Cooper is REALLY good as Kyle, continuing his streak of beautifully walking the line between prestigious actor and intangible movie star. If only the script and dialogue garnered fewer eye-rolls and more genuine emotion. Honestly, it's among the weakest and most pretentious scripts in a long time, like if Nicholas Sparks wrote an overtly jingoistic war film. While at moments it seems to want to capture the coldness of war, at others it asks us to cheer for the very things that are destroying these lives. Part of the problem is that not too long ago Kathryn Bigelow, with The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, told very similar war-ethic tales, but with better results. Both of those films represent their characters and the Iraq War with complexity and nuance, all while being gut-wrenchingly thrilling and tautly focused. American Sniper does none of these things. Instead of giving this thing anymore money, go watch the crucial and criminally under-seen Selma."

","Having lived through this time, having servicemen in my family, and having my own expectations with the written account firmly placed in my head, American Sniper was a difficult movie to live up to, in my mind. I was set to dislike Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris Kyle. In fact, after watching the entire cast on late night talk shows, I was determined that Bradley Cooper, although my movie star crush, was out of his depth. I was wrong. <br/><br/>It was extremely clear that Bradley Cooper researched and acted through this role as though he was Chris Kyle. At times it appeared as though the action was authentically occurring as we were watching the events unfold. The care in which both Cooper and Eastwood brought Chris Kyle to the big screen was respectful and complete. The only downfall, although true to real life events, was that Chris' return after his final tour was incredibly brief until his untimely death. As a viewer with the complete story fresh in my mind, some details felt as though they were left unfinished. I was waiting for the turn in his character that was so clear in his book. That turn, when he knew he could not return to duty but could focus on those who remained stateside and try to ""save"" them as well. In film, this occurred at warp speed. He's home, he's moved, he's at the doctor, he's volunteering, he's dead. Just that staccato. As much detail and care was placed in the truthful, accurate retelling of Kyle's tours; the viewer should have had that time to connect with Kyle as a veteran. <br/><br/>The interaction with family was also glossed over. The relationship between Chris and Taya was portrayed as intermittent, at best, While the viewer is left to consider if Chris Kyle was just afflicted with a God-complex or if the slow, self-assured Texan attitude was of Cooper's design and a result of artistic impression. <br/><br/>On the complete opposite page, Kyle's bond with his fellow servicemen was apparent. The viewer could feel how strongly bonded they were. How ingrained the image of a quitter was. How they all seemed to believe in Chris, even when he didn't. That aspect was portrayed spot on. <br/><br/>All in all, as a story or account of war, American Sniper told the tale with care and with a fresh perspective. I'm glad I watched the film. But wanting to know more about Chris Kyle as a person, not as a servicemen or veteran, I was disappointed. But the disappointment is something the world feels at the loss of such a tremendous warrior. May his family know the peace their son, brother, husband, and father brought to Americans like myself. And how very grateful we are for his service. May his memory live on."
"fluberon","6","26","63","9 January 2015"," Lets all be objective about this
","I only ever read the reviews and message boards AFTER I have watched a movie, never before. Like many others here I do this to see if my opinions and thoughts of a particular movie are shared and reflected by fellow posters, and i am also interested and intrigued by the differing views of other posters too. <br/><br/>The boards for the most part come across as intellectual, mature, thoughtful and educational... and you can tend to pick up on things and learn from other posters about a movie that you may have missed yourself. You know... the 'aaahhhh i see' factor. <br/><br/>That being said, things do get spoiled on here when patriotism, nationalism, bravado and politics tend to sweep everything else to the side. No greater example than on the boards and some reviews right here with this movie, American Sniper. Which to be honest was mediocre at best, but from reading other posts/reviews comes across to be the greatest movie ever. <br/><br/>Oscar/award wins?? On merit as a film, i really don't think so. <br/><br/>I have read the book and IMO the movie could have had so much more potential and scope (excuse the pun). I do realise that it is a biopic, but it came across as flat. I felt it lacked depth and flow. I thought Cooper did a great job of getting into 'character', but aside from that i really didn't feel i was made to care for anyone (or anything for that matter). I just could not 'get in to it'. <br/><br/>The musical score (or lack of) was too ambient, the plastic baby doll was laughable and totally not in keeping with a big budget/actor/director Hollywood film. A 'Sniper-war' that i was not made to care about ending in a flawless kill... Others here have also mentioned the telephone conversations with home via sat phone during operations. These details just ruined it for me. <br/><br/>I am a fan of any genre of film, as long as the film is good. American Sniper just didn't do it for me. Maybe because I had higher expectations with the possible potential to be drawn in and I just ended up feeling disappointed. <br/><br/>I am sure that many patriotic and/or US military service people will want to disagree with me, but if you are totally honest and take the patriotic and 'us Vs them' subjectivity out of it, objectively this film is not as good as the current rating it carries."

","Where to even begin with this atrocious movie. First off, after hearing many positive reviews I went into it thinking I'd at least think it was decent. Oh how wrong I was. Military movies have always been a hit and miss with me but this was by far the worst one I've ever seen. I kept wondering if I was watching a different movie than the people praising it did. The good about it: the cast isn't horrible to look at. It's better than any over the counter sleeping aid if you're looking for a nap. Sadly that's all it has going for it. The bad: it makes murder (military or not shooting anyone is murder) look casual and easy. The entire pace moved slower than frozen molasses. It's almost impossible to like Chris Kyle. He is NOT a hero in anyway. The script is a perfect example of the small minded redneck mentality that anyone different is instantly in the wrong. The ending was crap, I'm pretty sure they just decided to randomly stop filming and call it a day. I can keep going but I feel like those are enough reasons to skip watching it. With all the violence we have going on the last thing that needed to be made was a movie portraying a cold hearted killer as an American hero. Even slasher movies have the moral that murder is bad, and you don't see many kids looking up to leatherface. An American hero is something kids should be able to look up to though, but not for the reasons Chris Kyle became one."

","NOTE: Considering this film was released for a few limited releases in 2014, it is considered as a 2014 film. American Sniper is based on the book, based a true story about NAVY Seal, Chris Kyle. Chris joins the army shortly after a terrorist attack intended on Americans. In the NAVY Seals he finds that war is traumatizing yet addictive. In the film Bradley Cooper is absolutely amazing, in fact, the best he has ever been. The film was equally amazing. I believe it is one of the best war films of all time. American Sniper also does a very good job being historically accurate. Though there are a few obvious ""goofs"", such as the ironically hilarious toy baby's, Clint Eastwood has done an amazing job as directer and producer. This film will also (not like this matters) make a good profit considering his last film ""Jersey Boys"" was a kinda, sorta, a flop.Even though the film had a disappointing, yet satisfying ending, this film is absolutely amazing."
"CharlieGreenCG","9","27","66","6 January 2015"," Shoot or not shoot?
","It's a warzone. Structures lie crumbled and derelict from explosions and gunfire. US marines creep in formation between buildings with objectives. This particular city has been evacuated, anyone still there is a likely terrorist. Above them - almost as a guardian angel – US SEAL, Chris Kyle lays with his eye through a sniper scope with his own set objective - protect the marines below.<br/><br/>Out of a door comes a woman and young child, visually they look innocent as if walking to the shop - but in the direction of the marines. The child is handed a grenade from his mother and runs towards them. Is he helping and returning it? Or is he aiming to kill? But he is only a young child! Suspense builds, and acting as God from afar, Kyle has to react. Shoot or not shoot?<br/><br/>That is how Clint Eastwood's American Sniper begins; tense, brutal and setting a high bar for the remaining two hours. Based on the best-selling autobiography by Chris Kyle, American Sniper is the true story of his life as child to the beginning of 2013. Detailing his personal life, merits in the SEALS and his long lasting legacy of US achievements, the meaning of his accolade 'the most lethal sniper in US history' is revealed. Shortly; it's an important film, about an important man, with an important purpose - which is a lot for one film to compress. But American Sniper does not wallow in the war film clichés or allow time for it to even soak in, as suspense drives the towering momentum of war onto screen.<br/><br/>As well as producing the film, Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle. Transformed to look like his real-life counterpart, Cooper has not only bulked on the muscle and grown facial hair, but also took on the Texan accent and propels his interesting life on to screen as if paralleled. Switching from the deadly battlefields to life at home, Cooper contrasts Kyle's every emotion on screen. Whether he is on the frontline-battlefield, or at home with his family (and wife Sienna Miller - brilliant), he is committed and tested over four tours on his choice of the two. He is an enigma, and with this 160 credited kills, plus 100 probable extras, patriotism, ethics of war are physiologically weighed up on him. Expect an Oscar nod, Cooper.<br/><br/>Similar to The Hurt Locker - in a mix of subject, theme and quality – American Sniper introduces us to the world of warcraft, and brings the tones of Call of Duty to the screen with seemingly authentic- realism. It's intense and places a looking glass of what it is really like with first hand experiences from Kyle. Fortunately, all politics and American ideology are absent, Instead American Sniper focuses on heroism, loyalty and tragedy building to the best battle finale a film can offer.<br/><br/>It's pretty well crafted, cinematography is crisp, and elusive camera work at point stand out during action sequences. Yet, perhaps nit-picking – and only just forgivable given the rest of the prosperous moment- lazy film making still transpires as obvious CGI blood and bullets lay ridden, and the worst robotic-baby a film has even seen comes full on screen as it was made on a TV budget.<br/><br/>That aside, Eastwood, although now in his eighties continues to make decent films - Jersey Boy's aside. American Sniper is no exception and keeps us on toes and inside Kyle's head as he tells the story of pain and veteran stress that it ultimately endeavors. He has not broken any new ground, but has certainly proved that he is man for the job."
"dbryn","8","15","33","15 February 2015"," Read An Honest Review Here For Once.
","I'm both a screenwriter and I've served my country, and yet I can take a step back and examine the movie from an unbiased perspective.<br/><br/>First of all, I've read plenty of reviews here about how the US should not have been in Iraq and Afghanistan in the first place, and why did Eastwood choose to 'support' the war effort. Those reviews were followed by a 1-3 rating. My response to those people, I don't care what your opinion is on the US's involvement overseas. Rate the story being told and get your head out of your ###.<br/><br/>Second of all, I've read reviews that trash the movie for glorifying war. Really? Do you lack the insight to see the story being told? Was Chris Kyle glorified? Sure, by his peers, and supporters of the war... but look at the other story being told. He was alone. He couldn't relate to home life. His marriage and relationship with his children were nearly destroyed. He was a personal wreck.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the film is criticized for perhaps not showing Chris Kyle as he actually was. No film has the capacity to illustrate 'all that is' the character. You focus on a theme and a spine of your story, and you hi- light the traits and 'through line' to support that story/theme. If the writer had brought in other tidbits of information or news worthy events, the film would've been an overall mess. This is a story and it was told this particular way, and it was told extremely well. You have to respect that, but you don't have to respect the main character.<br/><br/>Fourthly, why would they choose to glorify a cowardly sniper. Really? Every infantryman will take cover and fire upon the enemy, only the sniper does it better. The sniper is alone, or works with a partner, concealed yet exposed, and often has little support. You take hold of a sniper rifle and creep into enemy territory by yourself and setup your position and tell me how cowardly you are once you've done so. So if you feel they are cowards, perhaps we should eliminate the airforce - afterall, pilots are cowards for firing upon the enemy from 10kms away? Let's just have a bloody face-to-face one-on-one battle like the good ole Civil War Days and really crank that body count up. These people save lives. <br/><br/>The film is being used as an excellent example in character, plot structure, and theme in film classes. The movie was overall, excellent. The story was told in such a way that the viewer can see both perspectives. Perhaps a lone wolf fighting for his country while holding together his home life by threads appealed to you. Perhaps you are strongly against war, and this story speaks to, that maybe America has become Chris Kyle. In the first ten minutes, young Kyle's father speaks: ""There are three types of people in this world. There are sheep and sheep dogs. While we are not sheep, lord help you if you are the wolf"". Chris thought of himself as the sheepdog, but some may say he transformed into the wolf. Has America transformed into the wolf? So, I don't understand why people against the war would hate on this movie, because the message and debate it presents is clear.<br/><br/>For a pure war movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"" retains top honors. I think people can support that movie because there was a terrible evil that was going to take over the world unless stopped. But, I don't think the fact that there is debate over which conflict the US should 'stick its nose into' should prevent us from telling those stories as well.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie."

","What bothers me about the negative reviews of this film is their intention. When you review a movie you should take into consideration how well the movie was made. Bradley cooper is amazing in this movie. What people do not understand is that there was no intentions to show people of Iraq as horrible people. My wife is from Iraq and she loves the movie. The people that are shown as the ""bad people"" are TERRORISTS, it has nothing to do with their religion or nationality. When you watch Schindlers list, one of the best movies ever made, do you think its a movie made as ""propaganda"" against Germans? Of course not!!! Take the politics out of this! At the opening scene when Chris Kyle has to shoot a small child he is shown to be emotional and regretful, he was not proud of it. He was a sniper and he only dealt with Terrorists not everyday civilians. The worst person in this movie is the guy on trial for Kyles murder not the people of Iraq. I did not for a second think of Muslims or Iraqis as bad people after seeing this movie because as we all know terrorists are from many different places in this world not just Iraq. If you can put the politics aside and like war movies, trust me you will love this movie. But if you look at movies as a source of education and political views then you will be a sour puss like all the other low reviewing people on this site that trash talk Americans. If you are closed minded and hate the USA of course you will hate this movie. I am not telling people to celebrate all the kills that Chris kyle has made. I just was people to stop hating on him for protecting the marines that were getting blown into pieces by uneducated brain washed terrorists."

The vast majority of those in attendance appeared to be retired ladies and gentleman much my senior, some in pairs, some seated alone.

","It's almost guaranteed Clint Eastwood will direct a very good movie? He has taken on diverse topics and come up with some pretty satisfying results. ""The Changeling"" gave us a study of motherhood and madness. ""Jersey Boys"" did a decent job transferring a musical from theater to film, and in the last fifteen years he has directed more than one cinema classic. His latest might just be another one to add to the list. ""American Sniper"" blends suspense, action, a fight against evil that might prove to be too much for the parties involved.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film is Chris Kyle, a fantastic Bradley Cooper who transforms into a military force who has decided to dedicate his military career to defending his country and helping his military brothers. He's loyal and focused, but this might be a problem since he becomes more and more affected by the world he's trying to destroy. As a result, he sees a deterioration of all that he treasures, as his mind can't handle the resulting emotional trauma of the experiences he has to go through.<br/><br/>His main problem is how much he gives of himself. He starts neglecting his family and children, and his obsession, might in some people's opinion, might not let him see clearly. The film doesn't take sides. It lets us observe what it is like being in the middle of this conflict. It's a world where you fight for your survival, where you don't know how death can reach and take you any moment. Chris is in the middle, but he shields his mind from the consequences to himself. He wavers when he's about to cause too much damage. He is able to recognize innocence and hesitate, but the lines blur, and he's unable to leave his work behind. Problems arise at home.<br/><br/>Miller plays his tough and supporting wife. She adores him, but she can see how much his assignments are destroying their relationship. There is genuine affection between them, and she tries to save their marriage, but she knows if he doesn't stop, she will become another victim, and we know she'll never allow it. Miller's performance is one of the best of the year because she portrays love, resilience, frustration, anger, dedication, and confusion very well. She develops and expands her character in a way that we never leave her behind, even in the middle of horrific battles. We can see Chris recognizes her presence in the faces of family members who are stuck in these nightmares, and he tries to block it out so much that he is unable to switch modes when he goes back. In one of the most painful scenes, he makes a call and surprises his wife by telling her he's already back in the States, and she can't understand why he's still not home.<br/><br/>Bradley is very good at showing the hurt that his mission causes. Yes, he's a patriot, but he also knows how much destruction his actions cause. He can say whatever he wants but he carries a big burden, and it is killing him inside. He refuses to visit Veterans' hospital because they remind him of how ugly his world is, and they can also show him what his own life might turn out to be if he survives. He plays Superman, but he also knows that he's not one.<br/><br/>Eastwood has made a much bigger film that we usually get from him. He dares go and show a much more complex picture of this world of war, hurt, and pain. He goes inside the heads of those in the middle, both Americans and the locals. Yes, everyone has two sides, and what becomes obvious is that there are actions and reactions and sometimes the explanations are not so simple. How did it start? Where will it end? Can it really be contained? Can evil eventually disappear? Is evil necessary so we can appreciate the goodness we still have in our hearts? It certainly rears its ugly head at the very end as we see the unexpected resolution. We feel an emptiness because this man was not just a soldier, but a tortured hero that tried hard to do his best, but he was after all another human who was equally vulnerable in many other ways."

","Snipers have a bad name. On the notorious 'Sniper Alley' in Sarajevo, they reportedly slaughtered 600 people, including 225 children, and they are often seen by the general public as ruthless predators rather than real soldiers with an important tactical role. <br/><br/>Dictionary definitions are anodyne. Random House gives the role of a sniper as 'shooting at individuals as opportunity offers from a concealed or distant position' and Webster's 'shooting at exposed individuals (as of an enemy's forces) from a usually concealed point of vantage'. To both, it appears, the sniper simply shoots from a hidden position and the word does not appear to have attracted a negative connotation.<br/><br/>The main role of snipers in regular forces is to give tactical support to troops when they are vulnerable to attack, though the term did not enter the English language until the 20th Century. Early snipers were called sharpshooters, though the term applied to a rifleman who fired either from open or concealed positions. At Saratoga in 1777, legendary sharpshooter Timothy Murphy, one of Colonel Morgan's Kentucky Riflemen in the American Revolutionary Army, shot British General Fraser dead at 330 yards (300 metres) with his unusual Golcher double long-barreled rifle, and then brought down the general's aid, Sir Francis Clarke. The Revolution may have turned on those two shots.<br/><br/>In 1809, Thomas Plunket, an Irishman in the 95th Rifles in the British army, with his single-shot Baker rifle, shot dead French General Colbert from an range that may have been as much as 600 yards (550 metres) then, reloading, killed the French bugler, eliminating with two shots both command and control of an entire French cavalry force. With such efficacy, it is hardly surprising that the sharpshooter evolved into the specialist sniper, and made a devastating impact during WW1 and WW2, when snipers were feared and hated. German snipers in Normandy in 1944, for example, often remained behind to harass the advancing Allies. Knowing that capture often meant summary execution, few were taken alive.<br/><br/>All this puts American Sniper into context, and, indeed, the eponymous Chris Kyle became feared and hated in Iraq, where the insurgents named him 'Shaitan Ar-Ramadi' ('Satan of Ramadi') because of his devastating impact on the insurgents in the city of that name, and he carried a bounty of $80,000. During four tours, he had 160 confirmed kills out of 255 probables, making him the most lethal sniper in US history. (To put this figure into context, however, a drone operator reportedly killed over 1600 'enemy' in Afghanistan over four years from a base 6000 miles away) Kyle would have argued that none of his own statistics take into account how many of his comrades' lives he saved, and his final shot in the film, from about 2,100 yards (1,920 metres) eliminated an insurgent sniper who had been taking out US Army Engineers.<br/><br/>For all this, the adulation of his peers, the army and his country, Chris Kyle is a victim of American culture. A plain and simple man, he is sucked into a pseudo-patriotism that drives young men to arms, many of whom, like Kyle, had been gun enthusiasts almost from infancy,- he was trained as a hunter by his father-'pseudo patriotism', because dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, the dread line of Horace cited by WW1 poet Wilfred Owen as 'that old lie', still appears to be imbibed by American youth. Yet, how much of our own freedom in the west has been bought by young men, and, today, young women, going to war, we will never know. <br/><br/>Kyle and many of his comrades have become warriors, their patriotism, devotion to duty, addiction to shooting and almost fanatical comradeship all too easily manipulated into fighting a war in the mistaken belief that they were protecting hearth and home. By focusing on Kyle and his comrades, Eastwood's sharp direction brings an entire culture, political system and military ethos under the microscope, as well as the mental and physical damage to individuals and to family life, not to mention the destruction and killing in Iraq.<br/><br/>Yet, many critics on this website and beyond, fail to understand that, to the soldier in the combat zone, the main focus is to get the 'bad guys' first, since they are out to get you and your comrades, a narrow here-and-now, kill-or-be-killed world, and winning the war is a remote goal. If these men are gung-ho, it is necessary to keep going, a mask for the terrible guilt many soldiers feel at the loss of comrades, and the daily fear under which they have to live, and, indeed, often go on living.<br/><br/>The question of how many lives might have been saved had the coalition led by the United States not invaded Iraq is probably best left unanswered. Kyle was not responsible, but was the instrument of those who are. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is an inch-perfect Kyle, delivering an understated performance. As he slips into the derangement of post-traumatic stress, his demeanor remains largely unchanged, apart from his eyes, his stillness and his silence, as all he has been through continues to infect him. While healing himself by helping other veterans, especially the mutilated, all are drawn back towards the gun and shooting, which brings about his death. The irony is savage.<br/><br/>Sienna Miller is a major talent trammeled by her role as Taya, long-suffering wife of Kyle and mother of their two children. Yet, such confinement is emblematic of the role of the women and families who stay behind. As Milton puts it: 'They also serve who only stand and wait'. He might have added, 'they also suffer, and suffer deeply', but are there PTSD clinics for women who have to stand and wait? I hope so.<br/><br/>Everyone suffers in American Sniper. The audience too. For all its good qualities, it is a film I would gladly have missed."

","I feel compelled to add a review due to the widely distorted reviews written by people on the opposites of the political spectrum (I blame Fox News for trying to make it their propaganda piece). This is obscuring the merits of ""American Sniper"", which I appreciate as a psychologist and the son of a Korean War veteran, whom I observed having a PTSD episode 50 years after the war. Additionally, both sides make mistakes in describing the movie, such as stating that it supposedly shows 9/11 as a justifiable pretext to kill Iraqis. Although it is not openly against the US-Iraq War, this is not the Chuck Norris B-movie version of it.<br/><br/>It's gotten so bad that before I can offer my positive opinion on this movie, I have to state my political affiliation: I was against George W. Bush since when he was running for governor. During the 2000 election, I warned everyone I could that Bush was going to find an excuse to invade Iraq, and that neither candidate was addressing the threat of Al Qaeda. After 9/11, I felt like joining the military to fight Bin Laden, but desisted, suspecting misuse by the Bush/Cheney administration. I was against the invasion. I later lost someone I knew in the war, and then watched in horror as my brother was assigned to Iraq. Luckily he came back alive. Now, let's move beyond the politics.<br/><br/>In ""American Sniper"", Eastwood and his crew focused on answering two great questions: what would lead a man to kill so many people? And what happens to that killer outside of the war front? Think about it: Chris Kyle's amount of kills would place him #4 on the all-time serial killer list. However, all of his killing was within the military context.<br/><br/>This movie's answer to the questions: he was raised to view himself as a protector, was trained in shooting from a young age, was a 'good ole boy' who had a false start in his adult life, and found his calling when he saw the 1998 embassy bombings (not 9/11). Religion is not a factor; he carries an unopened Bible as a talisman of sorts. He wants to go after the Al Qaeda terrorists. At the end of his training, 9/11 happens. The movie then skips over the Afghanistan war and the Iraq invasion per se, and dives straight into Kyle's chance to go after a terrorist, by being part of the mission to hunt Al Zarqawi. (Yes, I understand that Al Qaeda was able to come into Iraq as a consequence of the US invasion.) From there on Kyle is locked obsessively in the hunt, which becomes progressively personal, as the hunter becomes the hunted. He is initially disturbed by his killings. He later is knee-deep in the war and believes himself to be protecting people through violent mayhem. He is paranoid, being told that the only people left in the city are those helping the enemy, and he has some setbacks when he tries to trust people. He has become a killing machine, a hunter, and cannot transition back home, to life with his family. He is a very different person, tense, stressed, obsessed. He serves an insane four tours. He does not want to celebrate his fame. He still questions some killings, to the point of vomiting. When he chooses to stop, his sense of mission accomplished is different from where he started. He then returns to a full-blown battle: that for his mental health. He finds solace through helping other veterans unwind their own warrior psyche. I found all of this to be fascinating and balanced.<br/><br/>Is ""American Sniper"" pro-war-in-Iraq, despite its depiction of the damages to the the US soldiers? Although there is increased time towards the end dedicated to intense battles where you are asked to root for the US soldiers, overall I do not think that it justified the war. There is no ""win"" (save for one personal battle/competition); just an exit. There is no heroic, glorious score. Kyle's character avoids talking politics. He firmly believes that he is fending off a terrorist invasion of the USA, and/or simply protecting other soldiers (the latter which is questioned). Two characters close to him question the war, with one flat-out saying ""I don't think what we are doing is right anymore"". I also did not find ""American Sniper"" to be a portrayal of Iraqis as 'evil savages'. The term 'savages' is used a couple of times by the soldiers to describe terrorists and fighters who had attacked them. This is shown within context of a realistic exchange between soldiers. Otherwise, I felt that the movie forced us to view every Iraqi as humans. Most of Kyle's targets seemed nervous, not necessarily evil, picking up a weapon more out of an opportunity to fight, and wielding weapons more threatening than them. Some are shown as victims of the fight between both sides. Other Iraqis are shown as understandably angry at soldiers. Even Kyle's rival sniper seemed to be simply doing his job, a sort of mirror image of Kyle. Some of his shots are shocking, and you wish that the people did not have to be shot. The only truly evil characters are 'The Butcher' and his cohorts.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, ""American Sniper"" is very well acted (Bradley Cooper disappears into the role incredibly well), edited, and shot. The weakness? Some of the battle scenes towards the end go on unnecessarily, and come close to transforming into a standard action movie. Instead, we could have used some more time with Kyle at home after he leaves the war.<br/><br/>For those of you looking to make a flat-out anti-Bush era wars movie, go ahead and carefully adapt ""Where Men Find Glory"". How about an Iraqi equivalent of ""Das Boot""? For those of you trying to glorify the Iraq invasion, go make a sci-fi flick. You will find none of these movies in ""American Sniper""."

","A different movie than I thought. Less a movie about the joys of war and more about the psychology effect of war on people. I can tell that many people who wrote about this move did not actually see the movie. Those that talk about it being propaganda have never seen or did not stay to watch it. This movie did not say war is good was nothing good. Only the attitude that a man went to war to protect Americans and with this ideal, he went on to be great. It took a longer time for him to be affected by the evils of war, but in the end, the evils of war, eventually caught up with him and he had to quit, even if he didn't want to quit. I don't understand the hate I hear about it, except that some are predisposed to a certain opinion and can't look at this film objectively."

But the ultimate shock is that it's produced and directed by the same man who produced and directed Million dollar baby and Mystic river.... i believe that Clint Eastwood has hit rock bottom in this motion picture as a producer and director. now that being said.not only i don't see any cinematic or dramatic values added in comparison to previous motion picture production of the same genre such as black hawk down, platoon,we were soldiers, and The thin red line,i consider this production to be a smirch on the page of both Clint Eastwood's productions and the American filmmaking history."
"pfgpowell-1","4","17","39","31 January 2015"," Disgraceful, dishonest and offensive - one-dimensional twaddle
","Clint Eastwood's latest, American Sniper, presents this reviewer with a real quandary: if you buy into Eastwood's central premise that the SEALS, marines and other U.S. grunts who rampaged around Iraq in the second Coalition invasion imagining they were 'liberating' its people were justified in their mission and actions, and if you subscribe to the gungho simplistic notion of the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys', American Sniper does the business, though in a pretty pedestrian, run-of-the-mill manner (Eastwood won't win any awards for imaginative direction).<br/><br/>If you don't buy into Eastwood's central premise - and I certainly don't - American Sniper is a disgraceful, offensive piece of garbage. I don't doubt that it might have tens of thousands of red-blooded young Yankees cheering on their man to the rafters and will have many a Vietnam and Iraq War vet wiping away a private tear in memory of fallen friends and comrades, and I can understand their reaction. (According to IMDb figures, American Sniper has already taken more then $217 million at the box office.) But that doesn't in any way redeem the film itself.<br/><br/>Let me make it very clear that I believe it is the politicians, notably George W Bush, Dick Cheney, Tony Blair and their acolytes, who must be blamed for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths, most of them civilian, which have resulted from the second Iraq War, not the men they sent there to do their dirty work, many of whom lost their lives and a great many more of whom lost limbs.<br/><br/>They, as always throughout history, paid and are still paying the price of what often seems like one man's vanity - exactly why George Bush got it into his head that Iraq must be invaded and persuaded Britain's Tony Blair to support his plans was, is and will remain forever a mystery: no 'weapons of mass destruction were found' and Iraq's then dictator Saddam Hussein was not only not harbouring Al Qaeda, he was at daggers drawn with them.<br/><br/>I didn't actually cotton on that Eastwood was this film's director until the credits rolled - the fact had simply eluded me until then. But had I done so, and going on past Eastwood efforts, I would have had second thoughts about sitting down to watch another of his efforts. Eastwood's alleged masterpiece Unforgiven is, in my view, anything but and merely a two-dimensional cowboy film brought up to day in which the transformation of a now peaceful, retired and more or less arthritic gunslinger and how he regains his rusty skills in about two and a half minutes is ludicrous.<br/><br/>Even more ludicrous is the transformation in Gran Turino of a lifelong racist who hates Asians because of his wartime experiences virtually overnight into a caring, liberal do-gooder who'll give his life for one of them. In musical terms Eastwood is something of a two-chord merchant and neither chord is interesting.<br/><br/>American Sniper is from the same stable and has even greater faults: what, exactly, is 'the story'? All we get is merely a series of gun battles, most of which are confusing in the extreme. The characterisation of Chris Kyle and his patient, though often despairing, wife are so rudimentary as to be non-existent. Why, exactly, did Kyle repeatedly volunteer for tours of duty and in doing so neglect his wife and two young children? Suggesting it was 'patriotism' might work in a primary school textbook, but otherwise will not wash - there is something more profound at work, but Eastwood's American Sniper suggests nothing.<br/><br/>And why were Iraqis defending their country from what they saw as invading aggressors so vilified? They were only doing what each of those patriotic US servicemen would also do if Texas or New England, or Utah - or anywhere in the US - were invaded: they would defend their country, homes and family to the last man.<br/><br/>Yet when Iraqis do it they are 'bad' and 'savages'. Give me a break! Doesn't it occur to Eastwood and his assorted cheerleaders that every country in the world believes itself to be 'the best'? I don't for a second deny anyone - not least the Americans - the patriotic pride they feel (thought it does stick in my craw that the rest of us are by default expected to share that pride and equally vilified if we don't), but they must allow folk from other nations to feel the same pride. Those are two more reasons why Eastwood's American Sniper is disgraceful, offensive garbage and dishonest to boot.<br/><br/>Whether or not you rate the film will most certainly depend on what your take is on the second Iraq War, and having read what I have to say you might disagree entirely with the points I make. But be warned: if you don't disagree with me, then give this film a miss. You will get nothing from it but anger and supreme irritation.<br/><br/>(I have given this a 4/10 and not a lesser mark merely because technically American Sniper stands up. For content it would get 0/10.)"

","Kris Kyle: An American Hero<br/><br/>I have not seen ""American Sniper"" but I did read what Sarah Palin said about the ""left in Hollywood"". America does need a hero; since the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and President Kennedy were assassinated, there has been a hole in the moral fabric of America. They were the last great heroes. Khris Kyle represents what a hero is: courage, sacrifice and loyalty. All I know about the movie and the man is the basic story and that he was murdered at home, on American soil; this is his service record: ""Kyle served four tours in the Iraq War and was awarded several commendations for acts of heroism and meritorious service in combat. He received two Silver Star Medals, five Bronze Star Medals, one Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals.[9] Iraqi insurgents dubbed him the ""Devil of Ramadi"" and placed a series of ever increasing bounties on his head, purported to have eventually reached the low six figures. He became known by the moniker ""Legend"" among the general infantry and Marines whom he was tasked to protect. This title initially originated in jest among fellow SEALs following his taking of a sabbatical to train other snipers in Fallujah.[10] He was wounded twice and involved in six IED attacks."" ((Wikipedia) The man who shot him at a target range is awaiting trial. The importance of this film for the American public is that it is a small beacon in a very dark world where hope is needed that there are heroes, real ones that live, work, hurt and die in the service of something bigger than themselves. I am not a Palin fan but I believe that this film threatens the ""left in Hollywood"" or liberal elite because they are the part of Hollywood that contains no moral substance or fiber. I will see this film and I think that every person who believes and desires freedom and liberty should see it too as a reminder of what it means to sacrifice one's self for what one loves in a bigger and more glorious picture.

"CowherPowerForever","9","17","39","19 January 2015"," I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took.
","Clint Eastwood brings us another great film. Eastwood is very well known and popular for playing many great characters as an actor, and now that he is older he has become one of the best directors. This is Eastwood's second film of 2014, with Jersey Boys being the first. To release one amazing film is something, but to make two films that are great to amazing is something special. Eastwood's war movie American Sniper is more than just the story of Chris Kyle, it is a war story that shows the efforts of fighting and killing people in war. The following is my review of American Sniper.<br/><br/>The film was written by Jason Hall who wrote the film based on the book written by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen, and James Defelice. Hall is known for recently writing a film called Paranoia. This film is a horse of a different color compare to his previous work, but he tells an excellent story here. Not only does the story follow Chris Kyle(Bradley Cooper) during his four tours of service, but it also gives an insight into Kyle's background growing up and his family life while he was serving. This part of the story is where the film slightly drops off in my opinion. As the film goes back to when Kyle was younger, in my opinion the story moves too quickly over his life when he was younger and right before he joined the Seals. Usually you see a story needs to be trimmed, but in this case it should have added more. In the lead up to watching this film I heard so much about this film, from it being a pro war film to a propaganda piece. I can honestly say I never got that feel. The film simply shows what Kyle went threw as he was helping to fight a war. The film covers some anti wars aspects(although not in great detail), and really hammers home the effects war has not only the service people, but also their families. The story Hall delivers here for the big screen is a great work, and even if he wasn't able to go deeper into Kyle's story, we are still left with one amazingly written film.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is the director of this film as he is known for directing such great films such as Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino, and Unforgiven. Eastwood always delivers a fabulous looking film that keeps you at the edge of your seat. He also brings out the best in his actors as he is also a fabulous actor. The film stars Bradley Cooper(Chris Kyle) and Sienna Miller(Taya Kyle) with some amazing acting from the secondary actors in the film. Cooper is really able to draw you into his character and greatly care about him over the course of the film. The film can be very emotional throughout the film and with Eastwood behind the camera that aspect takes a big step up. I personally thought that the film could have added some more detail in his younger life, but the film sticks well together and moves by amazingly. This film is not the least bit boring. Clint Eastwood has directed an amazing war film that drags you into the life of those serving and their families. This is a film that is surely not to be missed.<br/><br/>In closing, we are left with a powerful film that while doesn't completely tell everything about Kyle's life, it does show the pain and suffering our men and women go through as they serve for their country. The film delivers a powerful message and that should not be overlooked. This film might not be for the whole family, but even younger viewers in their teenage years should be able to watch this film even with the bad language and war violence. While I can't say this is my favorite film of 2014, it certainly is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed.<br/><br/>9/10"

If Bush and Cheney are devout on their belief to spread democracy to the Middle East, then why won't they go fight for that belief.<br/><br/>3) In real life, I enjoy the Irony that Chris Kyle was killed by: a) a Gun b) another Military guy c) in Texas d) at a Gun Range<br/><br/>Serves him right.<br/><br/>4) Like many reviewers pointed out, this guy was not a hero.

","For some who will take umbrage at this review I say flatly I am a combat Veteran.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood demonstrates once again why he is one of the top 10 Directors of all time joining the company of Billy Wilder, George Stevens, William Wyler, Frank Capra, George Cukor, John Huston, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean as a consummate story teller. Eastwood is brilliant in bringing to life the story of Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper becomes Chris Kyle, and if not for Hollywood's leftist dismissal of war films that show American soldiers in positive light, Cooper would be a cinch to win Best Actor!<br/><br/>Eastwood's being denied a Best Director nomination is more a reflection of bias; the audience has voted making this the biggest grossing war film of all time<br/><br/>The entire cast beginning with Sienna Miller gives Cooper great support.<br/><br/>The movies wrenching ending engendered from the audience I saw it respectful and strong applause.<br/><br/>Bravo Eastwood and Cooper"
"budnik29","10","14","31","6 February 2015"," A Truly Wonderful Hero!!
","There seems to be a lot of hate for Chris Kyle and this movie in general. What boggles my mind is that some are comparing this to Nazi propaganda films. How sad that a man who saved probably more lives than he killed is being demonized as some kind of blood thirsty war criminal. Can't people even see that this was supposed to be a movie about the effects of war on a family and how its tears a person up mentally and physically. <br/><br/>To everyone criticizing Kyle, i say lace up some boots and go do what he did. Then you might have a say in how cowardly he was. Its so easy for you to sit in a movie theater and critique a true American hero and toss aside his love for his country and for doing what was right by his fellow soldiers. Sorry if this movie wasn't politically correct. Sorry if some people were portrayed in the wrong limelight. Quit being so sensitive over a film that isn't PC enough for you. <br/><br/>I remember the great war films of the past and how we used to practically worship our men in uniform. Now they are all so called killers, and all of a sudden the military has a hidden agenda to destroy all life. Don't you see how counter productive that would be? and there sure would be many politicians blowing the whistle on these warriors if that were the case.<br/><br/>Its too bad the blood of some of the best patriots in history have to be spilt for the likes of the progressive ungratefuls i see writing on here and everywhere else on the internet. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. If you had all been allowed to make decisions in this great country, we'd have been taken over before WW2 were a distant thought.<br/><br/>Congrats Mr Eastwood on making a great movie!.

We all know the politics of the Iraqi war, this film was not meant to answer the rights and wrongs of the conflicts, it was about someone who joins the Seals and uses his talents as a sniper.<br/><br/>As a soldier you protect your own, if you're facing an enemy who hides behind women and children and puts them in the line of fire, who are the monsters? Someone mentioned that if the Iraqi war did not happen we would not have Isis, how deluded can you get! Many Muslims are radicalised through the use of hatred and history going back as far as the crusades, and target the easily led, and the last I checked American military doctrine does not allow the beheading of non-combatants, which we are witnessing at the moment by Isis animals.<br/><br/>BTW I enjoyed the film leave the politics to the politicians."

It is a movie and not a documentary after all.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a true story but it wouldn't hurt to put some artistic cinematography in there so that the audience could actually relate better to what Kyle was doing the whole time he was in the war.<br/><br/>I felt absolutely nothing, no remorse no hate no nothing about the characters, I'm just very frustrated and can't accept the fact that this is a Clint Eastwood film.<br/><br/>Maybe he should have cast Morgan Freeman again eh ?<br/><br/>Last thought : They spent millions of dollars to make this movie but couldn't find a baby and replaced it with a fake baby doll ?

","Though there is some flaws to this film I gave it a 10. Not because it was perfect, because no movie is. The movie was good and served its purpose. However, I find it horribly disgusting that ANYONE who currently lives on American soil could EVER say that Chris Kyle is not an American Hero. MEN&WOMEN like him ARE the reason you're alive and are even able to say that. Just because he did things that you do not approve of does not mean he even approved of them himself. He did what he had to do, his job. He protected who he needed to protect. Our own. Unfortunately you have to kill innocent people,(including women and children.) to protect your own. That is how life is. They would do it to us, and that you need to remember. Those children are most likely going to grow up just like their parents. And the women are already dead because they are pretty much slaves to the men. They are not people, they are animals. I wish that anyone who has something bad to say about Chris Kyle could be in his shoes or the shoes of anyone in the military. AND then come back home after what they have endured. This country has gone downhill, its absolutely horrifying. Many of you need a reality check. You do not respect the people that give you your freedom. Wake up, or get out."
"feakes","Null","15","34","2 February 2015"," Chris Kyle the most lethal sniper in U.S. Military history.
","American Sniper the book was a incredible read of action and heartbreak. and it told so much that no movie could contain it. When I saw American Sniper the movie. The basic parts of the book are in intact. Hollywood but intact. Although it glosses over Kyle's early years and it misses the point as Kyle's upbringing was not anything like that. nor was his rodeo career. Kyle had made his mind up long before any terror attacks to join the military. Kle had been badly hurt in a rodeo where a horse fell on him breaking his wrist badly which required pins. at first the navy passed on him because of this injury. but Kyle kept at it and got into the Navy S.E.A.Ls the elite and best of the best. Kyle's book goes into more in depth detail of his training then the movie does and it goes a long way to explain his actions. And his beliefs. It also explains a lot better about why he did what he did. But again since this is a movie it only has a limited time to tell the story. And it does with heart breaking accuracy. There is a lot of action and a lot of pain. As we see Chris Kyle progress from young Navy S.E.A.L to a husband and then a war vet.The movie's best parts are when he comes home between deployments and we see the toll the war is taking on him. Kyle is pushed back into the normal world where nothing seems the same anymore and the only thing keeping him sane is his family. the heart break comes at the very end when we find out about Chris Kyle's sad tragic end. My favorite part comes where we Chris at a garage after his last deployment in which he and his team rescue some marines after a intense battle and Chris meets a marine he saved. Chris is in a garage with his son getting his car fixed. The sweet bit was the interaction between Cooper and the boy playing his son that was realistic but the icing on the cake was when he meets a man he saved and his reaction to the man as he tells the boy your dad is a hero thank you for lending him to us . That part choked me up quite a bit because I am a father. and I know how hard it was for Kyle to go to war with a small family. The battle with PSTD is simply the most authentic I have ever seen and you realize just how much the war changed him. And as he realizes it. And struggles to come back to be Chris Kyle the man and the husband and father. was this a perfect movie no far from it. but it was maybe the best war movie I have seen in a long long time."
"twotrybe","3","29","74","10 January 2015"," It just lays there with everything
","I didn't find this adaptation to be a good venue for storytelling. As you watch this, you have no investment into any of the characters. It wasn't awful it was just there. Bradley Cooper in this role just filled in the screen without giving any essence to his character. And in the scenes where he's being a soldier, there was no immediacy, no sense of trepidation, no feeling of dread, just as if he was a kid and he was playing soldier for the game of playing soldier. I don't necessarily fault him for that, I put the responsibility squarely in Clint Eastwood's direction. And it is because it is a Clint Eastwood film I find that the expectations of a better performance was diluted and I don't know if it was the script but it just wasn't there. Even the Sienna Miller character was a one dimensional point. She was pregnant on the phone and his life is in danger wasn't moving enough and as the final scene where he drives off with the man who would eventually kill him was left empty. This wasn't Clint Eastwood's better film and Bradly Cooper just rolled over and took it with a limp one without challenging the work."

"miy66","7","12","26","26 January 2015"," Sad But True!
","Love Clint Eastwood as a director as he doesn't do much wrong. This is an interesting movie depicting the true story of Chris Kyle. I didn't know the story and so didn't see the end coming. I think the movie is very well done as it does show the ugliness of the war in Iraq and the impact particularly on families and the soldiers themselves. You truly can't be trained to kill people then expect it to have no impact on you! I think Clint has directed a very realistic movie without going over the top with the action sequences. He just shows things as they probably were/are. Bradley Cooper does an outstanding job capturing Chris Kyle without adopting a action man status which would have made the movie too 'American corny'. Sienna Miller is also great as his wife. This movie isn't overcomplicated and tells a story of a man who does his job extremely efficiently but still suffers as a lot as people did and still do coming out of an intense fighting/killing situation. An expressive movie again by Clint, and definitely worth your time."

","Chris Kyle, Navy Seal, is a first rate sniper and tactician, but finds it difficult to return to real life after four tours of duty in the middle east.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Kyle in Clint Eastwood's biographical movie of Kyle's life, mixing action sequences in Iraq with rather more soapy stuff back in the States. That's not to downplay the domestic element: Sienna Miller is excellent as Kyle's wife, developing from bachelorette to mother and distressed wife, concerned at the husband whose personality hasn't fully returned from Iraq. And Kyle's recognition of his problem and eventual preparedness to address it are well shown, too, and contain some of the strongest elements of Cooper's performance.<br/><br/>But the combat sequences are probably what will live in the memory. They are extremely well staged, exciting, visceral, suspenseful, and full of jeopardy.<br/><br/>This is a very good film with an excellent central performance from Cooper who is maturing well as an actor. Eastwood's direction is good, especially in the combat sequences, albeit possibly a shade too leisurely overall."

","As always when talking about movies based on events regarding terrorism or war, you have to approach all of the content with delicacy and open mind. I have always done that for this types of movies and have yet to be truly disappointed both on the artistic and the informative style, I'm speaking of course about the recent ""Lone Survivor"" but more importantly of the masterpiece that is ""Zero Dark Thirty"". None of these have approached the material with a closed mind or with a America-f**k-yeah attitude (even if Lone Survivor did a little bit of that). So does ""American Sniper"" succeed in following the ordeal of these films? The answer is a plain yes. Of course we are talking about three very different films story and content wise, but the core of the historical themes remain.<br/><br/>On the artistic side the film is very well done, it certainly and openly borrows a page from ""Black Hawk Down"" and even though it doesn't exactly reach those heights it certainly goes very near. Sometimes you can't really understand what's going on and who is shooting who, but for the very major part the action is riveting, gritty and you feel thrown into it. The emotional core of the movie is solid and thanks to the best performance Bradley Cooper has given yet we feel every sentiment his character goes through. It is very touching in multiple moments and overall an experience that should be had on the theater.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie does have some problems. It doesn't answer, or even ask many questions and doesn't deepen any arguments about the war. The only themes which are treated are about patriotism and veteran stress, and whilst hands down it does a f***ing stunning job at portraying these aspects of the war and making me emphasize and understand as I had never done before, the movie is simply not an interesting look at the Iraq War. It is an interesting look at a fascinating character, in the mist of this war that could have opened up so many more opportunities for provocative filmaking. Plus it has very tyring end credits, that kind of ruined the nature of the movie. Whilst the film is trying to convey patriotism in a very human way that had me very attentive, the credits just blow it up to one thousand and took away a lot of the emotion of before.<br/><br/>Anyways, I don't want to seem I'm putting out there a too controversial statement, I liked the movie a lot and took away a lot from it, it is a great portrayal of a complex real life character, I just wanted another Zero Dark Thirty going into it and most certainly and unfortunately didn't get it."

","I can't say that I see the appeal when it comes to ""American Sniper"". Frankly, I don't understand what all the fuss has been about. This is a film that I found to be sub-standard in almost every way possible and by no means anything remarkable. It's something that seems to have absolutely no point whatsoever and fails to find one along the way, leaving the audience left to watch meaningless recounted events. And after a while, it gets a bit monotonous. <br/><br/>As you may know, the film centers around the infamous Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, focusing on his four tours of duty in Iraq. We see him grapple with keeping his fellow soldiers alive while also pursuing leads on various al-Qaeda members. <br/><br/>And what could be an interesting story - possibly one of value - is reduced to a tiresome gimmick revolved around whether or not he can snipe down person after person. It seems to have been made just to prove the fact that he is ""the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history"". With flashbacks to his childhood straight out of a TV movie and unnecessary jumps from his time at home to his time serving, it never quite finds a rhythm. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be an intense war flick or a study on his PTSD, and I'm not sure that Clint Eastwood knew either.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper manages to deliver a solid performance here but he's certainly done much better work and has virtually no chemistry with co-star Sienna Miller.

","Just returned from the cinema in a state of disbelief at the movie I have just seen. Now I was under no illusion prior to sitting down that what I was about to see may involve some fluttering Stars and Stripes but.....this piece of work has to be one of the most one dimensional films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Was this intentional? the characters and their journeys were so straightforward and predictable that I actually began to see virtual signposts with every development of this 'story'. Surely Eastwood and the writer must have realized this, or perhaps an aging Eastwood is not capable anymore. Kyle's compatriots were introduced and disposed of with little commotion.<br/><br/>The script was simple. The casting was questionable. Miller was stifled, Cooper was chugging around the place like a chuck Norris with a speech impediment. <br/><br/>who was it aimed at? clearly not me or anyone else that questions what they see at the flicks. If Kyle did really see everything in 'black and white' then this movie is bang on the money. There are no grey areas for the viewer to ask questions or relate to anything they see. Therefore, I can only assume that the filmmakers were aiming squarely at current or returning servicemen and their families. In which case, how and why should this movie be gaining traction as a piece of entertainment?<br/><br/>The war scenes seemed gritty and real and several set pieces held tension. But I'm still incredulous that this has been nominated for any award let alone an Oscar. <br/><br/>Don't see it if you have a moral heart.

","War and killing should never be glorified but justifiably brings out a multitude of emotions when watching Movies in this genre. However, as a Reviewer it's important to put this in the most simplistic light instead of any long-winded personal feelings of whose to blame, why we are there, kill or be killed, hero or no hero and other character assassinations. Don't over look the point of Clint Eastwood's intentions here. Most of us were doubly damn angry after having time to contemplate events post 9/11. Chris Kyle too watched in horror as the twin towers crumbled. He did what most of us wanted to do; make them pay. ""Hornet's Nest USA"" had been deeply disturbed. Chris acted quickly knowing that his keen eye with a rifle since childhood could contribute to the War Effort and hopefully save many of his Comrades lives. Bradley Copper's outstanding acting kept you completely focused and engrossed all the way through this film. Eastwood's direction made you feel you were right by Chris's side, breath by breath and heartbeat by heartbeat. I enjoyed the scenes where Eastwood picks up on the relatively minor details. In particular, the scenes of Chris speaking to his wife on his cell phone mostly in the middle of combat that helps give this film its reality check; that we like to share our longings and loneliness's to those closest to us no matter where we are or what we are doing.Who doesn't call their partners from their workplace? In closing, the Dust Storm scenario at the end of Tour 4 was one of most dramatic weather effected scenes that I have watched in a movie and perhaps worth the price of admission alone."

","It is so rare that Hollywood gives us a film like American Sniper. It is a film that doesn't want for the audience to feel bad about being American. Too often we have to see such tripe like '12 Years a Slave' for them to time and time again brainwash sheep into thinking that America is wrong and evil. American Sniper is a breath of fresh air. It is a film that makes one feel strong and uplifted about their country. It's a brave film that shows the world for what it really is and shows us that the real evil out there is not our sacred American ideals and institutions despite what leftist goons might think but instead the evil is those heathen radical murderers that the democrats want you to feel sorry for and apologize for being American to. Chris Kyle was a great hero because he knew that there was only one way to deal with such monsters. They have to be destroyed. Kudos to Clint Eastwood who has been a pillar of strength who makes movies that don't emasculate the audiences with touchy feely garbage. <br/><br/>American Sniper is a masterpiece. I think those goofy freedom hating cowards attacking Chris Kyle will be surprised when this movie sweeps the Academy Awards. They'll be crying when a movie about a real war hero wins instead of 'The Imitation Game'. The liberal media grossly underestimates the amount of patriots out there ready to stand up to their cowardice. Chris Kyle's message of bravery and strength will inspire countless audiences to stand up to their tyranny and destruction of American values. People who are against Chris Kyle deserve nothing more than to live in a failed Islamic state."
"RaymondKoepsell","10","14","32","1 February 2015"," Harrowing emotional blockbuster
","Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorite directors. Although a fine actor in his own right, Eastwood six-decades in front of the camera seems to give him the ability to pull out the very best from his actors when he's behind the camera. Bradley Cooper gives a career-highlight performance as Chris Kyle, and this is an absolute must-see for any American. <br/><br/>Most negative reviews all seem to include a negative assessment of our nation's moral imperative to engage in the war on terror in Iraq, which has absolutely bearing with the artistic merits of this or any film. Since this approach has dominated the vast majority of the negative User Reviews, I feel compelled to offer a moral defense of this movie. <br/><br/>Many negative reviews object to the portrayal of jihadists as as ""savages,"" but that argument serves as compelling evidence of how political correctness has corrupted public dialog. Any organization or nation who perpetrates war by hijacking planes and flying into skyscrapers in NYC is acting savagely. Any organization or nation who beheads journalists and civilians and posts a video on Youtube is acting savagely. Any organization or nation who uses women and children as human shields or human bombs is acting savagely. Detractors of this film suggest that Abu Deraa (""The Butcher"") is a fictional contrivance invented to give this movie traction, but those same detractors are either ignorant or willfully ignorant of history. <br/><br/>*********SPOILER ALERT*************<br/><br/>Any organization or nation who uses power drills and (worse, if that's even possible) hand-held drills to torture and murder perceived political enemies is acting savagely. A harrowing scene featuring a power drill is the moral linchpin of this movie. In the months immediately following 9/11, we were united in our grief at the gruesomeness of the attacks in NYC, the Pentagon, and the passengers of United 92 who bravely died preventing more carnage. <br/><br/>In the 14 years since 9/11, the shock, grief, outrage, and horror we shared about the depravity of the attacks have been homogenized into a polite remembrance of 3,000 American dead. Certainly, 3,000 families will never recover, but our left-leaning culture is attempting to sanitize the events of that day by attempting to force the rest of us into a historical perspective by demanding we are tolerant of or at least empathetic towards their motivations. The drill scene serves a stark reminder that al Queda, ISIS, and other terrorists will use any means necessary to carry out jihad, and it gives Bradly Cooper a moral imperative to serve his country using his unique skill set. We are lucky as a nation that there are and have been sheepdogs like Chris Kyle to watch over us all, even those who use their First Amendment rights to criticize his heroism."
"brianjbean2","7","14","32","31 January 2015"," Don't pay any attention to the politically motivated reviews
","First of all, this movie tells the story of an idealistic Texas cowboy-turned soldier, wanting to serve his country and protect Americans. Others may disagree with the reality of who Chris Kyle was, but this is the story the movie portrays. The character flaws some are attributing to him are laughably minor and wouldn't have added anything to the film. But it seems if you are pro- America in any sense, and have any character flaws that offend politically correct sensibilities, anything that portrays you positively is disregarded as propagandistic garbage. Regrettably, many are labeling anything that portrays America or American soldiers in a remotely positive light during this conflict, as propaganda, and they're doing it strictly for political reasons. <br/><br/>Others claim this film portrays all Iraqis as murderers and ""savages."" I didn't get this image of them at all, even though Chris Kyle does use the term ""savages"" to describe those they are fighting. But it's hard to blame him given the sadistic brutality they inflicted on other Iraqis. He wasn't using the term broadly to describe all people of color in a racist sense, and to claim he was is simply projecting your own bias upon him. Those who helped Americans are portrayed as sympathetic victims of our mutual enemy's brutality. Those who tortured and butchered the Iraqis who helped Americans, are usually shown being shot and battled by American soldiers. This is/was a reality, and I reject the idea that a movie like this should make no moral distinction between our troops and those who mean them harm. What those one-star people seem to be clamoring for is a film depicting Americans as the real villains. Essentially, they were just disappointed it wasn't the propaganda they wanted to see. <br/><br/>The morality of war is complicated to be sure, but consciously inserting an anti-war moral message in an attempt to affect people's opinions, is an act of overt propaganda. This film does show the moral conflict Chris Kyle has to reconcile within himself as he often has women and children in his cross-hairs and must decide. There are others in the film who struggle with the validity of the conflict as well. It also depicts the toll war takes on soldiers who are injured physically and mentally, far from the one-sided, propagandistic message many have claimed.<br/><br/>That aside, I had problems with the script, directing, and use of CGI to make obviously fake babies look real. You couldn't get a real baby for a nursing scene? You couldn't use real drone footage of Fallujah or something, other than sketchy video game graphics? Chris Kyle's nemesis, is often portrayed as a parkouring, Rambo-like character, tying his bandanna while looking at himself in the mirror. All that is just silly. So the film is not perfect in those respects, and those flaws often take you back out of the story you are trying to immerse yourself in. The quality of the filmmaking is on par with Gran Torino. It's a little clumsy, but a worthy effort. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper does a good job, but is it really Oscar worthy? The bottom line is that the story is compelling and if the events are true, one cannot come away from this film without a deeper respect for Chris Kyle, his family, his service and his sacrifice to save others, as well as for others who serve in the military. Claiming this film is propaganda because you don't like Chris Kyle or disagreed with the Iraq war, doesn't change the reality of the story that this film tells. Was Chris Kyle flawed? Undoubtedly. But good people, like good films, are often flawed."

Sienna Miller is great as his wife too, showing the stress of being a wife to a Navy Seal.<br/><br/>Another big positive is, of course, the action. It's very realistic, with plenty of blood and exciting moments to keep American Sniper moving at a good pace. Also, the script is brilliant as the dialogue between Kyle's army mates is snappy and often comedic, again very realistic.<br/><br/>To top this cracking film off, the ending scene where Kyle is revealed to have died is very powerful and wraps up a powerful film perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, a total triumph."

","Like many, I had very high expectations for this film. Regardless of the high praise it was getting from critics, American Sniper looked at first glance like it would be one of the best films of the year. It had all the makings of a truly great war flick, great true story, talented leading role and a more than capable director at the helm in Clint Eastwood. With all this in mind, I went into the theater with rather high expectations and I left only to have all of them shattered. American Sniper falls flat on almost every account. I never really felt any emotional connection to Kyle. All the situations in which Eastwood creates in order for the audience to feel for Kyle; his brief and terrible childhood sequence, his impromptu phone calls to his wife in the middle of battles, his struggle with PTSD after returning from duty, all felt like a desperate and poor act by the director to get me to relate or feel for Kyle. I'm not doubting that some of these events occurred, I'm sure some of them did - but they way they were portrayed in the film were such Hollywoodized versions of real life events that I really struggled finding any shred of believe-ability in them. The movie does not even succeed in its action aspect, having battle sequences that are extremely poorly shot and generic (the few that there are). Cooper, a lone bright spot in the the film, does a solid job with what little content he has but not even he is enough to save this train wreck of a movie from being what it really is; a movie with no heart, devoid of all true emotion."

I read his book, or tried to. In its pages I found an arrogant and empty person. In the end he disappeared the way he lived. The director in this case does not himself have enough depth of character to understand that this seems to be a picture of a loser. I was a soldier in Vietnam. I was a medic, not a sniper. I never met a sniper. I can only hope they are not like this guy. So many films about America's present wars show us a troubling picture of soldiers disconnected from their lives, not very interested really in their country and completely unable to understand the ""others"" they face in these conflicts. Some people view this empty man as some sort of hero, apparently. I do not. I could not finish his book. I just could not relate to this empty person. It is difficult to believe that the story teller in this case is trying to help us understand a lost generation. Or help us understand why so many American men come home from these wars and kill themselves. It does not seem to care at all about these deeper issues. After trying to read his book, and trying to watch this film, I see nothing to commend this man and his wasted life. If somewhere in the acting and in the script and in the direction, somebody was crying for help that never arrived...well, maybe that is a point worth rescuing. But I suspect no one really cares because he was such a precise and talented killer."
"azcoppen","6","25","64","9 January 2015"," Voted 10+ by Americans for being American, <6 by anyone else
","I'm just not sure what to think about this. I don't get why films have to have ""American"" in their name, other than for nationalism-peddling studio marketing scams. I don't get why they didn't just call it ""Sniper"", and it'd be interesting to see whether the same people voting this 9+ would give an equally good film the same score if it was called ""Islamic Sniper"". Propaganda is propaganda is propaganda is propaganda - whether it's produced in California, East Berlin, or in Pyongyang. I also don't get why Clint Eastwood chose this route, as his direction has been abjectly gorgeous again and again: the subtlety and elegant build up is always masterful. Nevertheless, i wanted to be open-minded, and not cynically write the piece off in the reactionary spin of labeling it American exceptionalism.<br/><br/>It does seem very badly-timed and insensitive in a period of public battle fatigue, and it has clearly been extremely divisive. As one commenter pointed out, ""when America makes a film about a war with a country that can fight back, i'll watch it."" All i could think about was the very old WWI quote that war is old men talking, and young men dying. War is horrific: everyone who's never been in one is in favor. Listen to any veteran's stories from the Middle East (burning bodies etc) and you instantly sense the ambiguity and nightmare-ish disillusionment. 1M+ civilians have died in Iraq, and now we have the phoenix of ISIL.<br/><br/>The terrifying statistic is that veteran suicides are now classed as an epidemic: 6.500 former personnel killed themselves in 2012 (22 per day over the last decade), and at least 20% suffer with PTSD (Shell Shock) - 50% of whom never seek treatment. More die from suicide than from enemy bullets, 22M receive some form of benefit, and 1M+ claims are hopelessly backlogged.<br/><br/>There is clearly something to say about the US military with spending more than the next 25 countries combined: it's training, tactics, post-battle care, and its invasive ideology. There is no apparent community ""hearts and minds"" strategy (e.g. the British manipulative rule book), just bomb and burn. The fact the US has had 20+ wars in its 200 years - most of dubious success - and it's the most sensitive patriotic tender-spot for the US public despite being the most neglected, implies there is some real material here to be explored.<br/><br/>And thankfully, the film slowly gets into gear to try to do that - to some extent. The first 30mins are fairly nauseating nationalism, but as time wears on, so does Kyle's disconnection with his ordinary self. The trouble is: one read of his book shows that the film character is a fabrication, or a pastiche caricature. He admittedly felt nothing of taking 200 lives, and was somewhat of an unquestioning military automaton: whether that should be celebrated as ""heroic"" is a matter of debate; ""skillful"" perhaps, maybe even virtuous at a stretch.<br/><br/>Soldiers can always be elevated for their bravery, and causes can be celebrated in the case of their validation of the Just War doctrine. But this did clearly not pass the Just War test; nor was the nobility of the troops' conduct evidenced in the sympathies of the local population; and the site of women and children resisting foreign troops is abhorrent, no matter how vicious TheTerrorists (TM) are portrayed. No matter how unjust or unsympathetic either side is, we can all understand brotherhood/camaraderie, loyalty, skillfully disciplining oneself to the task, suffering the personal consequences, our basic humanity, and so on. Heroism is differentiated from duty by the fact it is an exceptional act, and this worship is beginning to feel like narcissism.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what Eastwood's motivations were when parsing the script, but it sadly feels like dispassionate, sanctimonious back-patting. And if 6,500 men and women who offered to put themselves in harm's way have killed themselves and not even seen the counter-productive rise of the Islamic Caliphate they fought against for Halliburton, it's a gross disservice to ignore their testimonies in favor of an attempt at a serious version of Team America."

Because from a non patriotic standpoint, this film comes off as a flaccid jerk off to an image of the US military which became old fashioned years ago.<br/><br/>The constant reference to Iraqi's as savages, the timid or absent addressing of consequences or PTSDs effects on the man, the vacant smiles as the bland and completely forgettable cast perform their only role, to tell Kyle how great he is, and a flat atmosphere all make the experience slightly sickly.<br/><br/>The only redeeming moments are those with sniping in them, in which Cooper comes alive and you get the moral dilemma and tension that I was waiting for after seeing the trailer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is only a minor part of the film, the rest being a long character study of bluff, straight talking patriot who does his job; not exhilarating, not fun, not emotional and not thought provoking.<br/><br/>However, if you're already a fan of the autobiography, or followed Kyle's life before this, I can see why it'd be worth a watch. The issue is that the film fails to entice someone from outside its own mindset to see why its worth 133 minutes of their time.<br/><br/>For me, it just didn't make me feel anything, bar the sudden and unsettling end, which I suppose is accurate to what really happened, but it marks one of many interesting points that the film could've explored but didn't.<br/><br/>A forgettable experience with nothing to shout about technically or narratively as film."
"jandriod2012","1","8","16","28 June 2015"," Disappointing
","Putting all the politics aside, and disregarding any personal feelings about the Iraq war, I found this film to be lazy, lacking any merit, and ultimately quite boring. The main character is unsympathetically portrayed which I don't think was intentional, and rather one dimensional; there seems to be an underlying assumption that he is deserving of the audience's respect simply because he can shoot a rifle. I found the film overlong and rather 'garbled', and lost interest half way through. I can't understand why it was nominate for an Oscar, other than the standard American self congratulatory response to any aggressive action against other countries."
"djestic03","10","17","41","19 January 2015"," Fast-paced story, nuanced performances. GRIPPING !
","Other movies can be as good, but doubt any could be better. I marveled at the performances by Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller and Clint Eastwood's directing before finding out that the movie, Cooper, and Eastwood all were nominated. Miller should have been as well.<br/><br/>This is NOT just a war movie but as much a character study of a man in and out of war. You are put right in the action to feel the depth of Chris Kyle's service and dedication. Cooper's performance is nothing short of stunning: no space for over-the-top demonstrations of anger or detachment, but must be communicated in nuanced ways. At times, he comes across as a citizen in a documentary. Similarly, I thought Sienna Miller's performance the same way, as she must put us through the range of emotions at varying times. Eastwood avoids cloyingly trite performances and melodrama to let the power of the story play out. <br/><br/>This is NOT a glorification of war but is a tribute to man's calling. Some liberals have disparaged this movie as glorifying killing. HARDLY. Some have taken a quote--""...savages..."" out of context as well. There is a lot of depth to the components of this story. You'd be best off to ignore the political posturing and let the story affect you independently of the 'framing.' In short, unbelievably well crafted and well presented."

"jake-law123","8","17","41","17 January 2015"," Best Bradley Cooper performance since The Place Beyond the Pines
","Clint Eastwood is a master director, so right away I expected this to be good. I did not, however, expect to be as blown away by Bradley Cooper's performance as I was. Don't get me wrong, he's great, and he's apparently with Meryl Streep in getting nominated once a year, but I was not expecting him to be this good. His portrayal of American NAVY Seal sniper Chris Kyle who goes through four tours while struggling to cope with the horrors of war during the time with his wife and kids is possibly his best performance to date.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood never fails to impress. The directing is incredibly sharp, probably the best thing about this film. He takes a couple risks by being a little less subtle in certain moments. There are a lot of action scenes in this, but it's edited very well, showing us the war and its impact at home, even if it doesn't last very long. We got to see some interesting shots we don't usually see in Clint's film, like the airstrike close up shots, or the CGI helicopter in full view.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper portrays an American soldier whose duty it is to kill in the most realistic way imagined. He is on fire in this! The scene where he almost kills the kid with the RPG, his expressions and reactions are spot on!<br/><br/>I did enjoy the editing, but sometimes it went a little too much. Scenes are occasionally cut short after lasting like 10 seconds. Not to mention there's a scene that cuts away while they're getting shot at like, ""um okay, I guess the terrorists got bored and went home"". I would say the film could have shown a little more of Bradley Cooper trying to adapt to his life rather than just 2 minutes of that then 10 more minutes of action, but it's so well filmed it doesn't bother as much.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if you're patriotic, or if you love Eastwood. This is a must see, the film that The Hurt Locker should have been."
"ferguson-6","7","17","41","16 January 2015"," A Compulsion to Serve
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"". Shakespeare wrote those words for Henry IV, but director Clint Eastwood's latest film depicts the sentiment for Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL sharpshooter known as ""Legend"". Screenwriter Jason Hall adapted the story from Kyle's memoir (co-written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice).<br/><br/>You may not be aware of the sniper's role during a war. In an early scene (used in the trailer) we experience the incredibly stressful moment of decision that Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) faces as a mother and young child enter the street  are they a threat to the platoon or not? The decision means killing a woman and child or risking the death of many U.S. soldiers. If he is wrong, he faces a jury and military shame. Most of us lack the capacity for such decision-making. As a flashback to Kyle's childhood shows, most of us are either sheep or wolves. Only a very few are sheepdogs with the aggressiveness to protect the flock. Chris Kyle: sheepdog.<br/><br/>The story takes us through Chris' aimless young adult years on the cowboy circuit. He's a tough guy who likes to drink and party with his friends. September 11 acts as a call to action, a call to service. SEAL training is shown and the point is made that Chris is the old man in the group, but he displays a quiet leadership trait. We then witness his flirting with a snippy Taya (Sienna Miller) at a bar counter as his SEAL buddies throw darts at each other's bare backs (don't try that at home, kids). Soon enough Chris and Taya are married, and Chris is called to the front.<br/><br/>Back and forth we go through Chris Kyle's four tours. His expertise in war is offset by his inability to adjust to family life. He has a compulsion to serve and to protect his fellow soldiers, but he is unable to fit into the suburban life of cell phones and grilled hamburgers. Not surprisingly, Taya struggles with his struggles. Bradley Cooper gets to be the legend, while Sienna Miller is the emotional mother who has seemingly lost her husband – not to death, but to an obsession to serve.<br/><br/>The film does little to explain why Chris Kyle is exponentially more productive than other snipers, and even less to explore his PTSD and mental anguish outside of the front. It's Bradley Cooper's acting that provides us what insight we do get, and he does a remarkable job capturing the hulking, uncommunicative giant who doesn't really understand the ""legend"" title  he's just doing his job and following his nature.<br/><br/>The tragic end is handled with grace by Eastwood, and it left my full-capacity movie theatre as quiet as a church during prayer. It's possible to be a legend, but not a hero, and the movie makes no political statements regarding war or foreign policy. What it does show is that most of us are not sheepdogs."

","Just saw ""American Sniper.""<br/><br/>I FULLY understand why so many on the Left are coming unglued about the film and hate it so much. Chris Kyle - and all the others like him - are men they simply can not understand. The gulf between their world views is too great a chasm for them to even grasp it. So, of course, they can only hate that. And hate it they do.<br/><br/>The film is not light. It is very much unlike any ""typical war film."" Nor does it have absolutely anything to say about the politics of the war or about any of the other bigger issues surrounding it. That in and of itself means that the Left can only despise the film. Everything for them has to have a MESSAGE - and one that they approve of. <br/><br/>The focus of this was on the men - and women - who weren't oblivious to the war and were, instead, brutally affected by it by being in it. In it in one way or another. That was painful, damn painful, to sit through. And it was exquisitely well done. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was stunning to watch in his portrayal of Kyle. No stereotypes, no cardboard cutout characters there. The war's effect on him and his family - also very well done by Sienna Miller - was part of that painfulness, and rightly so.<br/><br/>I've sat through other Eastwood dramas -""Million Dollar Baby"" being the closest of such to this - and that one, in particular, hurt to watch, at times. But not like this one. <br/><br/>The theater wasn't packed but for a 7PM showing on a Tuesday night, out in the suburbs, it was very well attended. And as a measure of just how powerful the film was the audience was as quiet and somber leaving the theater as I've ever experienced. <br/><br/>We go to movies to be entertained. Even ""tear jerker"" movies are entertainment and most people will get up from their seats after watching those with plenty to say and express. There's chatter about what they just went through. And they quickly get back to thinking and talking about the rest of their lives once the lights come back up. Not this time. The audience was damn near silent.<br/><br/>This is a powerful film. And a painful one. It is well worth experiencing however. This is about the most moving film I've ever watched. This is not a ""date flick"" and nor is it anything to try and take in thinking its affect will be over once the credits stopped rolling. That said, it is definitely worth going to yourself. I recommend it highly.﻿"

Well basically the movie starts as Bradley mounting the sniper rifle where he is scoping out the enemies through his scope and looking after his fellow marines.Suddenly a child and his mother comes out of the building door and the mother gives the child a grenade.There it is shown that how hard it is to shoot a child for Chris kyle,but he has to do it in order to save his fellow men and then shoot the child's mother too as she picks up the grenade after her son dies.After taking the shot and saving the life of the soldiers he is bieng applauded by his fellow men sitting next to him on the roof but he(Chris Kyle)tells him to shut up as he did not liked shooting kids and female.

"tomgillespie2002","4","13","30","11 February 2015"," Little to engage with
","Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a uncomplicated film about a seemingly uncomplicated man. Bradley Cooper puts in another impressive performance as the tight-lipped, hulking marksman Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, clocking up 160 confirmed kills over four tours of duty in Iraq. Seeing that many people assassinated through the scope of his own rifle must surely have weighted heavily on Kyle's shoulders, only we wouldn't know it as Eastwood offers such little complexity to the man that we learn virtually nothing about him.<br/><br/>The film is little more than one action scene after another. The opening scene, which sees Kyle faced with the awful decision of whether to take out a child he believes is holding a grenade and on his way towards a unit of American soldiers, is riveting. From then on, Kyle's scenes are a repetitive montage of enemy or civilian, shoot or don't shoot. When he's on the ground, the action is confusing, and with such slight character dimension offered to Kyle's comrades, the tragedy of their deaths hold little impact. It's also difficult to sympathise with Kyle himself, who is portrayed as little more than an ignorant racist who lives his life by his father's recognition of him being blessed with the gift of aggression.<br/><br/>This would all be fine if Eastwood provided any sort of context. If wars need these kind of men in order to be won, then make that the point. If the film is supposed to be an honest look at a remarkably efficient marksman of questionable ethics, then offer us a window into his motivation. Any references to a controversial war, it's legality, and the methods employed during the invasion are completely ignored. Feeling the need to stick to familiar movie tropes, Kyle is faced by a foe, the Iraqi sniper Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), who did not exist in real life. He is a faceless, near- wordless villain, someone to boo and hiss at. Like all the other enemy soldiers, no motivation, background or personality is provided.<br/><br/>There are a few good points. Usually the 'home life' scenes of any war movie grind the narrative to an unwelcome halt, but it's in these moments where we finally get a glimpse at Kyle the real person. His wife, played by a very impressive Sienna Miller, is a rock (but thinly written), and it's through her eyes that we see Kyle's struggles with PTSD. And Cooper is excellent, bringing what little humanity to his character as the script allows and bulking up to an enormous size to do the man he's portraying justice. But ultimately, the film left me feeling hollow. There is no feeling of the passing of time, little to engage with on an emotional level, and Eastwood's personal views on such a hot topic and divisive figure are non-existent.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","American Sniper is a one brilliant war movie that is going to entertain you so much, that after the movie ends, you'll still think about it. <br/><br/>Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was nothing more than a Texan man who wanted to become a cowboy, but in his thirties, he found out that maybe his life needed something different, so he went to army to become a sniper. And he did well. He was called with some nicknames like hero and legend. He became best sniper in American history. The thing that i really appreciate in this movie is that they show his life like a younger guy at the beginning of the movie, and he gets much older and older and then, we came to a first scene of a movie when he is aimng at some kid who is holding a grenade. Also, i like that atmosphere of war. Kids and their moms are fighting for Iraq too. Nothing can stop them. I like that posttraumatic stress disorder after he came back at home when the war ends. Acting, of course, is one of the virtues that this movie can give us. Acting of Kyle Gallner (Goat-Winston) and Keir O'Donnell (Jeff Kyle) is best. <br/><br/>What is bad in this movie, well, I can tell you that there is nothing that really bothers me.<br/><br/>I'll definitely recommend you this movie, no matter what."

","Today in America many of us have become sheep, following whatever the media tells us. Much like hippies in the days of the Vietnam war we criticize violence but do nothing to help anyone.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that it's sick to see how many people are insulting a man who not only put his life on the line for his country, but also died while trying to help people in pain. Chris Kyle never ""loved"" killing as people seem to think, or he would have been one of the soldiers we've heard about before convicted of war crimes and he would not have left the service. The fact of the matter is the people Kyle killed were confused individuals raised on violence who would have killed American soldiers at any cost which likely would've resulted in them killing themselves. It should be noted not all of the Iraqis were depicted as savage killers, for example the family in their home clearly suffered from the violence of those around them.<br/><br/>People love to talk bad about the military but are never appreciative of the fact that without the people we have, who chose to serve in our military, we all would not have the freedoms we do today. This country was built by patriots not afraid to fight for what is right. Today we enjoy the comfort that our military gives us and constantly complain about the government. Of course the government isn't perfect but everyone just can't be jumping on the band wagon and disrespecting our soldiers. If someone doesn't agree with a war, that is perfectly fine. But don't disrespect people who would die to keep you alive because you won't do it yourself. Many countries force military service, but our military consists solely of those who genuinely want to serve.<br/><br/>The word ""Murder"" needs to stop being used in this film because just because someone doesn't like something that happened in a war does not make it murder. When someone lets a bomb off to kill civilians or does what the Nazi's did that is murder. However when an armed soldier kills an armed opponent that is not murder. It is terrible that Kyle had to kill a child, and Kyle felt terrible about doing it. But if he had not done it others would have died. That child was raised on a skewed idea that all westerners are bad and should die, and this thinking is not just about soldiers they want death for all of us. That child's death is on his parents hands. It would be different if our military was sent there to kill everyone like for example what occurred in Bosnia with ethnic cleansing. Then people would have reason to kill military occupying their country. But there was never any direct threat to civilians so they have no right to attack soldiers.<br/><br/>In regards to the film as a movie Clint Eastwood gave us a masterpiece as usual. And Bradley Cooper may have given his best performance yet. Not to much violence where it was just an action movie, and a good depiction of human emotion. It should be noted families with someone in the service have always faced difficulties, and this film does a good job of depicting that."

","I was prompted to see this movie because of it's 6 Oscar nominations, but watching this left me sorely disappointed. This film isn't necessarily ""bad"", but if you've seen Zero Dark Thirty (2012) or The Hurt Locker (2007), then you've already seen this movie; American Sniper is just a lesser version of the two previously mentioned films.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper, but he only gives a fair performance along with the rest of the cast in this movie and while Clint Eastwood has directed some great films, this is far from any of them in terms of quality and entertainment. American Sniper feels like an extended commercial to join the Navy; the movie may not glorify violence, but it certainly glorifies war. The most aggravating thing about this movie is that it's just mediocre through-out. It's painfully predictable; you can almost snap your fingers in sync to the gun shots during the sudden bursts of violence.<br/><br/>If this film had come out 10 years ago, it would've been better, but with the context of recent war movie releases American Sniper is just a poor attempt to copy what Kathryn Bigelow has already accomplished with her war movies. 2014 was a great year for movies, but this is not one of them."

","I heard about this film being released, and then I became more interested when I found out it was directed by Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Changeling), and definitely more so when the award nominations came in, so I was looking forward to it. Basically Chris Kyle (Oscar nominated Bradley Cooper) grew up in Texas with his father teaching him to hunt deer and shoot a rifle, and in adulthood becoming a rodeo cowboy, until in 1998 he watched the news about the U.S. embassy bombings, Kyle decides to enlist in the U.S. Navy, he is eventually accepted for SEAL training, and becomes a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper. Kyle meets Taya Renae (Sienna Miller) at a bar, they go out on many dates until they get married, but in 2001 they are shocked by the news coverage of the September 11 attacks, Kyle is sent to Iraq following, his first kills are a woman and boy attacking U.S. Marines with a grenade, he is upset by this experience, but earns the nickname ""Legend"" from his many kills. Kyle is assigned to hunt for al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a house-to-house search in evacuated areas goes ahead, interrogating a family the SEALs are offered the chance to catch second-in-command ""The Butcher"" (Mido Hamada), his favourite torture device is a drill, but the plan to get him goes wrong when the father and his son are captured by The Butcher and killed, while Kyle is pinned down by a sniper using a SVD (Dragunov sniper rifle), meanwhile insurgents put a bounty on Kyle. Kyle finishes his service and returns home to wife Taya, she gives birth to their son, he is distracted by the memories of his war experiences, which creates arguments, Taya is concerned for their future as a couple and wishes Kyle to focus on his home and family. Kyle leaves for his second tour of duty, promoted to Chief Petty Officer, and is soon involved in a shoot out where The Butcher is operating from the ground floor of a restaurant, he returns home again to a newborn daughter, but is still increasingly distant from his family, and on his third tour of duty he is badly injured by the Dragunov sniper and his unit is evacuated. Back at base the unit decide to continue the mission, another SEAL is killed in the gunfire, Kyle becomes racked with guilt and is compelled to serve a fourth tour, Taya does not understand his decision and tells him she needs him, but with his insistence she implies that they need some time apart. On tour four the expert Dragunov sniper is identified Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), Kyle is assigned to take him out, his team are placed inside enemy territory on a rooftop, Mustafa has been sniping U.S. Army combat engineers building a barricade, Kyle spots Mustafa at a risky long distance shot of 2100 yards and is successful in taking him out (the 8th longest sniper kill ever recorded), he exposes them to a large number of armed insurgents, in the midst of the firefight they are low on ammunition, and Kyle calls Taya and tells her he is ready to come home, he is almost left behind when a sandstorm covers his team for a chaotic escape. Kyle returns home, but is on edge and unable to adjust fully to civilian life, he tells a Veterans Affairs psychiatrist he is ""haunted by all the guys he couldn't save"", but he is encouraged to help wounded veterans in the VA hospital, many whom have suffered severe injuries, Kyle bonds with them and coaches them at a woodland shooting range, and he gradually begins to adjust to home life. On February 2nd 2013 fate takes a drastic turn when happy and playful Kyle takes an unstable veteran to a shooting range, the closing words explain that on this day Kyle was killed by the veteran he was trying to help, stock footage shows thousands of people standing in line at his funeral procession, and a Cowboys Stadium carry out a memorial service. Also starring Luke Grimes as Marc Lee, Jake McDorman as Ryan ""Biggles"" Job, Navid Negahban as Sheikh Al-Obodi, Keir O'Donnell as Jeff Kyle, Eric Close as DIA Agent Snead, Sam Jaeger as Navy Seal Lt. Martin, Max Charles as Colton Kyle, Kyle Gallner as Goat-Winston, Cory Hardrict as 'D' / Dandridge, Eric Ladin as 'Squirrel' / Case and Reynaldo Gallegos as Tony. Cooper gives a much more serious actor performance to what I have seen previously, critics were sceptical whether he captured the real man fully, he was a more hard-nosed killer than what he portrays, but he is definitely confident and thoughtful as the lethal sniper, and Miller is also impressive as his long suffering wife. Chris Kyle has been called the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, notching up 160 confirmed kills during his four tours, and the film covers his early years as a child and rodeo rider, rigorous training, his marriage and family life, and of course his challenging time of warfare, the psychological effects are certainly intriguing, and there are plenty of exciting explosive gun fights to enthral the viewer, it is a must see action drama based on a true story. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, Best Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. Very good!"

","I was surprised to see so many people bashing this movie for being ""american propaganda"" ""trying to recruit more people for the US army"" ""anti Muslim""and the like. To be honest I went into the theater expecting just that, just another Hollywood film about yet another renegade soldier fighting for his country and vanquishing all evil.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS MOVIE IS. on the surface it may seem that way, but digging deeper into the the character development we learn that Chris Kyle starts out as an idealistic boy, with 100% faith in his country and someone who would never give up. later in the movie he struggles with horrors he couldn't imagine as a kid. as he becomes more experienced as a sniper he starts changing. He becomes much more serious, gets angry and starts slipping away from his wife and children. <br/><br/>fast forward to his last tour and he is a completely different person. He has witnessed many terrible things, and even watched his own brother get PTSD from combat. that scene is one of the most important scenes in the whole movie, as he finally realizes that its much more than just a fight between black and white, good and evil. <br/><br/>When he finally returns home He is obviously having trouble adjusting back to ""normal"" life. in one scene he almost kills a dog at a birthday party. in another he doesn't tell his wife that he is back and starts crying on the phone.<br/><br/>At the very end he finally finds peace with himself and spiritual redemption by helping other Vets. <br/><br/>so to all the people who say that this is just another ""came here to kick ass, chew bubble gum, and kill terrorists: I have this to say<br/><br/>you should really watch the movie again, because this film also has a VERY strong but also VERY subtle anti war message."

"cordenw","7","12","28","22 January 2015"," actually it's a pretty good war movie
","I wasn't that keen on Bradley Cooper's acting chops (I got turned off in American Hustle) but he redeemed himself in this movie and was very believable in this role. Elise Robertson put in a good effort but it wasn't one of those transcendent performances like we saw from Ahney Her in Gran Torino or Sandra Oh in Sideways... it was okay but a little shallow in my book.<br/><br/>As I said, it was a pretty good war movie and, you know, the good guys won on the battlefield but lost in regular society.The theme of PTSD has been dealt with in a whole bunch of other movies, this one didn't give us any more clues as to how to recognise or deal with it.<br/><br/>The simple truth is that you can't put a man straight back into the normal world without some sort of formal training, just as you can't put him into the world of blood and guts without preparation. Nevertheless they continue to do it at both ends of the seesaw.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch these types of movies I'm always appalled at the stupidity of men (either soldiers or cops) walking into buildings thinking that a gun in their hands can save them from a guy waiting on the other side of the door with a bucking big fazooka. Not only that, but what are they doing in these crap hole cities where there's nothing but crumbling buildings and garbage strewn across every street, why not wait outside the city gates until they've all polished each other off? They don't seem to care who they kill, as long as it's someone. From the aerial shots they give you, the cities are usually in some sandy wasteland with only a couple of roads in and out. Why not just lay siege and wait for them to surrender. Geez if you did that in Vancouver they'd give up in a couple of hours 'cos they couldn't get their Lattes... but I digress. It's good Clint Eastwood stuff and he hasn't failed to entertain me so far. This is on the far edge of entertainment,pushing into unsettlement, therefore a movie that makes you think .....and movies like that are worth watching. cheers Billc"
"Michael Kenmore","8","13","31","8 February 2015"," A tense and straightforward biopic that aims for the apolitical story
","Having bought the ticket for this movie with a recommendation by a military friend in service close to his retirement, I came in with the expectation the movie is supposed to be apolitical that neither preach to the choir nor criticize the war.<br/><br/>Apolitical it is, which is a notable achievement as it's tempting to roll with the rah-rah propaganda, for the right, or self-righteous condemnation with critical approach, for the left. Director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall, adapting the autobiography book, did the stellar effort with deft directing and tenacious focus on the psychological cost of the war in combat that affect the home life.<br/><br/>I am more impressed that despite Clint Eastwood's back and forth political alignment between libertarian and republican party as a voter and in belief as a moderate, not to mention Clint's (in)famous lecture to the empty chair at 2012 Republican National Convention (which, while pointed, was embarrassingly bizarre, with Clint's last-minute request to bring in the empty chair besides the podium), Clint, working with Jason Hall trying to be respectful to the source material and the late Chris Kyle himself, chose to be tenacious with the aim of making an entirely apolitical movie, without overtly questioning or promoting support of the war.<br/><br/>There have been criticism of the movie by the left -- lame one-note actors, jealous-of- success directors and dogmatic online publications like The Huffington Post and, most egregiously, Salon -- that need not to be rebutted or challenged. Let the criticism speak for themselves. Suffice to say the criticism is ridiculous and unfounded, after viewing the movie and finding no fault.<br/><br/>American Sniper is, in the final analysis, not a propaganda movie. It never set out to be this way. <br/><br/>Clint and Jason tried something extraordinary -- to make the movie as apolitical as possible without offending the sensibilities of one type of audience or another. Interestingly, only the left-wing complained like Seth Rogen and Michael Moore, only to backtrack with excuses why they had the first impression that purport to be condemnatory.<br/><br/>Clint knew the propaganda value of film, that led to his denial of accepting the role in thematically anti-Iraq war movie ""In The Valley of Elah"" that was supposedly written with him in mind. Hence his aversion to making the movie with overt political statement that might offend the audience who lean conservative. <br/><br/>Clint knows the majority of the conservative audience is the ""rare breed"" to catch as the moviegoer base that vote with their wallet. Not to exaggerate, but this base is by and large powerful to make the movie succeed or fail, depending on the movie's message that is either politically neutral (or subliminal), or not at all. This is why the recent slate of the liberal-tilted anti-war movies (e.g. Robert Redford's ""Lions for Lambs"" with major stars including Tom Cruise and ""The Green Zone"" with Matt Damon) had tepid returns at the box office. <br/><br/>Politically conservative moviegoers, for the most part -- like me -- seldomly go to the movies, if never in a long time, because of the antagonistic and amoral content in the movies, not to mention self-serving as the conduit for liberal propaganda that condescend, denigrate and offend the moviegoers. Hence the shrinking movie-going public that befuddle Hollywood and the analysts, negating the shift towards movie streaming and other convenient means of watching at home. Hollywood can only count on the demography of 19-45 year old (R rated), teenagers (PG-13) and parents with children (PG and G) to go to the movies for the bottom line of profit. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, working with screenwriter Jason Hall, consciously avoided the minefield of political bias to choose to tell the story as apolitical as possible as the only viable way to contain the movie's themes without offending either side.<br/><br/>This is highly commendable indeed. I could not find anything obviously or subtly biased in the movie. <br/><br/>The sum of the movie's theme is ""war is hell"" requiring sacrifice that include the psychology of self in patriotic service for the country -- right or wrong.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws. (Not the fake baby scene, it went by quickly.) These flaws made me ask the question, why is this odd? was this even true? (You'll know towards the ending.)<br/><br/>Still, a very good movie with tense combat sequences and occasionally poignant moments. Bradley Cooper did a great job, duplicating Chris Kyle in Texan drawl and stoic and tough yet psychologically vulnerable, tender and deity-believing mannerism.<br/><br/>If American Sniper wins Best Picture Oscar, I should expect Clint Eastwood to announce retirement to the standing ovation. Splendid effort despite some flaws, not to mention frequently profane and graphic that shock and perturb some reticent conservative moviegoers who have not gone to the movies in a long time, that, with the timely story and its perfect apolitical approach, translate to the tremendous turnout not seen since The Passion of the Christ (which I also went to in a sold-out screening).<br/><br/>With respect for the core audience for which the story is thematically appealing come the big box office return. This is something Hollywood could learn from if they aren't so colored by their evidently pompous and didactic liberal belief, as conservative-aligned film critics Michael Medved and John Nolte always point out.<br/><br/>By the way, I have never been to the movie screening where the entire audience sat silent, solemn and still when the moving ending credit began for a few minutes, until this movie. Moved all of us to tears and lumps in the throat. Remarkable movie-going experience as a phenomenon. <br/><br/>Thank you Clint, Jason, Bradley & co. for the respectful tribute to the late war hero and patriot Chris Kyle and his compatriots. Even though I never agree, to this day, with President Bush II and the second Iraq war.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of 4"

The movie had everyone in the theater in tears at some points in the movie, made me cry every once and a while and I barely cry at the cinema.

"ant-stewart","2","17","43","30 January 2015"," Cinematically, not a good film. Intellectually, Pap.
","I was very keen to watch a great movie of foreboding power, a good brainless death suspense action movie... <br/><br/>Result: No mystery, no suspense, no realism, no symbolic philosophy, no intrigues of analogy. The scenes are artistically bland, the acting is boring, it's b-movie kind of dialogue. The length of the scenes don't use your attention span so for long enough to absorb one atmosphere or another, or catch your attention, cinematically.<br/><br/>The trailer was awesome. The first 5 minutes were great, and then it kind of dozed off. I prefer to watch an episode of the A-team or mcguyver for storytelling ability or a kind of sense of style. <br/><br/>Chris Kyle was boring, his childhood was uneventful and fantasy-like, unrealistic propaganda to show him of unshakable virtue... a true hero! His gravitas was pretty tame. When he stood up from an 8 hours intense sniper session, he looked like he was getting up from a 5 minutes arcade game... ""oh i got 6 or 8 of them"".<br/><br/>Then comes the subject of the philosophy of the film. It's got some interesting attempts at culture comparison at the start, contrasting rubble and religious fervor, to books and American family life. Then it swoops into an endless twitching drivel - moron mode, starting with some stupid SEAL training scenes with sarge shouting and a black man hosing himself down with mud with a big hose, crawling through a puddle and laughing with some Kevlar on his chest. Some cheap soundbites and empty racial interactions.. then it tries to convince you that the only point of view in this story is that of American Soldiers, and that Iraq is just some kind of random place with brown people who are being naughty and vicious in the face of the valiant Yankee Doodles, who are valiantly invading the place with tanks and lines of men and kicking in doors to make it secure from the bad locals. Obviously, by that time, Cheney had ordered that all the prisons be opened up, all the police and army to be laid off, general blanket bombing, followed by thuggish military discipline, kicking pedestrians around the street... and the film picks up somewhere in that timeline, we don't know where. So i call it Cheney's Sniper, because it doesn't have a clear timeline or sense of chronology or logic, it's fuzzy and void, film, ... And it wasn't exciting!! boo!<br/><br/>if you want to watch rodeo, cowboy hats, a kid and his dad shooting a dear, sarge shouting at his corporals, brown people being shot, jolly American marines being brave and manly, no guts, some tanks, and a clichÃ© love story, go watch it!"
"KineticSeoul","3","16","40","2 February 2015"," Cynical film
","Without coming off ignorant, I could see why this movie would be a hit but that doesn't mean I think the movie is good. Yeah, this is meant to be a black and white movie. That focuses on the a Sniper that is known for a lot of kills in combat. I don't think that makes this movie really patriotic or anything like that. Sure, the thing that stands out about this movie is how it's based on a true story. But in my opinion that also works against it as well. The acting is on target though. But when it comes the direction of it all, it comes off pretty darn cynical. I appreciate the men and women that protect and serve America. But this like I said just comes off very cynical. It's a simple black and white movie, and simple doesn't always make a movie better. The movie just seemed far from it being constructive. The movie seem to only portray all the positive aspects of Chris Kyle while shoving his negative actions under the rug.<br/><br/>3.3/10"
"richardskellern-213-674363","4","22","59","15 January 2015"," Disappointingly jingoistic
","American Sniper disappointingly ramps up the propaganda message right from the start. The simplistic narrative - that America is the 'greatest country on Earth' - borders on the offensively banal. Bradley Cooper's strangely affected performance also reflects poorly on Eastwood's decision-making regarding this project. When taking into consideration the complexity of tone in previous efforts such as Letters From Iwo Jima, it is puzzling that Clint Eastwood directs American Sniper like a TV movie replete with stock supporting roles. At a time when movie-makers should be aware of a responsibility to represent America as more than a divine entity controlled by manifest destiny, it is worrying that one of it's greatest directors should resort to such hollow propaganda."
"valen060","8","9","20","31 January 2015"," Chris Kyle: Gripping and Purposeful
","Witnessing what I had watched in American Sniper, I was left baffled and speechless on seeing how one American soldier sacrificed so much for his family and country by fighting his way through the 2003 Iraq War. Being based on the popular memoir, I had to see what the film adaptation had in store.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) was certainly one accomplished individual. By enlisting for the Navy SEALs, he knew how much his life would change when his training would eventually make him a skilled sniper. Upon finding love in his would-be wife Taya Renae (Sienna Miller), things further complicate Kyle when he goes on to serving 4 tours in Iraq. At the same time trying to maintain his civilian life with his wife and 2 little kids who eagerly await for his return.<br/><br/>Regardless of his elder age, director Clint Eastwood did a splendid job taking the helm by putting Chris Kyle in the spotlight. He captured the inner struggles Kyle and his fellow SEALs went through in the War on Terror and didn't stray completely away from the 'civilian life' scenes as to ease the tension. In particular, I found the scene where Kyle made his first sniper kill on an armed woman and kid to be really significant. It's like you can tell he feels guilt and unnoticeably shaken on what he just did before him. Not to mention that small bible he carries in his pocket added a nice touch of symbolism. How? It seems to represent that no matter what circumstance he faced in childhood to adulthood, not once did he ever lose faith on what truly mattered.<br/><br/>Perhaps in some instances of the movie, the representation of the U.S. Serviceman or Navy SEAL is over-glorified and vain, but I say that Brad Cooper embraced the role proudly and really brought out the angst Chris Kyle and his comrades had to endure in such a harsh, war-driven environment. Comparing this movie to other past war films like Saving Private Ryan, The Great Raid, or Green Zone, you can feel just as much tension when you picture yourself in their shoes. I can literally hear faint weeping and silent conversations among the audience as triumph and tragedy graced the screen.<br/><br/>To conclude, you can tell Brad Cooper underwent rigorous training, but now I see what earned him his Oscar nod. Although several may debate that Chris Kyle doesn't deserve to be called a ""hero,"" nevertheless Cooper channeled him marvelously and Clint Eastwood impressively displayed Kyle's imperfect, yet valiant efforts."

","Well, this was one of the movies that really shook me. I did not see the end coming as I did not know this guy's story and I don't like reading the plot before the movie. So, watching it without knowing, really left me with an open mouth in the end. Apart from that, it seemed kind of going on forever without needing to. I could have done with some less duration and some more emphasis towards the end. Apart from that, this was an amazing movie, as are all movies based on true stories from my part. I really liked the way the soldier was depicted. Eastwood did not hesitate to make him look as the typical American soldier (or any soldier for that matter) that is sent to war believing the lies and propaganda of his country. If he made him any other way it would not have been realistic but still you have to give him the credit that this is not yet another American-biased or nation-biased movie. The guy was one of these people that are good in everything they do, since they are passionate about it. He is the kind of guy that gets obsessed with anything he does and that does extremely well. He excelled in all his life settings and became an example, even without any deep and really sophisticated thinking and character. He just got the job done. And one day he came home, doing what he thought was best for his country to be killed by one of his own. I think that irony is one of the main parts of this film that makes any viewer jump out of his/her seat in the end. Overall, a really really nice movie!"
"drpizzi2501","3","16","41","30 January 2015"," A amazing film, but untruthful
","There cannot be any doubt about the kind of filmmaking master Eastwood is. In the sense of narrative American Sniper achieves perfection. Is both subtle and fierce and as usual with the work of great authors, you don't know exactly what to make of it. I saw a lot of controversy about the political stand of the film and I went to the theater with that in mind. After some time I concluded that the film's deficit is not the figure of Chris kyle, the way he is portrait or even the way the movie doesn't deal with any implications of the invasion to Iraq apart than those in the mind of this particular soldier (which are non existent).<br/><br/>But falls far from the truth of the war in Iraq, the behavior of American troops, the ordeal Iraqis live everyday and the crimes committed by both Iraqi and American troops. Anyone with a bit of curiosity can easily find out how wars are like and how elite troops behave anywhere in the world. In particular Saudi and Nato troops. <br/><br/>In this film I couldn't see not one innocent victim of the war wounded by American troops. Not even by mistake. Not one. Even more, almost all Iraqis were ready to hurt American soldiers. Women, children and men. The quality of the film suffers from it. Because this is a lie."

","This is not a movie. It's a film.

This film portrays not only the reality of combat in Iraq--particularly Fallujah--but how the non-radical Muslim population pays the price along with the American troops that serve to fight on our behalf.<br/><br/>The reviews panning the film based on the reviewers' political opinions are beyond disgusting. Their open contempt for America should be enough to make any fair-minded intelligent person disregard them as a barometer of the film's worthiness. I highly recommend seeing American Sniper. Not for its entertainment value. But because I believe everyone owes it to themselves to see what price American soldiers are willing to pay to keep the sword from our throats. And the price the peaceful indigenous population pays at the hands of Islamic terrorist savages."

","The evil people do is the same everywhere. Occasionally people want to do something about it. To try to stop it, or lessen it at least. Chris Kyle seemed to be one of those people. <br/><br/>He didn't like to kill people. It was a (job) he considered important in order to protect other people. And this isn't a story about the rights and wrongs of war. It's a story about Chris Kyle's role in a war. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was at times unrecognisable, (as was Sienna Miller). And all the better a film for it. Bradley Cooper was Chris Kyle. It was an outstanding performance. <br/><br/>There do seem to be flaws in the film; things in hindsight you might change, but what do I know. I'm only guessing. Some people (who were actually there) might say 'no flaws', 'that's how it was', 'that's how it went down'. To view the horror that unfolds on the silver screen is enough to know, accurate or not, that Chris Kyle was a brave man, and this film seems like a deserving testament to that."

Its unadvised, but if you choose to watch the movie and your IQ is north of 60 you'll see why their statements are so ridiculous. In the real world in war, yes there is awful collateral death. Now about the show - I haven't waited for a movie with as much anticipation as I did for American Sniper in I think forever. A sniper movie! A sniper movie about the best sniper in US military history! Couldn't wait! Every guy thinks the occupation of a SEAL sniper is about as cool as it gets. The film started out very slow with its characterization, but finally we're of to SEAL training and I use ""training"" loosely (not at all how SEAL selection and training works. You don't just walk into a military recruiting office and sign up for SEAL school lmao). I let that go with a pass. Just poor continuity and research. But the SEAL training scenes were horrific. It's when I knew the next hour and a half would undoubtedly be awful. It's probably easier to make it in the NFL as a starting QB then make it to SEAL school. I've seen documentaries on it and it looked horrendous what these men endured. I won't be a spoiler on the specifics of the scenes, but Clint could have made that part of the movie so much better. It could have been awesome rather than silly, unrealistic and boring. It bordered on an insult to the Navy. To wrap the rest of the movie up, it just sucked HARD. You know those movies that don't end the way you want? Like in Heat? That's the way virtually EVERY SINGLE action scene in the movie ends. I also roughly counted only about 4 sniper scenes. The rest of the movie was poorly choreographed action scenes (just a few) or him fighting with his wife (explaining time and again to her basically the same thing just in a different 11 paragraphs (in bad southern accent) ""I'm doing it for my country""). If you're not looking for your traditional war movie e.g., Saving Private Ryan or Platoon, but are instead interested to watch a poorly scripted drama/romance chick flick mixed with the depression of a ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" type movie, but also want the sound of very occasional gun fire, then run to see American Sniper. Or..you could achieve the same dopamine reaction by playing $5 worth of Buck Hunter at your local bar, go start an unreasonable fight with your girl (just walk right up to her and tell her she needs to lose 40 lbs), staple your genitals with a staple gun used to put up Christmas lights, then go to a dog shelter and walk up and down the cages for 2 hours."

Refuse to defend themselves? Refuse to protect each other? In reply to user Qrobur, It's pretty obvious that when Kyle refers to the enemy as 'Savages', he's referring to the insurgents, not Iraqi civilians. In my book, if you kill people by sawing their heads off, setting them on fire, chop the hands off of thieves, plant IED in areas where their Iraqi countrymen can and do accidentally trigger them, stone women to death, trick little kids and mentally disabled into strapping on a suicide vest, use your countrymen and/or children as human shields you ARE A SAVAGE! To everyone bashing Kyle and the movie: Why did you watch it? You had to know what it was about before you watched it! With approx .01% of the US signing up to defend it, those who do are all heroes! I am grateful that they have the guts to. Having to patrol and constantly have on their mind that the next step they take could blow off their legs, or get them shot in the face (as has happened to their friends) is a level of stress that most people will never have to endure.

It keeps you glued to the chair although the scenes aren't tense.<br/><br/>On another level, this movie explains the story of a nation and why this country is where it is, mostly because of the way people think about their origins.

"rjsf96","4","13","32","2 February 2015"," A Bland by the Numbers Biopic
","2014. It appears to be the year where dozens of films based on true events have been released. For 'American Sniper' this becomes a fatal head-shot. It draws comparison immediately to more intriguing and better-structured biopics, which it cannot compete with.<br/><br/>It does have some good factors, which are in large part due to the leading actor Bradley Cooper. Cooper oozes swagger and charm when we see him. He is cool, calm and focused. He plays Chris Kyle who becomes increasingly haunted every time he guns down an opposing soldier or citizen. He is enlisted as a Navy SEALS Sniper. Throughout his career he was known as the deadliest American Sniper in history. During which he had 160 kills to his name and was something of a legend to the soldiers working alongside him. The look on his face after his first fatal kill stays with us long after the credits roll. This is extremely frustrating, as the majority of the film does not stick to our ribs in the way that Clint Eastwood intended.<br/><br/>Eastwood takes up directorial duties on this film and it is clear that he is a veteran Director and completely comfortable not just in front of the camera but behind it as well. The film is drained of almost any colour and contrast giving it a gritty bare bones feel. This is ironic as the film almost has a black and white look to it; it mirrors how Eastwood sees the subject matter. For me though the topic is not as clear-cut and Eastwood if he had lent the film an ounce of thought could have worked wonders on Chris Kyle's biopic. Sadly, he does not.<br/><br/>But at least he was thinking during the action scenes because they are terrific and by far the best element in this sub-par film. The tension echoes as if you are taking part in the war and are in Iraq. Kyle experiences extreme, brutal horrors during his time away from his wife played by Sienna Miller, in perhaps one of the most lackluster female roles of late. Miller has little to do and acts little more than the mother to Kyle's children. Without a shred of depth to call her own, we should feel something for her but instead are left out in the cold.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the film progresses the proceedings go from bad to worse. Which is quite atrocious to say the least. All the right talent is called upon, but I feel that the real person to blame is Eastwood. The man just cannot grasp a feel for the film. Should it be awe-inspiring or violent? Challenging or dumb? 'American Sniper' comes across as the product of two different Directors working against each other and cancelling the other one out. Or was this just Eastwood's own ego working against him? It is in fact the latter. What I mean by this comment is that the brutality of war conflicts with the dull relationship drama provided by Kyle's equally boring wife. The scenes regarding Iraq make for gripping, hard to watch viewing, whereas the scenes with Kyle's wife come across as bland and forced.<br/><br/>For anyone who has glanced at a Psychology book prepare to be dumb-founded and amazed during the film's two-hour runtime. Remember how soldiers of war after serving a long term of service returned to their families a complete wreck? How they were terrified and distraught regarding any form of physical violence? Of course you do. This film has not even heard of the term 'psychology' and what it implies. We never get the sense that Chris Kyle has actually changed from the cock-sure guy he once was; unless, you count staring blankly at a television screen to have had a profound effect on him. I for one second do not believe that the real Chris Kyle had no trouble adjusting to normal life after war. Everyone did. The fact that this is swept aside is criminal. Post-traumatic stress disorder should have been at the top of the list for Eastwood but it is ignored in favour of violence, violence and hey guess what? More Violence.<br/><br/>This brings me to the absolute worst, disgusting and vile factors that the film gets wrong; firstly, the fact that it has nothing but contempt and soaring love for Chris Kyle. In biopics I wish to be enlightened about everything a person did in their life. But, we are not told about the bad things that the man did! The crew expects us to think of Kyle as a God, I for one object. This is not how you treat any audience member with interest in a true story.<br/><br/>But lastly, and this element here makes me question whether Clint Eastwood really cared about his film, because they really do glamourize violence. Not in the way that Quentin Tarantino does, as that is stylized and fictional. In 'American Sniper' we are informed early on that you must treat violence with more violence. This disgusts me. How on earth can I root for a man that sees violence as the only way to solve his problems? I cannot and will not. For some this may not be troublesome, but for me it makes me physically sick. Is this the kind of message that America should be promoting? A definite no from me; this is propaganda at its worst. Clint Eastwood should be ashamed of himself. I am left in complete amazement as to how this film ever got made. I wish it hadn't.<br/><br/>In short, 'American Sniper' is a disgusting, biased, propaganda piece on the war of terror on Iraq. Needless to say it has the distinction of being the most disappointing film that I have seen in the cinema in the last five years. American Propaganda would be a more apt title. Clint Eastwood your time as a Director is up, hand in your camera."

Fans of good film, whether or not they're fans of America's recent wars, will love this movie.<br/><br/>Now, as for the dozen or two negative (1-star) reviews I read. Anyone foolish enough to believe that those reviewers actually watched American Sniper deserve the bad advice those reviews offer. The negative reviews are in fact reviews not of the movie, but of American foreign policy; they're also negative reviews of those Americans who don't choose to live on the coasts. The hate and self-righteousness spewed from the reviews suggest authors with severe emotional problems. Is it credible that people who hate our military and people as much as these reviewers do would a) spend money on a ticket for American Sniper and b) sit through the movie? Not in the slightest.<br/><br/>Go see American Sniper if you have an open mind and like good movies.<br/><br/>If you're incurably anti-American, rent one of the many films that show our military in an unfavorable light - Rendition, Hurt Locker, anything by Robert Redford.

","There are a lot of reviews on this film by people politically opposed to the war, who cannot fairly evaluate a film because they find the subject distasteful. They can be discounted. There are those who are war supporters and they likewise can be discounted. Let's dispense with both political sides, and talk as if it is a film. Because as a film, it's one of the year's best. Those like me who have been in the military will say they got the tone completely right. This is not a John Wayne war, this is as it really is, down to the blood and the dirt. When we go on patrol, we feel the anxiety. When a friend is hit, we are shocked. This film does not glorify war, it glorifies humanity. The humanity of a man who is raised to be a sheepdog, to protect the sheep, and who continues that mission to the end. Lighting is mostly natural, with effective use of camera angles and quick cuts in many action sequences. Comparing this with Eastwood's prior work, it's on par with Million Dollar Baby, as a character study. Sound and props are spot on, and the military must have helped considerably with vehicles. Moving as a small story in a large war, and it does help you understand the man who could not completely forget what happened to him there. <br/><br/>I take away points only for the story not being one of full context, as it does not give political speeches, it's only about telling a story. Anyone who gives it less than a 7, with the scoring you see on other titles, either hasn't seen it, or has a political ax to grind. Having seen many titles rated in the 8s, I feel this is between an 8 and a 7.5 in technical ability and story."

There are not many movies about the Iraq war. This movie really depicts on how bad it was to be on the front line. I thought the main actor Bradley Cooper played his role fantastically.

"tye1138","6","24","68","1 January 2015"," Poor film about a serious subject
","American Sniper is suppose to be based on the Autobiography of former Navy Seal Chris Kyle and his life inside/outside the military. However, in reality the story is grossly inflated, making Chris Kyle out to be some amazing hero, where in reality he was just another cog in the wheel. Many key-pivotal aspects of the film were not part of his autobiography AND were based on his wife's memory, not actual facts written by the man himself. The screen writer Jason Hall, who has zero experience writing features, had only ONE phone call with Kyle before he sadly passed away. Many exciting and interesting aspects of Kyle's life weren't included in the screenplay. <br/><br/>Crucially, the audience is incapable of connecting to any of the characters or feeling sympathy for the actions that take place. As a consequence, the emotional component has been left out entirely. Even the combat missions are boring at best, never leaving the audiences in any suspense. Worst part is, the film includes a fictitious and horribly conceived antagonist, as device to keep the audience in the story. Without it, there would be no story, the film would simply be too disjointed, more like a documentary miniseries, rather then a narrative feature film. The fictitious character adds the ""glue"" necessary to keep us watching.<br/><br/>Outside of the poor screenplay, technically the film was a train wreck. Much of the film is suppose to take place in Iraq yet it was shot in Southern California. For wide shot's, they had a second unit in Morocco doing some 2nd unit work, but every single Iraq scene was the same buildings used over and over again. The military vehicles, weapons, clothing and combat actions were all wrong as well, silly mistakes for such a big movie. In the finale, fake vehicles, helicopters and an absolutely atrocious sand storm, destroy whatever realism remained. There were other huge mistakes like using a fake baby in one scene and mannequins for wide shots! Yes you heard me correct, mannequin's were used in the backgrounds of wide shots and YOU COULD TELL thanks to the digital cinematography and projection. <br/><br/>The film was actually boring to watch because it was visually uninspiring and flat. If the audience can't connect in any way to the characters, if the story is downright predictable and there isn't really any driving force, what keeps the audiences attention? Generally, stunning visuals and music can help a poor screenplay, but this film has neither a sore OR anything remotely redeeming about the cinematography. It was a truly ""flat"" film with no dynamics in the audio mix, cinematography, screenplay or acting.<br/><br/>Even though Bradley Cooper is an amazing guy and a great actor, his character wasn't strong enough to overcome the films glaring issues. It's just sad such a great ""American Hero"" had his story butchered by one of the best filmmakers we have."
"Yarrg","4","20","55","23 January 2015"," Proof Of America's Evil
","What can I say other than the summary. This film is really what the majority of the world thinks when they think U.S soldier, a gun toting Texan with a tendency to commit racially motivated murder. Sure, not all Americans are bad, just those who support the U.S military that goes against all rules of war and ignores human rights, even of other Americans. You know? See all of the Americas bar Canada. As someone who served in Iraq as an aid worker, this film does justice to the way U.S military treated the Iraqi civilians with suspicion and disdain in their own country. However, I feel for Chris Kyle as if I put in the same situation would simply buckle down, follow orders and guard my life by any means possible and for this I can not blame the individual alone, simply the politics behind him. Nonetheless, some stony acting from Bradley Cooper, (the kind of stone used as a paperweight) led to an experience which at the time I wished for end sooner rather than later. If any solace can be found, Siena Miller's performance was a surprise as she adds further credit to an impressive 2014 for her."

","Regardless of how closely the movie follows the ""true"" life story of Chris Kyle, it is obvious from the reviews that it is very polarizing. Having read a number of the negative reviews, people that do not agree with the U.S. involvement in the middle eastern conflicts must be very capable of ignoring the atrocities of Muslim upon Muslim to actually believe that some of the atrocities depicted in the movie could not have happened. What do the recent events in Paris along with the continual suicide bombings using any gender and age for bombers tell you? The movie did not depict Kyle as a classic hero but as a killer in a time where no one knows how the next killer will be dressed, where the attack will be carried out, and that there is little hope that any ruling group will ever come to any peace talks. <br/><br/>This is the world we live in now. This movie doesn't deny it or change it, and it doesn't glorify the effects these prolonged conflicts have on the returning veterans, but it also doesn't try to analyze that side of it because that is left to the viewers to sort out. It is sad to see that the negative reviewers seem to want the movie to hand them a definitive argument against any response to the current worldwide conflict between various religious, political and economic factions that are not clearly defined by governments and borders. <br/><br/>The movie allows the viewer to figure it out, if capable.

They have to do what they have to do to keep them and their fellow soldiers alive. Now I agree that America really had no business in Iraq, but all in all, those soldiers were doing a job. As for the film itself, it was great like I said before. The characters played their parts well and it did have its fare share of drama, but there was one thing in the film that bothered me. I don't know if this is a spoiler but just in case it is one I gave a spoiler alert. In one scene where Chris Kyle(Bradley Cooper) and his wife, Taya Kyle(Sienna Miller), got into an argument while they were sharing and holding their baby, the baby looked kind of fake. It actually looked like they were doing their parts with a doll. To me that just blew the entire scene and it was supposed to be an intense and dramatic scene with a close up of Sienna Miller's character going into tears and everything so that's why I took one star from it and gave it 7 stars instead of 8, but overall it was still an amazing film that does deserve an Oscar nomination."
"birthdaysuit11","4","17","46","16 January 2015"," Over-hyped and Poorly Written
","This has to be one of if not Clint Eastwood's worst films to date. It is tawdry and blatantly inauthentic. The movie sensationalized and falsifies certain aspects of Chis Kyle's book so to embellish the emotional aspect of war and a man supposedly fighting for what he thinks is just. <br/><br/>I found this movie subtly jingoistic and it never once depicted Chris Kyle as a man addicted to killing. Hell, he even boasted about his kills, and thought that Iraqi people were savages. He's been quoted saying, ""ill kill anyone who wears a turban.""<br/><br/>In his book he claimed to kill looters during Hurricane Katrina. He lied about quite a few things actually. But...just the fact that he pretended to kill civilians after the hurricane down in New Orleans, doesn't speak highly of this man. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the real Chris Kyle is a sadist who openly says that he enjoys killing. This movie is a whitewash of one of the most brutal chapters in American military history, an attempt to pretend this guy, a symbol of the sick brutality of our occupations of other countries, and pretend that he is some normal guy, struggling against the emotional baggage of being a pro killer when he wasn't.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movies plot was disjointed, the acting excluding Bradley Cooper was sub par, especially from the wife. The photography and frames were inconsistent, and the CGI was absolutely appalling and looked to be a video game at times. <br/><br/>The wartime / back at home flip-flop approach feels sort of modular and clunky and at times confusing. Also, the respites were quite redundant with Chris Kyle's wife and at times inauthentic, especially during a seemingly pivotal scene in the movie where a stage baby is used. This alone shows laziness. <br/><br/>If not for the graphic sensationalized violence one might think this is a sub par network TV movie, the script was that terrible. <br/><br/>Overall, I had high expectations for this movie and it quite literally felt like I was watching a propaganda film. I expected better from Clint."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","11","27","26 January 2015"," The best Oscar nominated movie that I have watched, so far.
","American Sniper is a biopic about Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle(Bradley Cooper). Ever since childhood, Chris Kyle has a special talent for shooting. When he grows up, Kyle decides to enlist for the army in the sniper division. While he undergoes training to become a Navy SEAL sniper, he meets Taya(Sienna Miller). Chris & Taya fall in love & get married. Kyle also becomes a certified Navy SEAL sniper. After getting married, he's immediately called for a tour of duty in Iraq. He saves countless lives in Iraq, due to his excellent sniper skills. When he comes back home, Kyle can't stop thinking about the war. When he goes on more tours of duty he gets more and more obsessed. This affects his relationship with his wife & kids. <br/><br/>American Sniper is a flawless masterpiece. It is better than The Imitation Game(2014) & The Theory of Everything(2014) which are the other Oscar nominees for Best Film that I have watched this year. The reason I love American Sniper is, it has elements of everything that make a darn good movie. Though it's classified as an action drama, it's so much more than that. Yes, it has action & drama but, it is also thrilling, suspenseful, emotional, heartbreaking & at times, even funny! The shootout sequences are tense, brutal & had me on the edge of my seat. The film accurately depicts the situation in Iraq & the struggles of the soldiers & the citizens. Bradley Cooper has given a legendary performance as Chris Kyle. This is the best performance of Cooper's career. The different emotions that Cooper's character goes through & the tough calls that he has to make as a sniper, has been portrayed magnificently by Cooper. Also, Cooper's physical transformation to accurately play Chris Kyle, is commendable. Bradley Cooper truly deserves his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Sienna Miller is brilliant as Taya. Keir O'Donnell is great as Jeff Kyle. Jake McDorman is outstanding as Biggles. Cory Hardrict is good as 'D'/Dandrige. Kyle Gallner is effective as Goat- Winston. Luke Grimes is impressive as Marc Lee. Sammy Sheik is spectacular as Mustafa. The supporting characters are awesome too. American Sniper is a triumph in all aspects. It deserves all the praise & award nominations it has received. A must watch."
"jacqueschouette","10","11","27","25 January 2015"," Great movie
","I was originally planning to see this movie later on an airplane flight but after reading about how Hollywood liberals like Michael Moore were having kittens over this movie, I decided to pay the money and go see the movie, if only to make the anti-war Left mad. I was very impressed by the movie, especially the dialog. I served in the US Marine Corps and currently work with the military and I found dialog to be exactly what you would expect from grunts. I felt as if I was back in Marine Corps from all the casual F-bombs being dropped right and left. Some might think the dialog was contrived, but I can assure you, that is exactly how the military speaks.<br/><br/>Although other reviewers have given the movie 1 star, all I have to say is that ""haters gonna hate"". The anti-war Left can hyperventilate all they want about whatever the controversy of the day is, but at the end of the day, this film will make more money than any anti-war film that Michael Moore will ever make."
"thale05","10","11","27","25 January 2015"," Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper Masterfully Take Sight on Iraq
","Not only do we get to know Chris Kyle, his life, and service but we also get to see the most grounded and mature movie made about the Iraq War even better than ""The Hurt Locker"". Like Vietnam in ""Full Metal Jacket"", there are no winners or losers in Iraq, only the reality of a war that changed us all forever. This is what makes some of the best war movies the best and this is why ""American Sniper"" will stand as one of the best movies about the Iraq War for a long time to come.<br/><br/>You probably would like to know how accurate this movie was of the real Chris Kyle, right? Yes, Hollywood has a tendency to make up and exaggerate the lives of people in the real world but I have done some research and can say nothing has been exploited in this picture. I believe this is a respectful portrayal of its subject with some material dramatized with good intention. I found 85% of what was depicted in ""American Sniper"" to be factually true; then again I am not a professional investigator so you decide.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) was, indeed, a Texan cowboy who believed in God, country, and guns but most importantly, he saw himself as a guardian of the weak and defenseless, a virtue he held onto since childhood. He joins the Navy pre-9/11 and trains as a SEAL sniper before being deployed to Iraq. There he served four tours of duty returning to his family in between but only to grow more passive and distant every time. And every time his friends are killed or injured, he feels obligated to take up his rifle and hunt his enemy even if there is a bounty placed on him.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been praising and slamming this movie as pro-war, neoconservative propaganda; I think those people are misguided. First of all, war is terrible whether you believe in some cause or not so calling something ""pro-war"" is pretty careless on your part. And secondly, the director Clint Eastwood is as anti-war as they come; don't let his support of Republicans fool you, he opposes the idea of America serving as the world police. Being anti-war does not mean you are not supporting the soldiers who serve our military, in fact, you can argue you're anti- war because you care about our troops and others. Alright, enough with my rant to all the Bill Mahers of the world and that goes to those who praise this movie as well for the same reason.<br/><br/>With all being said, Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall really get the Iraq War as an ambiguous conflict. Kyle, as a sniper, is put into strenuous positions where he must make decisions to kill or let someone go. Looking through his scope, we are pressured into the same conflict he is in. Our emotions battle with our instinct as ferocious as our hero's and climax as soon as he pulls the trigger or relieves it. That, my friends, is great filmmaking.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" does not justify nor condemns a controversial war, it gives us a picture of what it has done to our veterans and what they had to endure (and still are to this day). Most war movies these days are either so blatantly anti-war or supportive of the war effort (not that it is necessarily wrong to do either) but movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""American Sniper"" are smarter in how they portray sacrifice and consequence. But most importantly, they focus on the people who are in the war and what it does to them: the soldiers, their enemies, and the innocent civilians in between.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper put 120% effort into his role as Chris Kyle and it will go down as the performance of a lifetime. Beefed up in muscle and touting a Texan accent, Cooper achieves a heroic image with a stoic grace only he and Eastwood could have accomplished. But beneath the faÃ§ade of quiet strength is a battle from which Kyle risks compromising his family for his duty. And let us not forget about the lady of the family Taya Kyle (played by Sienna Miller). I cannot remember the last war movie in which the spouse of a veteran is given a significant amount of focus. Through Sienna's chemistry with her costar and through her pain over her husband's safety and sanity, I could feel how much Taya loved and supported her man. It takes a special kind of sacrifice for a woman to bear the burden of a SEAL sniper. Both actors deserve award recognition for their roles.<br/><br/>Of all the subjects touched in ""American Sniper"", I believe the most important is our veterans. They are still coping with life in the home and often do not show they need our help. Chris Kyle spends the remainder of the film dedicating his time and energy to give strength and hope to his fellow veterans. After watching this movie, I hope you feel the same way.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"
"noirsenzacielo","7","11","27","22 January 2015"," Not only a patriotic story
","I had very confused expectations about this movie: I adore Clint Eastwood but his late films (Hereafter and J. Edgar) didn't make me fully satisfied. I adore Bradley Cooper too, because I think that he was a surprise in this last years. Despite this the war is not my favorite theme for a movie. Technically ""American sniper"" is a beautiful movie: I appreciated the shoots, the close-up on the wonderful, expressive eyes of Cooper, the sound effects, the scene in the middle of the sandstorm. Knowing the political thinking of the director, my fear was to see an ode to the war. It isn't. It is a truthful portrait of a man with questionable values. Not a mere story of patriotic ideals."
"fourstringwizard","8","9","21","14 February 2015"," A powerful film, but must be seen with an open mind
","Let me start by saying I read Chis Kyle's autobiography before seeing the movie, and I'm really glad I did. It's a great read, and there's so much more to his story than even the movie can tell. While I don't write a ton of reviews on this site, I've felt the need to defend this movie from the hoards of people who feel compelled to bash both it and Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>First off, to the people who may be worried this film is mere propaganda, I can't stress enough that it is NOT. Unfortunately, some people will automatically dismiss something that's even slightly pro-American as propaganda (I guess it's no longer politically correct to show America in a positive light). But don't be fooled, this is not pro-war. It is, however, very pro-veteran. The movie is meant to show one thing: that war is hell, and that it takes a toll not just on the soldiers, but their loved ones as well. Yes, it's true that it shows some Iraqis as bad guys, but that's because many of them were. However, the movie also makes it clear that there were many innocent Iraqis who just wanted to live their lives in peace. To play devil's advocate, I can see how some people MIGHT see this as propaganda, but they're forgetting one thing: this film is Chris Kyle's story, and it's told from his perspective, which brings me to my next point. <br/><br/>A LOT of reviewers on this site are condemning Chris Kyle; calling him things like a ""psychopath"", a ""heartless killer"" and even a ""coward"". It's very sad. A psychopath is someone who totally lacks empathy and will go out of their way to harm others. Chris Kyle was none of those. Yes, he killed people, but that was because he had to. He was a soldier. His duty was to protect his comrades, and that was the reason he took those lives. War doesn't give you time to ponder right and wrong. Hesitation might make the difference between life and death. The haters also love to bring up the fact that he shot a woman, as if this makes him an evil person. I guess they would have preferred it if he had let her throw that grenade and kill American soldiers... (I say woMAN by the way, because he only shot one woman during his time in Iraq, as his biography states). Also, while it's true that Chris Kyle shot people from ""afar"", he was also in front-line duty a lot as well. I know this because I read the damn book and saw the movie. I'm convinced many of the people who are leaving 1-star reviews haven't actually seen it, because I see them get facts wrong left and right. <br/><br/>So, to all the people judging Chris Kyle, grow up. You haven't been through what he went through. It doesn't take any guts to bash someone from behind a computer screen, especially one who's dead. This man saved a lot of American lives, and that was all he cared about (not his kill numbers). The only people fit to criticize Kyle's tactics are people who've actually been through war themselves, and the only one fit to judge him is God. Not some random schmo on the internet.<br/><br/>As far as my thoughts on the film itself: as I already said, there's a lot to Chris Kyle's story, and a movie can only fit so much. However, I think Clint Eastwood did a great job of showing the important parts, especially the moments that changed Kyle's life. The main focus of the story is his struggle with serving both his country and his family, and the toll it takes on his mind. The film does a beautiful job of capturing his struggle and the mental scars that follow him long after he returns home. Bradley Cooper does an outstanding job, and the man is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood. One important thing I will say, however: Chris Kyle never engaged ""Mustafa"" in combat. I suppose they included this to add a central ""bad guy"", but honestly, I think it was unnecessary. Kyle's story is interesting enough without Hollywood embellishment, but it didn't ruin the story for me. <br/><br/>In summary, my suggestion is go see this movie if you're on the fence! More so, thank a veteran for what they do. They put themselves through hell to serve their country, for better or worse. If you can't leave your biases at the door, however, then this film is not for you. <br/><br/>Thank you, veterans. R.I.P. Chris Kyle."

","Well most of you are probably right. It is a story about redneck killing brown Iraq dudes. However you should realize that lot of Americans are rednecks and believes what they see on TV news is true and they are determined to join army and punish those ""brown guys"".I don't know if this is a propaganda but this movie don't have to change your world-view guys. Direction is pretty decent. Acting is great. Summarizing, this movie is pretty good and it's kind of a true story... sort of. It's touching and it keeps you in suspense. I love those shooting scenes and the dramaturgy. But I don't think it deserves an Oscars but it might get one. Otherwise Gravity wouldn't get one if you know what I mean. I liked this movie!"
"weston-bouchard","8","9","21","2 February 2015"," good film, with an unpopular outlook on war
","I personally found this film entertaining, and I was drawn in to Chris Kyle's story. The battle scenes are intense and are shot well but the movie is also a personal drama of a man who tries to do what he considers right, while holding back inner conflicts that arise from his tours in Iraq. Bradley Cooper also has an excellent performance.<br/><br/>I wanted the film to have had some Iraqi characters in a positive light. And because this is missing the film does have an implied bias towards America. Yet calling the film propaganda seems exaggerated. <br/><br/>I think the film is overly criticized. It is true that there isn't any questioning of the politics behind the Iraqi war but it's not explaining the war in Iraq is justified. It's not portraying war as being good for soldiers. Maybe the expectation is that every war film has to say something about war being despicable. And I admire films like All Quiet On The Western front, Paths Of Glory, and Platoon for showing how awful war can be. I would also say all 3 of those movies are better than this one. However, I think this film merits respect for going in a different direction even if it is the unpopular direction."

","Directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie tells the gripping and tragic story of Chris Kyle, an American Sniper, responsible for 250 deaths, 160 of which are acknowledged by the American military. Eastwood draws on Kyles tell all autobiography The American Sniper: The Autobiography the Most Lethal Sniper in American Military History.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a young Kyle (Cole Konis), demonstrating a special skill with the rifle, whilst on hunting trips with his father. The movie then moves on several years and finds Kyle working at a rodeo and one day seeing the news coverage of the US Embassy Bombings in 1998. He then decides to join the US Navy, where he's finally accepted and trained as a US Navy SEAL Sniper.<br/><br/>Kyle meets Taya Renae (Sienna Miller), who he falls in love with and marries. He is given his first mission, when he's sent to Iraq in 2001. He finds his first kills, a woman and a young boy, who attempted to attack US Marines with a grenade, upsetting. However, his exploits are soon acknowledged by his colleagues, who give him the nickname The Legend.<br/><br/>Kyle is then given his toughest mission to date, when ordered to hunt down Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. However, he finds this mission far tougher than expected and finds himself on the wrong side of the Butcher and pined down by a Sniper using an high powered rifle.<br/><br/>The movies warts and all feel may well appeal to the fan of the war movie. But some may find that some of the material touched upon a little on the sensitive side. That being said, The American Sniper is solid well made movie, and Bradley Cooper puts in a very believable performance as Chris Kyle. However, as you'd expect, some scenes are quite harrowing."

This is by no means a pro-war movie. I think it is clear the tone is anti-war for all the reasons war is something that should be avoided.<br/><br/>It is nice to see a the box office returns.

","To begin, I want to say that if I had the time to go to the movie theater and watch this again, I would certainly cough up the $10.50 and sit through this wonderful, emotional and action packed movie once more. First, Cooper's acting is spot-on. I was worried about his attempt at a southern accent at first but he proves a worthy champion of the Texas Drawl. Second, Eastwood's directing proves almost infallable once again. He captured the story so eloquently it had the girl I was with in tears (which granted may or may not be an easy feat). My only qualm was with the ending. I understand it was probably insensitive to actually show the man dying, but I still think the ending could have been done better.<br/><br/>I think the movie overall really showed Kyle's personality and gave us such a great insight into the minds of America's Finest. Thanks to all of you who serve.<br/><br/>Now, let us deal with the bitter disappointment that seems to be gripping many of you who thought a story from the point of view of a Navy SEAL was going to show the war in Iraq was a bad move. Look, we all know that the war in Iraq was a questionable excursion into foreign politics by the U.S. and we all know that a lot of people disagree with it. However, this says absolutely NOTHING as to the quality of a movie based on a man who served in the SEALs in Iraq. The movie was shot from the point of view of Kyle so of course it will convey the war in Iraq as a patriotic effort, since he believed in the cause. This is a movie based on a book he wrote. I don't know what you were expecting in terms of showing the questionable legality of the war in Iraq, as the previews and description of the movie did not offer this conclusion. Yeah we get it, you're angry about the war and you've watched a couple of Michael Moore documentaries but please don't insult a very well- made film because of your political ideologies.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think you all can chill the hell out enjoy this movie if war movies are something you may normally enjoy. To those of you who can watch a movie about a Navy SEAL fighting in a war in Iraq without getting offended, you will enjoy this. For those of you who do get offended by this type of thing, go home, rent another Michael Moore movie and continue being miserable."
"phaseplate","3","14","37","10 February 2015"," Is the overall message an accurate depiction of war?
","The acting was fine, and at times, impressive. However, I was concerned with the sort of influence that this film may impose on the public. This being, that there is a national sense of necessity to destroy those that are perceived as ""evil"" by those that are perceived as ""good"". After watching the film, the attribution of these ""good"" and ""evil"" qualities become obviously apparent: America is the ""good"", and those deemed responsible for 9/11 are the ""bad"". This is not necessarily a fact, and this notion deserves to be further investigated. During the film, there was a soldier who, at one point, questions whether or not the actions of America should honestly be considered as ""good"". This idea was quickly denounced by Chris Kyle, without giving the idea much thought, and asserted that what America is doing is in fact ""good"". An entire film could be spent in this ideological conflict, but this was simply dismissed in a matter of seconds by Chris Kyle. The asserted idea of loyalty to one's country was another prominent theme that remains questionable, for without knowing the true reasons for a country's war-like actions, how is one to know what they are truly sacrificing their lives for, or being loyal to? What is ""good"" and what is ""bad"" is subjects to one's own interpretation. The film attempts to accredit America as being the ""good"" and those deemed responsible for 9/11 as being the ""bad"", and provides graphic depictions of comrades dying and other forms of violence to justify this claim. However, this is not evidence, for the violence goes both ways. I also feel that the wolf, sheep, and sheep dog metaphor was entirely inaccurate. The sheep were considered to be the innocent citizens, the sheep dog's were considered to be the soldiers protecting them, and the wolf was considered to be those responsible for 9/11 or those who enact violence. This metaphor could be reconfigured in another way, a way that is perhaps more accurate to reality. Sheep are more or less oblivious to what is going on around them, and do not question what they are doing, but only take orders and do what they are told. The sheep dog's are those who are brave enough to ask questions in order to discover truth, in defense of those who do not have the means to do so. The wolf is the one who gives orders, and hides the true intentions behind the orders that are given. All in all, I feel that the film was meant to heard the sheep."
"Robert_duder","10","17","47","19 January 2015"," Controversy aside, everyone must see this movie period!
","I'm going to begin to look forward every year to January. For the past two years at least, the best films I ever see are always in late December and early January. Its not necessarily due to the Oscars or Golden Globes...I don't always agree with their picks but it seems like some of the best work is done in the latter part of the year. I suppose it shows a maturity on my part that the summer Blockbusters aren't always what win me over anymore. I was disappointed that once again I made it through 2014 without handing out a single 10 and now in one weekend in January I am handing out TWO solid 10/10's on two 2014 films. I hesitated on both of them because its a rare thing for me to hand out tens but I have to go with my gut. American Sniper was mind blowing. It is emotional and beautifully shot, it is heart wrenching, nail biting and it is the perfect blend of mainstream action with based on a true story military biopic (similar to what Lone Survivor did.) The cast is fantastic (led by an absolutely awe inspiring performance by Cooper) and Clint Eastwood (who I once idolized and has slipped from my graces lately) proves he still has an eye for making films.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has been Hollywood elite for some time now. He has really climbed the ranks and he is proving himself to be versatile and charismatic. Cooper as Chris Kyle though is just incredible. He is driven and heroic and compassionate and determined and patriotic and just commands presence on screen, never mind his physical transformation as he looks massive bulked up. Even in pictures of Chris Kyle you can see Cooper worked at capturing who he was and he deserves his Oscar nomination. Sienna Miller is also very good as his devoted wife who shows a lot of incredible emotion and you really feel for her in her situation. Their chemistry together is fantastic and she deserves a lot of recognition as well. Despite two amazing lead performances don't count out the supporting cast because these guys were equally as amazing and had some incredibly emotional scenes. Jake McDorman, Kevin Lacz, Cory Hardrict, and Eric Ladin were amazing as Kyle's fellow Seals. Unlike many other bio-pics (and the reason I think for the film's record-breaking financial success) is the fact that the film blends together bio-pic with mainstream action. There are some genuinely terrifying villains in this film played by Mido Hamada, Sammy Sheik and Navid Negahban. These three guys at various points in the film are terrifying and the idea that they are even loosely based on reality is sickening. The rivalry between Cooper and Sheik as enemy snipers is enough for an entire film on its own.<br/><br/>I get the controversy behind this film. I even understand it. I just don't care. I'm not getting involved in it and I'm not letting it effect my opinion of this movie. I am not here to discuss whether Chris Kyle was the hero some say he was. I went to see a film and it was moving and entertaining and incredibly well made and I judge it on those basis. For those of you who insist this is sort of right wing propaganda...I didn't see it. I am a Democrat and I have some issues politically with Clint Eastwood but this film wasn't pro-war...in fact I think it showed a very balance opinion of the pros and cons and how it truly effects a human being. The opening scene of this film when Kyle is forced to make a decision between killing a young boy to save his fellow soldiers is gut wrenching. I don't think the film is entirely realistic and it even feels very mainstream but that also doesn't take anything away from how great this film is. This movie will be a classic and you absolutely must see it now!! 10/10"

","There is only two words that can describe this awful move: war propaganda! This is all it is, showing how uneducated Americans got brainwashed by false flag attacks on their own country and then riding of to war to vent their misdirected rage. What's even worse is justification for killing kids. I remember that during World War 2, many of my countryman, young kids that had nowhere to go, joined the war and fought against Nazis, because otherwise they would be either killed or taken to concentration camps. Those Iraqi kids are the same - fighting against foreign invaders that came to exploit their country.<br/><br/>Only reason to watch this movie is to see how sick and brainwashed American society really is."
"rogerdarlington","Null","12","31","17 January 2015"," Something special
","A two-word title with the first word being 'American' is a common appellation for a Hollywood movie - think ""American Graffiti"", ""American Beauty"", ""American Gangster"" and most recently ""American Hustle"". In this case, the real-life eponymous military hero is one of epic achievement and reputation. Chris Kyle was a Texan cowboy who became a Navy SEAL and served no less than four tours in Iraq as a sniper credited with 160 confirmed kills out of 255 probable kills. As a result, he has been proclaimed the most lethal sniper in US military history and awarded five Bronze Stars and two Silver Stars.<br/><br/>Kyle's story - based on his autobiography - is in safe hands with 84 year old Clint Eastwood. This is a director who knows how to portray war, having even made two films about the Second World War battle for Iwo Jima, and as cinema this is a stunning work. From a tense opening which involves a split-second life-or-death decision, the movie never lets you go. The repeated tours, with frightening stake-outs and terrifying shoot- outs, represent a visceral experience for the viewer. I saw ""American Sniper"" on an IMAX screen and the huge images and brilliant sound made me feel as if I was there.<br/><br/>As Chris Kyle, Bradley Cooper, who has beefed up big time and keeps his emotions tight, looks and sounds a world away from his normal-bodied, emotionally-expressive roles such as in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" or the previously-mentioned ""American Hustle"". This is truly a powerful performance. As his wife Taya, British actress Sienna Miller, normally seen as a blonde, also looks and sounds very different from the days of ""Layer Cake"". Other support roles are well-cast, although the naturalistic dialogue is not always intelligible.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is ""The Hurt Locker"" meets ""Black Hawk Down"" with narrative elements (a conflict between snipers) from ""Enemy At The Gates"". If it is magnificent as an action movie, it lacks psychological and political subtlety. Director Clint Eastwood and writer Jason Hall present Kyle (known to the marines as ""The Legend"") in uncritical, almost mythic, terms and there is virtually no context to the war. But, when the credits roll up silently, you will feel that you have seen something special."
"mike3386","8","12","31","15 January 2015"," Strong Performance by Bradley Cooper
","Many of us met Bradley Cooper on screen as a heavy drinking goof ball in the first of the ""Hangover"" movies. Sure we liked him even then, the flashy grin, the penetrating eyes, but the role was fluff stuff. Not this time. In about five years he now turns in a riveting performance, much in the pattern of what DiCaprio did in ""Blood Diamond"", actors coming of age in American cinema.<br/><br/>Of course Eastwood can direct, did anyone seriously doubt it? Gun play of any kind? Heck he virtually cut his teeth on guns. This time the war setting is all too real and the suspense seemed to fill a nearly sold out theater at the 7:00 p.m. Thursday showing.<br/><br/>What's not to like? A few of the scenes here in the States, did anyone edit this stuff? As other reviewers have mentioned, a fake baby? Silly. Couldn't anyone find a real baby? Some of the goofs are distracting, e.g., in one scene Cooper has a goatee, in the next scene no later than a day or two, he has a full beard.<br/><br/>In the final analysis a gut wrenching true story about a brave American who laid it all on the line over and over again so that the rest of us can sleep at night. As Chris says in one scene, ""Do we want to stop them here, in San Diego, in New York?"" And in some poignant acting, we get a glimpse of the mental anguish his wife lived through in the process."

","Is this Clint Eastwood's last masterpiece? IMDb does not list any films coming up after American Sniper. He is 85 so it is possible he is considering retiring. If so he leaves an impressive body of work. American Sniper is a war movie & very difficult to watch. There is no sugar coating. Bradley Cooper & Sienna Miller do a great job of playing the Kyles an American couple caught up in the Iraq War which is still going on today. There are really no other substantial roles in the movie. Kyle's fellow soldiers are all in the background & only occasionally come into focus as real people.

"RossRivero99","10","5","10","16 June 2015"," The best movie of 2014
","Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is arguably Eastwood's best film I have seen since Million Dollar Baby (2004) as well as his most heartbreaking movie since then that I have seen. Not only is it a heartbreaking story it is also more of an inspirational story about an American hero named Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper in an Oscar nominated performance) an All-American man who lived an unfinished life who was dedicated to the protection of his country and his family and served four tours of duty in Iraq. I have heard a few criticisms of this movie of which I will only talk about one of them which he happens to be a movie critic that I highly respect whose name is Chris Stuckmann and he criticized that movie for not telling enough about Kyle's tours of duty, and for me that is a criticism that I highly disagree with because to me the scenes in the movie in which Kyle goes through his tours of duty is pretty self-explanatory. This is Clint Eastwood's 34th film as a director and one of his awe-inspired best. Even though I didn't finish Kyle's best-selling book of the same name watching this movie made me feel like I did which is one of the reasons why this movie is so good. Also Sienna Miller gave a strong performance in the movie as Chris Kyle's wife Taya, this film should have definitely won a lot more Oscars that it ended up receiving in other words it only won one Oscar which was for best sound editing and for me it also should have won best adapted screenplay, best actor for Bradley Cooper and best picture. Because this movie is a solid reminder that serving your country is always good with bad consequences and as Richard Roeper put it ""This movie is a brutal reminder that saying thank you for your service is not enough"" and that helping wounded veterans is a great thing to do to bring up a person's spirit of patriotism and a sense of humility."

"cultfilmfan","10","10","25","29 January 2015"," American Sniper
","It's hard to review the new film, American Sniper, without mentioning, or at least briefly discussing the various controversies and differences of opinions concerning one's morals and values and the film itself. For that reason alone, I find it essential to mention these things in this review and also to explain my own thoughts on the matter as well. American Sniper, is based on the true story of Chris Kyle, who went on to serve four tours of duty in Iraq, during the war in the early 2000's and became known as one of the best and most lethal snipers of all time. The film details his accounts while on duty in Iraq, as well as his relationship and marriage to his wife, Taya, and the different effects, Kyle dealt with after his enlistment. One could say that the film is bigoted and promotes hate towards Arabs, and those during the war at that time. It is a fair criticism as the film shows scenes of intensity and violence with little, or no empathy for those being killed and almost glorifying and condoning what the Americans are doing. I am not here to say that the war following the 9/11 attacks was a good thing, or a bad thing, but I think certain sensitivities should still be kept in balance when making a film like this, even if the other side is labelled as the enemies and that is where the war itself is taking place. Another criticism was the film's pro and glorified use of weapons and war itself. The film certainly does seem to be pro war and pro American troops and from the first few minutes of the film to the end credits, it does not hide this fact. Some have said that Kyle himself and his portrayal by Bradley Cooper, makes him look like a psychopath with no empathy, or feelings towards those he is killing, or the type of job he is doing and having no remorse for it. On that part, I would have to disagree. I know little to nothing about the real Chris Kyle, other than what I just observed in this film and going by the film, I would have to say that in Cooper's performance you do see that he is bound and determined to protect the troops with him, himself and the people back home in the country he loves, but I could see glimpses of hesitation and sometimes guilt with what he was doing when the killings took on a more personal meaning and role for him, especially after he has a wife and family of his own. You see that later he hesitates and sometimes does not want to do, what he is forced to do and later these such events and the brutality and violence and deaths that he witnessed will later come back to haunt him. He is still patriotic and will not turn down his duty, but at the same time, I can not say that he always, or even ever enjoyed it, or found it to be particularly easy. Some have said that the film makes Kyle a hero and one to almost be praised, or worshipped. I can see the evidence of such remarks, but I think the main task of the filmmakers here is to show an unbiased account of Kyle and everything he went through both during and after his tour of duty. He was certainly patriotic and killed a lot of people in the line of duty, but as I mentioned above, I do not always think it was the most easiest thing for him to do and you can see where he has hesitations, doubt and even sometimes questions what he is doing after having a family and loved ones of his own makes him question life and what he is doing more. Also later when Kyle is suffering from PTSD we can certainly see that all of this has taken it's toll on him and he certainly didn't escape unaffected, or unscathed from his experiences. Simply put, if you do not agree with war and look down on it and the American troops and any glorification of war, or violence, whether you agree with my points, or not, then this film is certainly not for you and I would not go to spend money to see it at the theatre. With my own political views and ideologies, I have to admit that they do flip flop from time to time and I do not support one political party more than the other at the present moment. Sometimes, I will like what one party is doing and then totally be against the other and vice versa. Ultimately, I would say I have become cynical of politics and politicians and do not always know what to believe, or support when it comes to issues such as this. As a film, American Sniper is tightly directed with excellent writing, editing and performances. Bradley Cooper, gives a subtle performance where he doesn't show a lot of emotion on the outside, but inwardly you can often tell what is character is feeling and the struggles he is going through. Sienna Miller, is equally as good as his wife. The film is powerful and extremely well done and is certainly a film that will make you think and gives a lot of food for thought and things to debate. For that reason alone it is an excellent film and worth seeing."
"issierulez","1","9","22","3 September 2015"," Inglorious Bastards
","For those of you who have seen the Quentin Tarantino film 'Inglorious Bastards', you will be familiar with the Nazi film in the end part of the film where Daniel Brühl's character becomes a war hero after he killed at least 250 enemies in three days. Because of his exploits, Joseph Goebbels decided to turn his exploits into a propaganda film, called Nation's Pride, in which Zoller stars as himself. He was nicknamed by his comrades ""German Sergeant York"". Now back to American Sniper, which is an American film, which follows the life of Kyle, who became the deadliest marksman in U.S. military history with 255 kills from four tours in the Iraq War, 160 of which were officially confirmed by the Department of Defence. Now, does anyone see the similarity between the two? Essentially my point is that, the film American Sniper, is no better than a fictional Nazi proper gander film, both films are based on one man killing hundreds of people and being praised by their country for doing so. I do not understand why any country would want to celebrate the life of man man and commemorate him with a movie about his killings, it seems utterly barbaric. The people he killed, whether they were 'enemies' or not, are all still people, with family who love and care for them. This film just totally dehumanises the Iranians who were killed by this man, just as the fictional Nazi celebrates the killings of the 'enemies'. I think it is rather in bad taste to make a movie condoning and celebrating the death of hundred of men, women and children."

The countless American and Iraqi lives that CPO Chris Kyle saved by his heroism and his struggles between the military and home life is gripping. One of the best movies that I have seen in years.

I never really got engaged in the movie at all.<br/><br/>The movie is well directed and acted, but the plot is its weakest point. It really doesn't tells you much about Kyle as you'd expect it to. It doesn't really show what war is really like, except for killing civilians and jokes between soldiers. They never show deep conversations between the squad or between Kyle and his wife. Was he really that into himself? was really the story that shallow?<br/><br/>On a technical aspect I hated the CGI blood. That was fake as hell, not even close to convincing. Also the ""bad sniper vs. good sniper"" was really badly developed. They never hinted that Mustafa was also human and had feelings, as they portrayed Kyle to be."
"lucasversantvoort","7","6","13","5 May 2015"," Good character drama, controversial war film
","Every once in a while, there comes a film that sparks so much controversy that it becomes impossible to simply watch it as a 'film.' American Sniper is one of those films, having been accused of glorifying America's deadliest military sniper, its racist portrayal of the Iraqi people, etc. So when I stepped into the theater and sat down in my little seat, I realized I couldn't simply review American Sniper and blandly point out its strengths and flaws; it'd be a question of whether or not all the controversy is justified or not. <br/><br/>But first the story. We see Chris Kyle with a fellow soldier on a rooftop, overlooking a convoy. He spots an Iraqi boy running toward the convoy with a grenade. Kyle's faced with a dilemma and at the moment suprême, the film cuts to the moment he shot a deer under the watchful eyes of his proud father. After Chris saves his little brother from being bullied, his father tells them there are three kinds of people: sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. Symbolically, the father lays the groundwork for Chris's compulsion to protect others/sheep. So when 9/11 takes place, he instinctively feels the need to jump to the rescue. Just like his father gave him permission to beat the kid who bullied his kid brother, he now gives himself permission to attack those who attacked America.<br/><br/>The film's mainly interested in the ways Chris's time in Iraq profoundly influences his family life back home. On the one hand, he feels compelled to 'do his duty' in Iraq, but on the other hand this also undermines his bond with his loved ones, because even when he's home, he's 'away.' To the film's credit, it does succeed in making you understand his desire to go back to Iraq, especially after one of his tours ends bloody. You understand why simply going home and letting others take over doesn't feel right in his eyes. He can only truly return to his family life if he achieves some sort of closure. (Whether or not that's truly possible for traumatized war veterans is another story.) This is nicely emphasized through the sound design as a sound at one scene's end pours over into the next: in other words, what happens in one scene isn't a singular problem, but something that continues to haunt those involved.<br/><br/>And so we arrive at the million dollar question: is the film too 'American,' racist and so on? Basically yeah. Figuring out why this film was received the way it was isn't exactly rocket science. I mean, even the poster's got an American flag gently flapping in the breeze. There's also the fact that Chris justifies his actions as being right. There are also little to no nice Iraqi citizens with most of them being made up of Stormtroopers, aka cannon fodder for the Americans. The biggest mishit is by far Mustafa, an extremely talented Iraqi sniper whose sole function is to be the final boss for Chris. He's a typical bad guy straight out of a nineties action flick who's presence on screen is punctuated by brooding, evil synthesizer tones. That's also what bugged me about the music in general. Even when Chris ponders whether or not to shoot, the music feels compelled to emphasize the moral dilemma with an oh-so subtle DUN-DUUUUNNN. If this were a random action flick it would've been fine, but a war film that aims to be 'realistic' <br/><br/>So yeah, the film's highly problematic, but I feel all this controversy stems from the notion that to show something is to immediately glorify it. But this doesn't have to be the case. Take Full Metal Jacket. Very few Vietnamese ever appear on screen. One scene shows them as shadowy figures in the distance as they're being taken prisoner. Do we immediately accuse Kubrick of racism? No, of course not. Kubrick realized he was showing the Vietnam War from an American point of view. Because the American troops have been trained to kill and have worries of their own, it's extremely difficult for them to truly care for the plight of the Vietnamese people as every one of them might be an enemy. We see the Vietnamese as shadowy figures, because the Americans can't afford to see them as human and that's the real tragedy. You could look at American Sniper in similar fashion. The film's not designed as a political thesis about America and Iraq, but is purely interested in Chris's experiences, how his beliefs are tested and how his traumas affect him. We get the scene with the father, so we understand his eventual desire to go to Iraq, we get a few gruesome scenes so we understand why he feels compelled to go back. So yeah, the film's 'American' to a fault, but I do feel the decision to focus on Chris necessitated an 'American' point of view by default.<br/><br/>Also, there are enough scenes that undermine the whole pro-America point of view. When Chris convinces a doubting soldier that there's evil here (in Iraq), the soldier responds that there's evil everywhere. Chris is occasionally confronted with those whose ideas and morals conflict with his, which in turn compels him to justify and rationalize his actions even more. If he's not convinced he's doing the right thing, how could he look at himself in the mirror after over at least 160 kills? From this perspective, it seems like the film argues that patriotism is nothing but a way to suppress one's guilt.<br/><br/>Anyway, I didn't direct the film. I don't know if what I'm saying here was part of the film's intended message. What I do know is that, regardless of whether or not the film's 'good' or not, you can at least justify some of the film's lesser qualities as being necessitated by the film's American point of view."

","Sometimes when reviewing films it helps if one tries to sum the film up in one word. This is one such film....SHEEPDOG!<br/><br/>From his early childhood Texan Chris Kyle has been reared to obey orders and not question. An early scene in the film sets the tone. Over dinner his father gives Chris the choice of being a wolf, sheep or sheepdog. Holding a belt in his hand (to thrash them with) his father then continues to eliminate wolves and sheep from possible career paths for Kyle and his brother.<br/><br/>Eventually Chris joins the US SEALS as a sniper to nurture his sheepdog skills further. From here stationed the film follows him home and away as he does four tours in Iraq. The film descends into the Jingoistic one dimensional film that you thought Hollywood had stopped making. The bad guys are all on the other side. Its true Chris Kyle killed women and children but it was justified since they were ""Savages"" who did not have the right to protect their soil. The few Iraqis that did co-operate were either duplicitous or greedy for money (by the way the got what they deserved, everybody else did according to Chris Kyle's autobiography on which the film is closely based)<br/><br/>I've been watching Bradley Cooper over 10 years now since his regular appearance in the acclaimed TV series 'Alias'. Every Big screen performance has increased his stature as an actor able to take on a variety of roles. Cooper's Portrayal of Chris Kyle here is no exception. He perfectly plays the character with the required weight (physically and emotionally). He tries to show this racist ""hero"" as a man with pent up frustration and Angst. But the character is too one dimensional. You are left with no sympathy for him. How can you when a man says he had no regrets about killing over 150 people. No all 166 bullets were perfectly justified he was happy to meet his maker when he questioned him (his words not mine).<br/><br/>This sheepdog was just protecting his herd.<br/><br/>At various times the film tried to turn this into a duel with an enemy sniper but this had been done already with great success by the film Enemy at the Gate with Jude Law.<br/><br/>In reality the film was more like the Nazi sniper cinema promo in Tarantino's Inglorious B*stards.That was another film which glorified a sniper, however that was done to show the inhumanity of the audience. A testament to those who rate this film so highly now perhaps?<br/><br/>The directing was flawless and the action sequences were taught and expertly done.<br/><br/>Call me idealistic but when I watch a film I like to see a biopic that inspires or educates me. This simple Good v Evil line should be kept to animation or superhero genre. I like a so called true story to leave me feeling that I was somehow a better member of the human race. I thought we had seen the end of jingoistic and bigoted views of the Iraq conflict albeit glossily done after all it is over 13 years since 9/11 and even the US government admitted it tortured, detained and killed people inhumanely in an unjustified war. In this film only the other side did atrocities like that..so says the sheepdog.<br/><br/>Mr Eastwood you are a veteran cinema actor/director. You can pick and choose any project. I expect better from you. Please use your skills wisely and leave the legacy that justifies the Giant of cinema that you are.<br/><br/>This US Army promo will receive awards and acclaim but hey it just illustrates everything that's wrong with the world!"

"socrates99","8","8","19","30 January 2015"," Best to give cinematic credit when due
","This is a well crafted movie with strong performances by its leads, Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. But after having read some of the comments on it I have to wonder how accurate it is in terms of depicting Navy SEAL Chris Kyle himself. The trouble is if it isn't accurate it starts smelling like propaganda and a pointless whitewash. For example, as in Stalingrad, there is a kind of competition and duel between Kyle and an enemy sniper but supposedly that's not what really happened.<br/><br/>Cooper is so deeply invested in the role you think it must be because he's honoring someone he admires. You never get the feel he was just doing it to get an award. I've heard the sniper was not that troubled about killing women and children who posed a threat to the troops he was watching over so I'm left wondering. I have to admit in the end I find the cold killer version of Chris Kyle more plausible than the driven but understanding guy shown in the movie. But I'll have to read much more than I have to feel certain about it.<br/><br/>Still it's a very well made film. I particularly liked how beautifully put together the battle scenes were. The sound of the rounds hitting all around was just right, I think. I've heard nothing is as chaotic and ugly as real war so it's a gift to have it sorted out for you by an intelligent director with a camera. You do get the feeling a lot of surviving is pure luck.<br/><br/>As between 'Fury' and 'American Sniper' both make you feel the tension of having to perform in a deadly situation though I'd give a small edge to 'Fury' though that's more directly a heroic tale. It's a little telling that director Eastwood found more paydirt in the battle scenes than in the sniper scenes. But being a sniper must not be that satisfying a job, I think, no matter how many lives you might save. And Miller and Cooper do a good job of depicting the strains on their marriage. I'm guessing it was those scenes that kept my wife happy as she usually hates war movies."
"samjohnstone99-223-249723","8","8","19","26 January 2015"," A superb war film by Eastwood and Cooper
","'American Sniper' is a movie based on the book of the same name written by former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who served four tours of Iraq as a sniper and special forces operative. Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper and a stellar team recreate his war experiences with astounding detail, providing a realistic war experience on screen. Bradley Cooper is definitely the standout in this movie. He reflects Kyle in all that he does the whole movie, from the Texan twang to the beard and bulk. You honestly believe that you are watching Kyle himself, Cooper's performance is so precise. Definitely deserves the Best Actor Oscar. Sienna Miller also played a very believable Taya Kyle. The movie also explores the effects of war, both psychologically and physically and makes the audience question whether Kyle is the bad guy or the good guy. All up, 2014's 'American Sniper' is a war film that provides maybe the best performance of Cooper's life, and is a war movie that will stand the test of time and remain a prominent figure in the war genre."

Story was confusing with soldiers and terrorists all looking the same. <br/><br/>Didn't focus on Kyle being a sniper that much somewhat more on family man but neither themes were fully developed and only touched the surface.<br/><br/>Overall an average effort by Clint Eastwood.

"BobbyDupea","7","3","5","2 June 2015"," Flawed But Riveting And Complex Portrait of A Modern Warrior
","A great many reviews of this movie claim that the movie lacks any ""self-examination"" of Chris Kyle's actions and the actions of the U.S. military in Iraq, or claim that the movie is a fawning, biased look at Kyle's character and record in Iraq and elsewhere. Many other reviews claim that this movie is simply a sharply illustrated depiction of a heroic, patriotic American acting out of purely altruistic motivations to save the lives of his fellow soldiers and guard the nation against terrorism. Neither of these perspectives is accurate.<br/><br/>First, there are many scenes in the film that do not show Kyle's actions, and the actions of the U.S. military, in a flattering light. For example, Kyle more than once refers to the Iraqi people as savages, without clearly differentiating between religious extremists and the population as a whole. Kyle also appears in more than one scene to have a callous attitude toward the effects of the U.S. operations upon the Iraqi towns and the Iraqi people. Second, the house to house searches and interrogations depicted show clearly the terror of the Iraqi civilians. It is clearly shown in the movie that the U.S. fighting men are often terrified while they are on ops, with reason to suspect every civilian of an intention to harm them or inform on their whereabouts to people who intend to harm them. It is equally clear in several scenes that the military operations by the U.S. forces bring great destruction, disruption, and death into the lives of ordinary Iraqis.<br/><br/>However, Kyle is depicted as having a conscience - he is greatly shaken by the circumstances of his first ""kills"" in action, and he is shown hesitating with great internal conflict at the prospect of shooting a child later in the movie. He is clearly relieved when the child's actions eventually make it unnecessary to do so. So, it is not accurate to say that the movie is simply an adulatory, one-sided portrayal of a great hero with no flaws - Kyle is anything but that in this movie.<br/><br/>Witness also the depiction of Kyle's actions toward his family and friends. The movie clearly shows that he put his family through a lot of agony when he signed up for continuing deployments he didn't have to make. The movie is fair in showing that Kyle was influenced in part by his patriotism and sense of duty to his fellow Seals and other U.S. forces in Iraq, but it is also fair in showing that he might have also been influenced in these decisions by more unpleasant aspects of his personality, or by the effects on his personality from his early deployments and indoctrination in the military culture. This is brought home by the letter written by a fellow Seal before he dies in action - the letter is very bitter and reflects disillusionment with the ideology behind the continuing U.S. involvement in the war. Kyle responds to the letter by saying that the letter killed his friend - he doesn't blame the enemy.<br/><br/>I also think that although the final scenes from real video of Kyle's funeral and memorials were a powerful testament to the emotional effect Kyle's life had on the people who knew him and had heard of him, those scenes contributed to an impression that the film focused too much on Kyle's patriotism and good deeds, and not enough on the contradictions and unpleasant aspects of his thoughts and actions in his work and in his personal life.<br/><br/>For example, when his fellow Seal mentions that he has never seen Kyle actually read the little Bible he carries with him everywhere in Iraq, I thought that it would have been interesting for the movie to flesh out one implication of that scene - that Kyle is motivated more by big ideas he has heard from his father, or his Church, than by a wider ranging motivation to seek out his own value system and guiding principles for his life through independent judgment and introspection. The conflicts between his value system and the resulting actions he took, and the world in which he lived and worked, could have been shown more starkly and perhaps provided a more balanced view of his life.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper did an excellent job transforming himself into a man resembling Kyle, and also showing both the good and harmful the effects of combat and his decisions he made in his life. Sienna Miller was also very convincing as Kyle's wife. Unfortunately, the depictions of the fighters opposing the U.S. forces, and the super-sniper Kyle hunted down with great purpose, were not as multi-dimensional. The movie would be more interesting if the lives of these people had been portrayed in a little greater detail.<br/><br/>In all, this was a powerful look at a flawed modern warrior who was the very best at performing a very ugly job that in many cases has to be done. The effects of his chosen profession on himself, on those he loved and cared about most deeply, and on the Iraqi people are shown in stark reality - the good with the bad, in a realistic way.<br/><br/>Viewers who put aside their biases and look at the full spectrum of details provided by Clint Eastwood and the other filmmakers will derive the most rich and thought-provoking experience from this movie and will also come away with a more accurate and detailed view of Chris Kyle as a human being."
"Legrosso","10","12","32","27 January 2015"," Liberals hate it, Americans love it
","After reading so many negative reviews, I had to step up and write a review myself, because this movie deserves so much more than obnoxious, politically crazy reviewers. So know that I, an 18 year-old, female college student, a film major, found this movie to be an amazing experience. <br/><br/>My dad had been talking about it for weeks and wanting to see it, but I have always shied away from war movies because I find them too disturbing. However, while watching the Imitation Game, I saw an extended preview for American Sniper, and I came home telling my dad I would see it with him- we went the next day to the advanced screening in our town. <br/><br/>(May Contain Spoilers Ahead) The movie itself was excellently made. I came out of it saying I had never been so on edge and terrified watching a movie in my life, far more than any horror film I'd seen, because this represents the reality and horror of war. Honestly, I cringed and even shut my eyes at a point, because it was so real. It was intense. And if you come out of a movie, uneasy about what you just saw, you know that film has power. And this movie is nothing short of powerful. Watching Chris's life unfold before your eyes, through his training, to his family, to actually being in war, you begin to see how much of a toll war takes on people. That these soldiers give up so much more than we can imagine to go and protect and defend during and after their time in battle. <br/><br/>The main reason I am writing this review is to encourage people to disregard what people like Michael Moore say about this movie. Chris Kyle was no coward, and he was the furthest thing from a terrible man. Yes, he was the most lethal sniper in history, but with his kills, he saved so many irreplaceable lives. He wasn't killing for fun, he killed to protect. <br/><br/>And to whomever believes that Kyle or Eastwood ever referred to Iraqis as savages, that is to be disregarded as well. It sickens me that this movie gets a bad rep for something it didn't even do. Terrorists are referred to as savages, because what they did was pure evil. You get a glimpse of this evil within the movie, and it doesn't sugar coat, it shows how horrible those terrorists really were (and are). <br/><br/>So I may sound like I am ranting, but I love this movie and it deserves better. Bradley Cooper is one of my favorite actors, and this is his all time best performance. It will move you, and for some (such as myself), to tears. I recommend this movie to all who appreciate a well made film, and those who have respect and pride for their country and for those who put their lives on the line to defend it."

","19 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - American Sniper. Moving, nerve wracking, sadness.........just some of the many emotions I felt whilst watching this film. Hollywood and the film industry highlight our social, economic and warfare history throughout the ages, if this film was made 20 or 30 years ago it would be the West against the Russians or the Eastern Europeans, but it's not and the enemy is in Iraq. This is the true story brought to the big screen, of Chris Kyle the man reputed to be the most lethal sniper in America's history, causing controversy over whether he was a true patriot or not. What I personally gained from this film (and I don't know whether it is correct or not) was that this was a man who wanted to defend his country regardless of who the foe was and that he would do what it took to keep those he loved safe. It was a very thought provoking look at one military figure and how he and his family dealt with the issues involved with killing people for a living. It also highlights the second family that the serving and ex military have and how hard they fight for each other. Whichever side you are on, the ones left at home have to deal with just the same issues of isolation, abandonment, and fear in equal measure with love, security and family values. Clint Eastwood has brought this story to our screens with an even mix of adrenaline and compassion, controversy aside I think this is a very good example of the modern war film. Not for everyone I'm sure, and this was one of the few evenings that everyone left the theatre in silence."

","Before I saw this movie I read up on some reviews and was shocked at all the 1/10 scores this movie got and thought ""wow must be a weak movie"".

Curiosity got the better of me and after a quick IP trace of a few users (too lazy to confirm with all) showed the same IP address. Basically the same person or group wrote all those negative reviews and is spamming this movie...<br/><br/>That concern figured out, I decided to see the movie; it was psychologically deep and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I also realized why people with political and social agendas hate this movie. It does not admonish war or America. Instead it tells the story of a soldier, the time he spent in a war, and how the war psychologically affected him (PTSD). <br/><br/>One last point, many of the spamming reviews suggest Chris and all soldiers are mindless killing machines. Agenda blinds again because they missed many key character references throughout the movie that show otherwise. For example, in one pivotal scene **spoiler alert** Chris takes down an insurgent holding a Rocket Launcher and a nearby child picks up the weapon and struggles to aim it at American soldiers. Chris gives the child a long 10-15 seconds, all why talking to himself, ""please kid- don't do it"". Thankfully the child throws the weapon down and runs away and Chris breathes a sigh of relief.

","I had heard a lot about this movie, mostly good stuff, but I had no expectations to it whatsoever, except be entertained.<br/><br/>Half way through I felt it became a bit too much America the great etc. But since I don't know how Kyle was, I assume it portray him the way he was. Though he comes off as a guy, with an IQ the size of a walnut. With the flag waving and the whole we are the righteous attitude. That's OK He obviously really believed all the propaganda he'd been fed, and that's okay. When he meets his brother for a brief moment on the tarmac on a airport, you get to see that they have grown apart, and become stranger to each other. He's brother no longer believe in the war, while Kyle still think it's right. <br/><br/>The movie as whole doesn't choose side, it just show you the brutal things they see and experience. But at the same time it also shows you why many of these people hate America so much<br/><br/>The movie as a whole Is not a bad movie, a bit to long for a movie that's is not 100% action. But still not a bad movie. It shows you the war from Kyle's point of view, which is the purpose of it. And he really believed in the war. That it is a righteous cause. <br/><br/>Every time he's not in the field, he feels guilt, and responsible for the soldiers that die. One thing that really bothered me though: I've heard that the military is really strict on phone calls when you over there. yet he seem to be able to call home from a sat-phone whenever he feel like it, even right in the middle of a fire fight or when he lies on a rooftop scouting, he can just call home. To me that seemed really strange. the movie goes a long way to show how brutal the war can be.<br/><br/>I feel there are important parts that have been left out. Why did Kyle have such a high pulse all the time, when he was calm he has a pulse on 170,but you never get to know why. Was it blood pressure, was it a decease ?<br/><br/>Also he claim he is a SEAL just cause he got through BUDS.<br/><br/>I might be wrong here, but to the best of my knowledge, you not a seal after buds. hats just the first step on a long way of becoming a seal. But I guess they did that to simplify and speed things along . What really annoyed me was that every time the marines were gonna shoot someone, they missed, they couldn't even hit people coming out a doorway right across from them. And every time they were gonna shoot from roof top they silhouetted them self. which is something I thought they learned they're soldiers not to do."
"Nicolerainville","10","9","23","9 February 2015"," This is a tragic story
","I don't see this movie as American propaganda, if anything I see this as a reflection of the absolute devastation of war. Sure, Kyle is portrayed as wanting to go ""kill terrorists"" but honestly, after 9/11, I knew tons of people who felt that way. I'm not from the South either. My uncle was in the Vietnam War and I know for a fact that he had to shoot children, so for people saying why would a mother have her son throw an RPG, why wouldn't she? I think this movie highlights the tragedy of war. It illustrates how the innocent people living in the area are terrified and it shows how much a person can be destroyed by war. Just because Kyle felt it was his obligation to keep going back, and even to seek revenge, doesn't make this movie about how great America is. It shows that some people feel so strongly about defending our country that it consumes them. The US is practically tasked with solving the world's issues. We're the first country everyone looks to for help. Most of the world would be completely different if it weren't for our involvement. I'm personally tired of having to bail out tons of other countries who can't take care of their own issues. Especially when we have plenty of issues on our own soil. This movie illustrates the failings within our own country in taking care of soldiers coming home from war."

He's supposedly there to protect his buddies... and in real life I'm guessing that was very likely true. But they have subtle hints to make you question things. He gets screwed up... becomes kind of like a robot soldier personality and is distanced from his wife and children. His little brother basically says screw the war and looks very mentally screwed up.

"lesleyharris30","8","4","8","15 August 2015"," Perfectly Chronicles and Pays Tribute to a True Hero,
","American Sniper is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a very intense, dramatic film that I think perfectly conveys the fierce struggle for justice and survival that the Navy SEAL soldiers must face on a regular basis, Clint Eastwood has still definitely got it as a director and this movie definitely suited him for the pride he must have for his country. The movie has one significant flaw, it's very dedicated to keeping all of its focus on Chris Kyle, he is of course the main character but I would have liked to have seen some other characters get some more development, even his wife Taya is very undeveloped, we really know nothing about her other than the fact that she loves Chris, that's what's missing from this movie I feel, the fact that Chris is the only real character, and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine. Though the scenes in the battlefields are very intense and beautifully filmed, I think the best parts of the movie are seeing Chris Kyle back at home, it can be just as dramatic and compelling to see him deal with a normal life, struggling to start a family, forget about what he has seen and the lives he could have saved, and I think Bradley Cooper shines as an actor the most in these parts, particularly in his scenes with Sienna Miller, I don't think he took this role because he felt it was an interesting role, but mainly because he wanted to pay tribute to this man, this hero, and inform people on what he has done for the USA, and Cooper delivers one of the highlights of his career. A well acted, action packed ride, I would recommend Anerican Sniper to anyone looking for a drama or war film. <br/><br/>Follows the life of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, both on and off the battlefield, as he kills with pure accuracy on his tours of duty, while struggling to forget about what he has done back at home with his family. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Bradley Cooper Worst Performance: Kevin Lacz"

He finally left the military after 10 years of honorable and extraordinary service.<br/><br/>Eastwood always go the extra mile to present realism. Some scenes are pretty brutal. Plenty of action with memorable images. This is definitely Cooper's shining moment as an actor. Kyle just wanted to be a cowboy, but became widely known as ""The Legend"".

","This has to be my favorite war film alongside Fury(Brad Pitt) and 300(Gerard Butler). Chris Kyle is played by Bradley Cooper who plays him incredibly well. The realism that shows how modern war really affects soldiers and what they have to endure really stood out in this movie. <br/><br/>Although it's based on one guys life, it just goes to show how hard situations are, for example, a man they call the butcher threatens a man after the man told the US soldiers where they were hiding. He then proceeds to drill through the child's leg, and ultimately through his head. <br/><br/>This movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart and it is based on the true story of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who was only killed in 2013 by someone suffering from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) that he was training at a gun range. <br/><br/>If you are alright with understanding that there are a few child deaths and multiple sniper kills then this movie is definitely worth watching. 9/10- For in-depth story-line and realistic warfare."

","Entertaining war movie.<br/><br/>The story of Chris Kyle, the greatest sniper (in terms of confirmed kills) in US military history. 160 kills in four tours of Iraq.<br/><br/>While the war and action scenes are great, the human side seems rather superficial. Director Clint Eastwood tries to make a theme out his struggle between duty and having to kill people (and what war is doing to him and how he relates to his family and other non- combatants) but this is not explored very well. The movie is uneven in that we have intense war scenes followed by back-home scenes which should be emotional but lack depth. <br/><br/>Eastwood used to be a master at human drama and deft manipulation of viewers' emotions (see Million Dollar Baby, as a very good example), but here he seems to have lost his touch. Instead he opts for a more bombastic, action-filled approach.<br/><br/>The other issue with the movie would be the accuracy of it. By many accounts some of the details are not accurate. The faults lie mainly with some of the lesser details, which have been dramatized for cinema.<br/><br/>This all said, while not a brilliant, or multi-layered, movie, American Sniper is a fairly good war movie. It does also raise the thought of what war does to those who fight in it, even (or maybe particularly...) when they are incredibly good at their part in it."

","Well, don't wanna write a long review.<br/><br/>Acting was good, esp Bradley Cooper reached a new high, he's been an above average actor anyways. Directing is nice; there was a wind of 90s from time to time and Eastwood managed to put this nostalgia into different parts of the film efficiently. Action scenes were delicately designed, angles were nice and flow was what it had to be. So in technical terms, it was clean and successful film.<br/><br/>However, to be honest, film was all in all a propaganda unfortunately. Little words like ""savages"" here and there, portraying the people of Iraq, referring to disasters and legitimizing the killings and little words of being proud of the high number of kills. I am not trying to be a great humanist or sth like that, war is war, I get that. But, the film was highly subjective, and maybe in some sense that's OK; but, you gotta see that making a film like this is very much the same thing as putting up nationalist propaganda posters like US did in Cold War. It's conservative, it's subjective and it's just a good example of good old brain washing. Unfortunately, it is what it is.."

"rprince-832-6294","8","11","31","17 January 2015"," Not flawless, but really compelling.
","-American Sniper (2014/15) movie review: -American Sniper, which I am going to put under 2015 reviews because it was released in 2015, follows the military career and family life of Chris Kyle, officially the most lethal sniper in United States history. The films looks at his time as a sniper over four tours, and his struggle to choose between protecting his nation or being with his family.<br/><br/>-American Sniper reminds me a lot of The Hurt locker, but more American. I do have some mixed feeling about the film though, so lets talk about them! -What I did like: -The story was pretty good. At first I didn't like how it was all in order, but going in order left room for going home between each tour, which worked well.<br/><br/>-The acting is really good. Bradly Cooper does deserve his Oscar nomination, but he probably doesn't deserve to win.<br/><br/>-There is not a lot of music in it, which I really liked. And when there is music I really liked it. Well done music editor! -The entire film is very tense and emotional. It is compelling and at times hard to watch, but you cannot look away or think of anything else because the film is very immersive.<br/><br/>-Here are some things I did not like so much: -The film drags a few times and, although is never ceases to be compelling, it feels longer than it is.<br/><br/>-The film is also full of little dramatic sounds like you would find in a trailer to add to suspense, but I thought they really took away from the suspense. Not a fan of the mini-Inception noises.<br/><br/>-One of the things I really loved about The Hurt Locker was a lack of antagonist. It was just him dealing with war. I can't be too hard on American Sniper because it is a true story, but there is one antagonist that shows up like four times which was cool to see Chris Kyle have a rival, but I thought it took away from just him dealing with war. Lone Survivor had a similar thing, but they did not have to deal with the antagonist until the end.<br/><br/>-There were a few cheesy lines where I immediately remembered it was a Clint Eastwood film. One cheesy character, but he was in one scene, so can't be too hard on him.<br/><br/>-American Sniper is rated-R for violence, some graphic war images, and some language. Less than Lone Survivor or Hurt Locker, but more than Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>-So it had a few things I did not enjoy as much, but American Sniper was compelling, emotional, and intense. A very great and well-made war-flick/biopic. I would say American Sniper is worth seeing in theaters. I would give the film a very strong 7.5/10.<br/><br/>-Did you see American Sniper? What did you think?"
"cricket30","10","12","35","20 January 2015"," Clint Eastwood's courageous film, AMER!CAN SNIPER . . .
",". . . clearly is the best English language movie of 2014, as well as topping JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN as the most moving anti-war flick of all time. One of the first things title character Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) points out to his eventual wife, Taya (Sienna Miller), is that he's a proud Texan, NOT a Redneck. ""We ride horses, they ride cousins,"" is how he puts it. Before notching a record 160-plus one-by-one death shots in Iraq, Eastwood is careful to show that Chief Kyle follows in the steps of such famous American serial killers as Alvin York (initiated on turkeys) and Jeffrey Dahmer (who began with dogs) when young lad Chris guns down an unarmed deer under the supervision of his dad. Nicknamed ""Legend"" (apparently his fellow S.E.A.L.s were big Will Smith fans), Chris feels doomed by this phrase--""When does glory fade away, and become a losing Crusade?""--written in a letter home by one of the many ""spotters"" he loses to an enemy sniper (as this is another true-life sniper vs. sniper tale, similar to the WWII story, ENEMY AT THE GATES). That serves as Chris' comrade's own eulogy a couple weeks later. Director Eastwood bravely exposes the Olympic movement as a terrorist training ground with a Syrian gold medalist in sharp-shooting gunning down hundreds of America's finest every time Chris is on the satellite phone with his spouse, or having a conjugal visit with Taya back in Texas. Eastwood's tacit conclusion is that America has to avoid having traitors such as W. and his cronies corrupting our Youth with phony baloney military excursions. Unlike a 90% ""good war"" such as WWII, the fallout from a 99% ""bad war"" like Iraq curses everything it touches, as Chris Kyle and his family learn in AMER1CAN SNIPER."

You can see how every time Chris comes home he is changing. The scenes in the war zone are a major part of the movie and well done.

While this movie isn't without flaws, It did it's job and that is the end goal with every drama production.<br/><br/>As far as flaws, I felt some of the editing was frantic, maybe too frantic for a dramatic production, and I am not talking about scenes of conflict, I am discussing scenes between Taya and Chris.<br/><br/>However, the performances were pretty solid, Bradley did a fantastic job, I knew when I first caught him on the Wedding Crashers he would go places. Sienna Miller also gave a good performance as Taya and her conflict of love for Chris and understand his on-coming PTSD and love for his brothers in arms.<br/><br/>All in all I gave the film an 8 out of 10. While it put it in my top 15 films, I do not give films 10 ratings any longer on IMDb, since a lot of 10 votes are never counted by the site.

","Movie through my eyes: ""American Sniper"" The movie made on the life story of American Seal Navy officer Chris Kyle who was called as Devil of Ramadi The most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, he accumulated 160 confirmed kills out of 255 probable kills. This movie was criticized for showing more Violence but i would say it is required to show the intensity of that situation. Bradley Cooper has played the role of the deadliest sniper and would say he has lived Chris Kyle right from his looks, physic etc.. The scene where Bradley being a sniper pointing a kid who tries to lift the lying Rocket launcher at the US army, the dilemma he shown in his face whether to hit the kid or not deserves applause.Other crew has perfectly played their roles as per directors need. Screen play of the movie and editing keeps the audience to stick to their seats which is supported by a brilliant cinematography. The pain and agony experienced by the army person and his family when they are on the battlefield has depicted well. Done side of the movie is at times being unrealistic for an example emphasizing the ability of rebel sniper depicts the scriptwriter is trying make him a strong antagonist. For someone who doesn't know anything about Chris kyle's life can enjoy this action package, but for one who knows even traces about Chris kyle this looks more fictitious than being real."

"phd_travel","9","10","28","23 January 2015"," Politics aside - gripping movie about a dedicated soldier
","Putting politics aside, this is a terrific movie about the war in Iraq. This isn't a movie about whether the war is right or wrong it is about an excellent sniper who is totally convinced he is protecting troops with his skills. Things are shown from his point of view and the Iraqis he kills even children are shown as the ones attacking the troops. So immediately the viewer is on his side. Subsequently there is a more questionable incident involving a family. Whether his instructions were just or unjust, we see how well he carried them out. <br/><br/>The screenplay is well paced. From the get go it is completely involving. Clint Eastwood's war movies have been rather draggy in the past but this one is almost like a different director was in charge. The civilian to battle switches are well balanced. It's more modern and matter of fact than 'Enemy at the Gates' which was a bit theatrical.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is transformed physically into a bulky soldier and his facial expression shows determination. He inhabits this role convincingly. Occasionally his version of a Texan accent was a bit hard to understand. Sienna Miller looks beautiful as a brunette here and she acts well invoking sympathy without overdoing it. She is talented and lovely and should be a bigger star than she is. Hopefully this will propel her to more leading roles. The soldiers on Kyle's team are played by Jake McDorman and Luke Grimes and you get to know them just enough to feel when they are killed.<br/><br/>The ending which everyone will know going into this movie is a problem. I can understand they didn't want to show the terrible tragedy of his being killed by a PTSD suffering vet and let Kyle go out as a hero. I think it should have been shown because it is such an integral part of his story and it would really bring home that the tragedy of the war goes on after the fighting is over. They do show injured vets and amputees but this was an opportunity to highlight psychological damage as well.<br/><br/>If you can put aside feelings about the correctness of the war this is a very good movie. It does show Kyle using the term savages to refer to Iraqis. If that's the way he was then might as well show how he was an unfortunate product of the times. Maybe by showing his total dedication it will make policy makers realize the responsibility they have in using such a skilled soldier in the proper way."
"rzajac","9","10","28","19 January 2015"," Well, there it is.
","Gotta say, as much as I, a bleeding-heart liberal in-good-standing, have political remonstrances about this flick, I've gotta give it beaucoup kudos as an artistic product. Eastwood set a tight focus for it, and he achieved an end-product that reflects that focus. And he deserves respect for that.<br/><br/>And, when I say ""tight focus"", I don't mean a one-note johnny. The hero is the tip of an iceberg: Maybe he really had the goods to do four tours of duty in Iraq and not be scarred. It's odd/coincidental; I just-so-happened to read a Wikipedia page about PSTD before viewing, and discovered that it can produce actual, physical brain changes. And I think _Sniper_ understands this, and addresses it in an artfully understated way. The hero isn't brusque with his post-operations psychiatrist, he isn't flippant or coy; he's just being who he is. And the shrink, one trusts, makes the right decision and invites him to join him in his particular ministry; attending to the needs of the rest of that iceberg that one doesn't normally see; those who meant as well as our ""hero"" did, but wound up, through tough luck or unexpected weakness, marred and scarred.<br/><br/>And, make no mistake, I still consider the 2003 invasion of Iraq a cowardly act, and a war crime. I consider people like the hero of this movie to have been abused by a system that continues to think America has some kind of divine right to be cowardly, yet thought of as brave; to be disastrously precipitous, yet thought of as agents of positive change; to be meddlesome, yet thought of as (small-'r') republican; to be profligate, yet thought of as ""conservative"". The hero's noble impulses to be a ""sheepdog"" were ill-used by the nation's power-jackals.<br/><br/>To me, the question of this movie is not whether he went through hell and kept his humanity. The question is whether his being oblivious to the cynicism of elites who harnessed his good will to the service of criminal ends, in principle, robs him of his humanity, in _our_ eyes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope this gives you something you can take away: In spite of the preponderance of imagery supportive of the heroics of the ""successful"" military man, the sharp lines and contours of that image--stating its case fairly unequivocally--serve as a Rorschach against which one can test one's own basic response to the ideal of noble (deadly) service to the state."

2) That he shot 2 car-jackers at a gas station
3) He claimed he had been awarded more medals than he did
4) That he punched and knocked down Jesse Ventura in a bar fight<br/><br/>It is thanks for Jesse Ventura's defamation court case against Chris Kyle that we found out that Chris Kyle was a serial lair and none of this account should be believed. However, what is clear is that Chris Kyle is an uncivilized killer with low morals and refers to Iraqi's as ""savages"" and that he wants to ""kill them all"". Not once do we see him think about the wider events, such as the war was illegal, or question what he is doing there. Instead he relishes killing people.

","Whether it be the political, racist, or factual debate, most of us probably have not been able to check into our go-to news websites or scroll through our Facebook newsfeeds without hearing opinions being thrown around about American Sniper. I used to love seeing conversation surface around movies, it means the cinema still has the magic to strike a nerve with audience and evoke strong opinions. With movies like Gone Girl, which prompted a conversation between feminist and misogynist interpretations, it is okay because no one was hurt by it. That is not the case with American Sniper. Seeing responses to this film is probably the closest comparison we will get as to what modern audiences would say if ""Birth of a Nation"" were newly released in the modern day.<br/><br/>American Sniper's hideous ideology is not easy to accept for open-minded individuals, considering Chris Kyle conducts himself in a sexist manner, rejects any notions of thinking in a larger way, and is flat-out racist against Iraquis, often referring to their race of people as ""savages"" and ""scum"". The racism inflates each time a line of dialogue is spoken through Bradley Cooper's mouth; you will wince and wish you were watching a different movie. For a Hollywood film to come out so firm with a political and ideological stance is almost as alarming as the racist slurs themselves. The screenplay does not look to criticize or question this aspect of Chris Kyle's personality. Instead it praises him and hold him up as a hero. Yes, this is the probably the only modern-day film that will label someone a hero who is verbally explicit in his bigotry and racism.<br/><br/>American Sniper bizarrely boasts its bigotry as patriotism, which is not only disturbing but worrisome. The problem with this aspect of the film is the ugliness that Kyle's ideas of the divide between the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is encouraging ultra-conservative and zealous patriots to continue using a racist characterization of Iraqis, and if one does not reinforce Kyle's ideology, they are not patriotic. But being uncomfortable, or at least acknowledging, that Chris Kyle had a very dense view of the world and was very racist on many occasions does not equate to anti-military views. I think most everyone would agree that we would not even be having these debates about a movie if it were not for the troops who have defended our country. My grandfather served in the Korean war, so this is not me being, as I've been accused, ""a crazy, America-hating liberal."" I am a liberal who hates that a film ties racism to a heroic image, and that the film breaking records at the box office. (Phrases used in tweets praising American Sniper like ""sand-n*gger"" have shaken me to my core.)<br/><br/>In addition to the ideology/social impacts of the film, I cannot say that, as a movie, it should be held up as one of the achievements of 2014. I have found this fitting phrase in describing it: a ""knockoff Bigelow film."" American Sniper attempts to be like The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty; it wants to be like Kathryn Bigelow's films like an elementary child imitates the actions of a junior high teenager in attempts to be ""cool"". But like that child, American Sniper just looks silly in its failed attempts.The cinematography is muddy and not very pleasant to look at, unlike those other films. The film editing, though among of the film's better attributes, is looser and less precise than both war films above. And the ""emotional impact"" is the horridly fabricated in this film. Not only is American Sniper ineffective in clawing at my heart but actually produces an opposite effect where, because of the terrible dialogue and a horrendous Sienna Miller, the scenes where we see Chris Kyle at home with his wife and family are laughable and cheaply melodramatic.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's directing of American Sniper is also quite linear. There are no inflections of the story or shades of the protagonist, just a paved-over, flat line of scenes strung together with little human feeling involved. His directing and the overall film are saved from being downright loathsome by the tense action scenes where Eastwood manipulates the audience into those with great suspense and anticipation. My favorite aspect of American Sniper was the straining, articulate sound design, but that's no reason to sit through a film as long and abysmal as this one. If I were recommending movies based on sound quality alone, you better pencil in Transformers: Age of Extinction after your screening of American Sniper.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper received his third acting nomination from the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts, and Sciences without any precursor nominations from critics or other major award shows, which almost never happens. Cooper has been on a roll lately, giving two great performances directed by actor-friendly director David O. Russell. But here, I feel bit fatigued by his nomination. Cooper is fine as Chris Kyle, but does not warrant an ample amount laudable acclaim. Most of what Cooper is trying to covey as an actor is suffocated by Eastwood and the screenplay's straightforward, dense, machismo portrait of who Kyle was. Cooper seems to be doing something inside grey-space but you'd never be able to know because his vision is not appreciated by the creative team behind him.<br/><br/>For military families and fans of the war genre, this will probably tickle your senses in the best ways, but for everyone may be offended by the content...most likely in more ways than one. American Sniper is the generic, ordinary, and guessable war film you would hope it would not be. Heck, even Lone Survivor, which is a B-movie at best, took more daring artistic choices last year than American Sniper does this year.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"
"clanciai","8","7","18","29 January 2015"," Inside view of a sniper's life.
","This film has been fiercely criticized for glorifying war and violence, for giving a one-sided view of the Iraqi war in favor of America and for ignoring the issue at large. Well, Clint Eastwood's ambition was not to make any moral or political assessment but simply to tell the story of this sniper's life. The topic is extremely controversial, since a sniper's business is generally judged to be the least honorable and most cowardly way of making war - you kill people by hiding from them. Nevertheless, Clint Eastwood succeeds in defending his sniper. For the first time you are convinced that he has to do what he is doing, he simply has no choice, it has to be done, and there are two crucial instances when he is faced with the very difficult issue of having to fire at children. The first one is in the beginning of the film, there is the child's mother also, and he kills them both - there is nothing else to do. In the second issue he actually prays that the boy will not pick up the rocket that has been left by the soldier he just shot down. The child picks up the rocket and starts moving as if to use it, the sniper hesitates, this is perhaps the most poignant moment in the whole film - and I will not reveal what happens. In the end he returns to ordinary civil life, and the story reaches a sudden and quite unexpected end, which must reconcile anyone to this whole sordid business. It's true, he killed 160 people in the most cowardly possible way, but you have to excuse him. Someone had to do it, and he only did what he had to do. End of story. Clint Eastwood refrains from any further comment, and so should we."
"lurp268","Null","9","25","15 February 2015"," Great, realistic war movie.
","The movie content, acting, direction, sound directing, cinematography were all outstanding. Only the Band of Brother mini-series is on the same high level as American Sniper (and American Sniper had only 2-hours instead of 12 episodes). The ""1 star"" or less ratings and the liberal rantings of many posters belie the fact that the story was about a guy who was doing what snipers have always been for and so much needed: protecting the infantry and armor troops of their side from enemy snipers and infantry. Period. Don't bemoan the necessity of it or fill your review with your political axe-grinding. Get over yourself; particularly those lib do-gooders who would have all necessary and difficult undertakings done by anyone but themselves. I was a US Army Ranger in Vietnam 1967-69. SSgt Carlos Hathcock was the best known Marine sniper of that era and there are many a Marine infantrymen who came home because of him. Chris Kyle was the next generation to save US Army and Marine infantrymen. Credit to both of them for their bravery and dedication (at the cost of their own family lives) and Michael Moore can go back to Canada, since he does not seem to appreciate the importance of those who serve to protect their fellow soldiers and marines."
"burlesonjesse5","7","9","25","1 February 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of American Sniper
","I once read a review on an earlier Clint Eastwood movie called Mystic River. In it, a well known critic sited his work as a product of quote unquote, ""meat and potatoes"" film making. I suppose it meant that he's not overly elaborate and more straightforward in his storytelling ways. Well, Clint's newest and most tiring endeavor American Sniper, has that affinity. It's like his own Flags of Our Fathers but with much better acting or Lone Survivor without the splurge of blood and guts. ""Meat and potatoes"" film making? Sure why not. ""Meat and potatoes"" film making with a large glass of wine? Okay, I'll give you that one.<br/><br/>Clocking in at a running time of 133 minutes, ""Sniper"" is after all, wholly about the red white, and blue. When I mean blue, I mean depressing. This is the only movie I've been to where when it was over, you could literally hear a pin drop in the audience. No one said a darn word as they exited the theater. War is hell (obviously).<br/><br/>Director Eastwood and writer Jason Hall (his screenplay for ""Sniper"" is heads and tails above the one he wrote for 2013's dreadful Paranoia) fashion a crisp, easy-to-follow story line that takes you through the short life of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper). What's largely on screen is based on Kyle's autobiography titled, American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. In the movie, he starts off as a once promising rodeo rider from Odessa, Texas. After injuring his arm, he instead forgoes his rodeo career to serving his country overseas. You see, when he was a kid his dad taught him how to shoot (and shoot accurately) animals like quail and deer. Kyle takes these skills with him later on in life and eventually becomes a killing machine for the U.S. military. As a sniper who gets the nickname ""Legend"", Kyle racks up over 100 assassinations during four blistering tours in Iraq. The film depicts him coming home in between these tours and becoming incredibly distant with his kids and his wife (Taya Renae Kyle played by Sienna Miller). He's present in body but not in spirit. He even has flashbacks that eventually trigger a loose cannon temper inside of him.<br/><br/>Now American Sniper, with its pedestrian combat scenes, is not entirely groundbreaking. I am however, recommending it for its valid sense of time and place (Kyle's plight starts to unfold after he witnesses the 9/11 attacks on TV). The acting is all aces and it rises above the already feasible material. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller get top billing and they literally disappear into their roles. They alter their normal appearances (Cooper gained weight and dons a pretty good Texas accent considering he's from Philadelphia) and halfway into ""Sniper"", you forget that it's actually them. In all fairness, you can literally feel Cooper's nerve endings in his portrayal of a bruised Navy SEAL with post traumatic stress disorder. This is more mature, more complex, and more contingent than anything he did in American Hustle or Silver Linings Playbook. Believe that.<br/><br/>Thespian prowess and believable locations aside (California can surely look like Iraq if the set design is sufficiently done and it's done well here), American Sniper still has flaws. They are to a degree, only minimal. I didn't buy the courtship between the Cooper and Miller characters. It was probably a classic love story in real life but movie- wise, it just seemed underdeveloped. I also felt misconstrued by Kyle's brother's character (played by Keir O'Donnell) who filters in and out only to never have a median in the plot development. He fights in the war just like Chris but his only scene concludes where he tells him, ""f**k this place"". I'm not sure what he meant by that to be honest. ""Sniper"" doesn't explain what happens to Jeff Kyle. We never hear from his bewildered soldier ever again.<br/><br/>In conclusion, American Sniper has some powerful moments but you can always sense that it's holding back a bit. It's like a marathon to get audiences to tear up and it doesn't quite reach the finish line. The scenes involving Kyle's sniper kills are the high point. They sting a bit and the moments leading up to them involve good actors/actresses making their scenes stick. Eastwood as usual, keeps things moving and his technique is to let the audience know exactly what's going on in order for things to ring true. He directs at times, with a steel-eyed magnetism but is however, hit-or-miss on the notion of ending his films with a certain level of panache. I wanted more out of ""Sniper's"" muted conclusion. It's abrupt and it signals his penchant for wrapping things up quickly (under time and under budget). That might explain his no- nonsense, no flash sense of style (it's rumored that his actors only do one or two takes a scene so Clint's tidy but no perfectionist). No matter. His editing team of Joel Cox and Gary Roach make things flow like butter. He fashions a character study about Cooper's Kyle that brims with madness and panic. Kyle lives for war, it consumes him, and he's built up a scary tolerance to it. He's set in motion to kill and protect his country even though he's thousands of miles away from it. American Sniper in the end, is a solid ""American"" movie. It may be conventional with its minimalistic violence and by-the-book candor. However, if you take out the rushed conclusion and counterfeit romance (remember, this is how the movie treats it. I'm sure that the late Chris Kyle and his real life wife had genuine love for each other), there are still significant bruises left behind. Result: A tributed 3 stars."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","9","25","31 January 2015"," Red White and True?
","Clint Eastwood has become a highly respected figure in the film industry. His iconic acting would have got him there, but add on his prolific film score composing and the fact that American Sniper is his 37th (THIRTY-SEVENTH!) directorial credit and the much over-used epithet ""legend"" is surely applicable. Given that I was less than complimentary about his last film (2014's Jersey Boys), and particularly since he still doesn't look – at 85 – as someone you want to get into a fight with, I'd better be nicer about his latest! And that's not hard, as it is a very good film.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper hunks-up to play real-life Navy-SEAL Chris Kyle, a sharp-shooter as a deer-hunting kid who, patriotically driven on by the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, 'signs up' and just gets better and better as a SEAL sniper. <br/><br/>On his wedding day he gets his call-up to his first tour of duty in the dusty and dangerous hell of the Iraq war. The film effectively charts both his stressful and dramatic tours of duty (where he quickly acquires the moniker of ""Legend"" and a price on his head) as well as the devastating effect that the build-up of post-traumatic stress has on his married life.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings Playbook"" aside I've not always been a great fan of Bradley Cooper's acting, but in American Sniper he really delivers a brilliant performance, switching from the outside world's view of a macho hero to a haunted and tormented soul when given calm to reflect. Although (in my book) he probably won't win, it's good to see he was Oscar-nominated for this. <br/><br/>Donning the dark hair dye, Sienna Miller is also extremely good as his long-suffering wife Taya.<br/><br/>In the same way as ""The Hurt Locker"" got to the unvarnished reality of the Iraq war(s), so this film also lays on the tension by the bucket-load. The action sequences are extremely well done, with the story-arc over the four tours of duty being Kyle's zealous pursuit of his equivalent on the other side: a Syrian Olympic sharpshooter who has been taking a toll on American troops.<br/><br/>Whilst I was moderately engaged by the film, it is rather too energetically painted in red white and blue for British tastes, and dispatches ""bad guys"" at such an incredible rate compared to the US troops that by my reckoning the war should have been over in under 2 weeks. My wife found the war sequences rather repetitious and I can see her point: the film's 132 minute running time could have usefully been trimmed by 15 minutes or so. A lot of the dialogue in the film is also difficult to hear: somewhat ironic in that it has been nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing (so what do I know?!). <br/><br/>With other Oscar nominations for Best Film, Best editing (well deserved) and best adapted screenplay, and with its fervently Patriotic feel, this is bound to do quite well on February 22nd. It's only a shame that there wasn't a category for ""Most plastic looking baby"", else this film would have been a shoe-in for that. <br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review please see my past reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address on the site to receive future reviews.

","We saw a small picture of that war from a US soldiers eyes. A very straight forward but gore removed version for the faint of heart.

The personal cost to our soldiers I have grown to respect even more with age.<br/><br/>Thankfully most liberals live in the cities the terrorists are likely to hit first.

","American Sniper was a brilliantly done movie. Capturing the horror of war and what volunteer military families go through to keep America safe. A thrilling edge of your seat two hours. War is hell and this movie depicts that very well. Kudos to Eastwood for his direction, Cooper for his portrayal of Chris Kyle, and screenwriter Jason Hall. American sniper humanizes war and delivers truth and humanity. American Sniper is a must see for any and all Americans who are not a losers. Chris Kyle saved many American soldiers lives with the job he did and was a hero to the Nth degree. The film is not a battle hymn or a call to arms. The film's intent is to engender respect for those doing the fighting, not to justify the reasons for the fighting. American Sniper is pro-warrior, not pro-war. Will see for a second time real soon."

But that's what books are for, movies can never fit everything from books and story lines. Great Movie and Bradley did a good job making you feel like you were watching the actual person. People have their opinions but most must not know the good work he did after he got out and got his life on track. There was more to this Man then just a Sniper...""The Legend"""
"FilmMuscle","7","9","25","16 January 2015"," A Dubious Portrait of American Patriotism
","The heavily disturbing image of the Twin Towers falling to their burning end and of people leaping off from its heights lit an unstoppable fire in many Americans on that day. Since then, many patriotic Americans have enlisted in the army, hoping to find some form of fulfilling resolution to all this terror. Some of them even agree with the war's never-ending duration in that it will protect the homeland from any other terrorists as long as they ""protect and serve."" American Sniper follows the true story of one of these soldiers: Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper)—a tall, sturdy All-American who continually chooses to leave his beautiful wife, Taya (Sienna Miller), and later on his two sweet kids for the sake of protecting this ultimate American ideal. He's a man who truly believes in the war, and thus, he also turned out to be the deadliest sniper in US history with a confirmed kill rate of 160 people throughout his tours of duty. How could a human even tolerate the responsibility and sight of so many corpses and gore without a particular psychological toll? Well, unsurprisingly, the answer is that one can't, and Kyle only displays the kind of issue here that many individuals choose to irresponsibly gloss over when they're on a support campaign for war: PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). Following yet another visit to Iraq, he comes home to the pain of looming anxiety and lengthy sessions of completely zoning out from reality. <br/><br/>With American Sniper, Clint Eastwood manages to create a thoroughly intense war film. As the deafening gunshots ring around the IMAX audience, the film's meticulous sense of gritty realism ensures to keep the viewers in pervasive suspense. Even when Kyle isn't focusing on deadly shots at a suspicious man's or kid's head, the brilliantly tense score sounds off with a foreboding build-up of what sounds like a sniper rifle reloading, followed by its haunting discharge, so as to never ease the tension in the room and keep us on the edge of our seats. There's no way I can emphasize the excellence of the sound use enough (the sound mixing and editing) in this epic, installing you into an observational post right there on the battlefield as many get blown to bits left and right. It's rough; it's graphically violent; it's unsettling. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper once again makes a smart choice for his latest role; this one though might not be as showy as his performance in Silver Linings Playbook, but his distressed eyes and failing psychological condition tell us everything we need to know through his journey. In which case, it's also supported by an impressive actress in Sienna Miller who works with fairly little material but adds so much more of her own emotional meat into the role than expected. The look of worry never leaves her face; even for those small intimate moments of family time and reunions with her husband in which excitement and merriment briefly spring out, she eventually returns to her emotional default—to a sort of declining hope for the future of a soldier's life. It's a shame Miller isn't receiving more attention in the awards circuit. In sum, from a technical level, American Sniper is one of the more memorable experiences in the modern war genre, but when we regard what's supposed to be an enthralling narrative, we start to witness questionable elements. <br/><br/>Like with Angelina Jolie's Unbroken, the major problem here is the sheer closeness to its subject. As the narrative flows along, it becomes more transparent just how much of a tribute American Sniper intends to be to Chris Kyle's legacy, followed in the end by the standard biopic footage that shows us the outcomes of his life and history. Eastwood's obvious jingoistic attitude here unfortunately adds a lot of bias when an objective and more intelligent perspective would've made for a far more fascinating study of a man who has sniped and brutally killed more people (whether innocent or genuinely criminal) than a normal human being can possibly endure in a state of sanity. There is no absolute morality in this tale as right as (simplistically) cheering on your nation, no matter what, sounds. <br/><br/>Every time American Sniper hints at hesitation from its protagonist, it refutes any possible anti-war arguments by reverting to blind patriotism again and again through heroic dialogue, the numerous American flags sighted across the movie's mise en scène, and the obvious tributary segments. ""This war was just destiny, and it's up to us to enthusiastically back America up in its undoubtable bravery and (supposed) righteousness,"" says American Sniper. Then again, considering something as heavy-handedly named as the film's very own title, you know exactly what position in the debate it will take. <br/><br/>Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/American-sniper-review- a-dubious-portrait-of-American-patriotism/"

It is sad what happened to Chris Kyle, but his story didn't make a compelling film. This was just another war film with nothing special about it.

He told me this story sitting in the back of a M998 during our first tour in Iraq.<br/><br/>Now, I know very little about SEALs as I only spent a short time working with them during my second tour... we had some demo/entry-breach classes (from them), shared some laughs, remarked about the awesomeness of ""relaxed-grooming-standards,"" and they assisted us with intel on several targets they were working on but didn't have the time to complete due to deployment constraints.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a work of fiction but it is a work of fiction based on real people doing real things. Regardless of the current attitude of the war in Iraq - many of us who signed up post-9/11 were sent there - for the simple fact it was (for a time) much more heated than Afghanistan. We had no choice, so we made the best of it ... and in many ways, in many cases (including mine), we didn't care - as long as we got to fight and kill ""bad guys."" Such a concept may be foreign to most people, and I'm glad, but for those select few of us who like the idea of facing a man down in battle and taking his life, such an experience is even better than sex. So when people quote Chris Kyle talking about how he's a ""sociopath"" and only wishes he'd killed more - welcome to the mentality of those select few who actually signed up for, trained, and executed such actions.<br/><br/>Who do you think is going to fight wars so you can drive your fancy, (benzine)petrol-guzzling car to your girl's house, and impress her with your two minutes of intense man-power?

","""I want you to be human again."" As soon as the screen goes dark and the movie begins, we are subjected to an enthralling booming bass that echoes power and might depicting annexing right. All thanks to the boom operators of the flick. A tank shows up, an apt manifestation of annihilation like a devastating predator crushing rocks, walking alongside soldiers with a mission. Not far away a sniper rests in a prone position on a roof alongside another soldier searching his target with rapt attention, cracking jokes, yet doesn't lose his concentration. Entry a lady hiding a grenade earnestly waiting for the convoy to arrive. She is accompanied by her son to whom she slips the grenade. The child rushes towards the American convoy, fully fledged, unaware of the cross-hair and bang! The deafening noise takes us to the past to the hunting grounds where a father is teaching his son to shoot.<br/><br/>Such brilliant direction! The prologue is so beautifully shot that you almost know that you are in for a treat. The story captures every aspect of the 'Legend' with whom American soldiers felt invincible. The flick features all his four major tours along with a melodramatic side story showing his wife wanting his husband home. What it also beautifully captures is the aftermath of war-turmoil in a soldier's head. One of the most badass scenes from the flick is the bit when Kyle takes off his belt to smack his dog inadvertently. Also, when he takes his longest shot that ranged around 1920m and executes it to perfection placing him at the 8th spot on a global scale.<br/><br/>There are some other gorgeous bits in the movies that have been subtly placed. Slaying a woman and a child wasn't how Kyle imagined his first kills to be like. Some beautiful dramatic pieces like Cooper shouting at the nurse to attend to his baby, asking his wife to move on if he doesn't return, his post-traumatic disorder, perspectives of people he met on war, Kyle's recovery and the final goodbye add further quality to this great biography.<br/><br/>A lot of hoopla surrounds the movie owing to the delicate topic it touches viz. Iraq War. Weird rumors and a lot of plot holes have shown up quite quickly for this one. Some of the facts have been altered for movie viewing as well. But if we overlook everything that raises brows and focus merely on how good the biopic really is and experience the emotional quotient of the drama entailed, we would see how marvelous American Sniper really is.<br/><br/>A definite watch for everybody."

","I went into this movie knowing only how Chris Kyle's story was going to end so I wasn't surprised by that. What did catch me off guard is how emotionally intense this film is. I found myself at times forgetting that it was Bradley Cooper on the screen and not the actual Chris Kyle. This is definitely a role that has helped bring him out of his goofy roles that he usually portrays and shines a new light on his talents. This is definitely an Oscar worthy performance much more then Silver Linings Playbook which I also enjoyed. It honestly gave me a new perspective on Bradley as a serious actor in the same way Dallas Buyers Club did for Matthew McConaughey. When the film was over you could feel the emotions that filled the theater. Everyone was in complete silence. All the actors and especially those portraying the Marines and Navy Seals did an outstanding job. It is definitely not a movie for the weak. I truly enjoyed it.

What people don't realize is that the movie isn't supposed to touch on the moral boundaries of war or weather the war was justified at all because it's simply through the views of Chris Kyle and nobody else. Your opinion of Chris may vary but everyone can at least agree that this was a Great War movie and Bradely Cooper's performance was amazing. Even if this movie were to be about a fictional character the movie would be an 8/10. The action felt gritty and the scenes back home felt real. I'm glad this movie focused on PTSD a little more than other war movies that simply end when the solder comes home. But the fact that this was an actual Hero that died, instead of a made up one, made this all the more powerful.

I'm finding it hard to digest this movie. It attempts to speak at a certain type of people rather than to everyone. I wanted a story, a plot, a twist, excitement. I got real life. They didn't even add some good quotes that stick with you. I think it got such high reviews because the people who admire war fail to see that this sort of thing happens every day. Soldiers die. That's what war is about. People seemed to be stupefied by the tragic murders depicted in the film. They were gross and inhumane, but it's no different than what happens daily, not just to Americans but to German, Chinese, French soldiers. The film doesn't even question war and it's morality, it just accepts killing. I felt like I was watching a documentary or playing call of duty at times. And important details were always excluded like why or how the ending happened. People just respect war because our people die for it, yet they fail to make any changes in their life routine to understand each other better. It makes them hypocrites and takes their ancestors in vain. It's a good film, it's just a little too long and lacks a morale. It's teaching the wrong values, encouraging violence over compromise. It's depressing and counter intuitive, an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind."

","Bradley Cooper is amazing in this movie, transforming himself for a very different role, from the ones he normally plays. <br/><br/>***** Spoilers Alert *****<br/><br/>This is by far the best war movie about American's war against terrorists, I enjoy it much more than ""The Hurt Locker"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty"". It adds a new layer of conflict for people in wars, the conflict between duty/honor/patriotism and responsibility to one's family/children. The actions of Chris Kyle is not justified by blind patriotism, at least not in his own eyes, it is justified by his sense of responsibility to his fellow ""sheeps"". He wants to be a sheep- dog, a protector. He had a personal vendetta against the enemy sniper, because he needs to save other soldiers. After that is done, he finally decided his time is up, and returns to his family while continuing to help other injured veterans. It is so much more realistic comparing to the other two titles. <br/><br/>In ""The Hurt Locker"", I do not really understand why he wants to go back to battle. It seems to me that he actually enjoys the violence of war, and addict to the adrenaline rush. In ""Zero Dark Thirty"", it is all about patriotism. There is only the conflict between the enemies and the protagonist (the hero). When people you love are on the other side of the conflict, the decision becomes so much harder. Great movie."

Long story short: if you have strong moral convictions and serve your country, you will become a hero. If you question your country's decision to go to war, you will become weak and either get killed, get maimed or go crazy and kill an American hero.<br/><br/>This transparent motive comes at the expense of what we were lead to believe this movie was going to be: a story about a man trying to come to grips with the horrors of war.

Chris was portrayed as a very serious and focused soldier who certainly had his wits about him. He was depicted in youth, as an excellent shooter, especially of ""anything that moves.""

","The War on Terror has been raging on since the seminal moment of this millennium; September 11, 2001, a day that has quite simply changed everything since. No part of our lives has been entirely unaffected, and the fact that this holds true for every American citizen may help to explain the reason for the film's astounding success in its first weekend; just about everyone seeing this film knows exactly the details and events surrounding the conflict which Chris Kyle became known as 'Legend,' which only enhances his stature in most peoples' eyes as a bonafide American hero who risked his life four separate times to fight intense combat in Iraq, often forced to stay behind and cover his fellow SEALs and Marines who were deployed to more dangerous work such as house-to-house searches in war zones for information about al- Qaeda leaders. It is his story that has come to represent the accomplishment, at whatever price, of the early phase of this newfound type of conflict. Whether or not it has been worth the risk remains hotly contested.<br/><br/>It should be noted that it is almost impossible to review any film which covers any aspect of the War on Terror without comparing it to Zero Dark Thirty, Katherine Bigelow's masterful account of the ultimate mission for the United States in the Middle East: to hunt down and kill Osama bin-Laden. Chris Kyle himself has said in interviews that he wishes he had been assigned to SEAL Team 6, the team responsible for although he certainly did his share on Team 3 in killing various Iraqi insurgents. Nevertheless, on a filmic level, Clint Eastwood's steady, conventional and even-keeled style seems to underwhelm this material. Here we have the story of a man where the tagline is ""the deadliest sniper in US military history,"" yet the bulk of the story seems to take this description for granted. In contrast to Zero Dark Thirty, the screenplay doesn't get into the specifics or details surrounding the complicated aspects of fighting terrorism on the enemies' home turf and the impact that has on American foreign policy as a whole. Indeed, much of the larger geopolitical themes are muted here in order to focus on the rather repetitive structure of showing Kyle's extraordinary ability to kill from astonishing lengths. <br/><br/>Of course, this is a much more focused type of story, but the character of Chris Kyle seems to be an archetype symbolizing American forces instead of a fully-realized individual. He exhibits typical behavior of any deployed soldier regarding guilt about dead soldiers as well as the conflict between needing to remain loyal to his family and his country. These are well-treaded conventions of recent war films, not the least of which is Bigelow's other intensified journey into the mind of the modern solider, The Hurt Locker. Kyle is very similar to Jeremy Renner's devoted and effective soldier who finds himself addicted to any form of combat as a drug, although the true story element does add a different understanding of the effects.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the film is made without a certain amount of professionalism and understanding. Bradley Cooper is very effective as Kyle, bulking up without looking too muscular or movie-hunkish. His acting focuses on the details of portraying a patriotic Texan, complete with the slow drawl, affection for beer and rodeo, as well as complete devotion to his wide-mouthed wife and growing family. Cooper's full range as an actor is on display here, complete with the dead-eye stare of a man who has seen horrors impossible to describe and feels an uncontrollable need to try and bring equilibrium to his life. Sienna Miller seems to have relegated herself recently to playing wives of real-life characters, having done so in Foxcatcher and here. She brings a glamorous quality to Taya, portraying her as a loving wife who puts the need for family stability above her husband's inner desire for combat and revenge.<br/><br/>It is this revenge element which many critics have leeched upon as evidence of Kyle's racist and jingoist attitude towards Iraqis and other Islamists. Although Eastwood does take a pretty apparent right-leaning view of the conflict, he nevertheless attempts to extricate any sort of moral judgment on Chris Kyle and his importance to the American hero mythology. The point of this story, to whatever effect it may have, is that one man saw himself not necessarily as the savior of freedom and democracy, but simply a soldier who followed the orders to protect fellow soldiers from behind, perched above with a high-powered rifle and an eagle eye. The impact this will have on the upcoming trial for Kyle's alleged murderer will undoubtedly be felt throughout the media. It will be interesting to note the recruiting effect of this movie as well. It's easy to imagine a lot of young men getting hyped for fighting through these images."

But for all the wrong reasons. If you, on the other hand, think that any movie with US Marines in it should focus on American war crimes or at least have pictures from Abu Ghraib in the Credits, because everything else is just propaganda - Well, you'll definitely think this movie is just another DOD propaganda flick. I myself think it's neither the former nor the latter. It's a portrait, pure and simple. A portrait of a man with a somewhat limited view of the world, who does not think in shades of gray but rather in pure, simple and easy black and white - sheepdog colors. For whom a kid with a grenade is a savage. Maybe a little bit more difficult to shoot, but basically a savage. Consideration of motive, any hint at ambivalence doesn't enter his mind. And it can't enter, or he would not have been the sniper he actually was. You can't shoot 160 people while wondering if some of them might have had a good reason for what they're doing. And Eastwood ( & Hall, Spielberg etc.) take a step back and just look at that man, his scary view of people and at what war does to him. And all that from his point of view, how he pictures things. The Arab super sniper does not talk. Why would he? He's just another savage after all. The movie does not judge one way or another, it just portrays.

"estebangonzalez10","8","7","20","10 February 2015"," Chris Kyle gets the Eastwood treatment
","""I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took.""<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's latest film, American Sniper, is a carefully constructed character study of one of America's deadliest snipers during the War in Iraq. Unlike most war films this isn't an anti or pro-war movie; it is a film focusing on a character who happens to be a soldier. Bradley Cooper is in nearly every scene of the movie and everything revolves around him. We really don't get familiar with any of the other characters in the movie because he is the main subject of the film. Sienna Miller plays his wife and she is the only other character in the film who has any depth beside him. Eastwood is doing what he does best here, which is focusing on the narration and telling the story of this unique man who had more than 150 confirmed kills during his service as a Navy SEAL. Some may read this film as patriotic, but I think it doesn't really take a side on this issue and rather simply focuses on a man who acted upon the firm conviction that he was doing what was right. Having his character kill off a woman and a young child during the opening scene proves this point. It is a difficult decision, but Chris Kyle has no reservation about what he is doing because he is determined and is able to justify his own actions. The film then flashes back to Kyle's adolescent years where he is taught by his father to be a protective man (to be a sheep dog that protects the sheep from the wolves). This is the key scene in the movie that becomes a metaphor of who Kyle will later become. That is why after watching the 9-11 attacks on TV he decides to join the army. This could've been cheesy and cliché, but I believed his character actually would act on such an impulse because it was the way he was raised. So without taking sides or judging this character, Eastwood is able to focus on his actions and later the consequences those decisions had in his life. He isn't simply portrayed as a hero, he suffers PTSD and suffers consequences for his actions. This however is the weakest part of the film because the film sort of rushes the character to recovery and doesn't take more time to dwell on that aspect of his life. American Snpier a solid character study with some good action scenes and a strong lead performance from Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>Based on Chris Kyle's autobiographical book, Jason Hall adapts a solid screenplay and walks the dangerous fine line of trying to force a point of view about the war on the audience. Focusing on the character allows it to steer away from that common and familiar take on war films. Bradley Cooper is the driving force of the movie and for the first time I actually forgot I was watching Bradley Cooper, and I believed he was the actual Chris Kyle. He downplays much of his performance and that is what made it more convincing. Sienna Miller is also great (she disappears like she did in Foxcatcher, and becomes the character). The rest of the cast really never get much to work with considering everything centers on the lead character. There is a thrilling confrontation between Kyle and an enemy sniper played by Sammy Sheik that is very interesting. The film has plenty of well choreographed action scenes and many thrills that keep us engaged. There is a great sandstorm action scene near the third act of the film that stands out. The action scenes are perhaps the most gripping thing about American Sniper, but a deeper exploration of the effects of the war on Kyle could've lifted this to another level. It is portrayed in a light and rushed way, but Cooper does his best to capture that inner tension. What American Sniper does best is tell the character's story and let the audience make their own conclusion of whether or not he was a hero or a murderer."

","The war on terror has been accomplished by determined soldiers that were willing to stay as long as necessary to put an end to it. What kind of ending was everyone's question, but the goal seemed to be common; kill those with a gun and try to get to the next level until we know who their leader is. One question that we have been trying to figure out is whether it's our army that changes the person or the enemy that does. According to my mother, my grandfather has always been the same person even before he enlisted in World War II. So perhaps it'd more on the soldier then anything.<br/><br/>Like how youths react different to education, it seems to depend on the person. Those that tend to take charge quickly will probably not be as affected by warfare then most. Those that have taken a military job somewhere that's not on the battlefield are more likely to feel something should something happen. The front line infantry however is a different story. The folk here usually join because they need a sense of direction that they didn't receive in life. One such guy is the result in American Sniper. <br/><br/>Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) proudly enlists in the U.S. Navy after seeing the 1998 embassy bombings. His experience in handling a rifle gets him into SEAL training where he becomes a SEAL sniper. Before shipping out, he meets a young woman Taya Renae (played by Sienna Miller) who warms up to the guy and marries him just as fast. Even with the training, his personality seems unchanged that is until he carries through his first set of kills; a woman and a boy who were ready to take out a tank with a grenade launcher. <br/><br/>He earns the nickname ""legend"" due to his many kills that he continues to rank up. The catch here now is that he returns home a new man. His happiness is short lived as he spends a lot of time watching war footage from the news and even starts arguments over that with his wife over it. He takes on several tours of duty which originally start out as true reasons (wanted to help his brother or catching a deadly terrorist) but seems to take a forth one just because. He grows increasingly distant from his family as the only thing that seems to be real is what he's targeting. <br/><br/>American Sniper is based of the famous memoir of the same name and though I haven't read it, my dad was with me at the screening and claims that it's pretty close. That's something that I should expect out of director Clint Eastwood who tends to do well with the dark side of humanity while still staying traditional. American Sniper relays both elements that seem to show Chris Kyle as war hero while properly showing the affect of his duty. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is perfectly casted into this man's role that show him playing both the war torn military guy, but also the innocent of who he is before the guns changed him. <br/><br/>I should warn most that while the movie is great, it is not for those that are prone to violence and blood. This goes beyond a couple of guying getting shot down as we see their scarred faces and even the torture of women and children. I guarantee that this is what probably went on over in the Middle East and Eastwood knew how to shot it (especially through an impressive sandstorm sequence that I will not dare spoil <br/><br/>I'll give this nine Special Warfare insignias out of ten. American Sniper says a lot about those that have gone over to Afghanistan and Iraq and may make a good companion piece to Zero Dark Thirty.

","This movie is essentially a character piece in a military setting, describing the life, motivations, and choices of Chris Kyle as he joins the military, serves with distinction as a Navy SEAL sniper, and deals with the mounting personal impact of repeated tours in Iraq.<br/><br/>Despite the subject matter, the movie has a relatively low-key feel, and presents setting and events in a very neutral way. The audience is invited to discover the significance of key points without exaggerated dramatic highlighting to draw their attention. In particular, the physical and psychological costs of military service to Chris Kyle, some of his compatriots, and his brother are made clear without melodrama or overt contrivances.<br/><br/>His meeting with his future wife, their marriage, and the increasingly stressful absences from his growing family during tours, punctuated by eventful calls home, provide the essential notes of what proves to be a love story, but the movie restricts itself to just the essential notes. And given his unexpected and untimely death in 2013 only a few years after his honorable discharge, it's hard not to look on it now as a tragic love story.<br/><br/>According to posts on boxofficemojo.com, the film has demonstrated broad appeal among both art house film fans and general audiences, and I've read a number of reviewers suggesting that the story's presentation lets it play well to people with very different social and political attitudes, because the audience is not explicitly led to a particular interpretation of the events described. Reviews here suggest that the lack of a carefully scripted subtext is also the source of resentment, at least for some, but again, the box office receipts would suggest this opinion isn't prevalent.<br/><br/>Intended as a dramatic depiction of a true story rather than merely being ""inspired by"" or ""based on"" real people and events (as with, for example, ""The Imitation Game""), American Sniper is constrained as to the kind of plot it could have or events it could contain without violating the integrity of the film. The movie benefited from this by being less ""Hollywood"", at the price of having a plot which (in a sense) is less intense than something explicitly designed to trigger audience response. That said, I would rate it very highly among the war and military-related movies I've seen, with the understanding that it's a drama, not an action-adventure or suspense/thriller film."

","Watching a war movie from Clint Eastwood like this, can be disappointing for a 50 y/o man like me who has grown up with this director's films. Unimaginable awful!<br/><br/>The opening sequence can tell you whole value of a movie. We have a naive mother and child in opening sequence, with a grenade and she sends her child to throw the grenade to a big group of American soldiers who were moving forward... then American sniper shoots the kid and subsequently the mother takes the grenade to do the unfinished job and... one another shooting from the sniper... HURRAY! Isn't it really funny?! <br/><br/>1- Why the Iraq fighters sent the mother and child to do that? Couldn't it be doubtful a mother and child to be seen in war zone of Baghdad?<br/><br/>2- Why the mother and child act so clumsily?! (she gives him the grenade so slow and obviously!) They want sniper to see them, or us to see them and give rights to the sniper?! (Lol!)<br/><br/>3- Why the Iraq fighters didn't throw the grenade from the roof of the building? Did they have to do it vis-a-vis?<br/><br/>4-How far can a child throw a big grenade like that? More than 20 feet? So can't the soldiers see and shoot him from 20 feet? and do they need a sniper to shoot?!<br/><br/>5- Why the mother didn't do it by herself? Did she want her son to be killed first?! Was she a mother or a robot?!<br/><br/>6- Why the Iraq fighters didn't use RPG instead that funny grenade? What can a grenade do for a few armored trucks?<br/><br/>All the questions are about goofs of just first sequence. Isn't it really childish to script like this by Eastwood? I think I don't need to continue to analyze rest of the movie. The first sequence was clearly awful enough.<br/><br/>The Iraq fighters didn't need to send a mother and child in front of an army. Eastwood needed to send them! Because somehow he wanted to justify killing lots of kids by real Chris Kyle. But I am sorry for Eastwood, because that way didn't work for me and many others also. It was too childish and ridiculous!<br/><br/>We have just two kinds of people in this film: Good, Good, Good People (American veterans) and Bad, Bad, Bad people (Iraq people)! The good people are paid young men who have traveled 10,000 km far from their home country to protect their own country, by killing the local children! But the bad people are some idiot, ""savage"" and non-paid people who even kill their own children and don't know even how to fight and use the weapons. They are very very bad, because want to kick out the good people from their home country!<br/><br/>At the same time we have a particular person in this story who is not bad, is not good too. He is a hero! He kills children and women from the close distant skilfully, he is a faithful Christian who never reads bible, a good father who believes he must kill people of 10,000 km farther country just for protecting his own children. He even can kill the sniper man of bad people, without seeing him in his own gun- binoculars. This person doesn't go to have battle with enemy due to patriotism even, he just believes that ""United States is the best country in the world""! (Lol) We must commiserate if all American heroes are HOLLOW like this one! <br/><br/>Eastwood has even falsification of history in this film. Real Kyle joined military in 1999 (before Sep.11 2001 attack), not after that. But Eastwood has changed it, because he believes that if we see Kyle made decision to join military after Sep.11, we can make more empathy with his brutal purposes! And perhaps Sep.11 attack has been a reaction against some brutal actions of heroes like Kyle, in real history.<br/><br/>In ""American Sniper"" we have a hero who comes from a family that father sees whole world as a jungle with wolves, sheep and dogs! Growing up in such a family naturally makes children like ""savage"" animals! Perhaps that was the reason why being a cowboy and living normal life with people couldn't make Kyle satisfied, and he decided to join military to enjoy his own ""savage"" character.<br/><br/>I wish I was 12 y/o boy! ""American Sniper"" is a best war movie for 12 y/o boys who always play ""Counter Strike"" (video game), without knowing ""the reason"" of fighting. This film's sold more than 500,000,000$, so it means that you can find huge number of people with 12 y/o mentality in America! I think it's needed to grab simple-minded young people from US to provoke and deceive them in order to send them to Iraq (and not showing how and why Kyle was killed). American military always needs some new veterans in Iraq anyway!! <br/><br/>United States is a country where artists of Hollywood are politicians, and politicians of White House are actors! Politics are more preferred than nation in US. That's the reason why after 26 years living in US, I left that country for ever. <br/><br/>If I new about this production before start to making of the movie, I would recommend Oliver Stone to make this film, not Eastwood! Oliver Stone at least lies subtly and credible! Propaganda film is not Eastwood's job."

"PaulEHarvey","1","8","24","15 May 2015"," Absolute Tripe
","** SPOILERS INCLUDED ** American Sniper is a true sign of the decline of Clint Eastwood as a film director. Eastwood took what could have been a truly interesting subject, the most lethal sniper in US History, and turned it into a silly conflict of pure good vs pure evil.<br/><br/>I am a fan of good war movies, Blackhawk Down being among my favorites. What a movie like DOWN doesn't try to do is moralize. From the first minute in, American Sniper is setting up good vs evil undertones in such a childlike manner that it's an embarrassment to watch.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle did four tours in Iraq. Instead of examining why Kyle kept going back, Eastwood invents a silly foil for Kyle's sniper in the form of ""The Butcher"", as well as a super-sniper that kills for the Butcher. Kyle has to go back to Iraq and ""finish the mission"" so the Butcher doesn't kill more of our guys. Eastwood might as well have just made a purely fictional film because to say this is based on a true story is deliberately misleading.<br/><br/>The religious and moral ""values"" hammering the viewer in the head throughout this film make it completely unwatchable. Do yourself a favor and stay far away. Watch Blackhawk Down or Fury, movies that do a far better job of looking at the horrors of war without being blinded by the prejudices of their directors."
"drawlife","8","8","24","19 January 2015"," Cooper's best performance.
","It's solid. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's performance is what makes this film work. In his performance here, you don't see him as an actor, but rather as a person. He embodies US Navy Seal Sniper Chris Kyle(rest in peace). His work is very solid, but being completely honest, I would have agreed with the Academy's choice of nominating his performance if Selma hadn't been released in the same year. <br/><br/>This film tends to ask the right questions including, what is the price for military glory? What is it like to be a modern day soldier? Can you come back as yourself after war? All these questions are explored. Cooper is able to show this as he struggles to deal with everything he does. Yet, he always goes back, because for two reasons, it's what he knows, and because nobody else will. The film goes to great lengths to show his compassion for his comrades. He wants to go on the ground and give the marines some pointers and he even argues to his superiors about going down than laying back. <br/><br/>This is Eastwood's solid effort, I didn't particularly enjoy his last couple of films, but he won me over with this one. To date his best work is Letters From Iwo Jima, but American Sniper is a solid entry into his glorious career. Eastwood brilliantly captures all the tense and suspenseful moments quite well. There are lots of nail biting scenes in the film, even in the trailers where Kyle is about to snipe the mother and son with the grenade was one of the most intense trailers I've ever seen, and seeing it all play out was even more gripping. <br/><br/>Aside from Bradley Cooper, who's mark is made in the entire film, Sienna Miller is quite effective as his wife Taya Kyle even though it's somewhat of a cliché role. She shares lots of intimate moments with Bradley Cooper. The supporting cast surrounding Bradley Cooper are excellent, it's not overdone but there's enough to actually care about his comrades and they all bounce off each other extremely well, especially Jake McDorman as Biggles and Luke Grimes as Marc. <br/><br/>The only criticism I have in this film is that it kind of glosses over some of the more problematic elements of him as a character. There are scenes shows on his PTSD problems and adjusting to a normal life, but it's sporadically sprinkled in the film rather than really diving into it. Though it was great to watch and has some good moments, I thought a lot more could have been explored. Also as I read more into Chris Kyle, the film somewhat changes his true self and its almost as if they're trying to make him more heroic, or more one-noted. I understand it's a film and some changes had to be made to appeal to some people and the studio head, but it's the only nitpick I have within the film. <br/><br/>Nevertheless it's a solid film by Clint Eastwood. There's a lot more action than you'd expect in a Clint Eastwood film and they are very well shot. Being asked to kill 160 people(officially confirmed) in the name of your country is a huge undertaking and shows the internal conflict that comes along with it. Cooper is brilliant and it's a poignant reminder that we need to do more than say ""Thank you,"" to all the troops and veterans in the US.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Its based of a true story, obviously they changed some things to make it into a movie but from what I read up on they actually stayed true to a majority of the things you see Bradley Cooper doing as Chris Kyle in the movie. If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend seeing it. I love how Bradley Cooper bulked up and tried his hardest to portray a realistic Chris Kyle. This movie is truly amazing and I wouldn't mind going back to the movie theater to see it again."
"williampsamuel","9","10","32","17 January 2015"," A Moving Portrait of a Modern Warrior
","They called him Legend. Well before he had completed his fourth tour in Iraq or broken the record for confirmed kills, Chris Kyle's fellow soldiers regarded him as a hero, an almost superhuman figure. People joked that he was invincible, that he could win any fight, and some of them were only half joking. But of course he was not. He was not invincible, nor was he immune to the effects of the war raging around him. He was a warrior, but he was still a man. And Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is the story of the man behind the legend.<br/><br/>Given the things he did, the most extraordinary thing about the man at the center of this story is how ordinary he is. Chris Kyle started out as just a small town Texas ranch hand, dreaming of becoming a rodeo cowboy till he saw our embassies burning on TV. Even after becoming a SEAL, he doesn't carry himself with the same bravado one would expect. In fact he's not the type to be particularly talkative about anything, remaining shy and soft spoken in social situations. His romantic advances towards his girlfriend-turned-wife are almost endearingly cheesy, making up with earnestness what he lacks in romantic sophistication. He's really just a down to earth American good old boy- who happens to be a model soldier and phenomenal with a gun.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper absolutely nails this role in a performance defined by understatement. He blends so seamlessly into the role that you almost forget that he's an actor playing a character. He's able to say so much with so few words, his tone saying as much as the words themselves and his expressions saying the things his character cannot speak out loud. We sense his anger, frustration, exhilaration and at times even fear without the need for drawn out exposition. If you blink you may miss it, but Cooper and Eastwood have perfected the less is more school of characterization.<br/><br/>Under Eastwood's direction, the scenes in this film come mostly in two flavors: tense and intense. The intensity comes with the firefights spread throughout the movie. These are expertly shot, suspenseful, as realistic as Hollywood can produce, and always important to the story. None of the action is gratuitous or included for its own sake, and what actually happened takes precedence over what would be the most fun or exciting, or the least disturbing. And in between the action the tension is always there, slowly building, because he can't know when the next firefight will be. Anytime on patrol someone close to him could be hit by an enemy sniper's bullet without warning. <br/><br/>Even when he's home, he really isn't. The tension is still there and his mind is still in the war. He can't relax, can't relate to anyone in civilian life. And so again and again he goes back to the fighting. There's talk of glory and at what point it ceases to have value, but that's not why he's fighting Neither, as he claims, is he fighting to protect his wife and children. They're safe half a world away. No, he keeps fighting because he feels obligated to his brothers. He knows that every minute he's home there's still a war going on, and he's scared to death that good people will die if he's not there to protect them.<br/><br/>And on another level it's very personal for him. He can't come back from the war, really come back, because he has too much unfinished business. There are friends to avenge, targets left over from his last tour. Targets like Mustafa. Kyle hears of him early on his first tour; an especially deadly Al-Oueda sniper rumored to have been an Olympian. Soon he sees firsthand just how much substance the rumors have in the first of many, many encounters. Across all four tours they meet again and again, seeing each other only through their scopes, coming so close to killing the other. It's like Mustafa is the white whale to his captain Ahab. Kyle simply can't rest knowing he's still out there.<br/><br/>But every war must end, every warrior must come home, and at long last he does. Finally he reaches the point where the strain is too much and combat no longer holds any lure, and so he leaves the war for good. Leaving it behind him however is not so easy. Readjusting is as hard as anything he's done. Admitting to himself, much less others that everything isn't ""fine"" is almost impossible. But he does. In helping others who are like himself he finds his peace, some would even say redemption. And it is this, more than anything he did in Iraq that the film treats as his greatest triumph.<br/><br/>And that is also the greatest tragedy. It was after he had come home, not only physically but mentally; when he had truly become Chris Kyle, father and husband, and begun living what should have been his happily ever after, that he died. Everyone watching already knows how the story ends, but that doesn't make it any less painful when it does. Handled in the same direct, understated manner as the rest of the film, his funeral procession makes for one of the most poignant and melancholy endings in recent memory.<br/><br/>American Sniper is not a perfect film. It's not quite a Hurt Locker or Zero Dark Thirty. The establishing flashbacks at the beginning come too quickly, and some later parts go too slow. Nor do any of his fellow soldiers make more than a fleeting impression. But that is understandable, because this is Kyle's story, and it is a very good one. Well shot and directed, exceptionally acted, and subtle in its depth, American Sniper is a good war movie and an excellent biography. In a winter with many excellent films in theaters, this is one of the best."
"stephendaxter","8","10","32","16 January 2015"," A gripping and tense story of the greatest sniper in US history
","American Sniper is yet another war film that follows the life of Chris Kyle; known as the most deadly sniper in history, both on and off the battlefield. The film is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle. Right away from hearing this team working on the film you cant help but get a little excited about film. You expect a really good performance from Bradley Cooper and that is exactly what you get. The performance of Cooper is what really makes this film great. He bulked up for the role and is able to play both the loving husband at home and the 'legend' sniper on the battlefield. It was a tough role to fulfill, portraying someone who only recently passed but he did a very good job. The only negative thing about his performance and preventing it from being one of the best may not be too much of his fault, i felt at times that i was watching Bradley Cooper and not Chris Kyle. At some times he really transforms into this other person but at other times i just see Bradley, and that took me out of it a little bit. <br/><br/>The story itself was at times intense and at times pretty calm and it did have a good mixture of that. There may have been a few scenarios in the film that you may have seen in other sniper films or war films but not enough to feel like you have seen this movie before. One last thing that i thought of is that there is a smaller plot line involving his brother that seems to all of a sudden disappear at one point in the film, and that just felt like a little bit of a waste to not follow it through to the end. But in the end American Sniper was a pretty good war/ sniper film with an almost great performance by Bradley Cooper. - 7.9"
"Dan1863Sickles","7","9","28","19 February 2015"," The Flaws Are In Clint's Vision, Not Chris Kyle's Life
","Most of the positive reviews of this film boil down to ""I love America . . . so I love this movie!"" Most of the negative ones come down to ""America is evil and stupid. Just like this movie!"" As a Desert Storm era Marine veteran who considers himself a liberal, I would like to evaluate this movie in a different way, comparing its strengths and weaknesses to a very similar picture, LONE SURVIVOR, starring Mark Wahlberg and directed by Peter Berg.<br/><br/>SNIPER is an effective war movie. It has panoramic scope, epic action sequences, moments of true tension and white-knuckle suspense, and it successfully packs Chris Kyle's four tours in Iraq into one coherent and compelling narrative.<br/><br/>The problem is, SNIPER is a Clint Eastwood movie, and the depiction of Chris Kyle is limited by Clint's narrow world view. For Clint Eastwood, being a hero (in fact simply being a man,) is always a matter of going it alone. Every movie he makes is a restatement of this theme, and SNIPER is basically HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER goes to Iraq. There's a town full of no-goods, and a lone stranger rides in to deal with them. Then he leaves. That's not all there is to the movie, of course, but that's the only part Clint Eastwood really likes or understands. Whenever Chris Kyle is bonding with his buddies, or trying to deal with his wife and children, the movie goes flat. Not because the real Chris Kyle didn't care about those things, but because Clint Eastwood doesn't.<br/><br/>The vision of lone-wolf courage in SNIPER is very different from the vision of brotherhood and sacrifice in LONE SURVIVOR. Clint Eastwood celebrates ""aggression,"" as if that's all courage comes down to. But you don't have to be a liberal to see how shallow that is. After all, Sonny Corleone in THE GODFATHER had plenty of aggression. <br/><br/>The Navy SEALS in LONE SURVIVOR have aggression, but they also have discipline and teamwork. And they have each other. Clint Eastwood totally does not get that. The sidekicks he gives Chris Kyle are mere cardboard cutouts. (Like his wife and their rubber baby.) They're only there for Chris Kyle to save. But the SEALS in LONE SURVIOVR are true equals, a band of brothers. When they're joking around they come across more like the Beatles in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT than like lone wolves filled with aggression. What they are called upon to endure is truly the ultimate ""hard day's night."" The story's tragedy is that they can't save each other from death. But the everlasting triumph of the story is that they do something more important. They save each other from making the wrong choices, from being dehumanized by war. <br/><br/>When you watch LONE SURVIVOR, the enduring image of courage is Lieutenant Mike Murphy (played by Taylor Kitsch) climbing to the top of the hill to call for help for his wounded men. He's willing to die because he loves them more than himself. Notice that he's not fighting at this moment. He's not even armed. He's making a sacrifice. That's what courage is, not ""aggression."" You don't need weapons to be a hero. All you need is love.<br/><br/>Again, let me be clear. I know that the real Chris Kyle would understand this, and would have behaved the same under the same circumstances. But that's not the story Clint Eastwood wants to tell. He doesn't want a band of brothers, a team of men who laugh and cry and are ready to die *for each other*. He wants Dirty Harry. He wants a lone wolf who feels nothing but contempt for the ""sheep"" he protects.<br/><br/>There were some liberals who chose to hate on LONE SURVIVOR, but on the whole I think it was a movie that was easier for us to respect and understand. Because the themes of love and brotherhood and sacrifice far outweigh the killing. American SNIPER paints the opposite picture. For Clint the guns and the violence are glorious in themselves. And he doesn't see how self-destructive that really is, not even when Chris Kyle is going to the gun range for the final time. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood thinks he's glorifying Chris Kyle by making guns the center of his life. He doesn't understand that he's actually oversimplifying the character, and retelling a story the Beatles already told. It's not a story of brotherhood, like LONE SURVIVOR or A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. It's the story of Rocky Raccoon!"

"CinemaClown","Null","10","33","21 February 2015"," Another American Propaganda Piece That's Nothing More Or Less
","Out of the 8 films nominated for Best Picture Oscar this year, 4 of them chronicle the lives of notable personalities, first being the renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, second is the legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, third being the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, & finally we have the deadliest sniper in US military history, Chris Kyle, in American Sniper.<br/><br/>Based on Chris Kyle's memoir of the same name, American Sniper tells the story of the decorated United States Navy SEAL marksman who served 4 tours in Iraq War & earned the notorious tag of the most lethal American sniper with 160 confirmed kills. The film adaptation briefly goes through segments of his life, his time in Iraq as well as the difficulties he faced in readjusting to civilian life & domestic responsibilities after returning home from his duty.<br/><br/>Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is a one-sided perspective on the subject of Iraq War that depicts all Iraqis as dehumanized savages, is brimming with American glorification, even tries to justify United States' moral policing habit on the world stage when that nation could really use some of that in its own backyard, and just like Lone Survivor which was released over a year ago, is nothing more than a mere propaganda piece made exclusively for American audience.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are finely executed but none of its elements have anything that can make them stand apart from other examples of the genre. The cast comprises of Bradley Cooper & Sienna Miller, and the rest of its supporting cast simply exists. Cooper chips in strongly in the role of Chris Kyle & adds another impressive act to his résumé while Miller is brilliant as Kyle's wife who becomes increasingly concerned with the evident change in her husband's personality.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, American Sniper neither succeeds as one of the best examples of its genre nor is amongst Eastwood's best works as a director. However, you have to give it to the 84-year old filmmaker who still isn't showing any signs of slowing down & despite being a very mediocre film in my opinion, its combat sequences nevertheless manage to elevate its entertainment factor to a level that's probably enough to satisfy the majority of mainstream audience.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the weakest nomination in both Best Picture & Best Actor category at the upcoming Academy Awards, and quite unworthy of its recent praise as well considering that there were far too many better films & more compelling performances to come out in 2014, American Sniper might be raking in millions at the box-office right now but content wise, it has nothing new in store for those who are looking for a fresher outlook on the subject of war."

However I did 2 Persian Gulf deployments aboard a carrier and a one year ground deployment in Kuwait.<br/><br/>This story is what it is. To hyper politicize it is very disgusting in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Those on the left are generating all kinds of hate towards Chris Kyle calling this story propaganda. Some of the far left are parroting hearsay about how Kyle was ""redneck"", racist, went on killing sprees, described the enemy as savages, and took out Hurricane Katrina Victims. The left constantly cries out that President Obama got Osama Bin Laden. Obama and Biden routinely remind us of that. The ironic thing is that the Navy SEALs were the ones who killed him.<br/><br/>Those on the right are pretty much in lockstep with the book and this movie. Talk radio constantly reveres the Chris Kyle story. Fox News constantly has Taya Kyle on the air and constantly airs Chris Kyle interviews prior to his death 2 years ago.<br/><br/>I'm here to take a neutral and apolitical stance. War is hell. Did we ""need"" to go into Iraq? There is no correct answer to that question. We did it, Chris Kyle believed in our mission, followed lawful orders, defeated the enemy with his sniper rifle, excelled at it, and saved American lives. He made the hard but correct choice to return to his family at the expense of his stellar Navy career.<br/><br/>I personally believe that this kind of story does need to be told and do need to be based on actual events. However, I have very mixed feelings about the actual Navy SEALs putting themselves in a ""glamorous"" and public eye so soon after their service with books and movies. I do think it is possible that some of it is ego, some of it is hyper political, some of it is for personal or financial gain.<br/><br/>I think that the active duty SEALs still out there carrying out missions unbeknownst to us do so with the thought of completing the mission by destroying the enemy with the utmost precision and intensity, return home with all their shipmates, hug their wives and kids, then turn around and do it all over again. These guys do not say ""Look at me, I'm a Navy SEAL."" The general public cannot nitpick the specifics of the Chris Kyle story. I as a retired sailor cannot nitpick his particular story.

","My title reflects a line from ""American Sniper,"" Clint Eastwood's reverent biopic of Chris Kyle, a sniper during the Iraq War credited with 160 kills, the most in American military history. It also reflects iconic films from Eastwood's career. He, of course, is famous for his roles in westerns, portraying lone dispensers of justice in a world beset by evil. ""In the universe of his films,"" writes N.Y. Times critic A.O. Scott, ""— a universe where the existence of evil is a given — violence is a moral necessity, albeit one that often exacts a cost from those who must wield it in the service of good."" <br/><br/>The narrative goes like this:<br/><br/>People are besieged by pure evil in the form of villains with no conscience who will stop at nothing to destroy what is good. <br/><br/>Most of the good people are impotent to stop the evil ones. <br/><br/>One man rises up with extraordinary gravitas and courage to take a stand. He will not be persuaded to do otherwise. <br/><br/>Evil does its best to compromise or destroy him. However, the good man is better and more skilled at dispensing violence, and evil is conquered. <br/><br/>He is also able to come to terms with himself and the impact evil has made on him. <br/><br/>American Sniper is, at its heart, a cowboy movie. It's a great one too, a well-acted, gripping, old-fashioned shoot-em-up that will have you cheering when the good guys win and the bad guys bite the dust. Its morality reflects pure black and white. It's a hero pic with hordes of faceless enemies and one grand villain (though is not characterized beyond a few mentions of his back story). The dusty streets and rooftops could pass for the wild west, Kyle has a ""posse"" of faithful sidekicks, and his woman waits nervously at home, wondering if he will ever make it back to her.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle is played by Bradley Cooper, who does a stellar job portraying Kyle as a gentle giant with a job to do to preserve the American way of life. His character was formed by a daddy who raised him well, teaching him to shoot and take care of his gun, and giving him a simple, compelling moral view of the world. He tells him there are three kinds of people in the world: sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. Most people are sheep, they need protecting from the wolves that threaten them. The boy better not think of being anything but a sheepdog -- strong, protective, using whatever means necessary to guarantee the safety of his own.<br/><br/>And that about sums up the depth of insight we gain into Kyle's character. He has no demons of his own, only those inflicted upon him by contact with evil. Honorable from youth, he bides his time riding rodeo until the events of 9/11 move him to join the military. He serves four tours in Iraq. Some of his kills involve women and children and we see the pain this causes him. On his trips home between deployments, Kyle's wife struggles with how distant he seems. The aftereffects from combat leave him increasingly estranged, and on occasion he shows a few signs of PTSD. But these are wounds inflicted from without, by his engagement with evil. He is not like some of Eastwood's other characters, dark, mysterious men with secrets in their hearts and past. Chris Kyle is a pure hero.<br/><br/>One of the weaknesses of American Sniper is that it doesn't develop any other characters. Even Kyle's wife, played by Sienna Miller, is given the limited role of worrying about her man, keeping the home fires burning, and expressing hope that one day he will come all the way back and devote himself to the family again. Kyle's buddies trade banter with him, there's a lot of talk about ""team,"" and you know he's there for them but it doesn't get much beyond that. Eastwood's Chris Kyle is truly the lone ""Legend"" in this film -- set apart from everybody else.<br/><br/>The movie has been a huge box office success, and has generated a fair amount of political controversy. However, American Sniper ignores politics altogether to focus on this one man doing his duty. I, for one, am glad of that, because soldiers like Chris Kyle and his mates should not be caught in the middle of political wrangling. If you want to argue politics, let's talk about the people who sent them to Iraq and the policies they enacted which made it necessary for young men and women to go into harm's way.<br/><br/>No, American Sniper is not political, it's something else. It's mythical. That is why audiences are filling theaters to see it. Here in the conservative heartland where I live, the movie house was packed and it was hard to find a seat. People hunger to see something with moral clarity and heroes, a story which validates their underlying beliefs. It doesn't matter to them if it is 100% accurate or reflects all the complexities of war or the human psyche. Literalists will never understand this, but people are more shaped by their mythos and ethos than they are by analysis and reasoning based on facts. Chris Kyle represents a deeply ingrained American myth, one upon which director Clint Eastwood has built his entire career: One man. Doing his job. Standing for justice. Protecting others from evil. Resorting to violence when necessary. Coming to terms with himself.<br/><br/>In my view, myths are fine, if you understand that's what they are. They can be entertaining, inspiring, and thought-provoking. Who doesn't love a good western? So I accepted and appreciated American Sniper for what it is: a well-crafted movie representing a great American mythos and ethos.<br/><br/>Whether or not I actually buy in to that mythos and ethos is another question entirely."

","A film that's been nominated for best picture at the Oscars and also has a lot of controversy behind it, that's a lot to take in for a movie studio.<br/><br/>American Sniper tell the story of Chris Kyle played by Bradley Cooper. Chris was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and, as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname ""Legend."" However, his reputation is also growing behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to ""leave no man behind."" But upon returning home, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.<br/><br/>I remember a time where Clint Eastwood use to make pretty damn good movies. Unforgiven, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino and Mystic River. All these movie right there are one of his best, but for the last couple of years he's been making some bad or really boring movies that forgot about. Until American Sniper came out and at last his back on track of what made him good in the first place, because American Sniper is a great movie.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper in this movie dose a Oscar worthy performance and...wait a minute, his nominated for one. Now that's what I like to see. Cooper really played Chris Kyle so well that I think this is my favorite performance from him, because he got all the stress, all the hard work to protect his family & country and war itself effecting you from the people you killed, and Bradley Cooper got the character right and showed that he was only human.<br/><br/>The directing from Client Eastwood was nothing but great. With his other films (And I'm talking about the bad ones) his movie always have this slow paste feel to them making it uninteresting, but with this it's always going and it never slows down. I'm not talking about the action that makes the movie more quick past, no I'm talking about the movie characters and it's sense of atmosphere of intense and quick reaction and that got my interested from start till finish, and that's brilliant film making by Client Eastwood.<br/><br/>Now for the controversy of this movie: 2014 was the year for controversy and yet it's pretty pointless to start a controversy for this movie over a American hero who may have do some wrong things, but who hasn't in a war zone. The people who started the controversy is only advertising the movie more, I mean just look at the The Interview and how much people sawed that by all the controversy and almost the start of World War 3. The controversy for this movie is by Chris Kyle actions towards Muslims and how the movie adversest him has a perfect war hero, and that's just ridiculous to get all bitchy about. Chris Kyle probably did some bad things in the battlefield but he also did some good things that saved many solders lives. To those who's criticizing Chris is only adverting the movie more and everybody is going to watch the movie and you going to get a lot of hate for saying that.<br/><br/>Now for problems: The films editing seem to past some important scenes in the movie and I'm not going to say what scenes I mean if I do then I must spoil some scenes. And that's it for problems.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a excellent war movie that shows how brutal war is and how it can effect on people."
"ronanmorrissey123","5","9","29","22 January 2015"," Very slow Not best Picture Quality
","So here's the pro's and con's of this movie.<br/><br/>Pro's: *Bradley Cooper - looked the part, good accent, believable character.<br/><br/>Con's: *Bradley Cooper - Not his best performance *fake babies - this is a dead give away. When Chris is holding his new born baby it is clearly a freaking doll. *bland characters - All of the friends he made in the movie were very bland ,non-connectible and very cliché. *predictable plot - the 3rd time he was in Iraq it was pretty much predictable form there. And when his first friend died I was saying to myself in the theaters ""yeah, he's going to die""<br/><br/>I can go on about the pro's and con's all day. But I'm not. Here's what I am going to say. I was so excited to see this movie. I saw the trailer and my dad and I wanted to see it ASAP. Then I did see it and it was a HUGE let down. It started off pretty well. Him watching the marines and a suspected mom and child come out etc. etc., Then going back in time a bit to tell how he got there. I was intrigued for a good while and then after that it just got really slow and very predictable. I understand that it was a true story and on real events but you can add just a little bit more action or suspense or friendship connection to keep the audience connected. I feel that's what it really failed to do. I was attached to any character. I knew Chris was going to die at the end (which was really sad), All of his friends that passed were blunt. I had no feelings for them and I wasn't rooting for them. It felt like it should of been a biography more so then a blockbuster Hollywood movie. <br/><br/>All in all I feel it should of grabbed our attention more. After the first quarter or so it just gets really slow. Although the scene with The butcher and the drill was intense but that was really it besides the awesome 2100 yard shot (which, again, was easily predictable)<br/><br/>So, I'm saying don't waste your money seeing it in theaters. It's really not worth it. Is it Oscar material? For sound sure. But not Best Picture"
"Chimera-5","5","9","29","20 January 2015"," It's really nothing special; good but FAR from great.
","Okay, I didn't serve, so I'm not going to pose like I know what Iraq was like and pull the ""I was there!"" card. I do, however, really like historic films in general. The attention to detail in the film was good, but then again you should expect this from someone the caliber of Clint Eastwood, so it's hardly surprising. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how much of the film was factual, but my issue was how silly a lot of the film was. He sees the bombings of the US Embassies in Africa (before 9/11) and THAT motivates him to give up his cowboy life and enlist as a SEAL? Really?? Can anybody else under The Sun relate to that? It just seemed ridiculous, 9/11 would have made more sense as his impetus. <br/><br/>Right when his wife calls him to say ""It's a boy!"" an intense battle breaks out? Wow, the insurgents must have know with their psychic powers that his guard was down!<br/><br/>Coincidentally meeting a maimed solider from his platoon in a mechanic shop in Podunk, Texas? Of all the luck! <br/><br/>There was only one line of Arabic subtitled THE ENTIRE FILM and there were many lines that seemed important to the plot point in the scene. This was just laziness on Eastwood's part. <br/><br/>Overall a well-made film with a few things that made me cringe. It does move fast for being just over two hours and covers a long span of time in Chris Kyle's life. I definitely prefer Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker over this, still."

","War movies are inspiring to watch as they give factual events of the soldiers who have laid down their life for the motherland. American Sniper is one the best war film in the recent times.<br/><br/>American Sniper follows the true events of Chris Kyle who travels through harsh terrains of Iraq to save countless lives with help of his sharp-shooting skills and becomes a true legend.<br/><br/>From the director of impeccable films like Gran Torino, The Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood comes back with bang after giving string of flops like J Edgar and Hereafter. He mixes the real-time events with well choreographed action sequences and focuses on the script that turns out to be a well-made flick. Hats off to him for pulling all strings together. As you are watching the film , you will be completely engrossed thanks to the powerful script. Special mention for nice action shots along with fantastic cinematography. Bradley Cooper gives in a commendable performance and fits in the role of Chris Kyle. Sienna Miller impresses with her acting skills.<br/><br/>Overall, American Sniper is one of best war films to come out this year.

"kingwreck","5","8","25","27 January 2015"," American Propaganda
","From The start Chris Kyle's story is sad but no sadder than any death from this Iraq BS war. Remember this only a opinion. <br/><br/>The movie as a whole is great at sucking you in and feeding you nothing. Good popcorn but not artall Hollywood. Clint's films can do that at the best or worst. The question is this is not a heroic war and yet the amount of kills seem to be more known than the stupidity of this war. Sad yet unnecessary war and a waste of lives. <br/><br/>Regardless Cooper does a good job not Oscar worthy...this film is very one sided with America as the good guy as always. Any point of view should ask the harder questions. The real great impact war movies are never this patriotic and over-hyped. Better directors with heart would do Chris Kyle's story and all Iraq vets justice. Clint is out of touch. <br/><br/>As a whole the story is vague with Kyle being a humble about his kills, in his book he brags and was competitive with his legend status. As a whole besides being sucked in.yet not being a sheep. I pulled the wool over American Snipers eyes pure propaganda."
"jadepietro","8","8","25","20 January 2015"," At Close Range
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>War is hell. We know that to be a fact. But it's the hell that lingers within the damaged heart and mind of a soldier that is on full display in Clint Eastwood's gripping American Sniper, a biography about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and his tours of duty in Iraq.<br/><br/>￼An assertive screenplay by Jason Hall shows Kyle's life, from impressionable child to family man culminating to trained assassin. Bradley Cooper is fine as the sharpshooting ace and the actor adds more award-winning work to his impressive resume. His portrayal of a man consumed with war is very nuanced and Cooper is a commanding presence on screen. Sienna Miller co-stars as Kyle's devoted wife, Taya, and the actress brings the emotional bond needed to make Kyle appear more human, unlike the laughable plastic dolls substituting for their real life infants. (Come on, the budget couldn't afford real kids! Really?)<br/><br/>￼Tersely directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is an old-fashion war movie with a modern day sensibility. Eastwood has more than acquitted himself with this fine character study, having left the foolishness of his disappointing Jersey Boys behind. Finally in his comfort zone once again (the war zone), he ratchets up the suspense and trauma that a soldier can experience before and after combat. The director's use of violence is effectively done. <br/><br/>However, Eastwood doesn't always succeed in the quieter moments stateside, where he allows the film to become pompous with unnecessary preachy messages about duty, honor, and country, all done very heavy-handedly. (A scene between Kyle and a wounded vet at the doctor's office is poorly staged and totally unbelievable.) But there are many other memorable scenes, especially toward the end of the film in its powerful final battle sequence with its raging sandstorm between the soldiers and the non-stop gunfire and a family cookout that becomes a warning signal about Kyle's inner demons).<br/><br/>Initially, the use of flashbacks add some background about the man, but Eastwood seems more interested in creating the myth. American Sniper never congeals into one solid film. Transitions from the war scenes abruptly change into family sequences that are less satisfying. The film's structure is episodic and choppy. The time frames are jarring and incomplete, particularly Kyle's winning bout with PTSD that seems more like a footnote. <br/><br/>There has been some debate about the hero worship that Eastwood ascribed to this man and his actions, under the guise of patriotism and courage. I will not debate that issue, nor the factual free-wheeling that is customary with the genre of docudramas, but I can criticize the film for its underplaying of the impact of PTSD upon our troops, which is the most interesting part of the film, and the overplaying of the machismo aspects of soldiering that resembled Eastwood's earlier film, Heartbreak Ridge, and its training scenes. Also, the intense competition between Kyle and his adversary sniper, Mustafa, seriously becomes a crucial deterrent to the film's credibility and diverts this strong film into pure melodramatic mode.<br/><br/>￼Kudos to the superb editing by Joel Cox and Gary Roach, the excellent sound mixing of war noise and sudden silence by John T. Reitz, Gregg Rudloff, and Walt Martin, plus the gritty photography by Tom Stern, all contributing to a powerful statement about the casualties of war. This is solid filmmaking even if the film's parts are more fascinating than its whole. American Sniper may carry its patriotism on its sleeve, but it does honor the man, and is a loving tribute to soldiers everywhere.

"j-madej","9","8","25","16 January 2015"," Highly touted Oscar contender that might indeed steal some statutes this year!
","I have been following the story of the sniper Chris Kyle, the Navy Seal credited with over 150 kills of the enemy combatants in the Middle East for quite some time. I knew that eventually there will be a movie made about his life, but I didn't expect to be so soon and with such a high profile director and cast. When I first heard that Clint Eastwood was interested to direct this project, I became doubly exited. I have a lot of respect for his work as an actor, who comfortably, in a twilight of his life, made a successful transition to become a film director. Eventually when it was reviled that Bradley Cooper will take upon himself the titled role, I was confident that the movie will turn out well. Cooper for his role needed to bulk up a bit and took Texan accent classes to be able to portrait Chris Kyle's life, in what eventually would end up as ""American Sniper"" the movie. The whole film is based upon the book by Jason Hall and Chris Kyle spanning the period from childhood going all the way up to his training and 4 tours in Iraq, all the way to his unexpected (spoiler alert) death. <br/><br/>The fact is that Chris Kyle was always a controversial figure. To some he was a hero and a patriot of the highest caliber, to others he was an enemy who had a bounty put on his head in the amount of $20.000. Even known American politician Ron Paul got in to hot water by controversially stating comment about Kyle's life in motto: ""Who fight with a sword dies from it"". However the opinion about the man himself, the fact is, that his life story does work as a movie and the ""American Sniper"" receiving many Oscar nominations this year including Best Film and Best Leading Actor for Bradley Cooper is the best testament of that.<br/><br/>The first thing that you notice about this film is the fact that it is 2 hours and 13th minutes long. This time allowed Eastwood to develop the story without rushing through important moments of Kyle's life, starting from his childhood, going through his bull - rodeo riding, all the way through his enrollment at the age of 30, on to the Navy Seal training regiment and his 4 tours in Iraq. Of course as with most military veterans the adjustment to a normal life becomes a problem. Many veterans suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) which Kyle was trying to help and by doing so helping himself.<br/><br/>The way the story is constructed in the movie is that Eastwood concentrates on the central conflict between the two world class snipers. One of them being Kyle, the other is a Syrian based terrorist who has Olympic pedigree in rifle shots, who fights on the side of the insurgents in Fallujah, a city in the Iraqi province of Al Anbar which has been a terrorist hotbed of insurgency. As US Marines conduct door to door search Kyle is their eye in the elevated position, that protects them in case of problems. This creates a legendary celebrity like status among his fellow soldiers. <br/><br/>Watching ""American Sniper"" another Oscar worthy movie with similar subject comes to mind titled ""Hurt Locker"". Specially the fact that soldiers have a difficulty in adopting to their life back in the civil circumstances and that makes them want to come back to the battlefield, because only there they feel like they are really alive.<br/><br/>Personally I felt ""American Sniper"" was bit too long and lack the emotional impact which I expected from the material presented here. Don't understand me wrong it is still a great film. All the performances are very solid, starting from Bradley Cooper, who not only transform physically, but also has the natural charisma and likability of a leader on display. I am not sure however if this is indeed his best performance. Sienna Miller seems to be on a row and to some extent being type cast again by playing his wife, being also casted as a wife of Mark Ruffalo's character in the ""Foxcatcher"", another highly Oscar touted movie this year. There were scenes in ""American Sniper"" which I felt were unnecessary or simply too long, but they were not distracting enough to take me out of the cinematic experience. On personal note I was really proud to see one of my Ivana Chubbuck Studio acting buddies Evan Gamble, whom I work with in the past, getting an opportunity to have a small speaking role with Bradley Cooper. All in all this highly touted Oscar contender might indeed steal some statuettes this year and rightfully so, I just wish that it would have been at least 15 minutes shorter, which would help to speed up the tempo of the film.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"
"matthewcampagna","8","8","25","18 January 2015"," Cooper Deliverers One of His Best Performances to Date
","American Sniper tells the story of, Chris Kyle, former U.S. NAVY Seal, his life, his struggles during the war and the effects he has to deal with when he comes home. Bradly Cooper portrays the big bodied Kyle perfectly. Putting on over 40 pounds of muscle to play the role, and rocking a southern accent Cooper goes so far into the role you forget this is an actor and not the real man. Sienna Miller plays opposite Cooper as Kyles wife, Taya Kyle. Just as Cooper she embodies the character with great emotion and depth that she creates a real sense of chemistry and sadness to the character that you feel, and her struggle when her husband is away fighting to cope with the stress. Clint Eastwood provides great direction, especially combat sequences that feel real and visceral at times, and not over the top. There is times in the film where it feels somewhat been there done that from other films within the war genre. But still you are drawn into each moment, especially an opening sequence that will have your heart pounding and on the edge of your seat. The music is very tense and fitting to the scene and Eastwood does a good job of setting up the moment within scenes. Again Bradley Cooper is outstanding, especially playing a post war Chris Kyle, that doesn't speak much but just through simple facial expressions and looking into his eyes you feel a certain pain and sadness for Kyle. Similar to Sienna Miller, who as his wife tries so hard to bring Chris back to reality. American Sniper provides tense moments, with great music, and fantastic performances to create a great movie. Some moments may feel out of place, but with Coopers performance you are always drawn into the scene."

Yes we all know this, and Eastwood also knows that we know, so the predictable cliché isn't really rubbed in our face too much through this, sometimes pretty intense and gruelling return to form from the director, his best since Gran Torino.<br/><br/>What Eastwood focuses on is Kyle, and the demons he faces when he returns home from each duty, and how a person can become institutionalised to the war zone. During his tours, Kyle appears to be at ease behind the scope, calm and collected, when he's at his most focused.<br/><br/>Back at home, he appears to be unhinged, and at times, appears to be unapproachable, which is evident in the scene where a fellow soldier thanks him and tells his son his dad is a hero, the reaction is almost autonomous, and it appears that he shuts off to the world.<br/><br/>In his head, is he a hero? Yes, he protects his country, his family, his future, but what he has to do to fulfil this, is sometimes unthinkable, and the fact that he has to live with his decisions, however right they are, are also unimaginable.<br/><br/>Cooper is once again showing that he has so much range, and those blasted Hangover movies are a million miles away from the roles he has now. And it shows with his third nomination in as many years. The intensity he has with Kyle is astounding, and sometimes it's pretty unsettling.<br/><br/>Miller also is showing that she is becoming an actress to be taken seriously, again, light years away from Layer Cake, and being Laws other half.<br/><br/>Yes at times, it's very patriotic, but with a title like this, I wouldn't have expected anything else. I would have like to have seen Spielberg's version though, having the story told from both sides of the war zone, but Eastwood is just as good at telling a story, and giving us amazing set pieces.<br/><br/>I didn't know the story of Kyle, so the very last scene was pretty shocking to me, which made me appreciate that little bit more.<br/><br/>Worth seeing."
"pasqualeperilli","5","7","21","25 January 2015"," Disappointing
","When one thinks of Clint Eastwood, one automatically thinks of a movie that is worth the price. This movie is a proof that, sometimes, even the greatest can fail. From a technical standpoint, the movie was barely OK. The plot and the acting were very disappointing. What one comes to expect in a war movie is the contrast between the horrible aspects of the war and how the war is a necessary evil. That's what leads the audience to reflect and to ask themselves questions. AS failed. The way this movie was made, there were no gray areas. All black and white. The good guys and the bad guys. The heroes and the terrorists. It is laughable that a man sees something on TV, joins the army immediately after and becomes a legend. No struggle is shown to get to that point. Additionally, the main character is as one-dimensional and ""flat"" as it can get. A macho man with absolutely no emotions. A man focused on war and war only. How a sniper can just decide to join the group of soldiers that goes door to door is also inexplicable. This movie resembles a Vin Diesel movie, just in a different context: from car racing to war. People who like Vin Diesel will probably like this movie too. Bradley Cooper was really bad, probably even worse than Eastwood. The movie was not gripping at all, as it was missing two fundamental parts that make a war movie great: a well-rounded main character and the strategy and the reasons behind a war. Too bad. Onto the next one, Clint."

"henryohill","9","9","30","16 January 2015"," this is the ANTI-WAR-IS-FUN movie.
","Today we went to see the newly released movie directed by Clint Eastwood, 'American Sniper.' The title of the movie is perceived differently right off out of the gate by different folks, a division that exists in life, and not just in the movies. There is the anti-cop, anti- military, and anti-patriot view, and it is here where the title irks the seer of such words and as such goes straight to ""BUT"" point of view. The BUT point of view is where the party in question makes a statement followed by the word ""BUT"" and everything before the ""BUT"" is a lie. I support the military BUT, I support the cops BUT I am a patriot BUT, and on and on ad nauseam. Well I have good news for all concerned, this not a movie about war, a movie about heroes, a movie about politics, or where killing is a game of enjoyment as seen in most kids bedrooms at night playing video games that do just that, beyond the roaming eyes of the ""BUT"" adults in the household of said children, who do develop the view that war is fun  this is the ANTI-WAR-IS- FUN movie. <br/><br/>This movie is a story told without agenda and based on facts written in a book by the subject of the movie, Chris Kyle. When I say facts I mean the story of Chris, the war facts are his and the directors opinion of course used as the vehicle to tell Chris Kyle's story  not a hero story, not a worshipping story, but the story of living through the hell of war. The curse of being titled ""Hero"" and ""The Legend"" and all that comes with such words in this world. One of my friends John W. Finn, the first recipient of the Medal of Honor  the ""BUT"" folks almost say the ""Winner of the Medal of Honor""  John beat me down for uttering those words! He would say, ""this is not a game, not something that you can win, and anyone who every tried to win one died!"" A recipient of the MOH was in the wrong place at the wrong time and some officer saw it, then the curse came, and it never leaves you, ever! John said the heroes are still buried in graves around the world, and the lucky ones who made it do not think of themselves as heroes. They like to leave that title to the TV Commercials where everyone who does anything they are supposed to are do are called heroes, moms who feed their kids, someone who shows up for work on time, etc. The vets don't care, as long as you don't call them, the survivors, Heroes!<br/><br/>I know that a lot of people can't fathom the thought that some people naturally are protectors and feel a duty to do so. Protect their family, protect their loved ones, protect their home, and to protect to their country. Today that is out of style and looked down upon as the morning risers read about our troops being killed the day before, cops be assassinated, and they turn the page without thought to the stock market or funnies page and finish their second cup of coffee. They loathe this morality or character flaw that they do possess and do their best if they are in a position to do so, the death of a thousand cuts to take them down. This is the story of Chris Kyle, and upon his return home the battle to protect or to adjust, as the aforementioned world goes on in his head even if not in his current reality; the past is just a thing of time and space, and in some of these protectors head there is no separation between the two. This is the war this movie is about. It is not about the killing, banners, and politics, but real life in our world where war is a constant since the first caveman discovered the club.<br/><br/>This film is the best example of film making this year. Clint Eastwood who makes films like this without politics is judged by politics and I am afraid will NOT win the Best Film nomination for that reason, the personal politics of Clint and not his work and his art. He has a skill and style of story telling that makes you feel, Bridges of Madison County, Flags of our Fathers, the Unforgiven, and now American Sniper. This is film making that reaches into your heart and rips at the fiber of your humanity at its very core. If you don't want your children to grow up wanting to go the war, as the fun of war in some video games is where this may lead them; let them see this film if they are mature and almost to military age  they may have a change of heart. Like most World War Two veterans, who are the best anti-war folks you can find, this reality may save their lives.<br/><br/>Although I am not an on the ground, in country war veteran, my background on the streets gave me one emotional  and this movie IS EMOTIONAL  connection with one thing Chris Kyle said, when he said when he was asked about how he felt afterwards about saving so many by another character in the movie, Chris replied, ""I feel bad about the ones that I could not save."" This made my heart burst, as that is something that is haunting when the night devours the day."

","first off, this was a real event. war is real. We got an inside look at one of Americas best snipers. I feel Eastwood did what he had to do. the movie was about his sniping ability, which was shown more than his personal life. I feel they put enough of his personal life in it to give you an understanding of the kind of guy he was. All my respect to our troops. I don't feel that movies like this get enough credit. We base our likes on movies that reflect on ('homosexuality, Race, transgender) We need to open our eyes, and realize realism cant be changed. Sure, Spielberg might have had better ideas and a better way to show everything, but i feel Eastwood did pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Sniper"" is a solidly-staged but unexceptional picture, filled with overly familiar dramatic situations and a surprisingly blindered view of the world around its central character. While Bradley Cooper does a strong job of inhabiting the role of Chris Kyle, the real-life Navy SEAL whose story is told by the film, Jason Hall's script fails to crack why this story is being told to us.<br/><br/>Sure, Kyle is recognized as the most successful sniper in recorded military history, and he did immeasurable good in terms of protecting human life in the battlefield. I can't begin to imagine the way the people whose lives intersected with his feel about him, and the most moving thing in the film comes at the very end when we see real news footage of the funeral procession for Kyle. The sheer size of the mass of humanity who showed up to pay their respects speaks to the quality of Kyle's character<br/><br/>I'd say the biggest problem it has is that Clint Eastwood has already dealt with this exact material thematically, and he's done it much better"
"shawneofthedead","4","8","26","1 February 2015"," Sharp-shooting in parts but this is, ultimately, a misfire.
","It's tough making a war movie in modern times. These days, conflicts are rarely fought along rigid lines, with moral quandaries presenting themselves every so often. That would seem to be right up director Clint Eastwood's alley - as he's demonstrated in Flags Of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima, a pair of battle-heavy films that take a smart, nuanced look at a far less controversial war. But American Sniper doesn't sit all that comfortably in Eastwood's canon. This portrait of the late Chris Kyle, America's self- proclaimed 'most lethal sniper', has flashes of depth, but winds up presenting a worryingly simplistic view on some very complicated politics.<br/><br/>Brought up as a rough, ready cowboy, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is badly shaken by terrifying video footage of the 9/11 attack. Resolving to take another route in life, he suits up as a Navy SEAL, and is swiftly dispatched to Iraq just as he marries his girlfriend Taya (Sienna Miller). Once there, Kyle's tremendous sharp-shooting prowess gains him a reputation as a legend, among his brothers-in- arms as well as the insurgents they are all fighting. As his family grows, both up and away from him, Kyle drifts ever further from his wife and children. As shell-shock sinks into his bones and the target plastered on his own back grows ever larger, he becomes increasingly determined to hunt down Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), an expert sniper taking down his fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>There are moments of dark, bitter brilliance buried within the grim and grit of American Sniper. These come primarily in the tension between the fictional Kyle's job and his own humanity. In effect, his service to his country requires him to kill: to seek out targets and coolly take them out from the safety of higher ground. When a woman and child run into the path of a tank, the choice is at once obvious and unimaginable: murder, or be murdered. The toll this responsibility takes on Kyle filters into his relationship with Taya - he becomes something akin to an automaton to survive his four tours of Iraq, losing track of his family as he conditions himself to believe that what he does is right. <br/><br/>The problem is really Jason Hall's screenplay, which is - to put it kindly - a perfunctory mess. Taken solely on its own merits (or lack thereof), it's full of strange characterisation and awkwardly on- the-nose dialogue. The final film aches to portray Kyle as a hero, but contains odd undertows of doubt about its main character that are never fully explored. The injustices of this war aren't questioned so much as swept aside, which results in American Sniper celebrating rather than questioning Kyle's dedication to the cause. Kyle finds himself fighting a people who are casually and almost unilaterally demonised as brutes and radicals, and in fact has a ludicrous, almost superheroic final confrontation with the villainous Mustafa. It's an unsettling film to watch because its politics and message seem so simple when they should be anything but. Not to mention the fact that the screenplay really isn't all that accurate as an adaptation of Kyle's memoirs in the first place. <br/><br/>At least the performances are truly quite interesting. Cooper doesn't get to display a great deal beyond a certain grim, dark determination, but he does so with a depth you'd never expect from an actor with his CV and sunny good looks. Miller, too, is practically unrecognisable as Taya, a role that becomes, unfortunately, less interesting as the film goes on; in effect, she is increasingly relegated to weeping and rending her garments over Kyle's exploits. Cooper and Miller are almost - but not really - good enough to convince audiences that they're fretting over their child in a thoroughly puzzling scene featuring an evidently fake baby.<br/><br/>Whatever its failings as an adaptation, American Sniper is a perfectly watchable film. Eastwood is too seasoned and smart a director to fail in that regard - he wrings dramatic tension as much from a scene in which a former serviceman recognises Kyle back in the States, as from a terrifying moment involving a weeping child and a pneumatic drill. But there's something curious and not quite right about this war-soaked drama. In plumbing the depths of its titular sharpshooter, it fails to look beyond the man to the conflict in which he's fighting - a glaring mistake that undermines and, finally, undoes the entire film."

","'AMERICAN SNIPER': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Iraq war flick that's loosely based on Navy SEAL Chris Kyle's autobiography 'American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History' (written by Klye, Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice). Bradley Cooper stars in the movie, as Kyle, and he also co-produced it. Clint Eastwood directed the film and Jason Hall wrote the screenplay. The movie has been nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay) and it also did huge Box Office on it's opening weekend (in theatrical wide release); making over $105 million in four days. It's received mostly positive reviews, from movie critics, but it's also garnered a lot of negative criticism; for it's historical inaccuracies and glamorized depiction of war. The movie also depicts a pretty distorted image of it's central character; who suffered from severe mental illness, lied a lot and bragged about killing (which he also found immense joy in). As a work of just pure cinematic fiction though, I loved it!<br/><br/>Cooper plays a Texan named Chris Kyle; who was a rodeo cowboy until he saw footage of the United States embassy bombings, on TV, in 1998. He decided to enlist in the Navy and became a Navy SEAL sniper. During his training he met Taya Renae (Sienna Miller), at a bar, and he went on to marry her and start a family. He deployed to Iraq after the September 11, 2001 attacks; and served four tours there. During his time of service he claimed to have killed 255 people; 160 were officially confirmed by the Department of Defense. The movie focuses on his obsession with his job and how it effected his family, at home, and his own mental well-being (although it goes into very little detail about it).<br/><br/>Cooper secured the film rights to the book and was originally going to have his buddy David O. Russell direct it; I really wish I could have seen that version (O. Russell is one of my favorite filmmakers). After O. Russell eventually passed on the movie, Steven Spielberg was set to direct it; he wanted to make it a much bigger budgeted epic war film though (and it was his idea to add a rival sniper; that Kyle was constantly battling throughout). Spielberg also passed on the movie, after Warner Bros. (the studio releasing it) wouldn't give him the money he wanted to make it with; I would also like to have seen Spielberg's version of the film (Spielberg and O. Russell have directed two of the greatest war flicks ever made; 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' and 'THREE KINGS'). I do like Eastwood's movie, as pure Hollywood escapism, but I also think a more truthful and accurate film, based on Chris Kyle's actual life, would have been more appropriate and insightful. The omission of Kyle's drastic mental issues, constant lying and somewhat psychotic outlook on life (and death) is severely misleading. If you know the true story though, the film can still be appreciated for it's expert craftsmanship and skillfully produced entertainment value. I can understand how some see the movie as unethical; for distorting facts and giving American viewers just what they want to see (and only that). I still thoroughly enjoyed it though. Eastwood's direction has never been better and Cooper turns in yet another amazing performance (one of the very best of 2014). I think that if the film were set in a different setting (like say a futuristic sci-fi warzone), and the filmmakers didn't claim it was based on actual historical events, most movie fans would just see it as an awesome action movie. I also think it's one of the most important films of the year because it does bring up important issues about war and filmmaking and it also raises insightful discussions about the responsibilities that filmmakers should (or shouldn't) have; in telling a true story. It's sad that a lot of viewers will go into it uneducated, on the disturbing details of Chris Kyle's true life, and therefore believe that most of what they're seeing is true. For educated and open-minded viewers though, it still can be a very powerful and entertaining filmgoing experience!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/1_bZp5ejQ4I"

","Untruthfulness tarnishes the qualities of Clint Eastwood's American Sniper. It's made with fine technical expertise, expectant of the eighty-four year old filmmaker, and is strongly acted. Yet it's also an incomplete, dishonest portrait of a trained killer who lacked a conscience. Before his death in 2013, Chris Kyle served four tours of Iraq. He was the most decorated American sniper in history with 160 confirmed kills and nicknamed 'Legend'. Screenwriter Jason Hall, adapting Kyle's book, conversed with him until a day before his death. Steven Spielberg was to direct the film, hoping to show a rival sniper, but Eastwood replaced him. Violence is a persistent fascination for Eastwood, one he's explored his whole career from both sides of the camera. In his recent work, like Flags of Our Fathers and Gran Torino, Eastwood has shown sympathy for soldiers out of combat while also critical of the sociopolitical forces around them. American Sniper offers far less. It's not a psychological study but an action movie, accounting for its box office success despite a limited release. The film's dedication to combat is increasingly boring and paints Kyle's life as a sentimental, romanticised tragedy. The truth about this man is darker, more disturbing than this misleading psychodrama. <br/><br/>Full review at: <br/><br/>http://www.impulsegamer.com/American-sniper-film-review/"

"DKosty123","9","7","22","25 January 2015"," Chris Kyle's Biography Is Top Notch
","Hollywood people have become more than a little fickle. This movie avoids political statements entirely. Chris Kyle's isn't about politics, it is about service to his country.<br/><br/>The only ones who might not like the way this is told would be corporations. That is because Chris Kyle comes off in this like a blue collar worker - loyal to his company (the Navy Seals) in doing his job effectively and efficiently. That job is protecting his comrades in a war both parties voted for in Congress. <br/><br/>The movie is only slightly patriotic because Kyle is doing his job. I do give him credit. When he meets his wife, she gets sick and barfs from too much booze. When I met a girl at a college mixer who did that, I did not even date her again, it was that ugly.<br/><br/>Kyle was played by a member of the cast of the Hangover and played well. The combat in this one rings true, The film does a great job of addressing the mental stress 4 tours of duty in Iraq would do to somebody. It portrays Chris Kyle's family as low middle class.<br/><br/>Mustafa (the other sides sniper) is played by an Egyptian actor named Sammy Shiek who had a role in Charlie Wilson's war. The reason I say the critics are fickle is that Hollywood must still be hurting over making The Hurt Locker a pro war fictional tale Best Picture a few years ago. Hollywood hates being too pro war so just as the Democratic Congress, that voted to authorize Iraq to start with, they are trying to run away from this movie.<br/><br/>I have the feeling after seeing this, I need to read the book. Since I had not, the ending shocked me and represents extreme irony. Democrats are really good at running away from problems and issues, and that is what they are trying to do with this one.<br/><br/>This movie is tense and dramatic with lots of action and everyone involved in making this one should get kudos. Could it be better? I'd have to read the book. This movie is politically middle of the road. Chris Kyle is a portrait of control in the middle of chaos. As for all of Hollywood being middle of the road and in control, that will never happen. Hollywood does not relate well to lower Middle Class people. They are all rich so they do not understand Chris Kyle's biography and the stress portrayed in this movie. To sum it up is Chris Kyle's statement to his doctor. ""I only wish I could have saved more of my friends."" A lot of them die in this movie and it appears Hollywoods, the rich fat cats do not understand his humble noble mission."

"~AleXa~","4","5","14","5 September 2015"," American Propaganda
","Reviewed August 22, 2015 - 1st viewing (Blu-ray 2D) <br/><br/>American Propaganda<br/><br/>I would like to preface this by stating the obvious: The true story is a tragedy to be sure, however the film unsuccessfully conveys any real emotion or depth. In general I find true stories are harder to adapt, however it is ultimately the director's responsibility to find ways to present the material in such a way that the audience can connect to it, and in this way, it is a failure.<br/><br/>From the beginning, I felt like it was abundant clichés about the American soldier, from hunting to a domineering father to the child with a bomb, the latter of which I'm almost certain I've seen in another film. The facts and events of his life are piece mealed together as if you're skipping three pages for every one you see in a photo album. The plot unfolds as if the screenwriters expect you to know many of the important details assuming you'd read the memoir. <br/><br/>Chris Kyle, a native Texan aspiring to be a rodeo cowboy, decides to join the military after 9/11. Somewhere his brother gets forgotten until his wife mentions he got deployed to Iraq, where Chris is no less, and yet he doesn't seek him out until one random day he seems him boarding a hilo. Then towards the end they vaguely reference that he was killed and Chris comments that it was his own fault I still didn't understand whether the funeral was for Chris' fallen comrades or his brother. There is such an overwhelming lack of emotional connect, even with Bradley Cooper's amazing performance—a testament to the lack of good writing and direction.<br/><br/>The score doesn't fair much better, barely making an appearance other than some numbers with drums during the war scenes as if they accelerate the action. The action sequences (if you can call them that) were quite formulaic and predictable. And the moral of the story certainly does not make an appearance here—I don't understand how Kyle could be so seemingly affected by the kills and yet not have an issue with the killing, never implementing any degree of self-examination or questioning his own personal value system.<br/><br/>Then you have plot devices that just don't make sense. After the kid picked up the rocket launcher, couldn't he have settled for shooting him in the shoulder or leg? Why would you set up your sniper on a moving object? Would all the militants in the greater area known your exactly location from one sniper shot echoing off a building where he's laying under cover? If you can't see two feet in front of you in a sandstorm, how can you make a getaway in a Humvee in it? And what's with the supposed air support coming in at the last possible minute? Not to mention the Punisher logo on everything, from the machine gun shield to their clips to their bulletproof vests. Is that really wise in an active war zone—leaving identifiers plastered on everything in sight? They may as well have painted targets on their backs—oh wait! They already did! And let's not forget the American propaganda lurking behind every corner. So all Americans join the military to serve their country and come home numb of the killing with their only regret being they couldn't kill more 'savages' (we're still calling them that?), with no questions whatsoever about the point and purpose, or tactics used on anyone they cross paths with, including civilians? No concern over morality, no qualms with conduct.<br/><br/>Eastwood is attempting to be minimalistic, but it just falls flat. He has a visual eye, but forgets the aspects that connect the audience to the material. The camera movement was interesting, however there is no attention to the details surrounding the characters, like who they are and what they represent. I can't help but feel like he's trying too hard in all the wrong places.<br/><br/>The most emotional scene was when Chris visited the psychiatrist. I appreciate the fact that they do touch on the importance of veterans being able to seek help and share their experiences with fellow veterans, as I do not feel this is brought out into the light as much as it should be. That being said, in the end he was killed by the veteran he was trying to help. I understand the director finds irony in this, however isn't it completely defeating the purpose of former soldiers not being afraid to seek the help they so desperately need? I mean, that is the end note, so is the moral of the story don't seek help? This is my frustration with films developed from true stories—it isn't enough to just tell the story—the point is supposed to be to find the meaning behind it, how we an make good come of bad.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film did not bring anything new to the war genre, supplanting originality and depth for clichés and propaganda--both of which abound in truckloads. The gravity of how detached and underwhelmed I felt is staggering. The only explanation for the high IMDb rating is that it is based on the concept, not the film or content, the implication being if you don't like this film, you're not proud to be an American. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad I went with my gut and did NOT see this in theaters The film itself is a tragedy in that it fails to celebrate the man's life, instead settling for propaganda and the ironies of life. If you're looking for a great war film, I suggest Saving Private Ryan or Fury—the depth and emotion conveyed in those films leave you feeling more like you took something important from them and less like you just watched a good man's legacy die before your very eyes <br/><br/>3.0 of 10.0"
"bryank-04844","3","5","14","12 August 2015"," 'American Sniper' fails in its redundant pacing and in my opinion, a poorly timed release, being Christmas Day.
","This production sure has had its ups and down. Actor Bradley Cooper was cast as real life Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who is one of the most decorated SEAL in US History with a confirmed 160 kills in the recent war as a sniper. He is responsible for saving many US soldier's lives. Shortly after Cooper signed on to star, David O'Russell ('Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle') wanted to direct, which would have made sense, because Cooper and O'Russell worked together before. But he dropped out and and Steven Spielberg signed on to direct 'American Sniper'. But yet again, Spielberg dropped out, leaving this project in limbo.<br/><br/>But in the final minute, Clint Eastwood steeped up to the plate and took the reigns. After all of these directors, I'm surprised the studio wanted to release such a heavy handed and depressing film on Christmas day, particularly when this tragedy happened only within the last year or two. If you are unfamiliar with this story or don't remember all of the news stories, after Chris Kyle served four tours overseas, fighting terrorism and saving American lives, he had a fairly rough time adjusting to civilian life. But he found a happy medium between his wife and kids and helping injured soldiers back home with therapy sessions, which he chronicled in his autobiography of the same name. During one of his sessions with an injured marine he was helping, this marine murdered him and his friend in cold blood.<br/><br/>It made national news and was a sad day indeed. One of the other big stories to come out Chris Kyle and his book was that supposedly he got into a bar fight with Jesse Ventura (yes, that Ventura), because Ventura was supposedly saying some nasty things about America and its soldiers. Ventura eventually sued Kyle and won, even after his death, which has made Ventura look like a world class asshole, but this entire storyline was completely omitted from the film, which is fine by me. Eastwood has concocted a pace very similar to the Oscar winner 'The Hurt Locker', which at times has a redundant feel. After Kyle's backstory from childhood through bootcamp, we travel with him overseas to fight in the war.<br/><br/>After each tour, Kyle comes home to be with his family, each time a little worse for the wear as his PTSD is kicking into high gear. This happens four times, which again can get pretty repetitive and dull. Pacing aside, Cooper delivers a powerful performance as Kyle. His emotional range from a regimented soldier to a chaotic mess is brilliant. Cooper proves again that he is one of the top actors working today. And Sienna Miller plays Kyle's wife very well and realistic.<br/><br/>Eastwood's direction is in perfect form here again with some very suspenseful war scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That being said, 'American Sniper' fails in its redundant pacing and in my opinion, a poorly timed release, being Christmas Day."

I genuinely found the dialogue and theme of the actions to be distasteful, racist, ignorant and on the verge of xenophobic. And all this ultimately coming from a highly accoladed director and actor Clint Eastwood, who;s future films, i have a strong desire to deliberately avoid in the future, now knowing where his political attitudes lie. I also have to say how deeply disappointed in, who is clearly a talented and intelligent actor, Bradley Cooper for even entertaining the idea of assuming such a role. In essence, if you have a mind, and wish to investigate further into the main protagonists past, and the actual lives of the people in the country where this film/story is set, i would hope that similar conclusion would be met.<br/><br/>All that being said,and sweeping all political connotations to the side, the movie does go far in accurately portraying the horrors and fears that the troops on the ground had to deal with on a daily basis, which were clearly something that is hard for the vast majority of people who have not experienced combat to remotely begin to understand.

No matter how I tried to look at it, the movie came across as enraging and highly offensive. If it was supposed to spur some ""patriotic"" sentiments, then the movie is a disaster. First, the entirety of the movie was about soldiers who only looked after themselves. Cooper's character claims that America is the best in the world but still follows the backwards thinking of ""Eye for an eye."" They also so disloyalty by shooting the man who fed them at his own dinner table and eventually decided to help them. In addition, throughout the movie, Kyle refers to the Iraqi people as savages. There is a complete lack of respect for the place they are destroying. As a person who has close Muslim friends, I find this highly offensive. Time and time again, this movie makes irresponsible choices and biased statements. I don't see how anyone can find this movie thrilling or enjoyable. If anything it was nauseating. I would have forgiven the movie if the characters turned around in the end. However, if that wasn't enough, the ending was a trap to create a biased public opinion about Kyle's death! I also understand that American Sniper can be seen as an inside look of the war zone in the Middle East. If that was the case, then the movie failed again because it only provided a sick biased look on the war. I would have respected it more if it added some other perspectives. I give American Sniper a gracious 3. While I hated it, I must take into account some of its good side and the soldiers that do risk their lives everyday, even if we don't agree with the circumstances."
"jackbanister16","7","6","18","29 January 2015"," It is the story of an American sniper.
","Quite literally. This movie doesn't get too political, so do not expect to see many questions raised about the validity of the Iraqi war. It's fine and definitely fair for people to raise questions about why Eastwood didn't go political, but the film is a biography, nothing more. <br/><br/>Eastwood follows legendary Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle from his life as a cowboy in Texas to his tours in Iraq, and all the way to his death back in the States. <br/><br/>I will state first off that the movie is technically gorgeous. The filming locations, effects, and set pieces are extraordinary. Eastwood was very meticulous in choosing what we see and do not see and showed that he can still direct an Oscar contender into his 80's. <br/><br/>You will know the scene when you see it, but the tension that is built into Chris Kyle's first sniper kill is beautifully and hauntingly well directed. Kudos to Eastwood and Cooper for making that scene movie magic. It is probably one of the best scenes out of the movie and probably out of any movie made this year. <br/><br/>Acting is very well across the board. Bradley Cooper absolutely NAILS the role. I was actually shocked when I saw Cooper on Jimmy Fallon and he didn't have the Texas accent going on. If you have seen some of Eastwood's other movies, you'll recognize some familiar faces. Sienna Miller's portrayal of the ""wife"" was pretty wooden and uninspiring, but what else can you do? The movie was more focused on the Iraqi tours than Chris' home life. Overall the acting was good where it needed to be and so-so in the roles where it didn't matter as much. <br/><br/>If there is one statement that I got from the movie, it's that our veterans come back from war with deep seeded trauma and problems. Again, Eastwood doesn't come right out and say it, but he shows the hardships and toll that the war takes on soldiers and their families. <br/><br/>The movie is well made, emotional, and intense to watch, but it does suffer from some problems. It runs just a bit too long. I enjoyed the movie, but it definitely meandered for the last 15 minutes or so. Another problem is the catalyst which got Chris Kyle to go to war.... I feel like there could have been a few more inciting moments to make Chris such a dedicated soldier, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I REALLY enjoyed this movie, but to think it's ""Best Picture"" material is a bit too much for me. Not to bring up the ""Hurt Locker,"" but I feel like that was a much better Iraq war movie. American Sniper should definitely get some Oscar nods and is well worth the time to watch, but at the end of the day it's just not Best Picture material in my book..!"

","It seems that lately there have been a lot of war movies and American Sniper is a war movie but, it is a current war movie. This is the story of the most lethal sniper in US history and a very truthful and brutal reality of what the war in the Middle East is all about. This movie was very hard to watch because we all remember 9-11 and the consequences following the attack. What we don't know is what our troops went through overseas to keep our liberty alive and well. Although I studied all of the wars in school not many folks my age know much about the wars and conflicts in the Middle East and it seems to me to be that these are the most brutal....not knowing who the enemy really is. You might be gunning down women and children who are carrying grenades and bombs to kill our troops. Snipers like Chris Kyle have the toughest job.....and they are American Heroes...have no doubt about that. Every American needs to see this movie and to have a new appreciation for our veterans and for those now serving to keep us safe."

","""American Sniper"" is, generally speaking, a decent movie. The direction is rhythmic, insistent and engaging in some scenes, while in other sections it is inexplicably anonymous and listless. The thing that puzzled me the most was the superficiality with which Eastwood tried to address some complex topics (the classic distinction between good and evil, morality, the fire guns cult among US citizens...). The director leaves some element in order to induce a reflection by the viewer. The most obvious example is the scene in which the protagonist, recovered after years of war, plays with his kid and draws a loaded gun on him and, soon after, he leaves the pistol at home, unattended. But this is still not enough. Maybe the director could tell something more, perhaps he could tell better his point of view. But perhaps it is difficult to expose yourself when you tell the story of an ""American hero""."
"greghm","5","9","31","18 January 2015"," Fair adaptation on screen of bestseller, sadly part of propaganda
","As a fan of Clint Eastwood movies as a director and actor I have been disappointed by this movie because in spite of great action and war scenes which are unusual in the director's latest production, it does not go into questioning why great warriors like Kyle think and act like this...<br/><br/>The movie is too much of the simple attitude American people have about wars, good and evil. To support the Global War on Terror that has been lasting for 13 years this message has to be repeated by numerous politicians, pundits and media propagandists. This is pretty well represented in the movie where Chris thinks that he needs to protect his country by fighting in Irak or risk that the locals might come to San Diego. It goes along with the many times heard motto ""they hate us for our freedom"". Chris thinks of himself also as a crusader and he sports tattoo with the Christian cross of the crusaders time. One has to realise that without critical thinking it is very easy to fall into this black and white analysis of the world. And sadly, very few directors have treated this subject. I can only think of Paul Greengrass in Greenzone.<br/><br/>The movie is a very good representation of the book written by Chris and for this Eastwood can take the credit for it. However it is used as a propaganda tool by being nominated at the Oscars to support questionable foreign interventions. Even though it shows the effect of war on soldiers such as wounds, death and mental illness, it only stays at the individual's level and does not mention the effect on society. It is always interesting to analyse why a specific movie is promoted at some awards ceremony; what is the message ""the system"" is trying to send to the masses?"

","The problem with biographical material is illustrated in American Sniper. There are too many facts. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is one of the finest directors, and Bradley Cooper is a great actor, and this is a good enough film. Chris Kyle was a real Navy SEAL who, in fact, holds the record for being the deadliest sniper to ever serve The United States.<br/><br/>With more than 160 confirmed kills to his credit and perhaps as many as 200 total kills, Chris Kyle's bravery and accuracy are beyond reproach, and as he told his VA shrink, he can face his God with a clear conscience. <br/><br/>The story is very matter of fact and runs through essential parts of his life as if each part of it must be told. He served four tours in Iraq, but we witness only a few of his kills. We understand his need to protect his comrades in arms, and we respect his willingness to take great personal risk in that effort. Still, there isn't enough tension in the story. ""Lone Survivor"" dealt with the same kind of material, and even though the title tells you what will happen, there is much tension in that story. <br/><br/>There are a couple of scenes where Kyle struggles with the moral question of being a sniper and having to shoot someone who poses a threat, but doesn't fit the standard profile of an enemy combatant. These add depth, but he is in and out of the theater quickly. So quickly that tension and intensity are not allowed to build. He is in mortal danger, then he is home with his family, then back in mortal danger.<br/><br/>A better script would have stayed in the intense moments and not been so concerned with the four tours. Finally, there is the problem of the ending. Incredibly, Kyle is murdered after he survives four tours in Iraq. He is murdered by a veteran, but that large, question-begging, ironic event is all-but dismissed in the film. It is a caption attached to the last scene.<br/><br/>The film is good enough. It tells a great American hero story, but there was a better story in this material. It missed for me."
"PWNYCNY","10","8","27","23 January 2015"," The battlefield is not just over there but over here too.
","This is a somber movie about a tragic story. A man, Chris Kyle, dies, tragically, after repeatedly risking his life for his country. While he is alive he is pressured by his wife who is becoming increasingly hysterical to stop going to war, which just drives him away. His job was to methodically kill the enemy, which included women and children who were combatants. That was the nature of the enemy he was fighting. At no time does Kyle derive any joy from doing his job. But he believes in what he is doing and has the full support of his commanders who acknowledge his bravery. Of course, the question is: who exactly are the Americans fighting? And should they even be there? Interestingly, in the movie, Kyle is not the only sniper. The insurgents have a sniper too and he is looking for Kyle. It's too bad that the movie does not tell the audience more about the other sniper, who is fighting his own war. But this movie is not about snipers. It's about fear and terror. Kyle is not the only victim. His wife and children are victims too. While he is fighting the war overseas she is fighting the war at home. Thus, the terror is compounded. The war becomes this monstrous entity that engulfs all who are involved in it. And what makes the story even more tragic is that the battlefield is not just over there but over here too. Bradley Cooper delivers what is probably the strongest performance of his career. That alone makes the movie worth watching."

","You know, the reason people slam this movie is the same reason it is very well done: it makes you FEEL things you don't want to feel.<br/><br/>For example, you can be one of the strongest advocates for animal rights on the planet, but if you're watching ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and you see that rabid dog staggering down the street towards Atticus and his family, you would have pulled the trigger. Absolutely.<br/><br/>I have never been in a war situation but my ancestors certainly were. From what I've learned is that when you are, those people that you sleep/eat/fight with are your FAMILY. You have their back and they have yours. You are alive because of them and visa versa. <br/><br/>No one knows the atrocities our relatives faced when in that situation, although we've all heard the horror stories. The term ""War is HELL"" came from somewhere, now didn't it? Your grandfather or great- grandfather (if involved with any war on any level), more than likely did some things they are not very proud of, nor are they spoken about. Just watch one of those documentaries about WWII where the cameraman is sitting in the plane that is dropping mortars and/or shooting up some farmhouse out in the boonies. Because they weren't exactly accurate shots from a mile or so altitude, poor old Gerta was just out milking the cow and was blown away because someone overshot their target. Watch Mrs. Minerva. <br/><br/>What this movie did was anger people that, under normal circumstances, would never even dream of hurting a child. But in one split second you go from saying, ""OMG! That's a little kid!"" to ""SHOOT HIM! PULL THE TRIGGER!"" because in one split second that ""little kid"" becomes an assassin, or a murderer, hell bent to kill your family. Same thing with the woman dressed as a nun. The sniper did not want to needlessly kill innocent people, but as a soldier, he was expected to play the part of God and make those decisions, otherwise known as doing his ""job."" That's what he was trained to do and paid to do. <br/><br/>The sniper in this film was doing what anyone under the same circumstances would do: PROTECTING HIS FAMILY. Was he any different than Atticus? Can you honestly say you wouldn't react/act in the same manner if you saw anything or anyone threatening YOUR family-- regardless if it was a rabid dog, someone dressed as a nun or a little kid? <br/><br/>If you didn't ""get"" this aspect of the movie that's okay. Respect it for what it is--a depiction of some really nasty stuff that happens when you're involved with war. There may have been some poetic license involved, but it's a MOVIE. It happens. <br/><br/>Could it have been done better? Maybe. Was the doll used for the baby cheesy? Definitely. Did I ""like"" the movie? No. But it was well done and I have voted on that aspect of it because it did what it was supposed to do: it made me FEEL. I was pulling that trigger, too. I was protecting my family. <br/><br/>It may have made you realize that there may be some nastiness lurking underneath your own surface. Maybe that's why it's so disturbing. Maybe that's why it's so good. <br/><br/>Kudos to those involved (except for the cheesy plastic doll)."

","American Sniper is the movie that should not have existed. Even though the book was a bestseller, nobody in Hollywood wanted the rights. <br/><br/>And why would they? <br/><br/>The Iraq War already had an official narrative in Hollywood. It was bad and wrong. Its veterans were crippled, dysfunctional and dangerous.Before American Sniper, Warner Brothers had gone with anti- war flicks like Body of Lies and In the Valley of Elah. It had lost a fortune on Body of Lies; but losing money had never stopped Hollywood from making anti-war movies that no one wanted to watch.<br/><br/>Even the Hurt Locker had opened with a quote from leftist terrorist supporter Chris Hedges.<br/><br/>An Iraq War movie was supposed to be an anti-war movie. There was no other way to tell the story. Spielberg's own interest in American Sniper was focused on ""humanizing"" the other side. When he left and Clint Eastwood, coming off a series of failed films, took the helm, it was assumed that American Sniper would briefly show up in theaters and then go off to die quietly in what was left of the DVD aisle.<br/><br/>And then American Sniper broke box office records that had been set by blockbusters like Avatar, Passion and Hangover Part II by refusing to demonize American soldiers or to spin conspiracy tales about the war. Instead of pandering to coastal progressives, it aimed at the patriotic heartland.<br/><br/>In a sentence you no longer expected to hear from a Hollywood exec, the Warner Brothers distribution chief said, ""This is about patriotism and all the things people say the country is lacking these days.""<br/><br/>The backlash to that patriotism and the things the country is lacking these days didn't take very long to form and it goes a lot deeper than snide tweets from Michael Moore and Seth Rogen. Academy members were reportedly passing around an article from the New Republic, whose author had not actually seen the movie, but still denounced it for not showing Chris Kyle as a bigoted murderer.<br/><br/>Hollywood progressives are both threatened and angered by American Sniper.

","I read tons of reviews for and against this film before finally watching it myself. Let me start off by saying I would consider myself liberal, who is against capital punishment, and for gun control. However I am equally against torture, government secrecy, and immunity from punishment for starting unprecedential war. I am also for freedom of speech, and advocate a presidential pardon for Chelsea Manning, Assange, and Snowden and any whistle-blowers that help keep government on it's toes. Regardless, and despite the fact that I'm not even a fan of Bradley Cooper, ""American Sniper"" is a great film! Personally I don't feel this film is about any particular issue. Lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction etc. is irrelevant in this story.<br/><br/>This is a movie about one man's story, and some of what he experienced. He is neither the good or the bad guy, and even the ""enemy"" is not only ""bad"". I am truly amazed how many people on the left or the right are using this guy's story as some kind of political angle. Sure there is some ""American Pride"" behind the intentions of Chris Kyle going into battle, but those who think he's a hero because he was protecting US citizens are sadly mistaken. He was nothing more than an honorable man doing his job, and protecting fellow soldiers as best he could in a dirty war that costs thousands of lives where both sides believe they are in the right. It's not even about religion, and it's not even about murder, although eliminating threat to his fellow man was his job, and he was good at it, and took pride in it, as anyone who is good with their skills would be. Whether they are an actor, lawyer, doctor, musician, architect, what have you. Some people also tend to get a little arrogant if they let their accolades go to their head. From what I've read about Mr. Kyle that may have been the case, but I think he also turned towards being a positive role model, and was probably a fairly sane individual despite all he'd experienced. <br/><br/>That's all this film is about, it's called ""American Sniper"" because that's what this guy was which is just as ""American"" as an American Psycho or America's Top Model. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's film is not propaganda. It is a story well told, and filmed in a way that takes the audience on a partial journey into the world and life of this man. Now that I have finally seen it, I think that Million Dollar Baby, and Gran Torino can take second and third place behind this new top film in Clint's directing highlights. ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" was also not ""pro-war"", and neither is this movie.<br/><br/>If anything it's a great thing that many people of different walks of like are seeing a film like this, and it is opening the eyes of the average world citizen as to what is going on ""over there"" as we tend to try and shut out all the deaths caused by war in our daily lives. <br/><br/>There are many bold statements made in subtle ways in this movie such as Chris' frustration about ""going to a shopping mall, while soldiers are dying, and horrible things are happening in another part of the world"" as he states just before his wife gives birth. <br/><br/>Pause for thought, and discuss what this means to you as an average citizen going about your daily routine, free from fear, free to go shopping without getting bombed. <br/><br/>In the end this is not a movie for the Republicans, Democrats, Lefties, or Nazis. It is a movie for anyone who wants to have a better understanding what soldiers do, and what we in the Western Society are doing to ourselves when we argue about who is allowed to do what in a ""free"" society. This film does not glorify war, or killing other human beings whether Chris considers them ""savages"" is not the point. <br/><br/>The fact that Chris was killed by another soldier while planning to help with therapeutic training is not poetic justice, it only adds to the tragedy of what happens when a human mind is broken, and we callously avoid doing something about this problem. Especially when we think having a gun is the solution.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wonder if the people who see this as propaganda have even watched the movie, or only read the title, viewed the trailer, and gone straight to IMDb to condemn it. And for those who cheer on the killing in the film, I can only feel sorrow. <br/><br/>Realize that Clint Eastwood has a pattern for making contemplative melancholy films including even the one about J. Edgar Hoover, then you know this is not a movie to rally together and sing ""We Are The Champions"" to. 'Nuff said."

But in my mind this movie is not about any political issues. <br/><br/>I liked this movie because it's a very well made biopic of an American guy who, for some reason, made a choice to join the war and his struggle in dealing with his choice. A struggle that most of us are probably unfamiliar with but which apparently should be very familiar to a lot of men who made the same choice of becoming a soldier. Especially the way the movie pictures his struggle in dealing with the difference in fighting and killing in Iraq and then returning home and having to be a normal father again in a surreal peaceful world, is very impressive.<br/><br/>You could probably make exactly the same kind of movie about an Iraqi sniper!"

This movie is, essentially, a societal statement that Thou Shalt Not Kill is not a commandment, and should be seen a more of a joke. It is better to be proud of killing, to enjoy killing, than to be proud to value the lives of anyone labeled an 'enemy.'

","(Pulls up an empty chair, speaks to an imaginary figure there) Dear Mr Eastwood, We don't know each other, we have never met and it's highly unlikely we ever will. I'm writing to say, I like your movies. In fact, a few of them are among the finest movies ever made. 'Unforgiven', 'Play Misty for me', 'Magnum Force' to name but the first few that come to mind - oh, the memories, oh the skill. Thank you for them all sir.<br/><br/>I just saw your latest 'American Sniper'. Good choice in Bradley Cooper. He does a great job even if he seems to have based his portrayal of Chris Kyle on the youtube clown 'Mumbles' because it's almost impossible to understand what Cooper flub-bubs his way through for 90% of the film. However, that may also be attributable to what I think even you know Mr Eastwood was a weak and much too MUCH gung-ho script. Hats off though to Tom Stern for some really great cinematography.<br/><br/>Sienna Miller - no. Don't, OK? Don't. Not your smartest choice.<br/><br/>On to the film. There's an old John Wayne movie, 'The Green Berets' - you are sure to have seen it Mr Eastwood. It's one of the earliest attempts to portray what life was like for the average soldier in Vietnam. This was made long before the true darkness of Vietnam was revealed to us all via the first hand accounts of those who were there, as well as through films such as 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Full Metal Jacket' to name but a few. In Green Berets, the Viet Cong are portrayed as fanatical, do-or-die, indoctrinated insurgents who almost cheerfully run headlong into the line of fire of American bullets, and where every one of those bullets seems to take down 15 VC at a time while their own bullets seem to whistle past the American forces, never striking GI Joe even once. Your film 'American Sniper' showed us the same thing. Turn any corner in Iraq, and it seems there's someone openly carrying a weapon and who is intent on making sure everyone knows it too. That good men do bad things in times of war is a given. The reasons why people who have seen their homeland illegally invaded and their loved ones dead in pools of blood because of that invasion should choose to do bad things by defending themselves was never addressed even once. It's almost like this film chose to ignore what we have all seen, read and learned about war. For you Mr Eastwood, there is no cultural cross fertilization, no understanding, no reflection upon such grave matters. You need to think hard about why that did not happen in your movie Mr Eastwood. You really do.<br/><br/>What I found more offensive, however, was the awful dichromatic version of historical events this film chooses to portray. White skin equals 'Good, right, free, logical'. Brown skin equals 'despicable, duplicitous, savage, barbaric'. Surely to all that is known we know enough that such a division is not only wholly erroneous in the extreme but does great harm in a world already divided along social, political and economic lines - never mind racial and/or religious ones. Again, think hard about that Mr Eastwood. You have let us all down by choosing to be so racially divisive in such a clownish way but, most of all, you let yourself down. At your age, and after all you have seen people achieve in trying to bridge the racial divide in your own country, surely such a poor representation of human diversity as you display in your film serves only to take us all backwards and not forwards toward comprehension and inclusion. <br/><br/>All nations need a Chris Kyle and his like. In times of peace, they end up in jail, locked up for life because of their psychopathic behavior and inability to deal with reality (Let's not forget, Kyle was proved in court, not just once but several times, to be a liar). However, in times of war, men like Kyle get sent out to kill under a banner of 'right and just', get medals put on their chest after they kill and acquire the sobriquet of 'Legend'. Mr Eastwood, your film would have been much better had you focused on the former rather than the latter of these two scenarios.<br/><br/>I gave this film a rating of 6 out of 10. That's because of Bradley Cooper's performance. He did the best he could do, in spite of being saddled with a bad script. Mr Eastwood, I give you a 2 out of 10 and a 'must try harder'. Please don't choose to go down this same road again."

","It is difficult to suspend expectations when you are facing a story inspired by the memoires. Even though a movie is a work of cinematographic art (and Eastwood excels at that, whether as an actor or as director), it is difficult to bypass a story that lacks depth and labels participants narrower than a Steven Seagal movie.<br/><br/>The story is simple, American soldier follows orders, goes to Iraq, kills people he labels as evil and returns home traumatized that he couldn't kill more (and save his mates).<br/><br/>Cooper is a good actor and he may be compelling in this part save for the fact that it's truly hard to empathize with his suffering. He travels oceans and continents to the far side of the world to impart death and destruction motivated by a natural need to overcome terrorism (the long defunct thesis that somehow Iraq had something to do with terrorism or WMDs, something dismissed even by the Congress) and everyone found there is 'evil' and somehow deserving of death.<br/><br/>It's difficult to find something to like in the portrayal of an invader and impossible not to root for those invaded and labeling the fight against the invader as anything but a fight for freedom (I would say war and describe the conflict as the White House does in press, save for the fact that nobody seems to abide by the Geneva convention).<br/><br/>I truly wish I could move beyond the details of the reality that brewed this story, but as the story itself wants to appear grounded in reality while ignoring the higher reasons for the events, I cannot. Nobody lingers over justification, we are good, they are evil and must be killed. Soldiers need to invade foreign countries while staying safe at the same time (pardon me, but isn't a soldier's job to risk their life? why lament over it instead of honoring the task when done in good faith?).<br/><br/>Overall the movie is an insult to the victims of the US invasion of Iraq and this general feeling manages to tarnish any artistic value."

","In recent years, there is at least one war movie set in the Middle East that catches Oscars' attention. There was ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" and ""Lone Survivor."" This year, it is ""American Sniper,"" which is nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture.<br/><br/>The title refers to Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), a real-life Navy Seal who served during the war against Iraq from 2003-2009. He was a Texan cowboy who decided he wanted to do more for his country as a soldier. During his training, it is discovered that he has a particular talent for being a sniper. He subsequently had four tours of duty in six years, notoriously credited with a record 160 confirmed kills (probably even more in reality). On the other end, he was neglecting his young family Stateside -- his wife Taya (Sienna Miller) and his kids. An injury in his last mission led to his forced retirement. He realizes he cannot get back to living a normal life anymore.<br/><br/>Director Clint Eastwood had directed introspective war films before, the lyrical ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" (2006) being a personal favorite. Being a Eastwood movie, the story of ""American Sniper"" (based on Chris Kyle's own memoirs) was told in a very straight-forward manner, not too much cinematic excess. The war scenes in this film are very well-shot, with excellent editing and sound mixing. It does not shirk from the violence, but there was no overkill on the gore. The climactic sniper scene (a spectacular 2,100 yard kill) and its dusty aftermath is really a memorable one, very exciting and exhilarating in execution. <br/><br/>The last thirty minutes or so dealing with Kyle's post-traumatic stress disorder were very touching. This is where Bradley Cooper best displays the acting chops which earned him his nominations for Best Actor from various award-giving bodies, Oscar included. This is already Cooper's third Oscar nomination in a row after ""Silver Lining Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"". Aside from the fact that Cooper absolutely dominates this film with his nuanced performance, the patriotic fervor inspired by this film may also work in his favor.<br/><br/>With the title alone, expect to watch a very American film -- a movie clearly made for its flag, country and ideals. While it has been accused of being pro-war propaganda, you will actually pick up Clint Eastwood's anti-war sentiments along the way. (Oh, you will notice something odd about Chris and Taya's baby, but don't let it bother you too much.) 8/10."

","2014 has been a rather mediocre year for big-budget war movies. Fury was an entertaining if undercooked WWII actioner, and Unbroken, while being triumphant and well-made in most aspects, was very much a crowdpleaser, nothing more. Enter the latest this year has to offer, American Sniper.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's action biopic is an unflinching, unnerving look at the Iraq War through the lens of one deadly sniper; in fact, America's deadliest sharpshooter in history. Chris Kyle is portrayed by Bradley Cooper, who has shown a wide range of talents in the past five years, but never has he pushed himself this far. Bradley Cooper is almost unrecognizable as he becomes the blindly patriotic Navy SEAL who is willing to give all of himself to his country.<br/><br/>American Sniper is not so much a focus on the Iraq war as it is the story of a man destroyed by war. It is nothing unique in its perspective, but it's told with such precision and nuance, its hard not to be enraptured by the nature of the film. Chris Kyle- and the audience- sits at a distance, watching Americans and Iraqis get blown away, making judgments before he knows whether to fire the shot. American Sniper is a graphic movie, unafraid to show us the violence, to make us hear it, and to remind us of it when Chris returns from tour.<br/><br/>Despite crisp direction from Eastwood, the film does seem a little afraid in its depiction of American soldiers in the Middle East, taking a neutral position. Many times Iraqis are passively referred to as ""savages"", which seems rather inhumane, but having friends in the Army now, I know that the language gets worse than this. On one or two occasions, soldiers are heard muttering for the deaths of the men shooting at them, but when the shooting stops, many of these soldiers, except for Chris Kyle, are left wondering why they're even fighting. It suggests greater ideas like this, but never really delves into them. For example; in one scene, Chris Kyle's wife asks him, ""Do you ever stop to think there's a person on the other side of that trigger?"", an issue that is never explored again in the film. Nearly all of the Iraqis depicted are terrorists, but with the soldiers breaking in to ten homes an hour in one sequence, they are bound to have run into regular civilians, but the story isn't interested at all in this. I wouldn't say it's a flaw, so much as a missed opportunity to demonstrate the intricacies complexities of a confused and frustrating war.<br/><br/>The movie does face a few flaws, however. One particular Iraqi, also an expert marksman, is talked about much of the movie, doesn't say anything, and is always receiving phone calls about the whereabouts of U.S. troops. As soon as he hangs up the phone, the villain music comes in, and he sets up his weapon, waiting to ambush incoming Americans. After awhile, his character seems more cinematic than real.<br/><br/>Another character I had a problem with was Taya, Chris Kyle's wife. Despite Sienna Miller giving a strong, albeit a bit trying performance, Taya comes off as relentlessly nagging. Every time she sees Chris, he is more machine than he is man, but Taya longs for the man. She does not seem to be all too sympathetic to the pain he's suffered, to the things he's seen. She wants him to talk about it, but why? What does that solve? There is enough complaining from her for this to become a bit of a weakness in an otherwise solid movie.<br/><br/>My last issue is with the ending. Though the film does come full circle, I didn't see its arc fully realized until after the credits rolled. It feels short a scene or two and therefore, lacks proper closure. I respect Clint Eastwood's decision not to recreate the text that succeeds the final scene, but perhaps the movie's third act needed a bit more character development and underscoring of its themes to leave off where it does. Still, the rest of the movie pretty much hits the mark, so its hard to be too disappointed by its ending.<br/><br/>American Sniper is not a perfect war movie, hindered some by its single- character perspective, but it is a great and disturbing biopic portraying a man traumatized by the war in the desert and the war in his head. It is rather unsettling to watch for its graphic violence and coarse language, but plays things safe when it comes to the concepts that are raised. It's not as ambitious as The Hurt Locker was years ago, but it's the best Iraq war movie since, and without a doubt, the best war movie of 2014.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","""American Sniper"" is an auto-biographical film about the life of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper (also a co-producer) and Directed by Clint Eastwood (also a co-producer). Kyle was proclaimed the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, having accumulated 160 confirmed kills out of 255 probable kills. The movie traces Kyle's life from his childhood in Texas, to meeting and marrying his wife Taya, played by Sienna Miller, and the birth, & moments of their marriage & 2 children, to his military service following 9/11. The movie portrays Kyle's father teaching him to be one to protect others. This theme plays throughout the film – specifically in Kyle's military service, in that prior to going home for good, he is motivated to finish the task of taking out an enemy sniper, possibly at the expense of the relationship with his wife and children. In short, I thought the movie was great. In earlier parts of the film, I though some of the Dialogue needed improvement, but following that, I have little complaint. I found Cooper's performance very effective. Maybe there could have been one or two heavy Dialogue scenes from his character to add more gravitas to the performance, but perhaps that was just the way the real life Kyle's personality was – And this would be more of reflection on the writing and other aspects of the movie, not Cooper's performance. If you read about the real life Kyle, he seemed to be a very complex individual, and some of his views may not totally vibe with many, including myself, but I feel this should not detract from his service, and certainly not from Cooper's performance in the movie. Sienna Miller I thought was also very effective as Taya, Kyle's wife – who sees that her husband's military experiences are changing him, and simply wants him home. In the end – the movie keeps you engaged and is very entertaining – 3 ½ out of 4 Stars – 9 out of 10."
"danthings","4","8","29","29 January 2015"," A huge let down
","I can put aside that they chose to allude to 9/11 being the cause of the the Iraq War--which is patently false, Iraq had nothing to do with the Twin Towers attack, yet there we see the towers going down and two scenes later the boys are called up to go fight.<br/><br/>I can also put aside the fact that the real Chris Kyle was been proved to liar in many of the stories in his book, even losing a lawsuit brought by Jesse Ventura, turns out Kyle totally made his story about punching him out up.<br/><br/>But what I can't put aside, is even if you look at this as a fictional movie, that it's so poorly done. I should point out I like war movies, I've seen most of them from the old classics to the modern era, and American Sniper was completely underwhelming. The war and fight scenes weren't as intense as Hurt Locker, Lone Survivor or Black Hawk Down, the tension with tracking down the other sniper wasn't built up at all (like say with Zero Dark Thirty), and the character development and story depth was nothing close to Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. I love a good shoot 'em up war movie and I love a movie that looks into the psychological effects of war on soldiers, but American Sniper just seemed weak in it's attempts at both. Want a realistic depiction of modern warfare? Watch the Generation Kill series, it's brilliant. Or watch any of the other movies I've mentioned, they are all better than American Sniper. It baffles me the ratings and success such a sub-par war movie is getting. That said, Bradly Cooper did the best he could with the script and direction, but this could have been such a better movie. And the ending was a total cop out."

","The camera is on the sniper and he is following a woman in one direction. The camera shows the weapon's display and shows it moving in another. The gun sights and binoculars look like they were drawn on MS Paint. There's one gunman at some point holding a gun wobbling but the camera showing the sights shows them perfectly stable. At one moment he is holding his baby son which is clearly a toy baby. He kills a man with a shot 2km away without even seeing him (at least the cameras show he can not see anything). Ridiculous movie. Besides all these technical mistakes, which are not admissible in a war movie, it was, at most, OK. For the first time in my life I wanted to ask for my money back."

"jdkraus","6","9","34","10 January 2015"," Cooper's performance is the glue that keeps American Sniper together
","""American Sniper"" is a movie that can be very easily interpreted as American propaganda. The use of the word ""American"" in the film's title is enough for some to make this claim. The motto ""God, country, and family"" rings true to mind in what this film depicts. In actuality though, ""American Sniper"" is a feature that takes a patriotic individual, hoists him up as a legend and then brings him back down to the harsh level of a haunted soul. Clint Eastwood is a master director who knows how to show the flawed and imperfect nature of humanity. Just watch ""Unforgiven,"" ""Mystic River,"" and ""Letters of Iwo Jima."" <br/><br/>With US Seal Sniper Chris Kyle, he is portrayed as an unsophisticated character. From youth, we get to see his life grow from a god-fearing hunter who dreams of being a cowboy to the deadliest sniper in American history. In response to 9/11, just like many American men and women, he enlists in the Navy to serve his country. We watch as he endures four tours of active duty in Iraq and tries to readjust in the safe confines of suburban America. Writer Jason Hall molds him as a sympathetic and likable person, whom is determined to eliminate the enemy and protect his home. <br/><br/>It is Bradley Cooper's deeply expressive performance that captures the essence of this simple yet larger-than-life person. As an actor, Cooper has acquired a power to display in both voice and face great emotion. Without him even uttering a word, we can comprehend the thoughts going on in his head. His performance is nothing short of deserving an Oscar nomination. Clint Eastwood smartly keeps the camera on him for the majority of the film, allowing the audience to empathize and understand his character. He also gives us a parched, desolate, desert landscape plagued by violence and cruelty. The amount of dedication in the cinematography and production design give viewers a gritty look of Iraq, which rivals Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker."" The war sequences are quite brutal and intense. The final action scene alone is truly marvelous as a sandstorm blankets the battle-stricken Baghdad.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" unfortunately falls short on many other aspects, dragging what could have been a great movie down to mediocrity. While the focus is on Kyle, other parts of his life are introduced and then just as quickly dismissed. We get to see his younger brother join up the marines and then we never see him again. Likewise, the relationship between his strict father takes precedent in the first ten-minutes, and yet it goes nowhere afterwards. His war buddies appear, disappear, and then reappear usually for a plot device. As a viewer, we barely get a chance to know them like Kyle. When they are killed off, we really do not feel any emotional engagement or loss. The added subplot of a Middle Eastern sniper targeting US Soldiers feels clichéd and a poor attempt to draw a main antagonist for the lead character. Even the relationship between Kyle and his wife is limited in time. We are left with following a great American patriot consumed with torment. The frequent jumps between war and home grows old very quickly. An entire movie could have been just based upon one of Kyle's tours and it would feel like a more completed film. <br/><br/>In short, this movie left me wanting more than the 132-minutes had to offer. That is the sad problem with most biographical films. They are spread so thin that they actually show too little in too much time. I'm probably in the minority on this one, but ""American Sniper"" is a slightly above average film, and that is mainly because of Bradley Cooper's performance. I wanted to love this, but I cannot. Regardless, I still appreciate the people who brought Chris Kyle's story back to life."

","American Sniper (2014)<br/><br/>1) For those familiar with the military culture in the U.S. this will offer some familiar insights into how families deal with their servicemen overseas.<br/><br/>2) For those who know the war in Iraq either directly or through the movies, this will add to a series of rather good movies (though only movies, to be sure) about that tense conflict. It doesn't have the depth of ""The Hurt Locker"" and others, but it's well done, and has real impact.<br/><br/>3) For the idea of a sniper, the adulated and reviled rifleman who picks people off on the edges of battle, this movie goes far, and this is probably the unique contribution of the film.<br/><br/>4) As a movie, as a construction of scenes and flow of narrative ideas, it's good, very good, but nothing beyond the normally well made movies that Clint Eastwood (the director) and many others with professional backing manage to pull off. It's not easy, but it's stuck a bit in its methods, the movie-making protocols.<br/><br/>I number these because everyone has strong opinions about the content of this movie (and to an extent the director with his well known conservative politics). I don't know what to make of it in a larger context because I'm not an Eastwood fan outside of his movies, and I'm not in favor of what happened in Iraq. Politically. However, once you send our young men and women into a war zone, you have to understand the war for what it is, not for what it might have been if it wasn't. Obviously.<br/><br/>The revelation of this movie is that it makes clear what it is to be in this troubled situation EVEN IF you were all for it. The leading character, the sniper, played with astonishing realism by Bradley Cooper, has to be all kinds of things to satisfy himself. This is a movie about a man who has something to prove, but also a duty to perform. His personal life, his marriage, his role as a father, is all compromised by this duty to do something he thinks he has to. And he does extremely well.<br/><br/>Whatever you think of the politics (or whatever you call them) that go with the release of the movie, it's still a really conventional story, well told. There are no creative leaps, no unexpected insights, nothing to make it go outside that old box people talk about. So enjoy it for what is is, thoroughly. A pleasant experience."
"diomavro","6","6","20","28 February 2015"," One of the better biographical movies out there
","Now I quite enjoyed this movie I would have given it an 8 but I thought the fact that Clint Eastwood used very obvious fake babies was too much, completely ruined the immersion for me, though this is not the only reason.<br/><br/>Plot: I don't spoil movies for myself so I had no idea about the buzz that you see in the media which spoils it for you. That said the presentation of the Al Qaeda make it all too obvious who would be taken out, it would have been much more interesting to have a briefing about 10-12 Al Qaeda leaders and then show some of them being taken out. I thought there were some pacing issues, too much back and forth between home and Iraq, some of it would have been better off if it was blended because there is a little bit too much repetition this way. It is an emotional issue but a director with a little bit more rigor would have shown us the last scene(instead of just texting it to us), that had potential for groovy empty feeling. <br/><br/>Directing: Clint Eastwood can't get off the wide shots sometimes, there are many cases where he sets up a good wide angle and then just leaves it at that which doesn't help the viewer associate with the characters. Smarter camera work would have helped us feel the casualties as a greater loss. <br/><br/>Acting: All around okay, nothing noticeably terrible I think but nothing off the charts either. <br/><br/>I don't know what people are so riled up about, this movie isn't about politics, its about a guy, I thought as far as telling the story well they did right by their politics. I'm sure plenty of pro war people watch the anti war films and love them but now that there's a more pro war movie it seems leftists don't show the same open mindedness."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","6","20","8 February 2015"," Well made, quintessential 21st century war film that doesn't go deep enough
","Stories of American soldiers — their bravery in the field, their struggles to return to civilian life — have been well documented by Hollywood. The first thing to think about, therefore, is what makes each a necessary or unique story to tell. ""American Sniper"" tells of the life and years of service of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL sniper who killed more enemies than any soldier in U.S. military history during his four tours in Iraq.<br/><br/>Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was a Texas cowboy who at the age of 25 felt he could be of value serving his country and became a Navy SEAL. While in Iraq, Kyle was primarily tasked with protecting ground units from threats they couldn't see, meaning many of the people he killed were in a position to take the lives of American soldiers. Before he finally finished serving, his reputation as a legend proceeded him.<br/><br/>That, in essence, is what makes ""American Sniper"" different from other 21st century war films. The other elements of his story make him just another soldier: a man who was willing to put his life on the line for his country, left his wife (Sienna Miller) and two kids for months on end to do it and wrestled with the side effects of post-traumatic stress disorder when he was home and after he quit. The film soundly and movingly depicts the life of this consummate soldier, but it glosses over the story's defining characteristic — that its main character is both a beloved hero and an elite killer.<br/><br/>As a blue-blooded patriot, Clint Eastwood is both the perfect and maybe even the wrong choice for this film. Eastwood certainly shows us why he's been a good director for so long, in some ways reminding us after his recent string of critical duds. Yet he (and admittedly screenwriter Jason Hall, who adapted Kyle's memoir) evades a certain level of depth when it comes to the themes and issues this story presents. The film doesn't ignore PTSD and the hurtful effects that military life can have on a family, nor does it silence the point of view that war, specifically Operation Iraqi Freedom, is inherently controversial, but it does limit their influence on the film's message.<br/><br/>Hall's screenplay walks the line when it comes to opinions on war. Put a Southern, conservative, God-fearing patriot in the same theater as an urban, liberal, agnostic and one might tell you ""American Sniper"" is an amazing, truly American film that honors those who rid the world of evil to keep America safe, while the other might say it casts an uncomfortable shadow of doubt over war as it relates to American values. A third person might even tell you it's nothing short of propaganda. <br/><br/>Although it doesn't pick sides on war, ""American Sniper"" does choose to portray Chris Kyle as a hero, and therein lies the controversy. Not that Kyle wasn't a brave and good person, but that he's a hero for his actions. On one hand, while working closely with Kyle, his friends and family, filmmakers do not want to create something that would in any way be disrespectful to them. On the other, certain aspects of his story are conspicuously under-developed, with the emphasis on the action and suspense of the military action he saw.<br/><br/>To avoid delving too far into it, I'll simply say that never before has a movie's credits sequence informed its message to the extent that ""American Sniper's"" does. It honestly complicates the movie, what the takeaways are supposed to be, and highlights a lot of the gaps in the storytelling, primarily how what we see in the Iraq scenes translates into the ""legend"" of Chris Kyle at home. The script merely hopes that lots of characters telling Kyle how they've heard this and that about him will convey the truth of it to the audience. Nothing that we see truly confirms how incredible of a soldier Kyle was.<br/><br/>To go back to the surface layers, ""American Sniper"" holds interest and suspense extremely well. Eastwood's technique doesn't compare with the way Kathryn Bigelow powerfully portrayed soldiers in the Middle East in ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" but the level of intensity in both the action sequences and in the way Kyle struggles at home exhibit excellent craftsmanship. And neither is it dumbed down — Hall creates some sharp dialogue and plenty of humanizing, touching moments. <br/><br/>Cooper is probably the best thing about the movie. Sporting a legit Texas accent and bulking up to look almost exactly like Kyle, he definitely shows his versatility. Most of his previous roles have showcased charm or paranoia; here he plays a realistic, humble action hero of sorts. In the non-action scenes, he could colors the Texan stereotypes with a complex psychological portrait.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" captures the essence of the contemporary war story in a way that allows contrary opinions to coexist, but it doesn't answer the question, ""why Chris Kyle?"" His story is compelling, probably more compelling than most, but ""American Sniper"" doesn't feel like the story of ""the deadliest sniper in U.S. history"" so much as the story of ""a dedicated, courageous soldier who happens to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history.""<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Bradley Cooper certainly demonstrates his tremendous talent in this well produced but somewhat lamely directed/scripted film. Unfortunately, some of Eastwood's choices left me feeling disappointed. <br/><br/>Reducing the Iraqis to cardboard cut-outs, reminiscent of a Rambo movie, might be Eastwood's attempt to reflect Kyle's attitude, arguably a product of his training or perhaps his way of dealing with having to slaughter people - but I don't think it makes for good storytelling. Totally unsympathetic villains simply don't work in an otherwise complex story.<br/><br/>I've read a number of critics' interpretations of the final sequence involving Kyle pointing a gun at his wife - both pro-gun and anti-gun as well as anti-war. I just found it terribly out of character for Kyle, a man who certainly loved guns - but certainly treated them with care and respect. Whatever point Eastwood is making, I found it jolting and dumb.

I felt the editing really let the movie down, his tour's of duty came and went too quickly, the way his psychological state was deteriorating just didn't correlate to the ground action he was experiencing. The Hurt Locker did a much better job of capturing that raw emotion and intensity. The movie should have aimed to hit us more on an emotional level, we should have walked out of the cinema feeling that war is a terrible place, it should have made us sympathize with veterans coping with post traumatic stress.

"jmoneysomuchcash","5","7","25","26 January 2015"," American Sniper is a Film About War that Says Nothing About War
","American Sniper might not be a bad film, but I would absolutely not call it a good one. This film suffered from a lack of identity. I have no problem with a pro-war film or an anti-war film, even an ambiguous film, but this film didn't pull particularly in any direction. There are scenes setting up the theme of post traumatic stress disorder, there are scenes which function as action sequences, there are scenes meant to build characters, but nothing ever comes out of any of them. This film should've decided whether it wanted to be ""The Hurt Locker"" or ""Black Hawk Down"", instead of being inferior to both as a result of trying to be both. Scenes at home display our main character easily snapping to violence and making his family afraid, but scenes at war feature pounding Hollywood music and slow motion effects to show a bullet fly into the head of an enemy sniper. It all feels disingenuous.<br/><br/>On top of the tonal confusion, this film features glaring inaccuracies to the actual story of Chris Kyle, which I would be fine with if they served to make the film more interesting, but they actually do the exact opposite. The film features an enemy sniper who Chris does battle with named Mustafa (although Chris never actually encountered Mustafa in real life), who is set up to be the exact same person as Chris himself, only fighting for the opposite side. This could've set up an interesting theme of Chris confronting whether his actions are truly right, and whether he is so different from the men on the other end of his gun, but this fictional Mustafa only exists as a bad guy for Chris to fight. Another far worse example is ""The Butcher"", a completely fictional Iraqi warlord who tortures children with a power drill in front of their families and is an implied cannibal with a freezer full of human meat. No real human being acts this way. This character is straight out of Dexter. The film also glosses over many of Chris Kyle's uglier qualities in order to paint him as a nobler man than he really was. The themes it presents about war's ugliness and its effects on the human mind would've been much stronger if the film wasn't so beholden to Kyle.<br/><br/>The film presents the main character calling Muslims ""savages"" and ""bad guys"" free of any commentary (incidentally, it is well documented that the real Chris Kyle said much worse things about Muslims). Moral grays and actual dilemmas are far away from this film's mindset. Chris Kyle himself says that he regrets not a single one of his 160 kills to a psychologist, and the film neither agrees nor disagrees. Leaving a question deliberately unanswered is fine, but the film still must ask it. The editing does its job, but the film is in such a hurry to get to the next scene (whatever it may be) that it skips over any real examination or development of the themes it presents. The ending in particular, which I will leave unspoiled, is a giant slap in the face. The film also paradoxically doesn't function well as an action movie because its action scenes aren't particularly creative, exciting, or frequent.<br/><br/>There are no other characters to speak of except for Kyle. His wife is left to portray whatever female stereotype is appropriate at the time. His son is completely ignored by the film, but not in a way that seems deliberate or says anything about the main character. There is only one non- villain Iraqi character who gets merely 10 lines of dialogue before he is killed by ""The Butcher"". <br/><br/>The film is also shockingly cheap-looking. Digital blood squibs are not, and have never been convincing. The aforementioned slow motion sequence was clearly not shot with slow motion cameras, and so it looks like a skipping DVD. The CGI bullet which has no physical presence also gives me the impression that the scene fell flat in the editing bay and so slow motion was added. The wife's pregnant belly looks incredibly fake, and of course there is the now-infamous fake baby scene, which is hilarious because it would not have been even remotely hard to find a real baby and get it to be quiet for a scene that lasts one minute. Clint Eastwood has been directing films for 30 years. He should know better.<br/><br/>American Sniper features an incredible performance by Bradley Cooper and several great scenes, (the opening scene and several scenes at home, for example) but the movie collapses as soon as one thinks about it. Leaving questions unanswered makes many films come alive with additional thought, but it makes this one worse. Its ambition and performance still, in my mind, make it worth watching, despite its flaws.<br/><br/>(P.S. To any who take this review as a condemnation of the military, I have nothing but respect for those who fight and die for their country. Criticizing the film does not equate to criticizing the men and women who give their lives so that we may live safely, and pointing out the inaccuracies in the film is not the same thing as disrespecting its subject. I believe that demanding a more accurate film actually does the opposite, and I find it much more disrespectful that Clint Eastwood didn't think Chris Kyle was brave enough on his own and felt that what the film really needed was a villain for him to fight. That trivializes the actions of real soldiers far more than a negative review of a patriotic film.)"

","American Sniper is one the few movies where the movie is much better than the trailer. This movie is a combination of war scenes in Iraq and the psychological problems soldiers face when returning to their country. These are explained from the point of view of the war hero Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>In this movie, Bradley Cooper rose from being an average actor to one of the greats. The way he depicts the real life of Chris Kyle is just brilliant. He pulled of a great Texas accent to make his role as Chris Kyle seem very realistic. The rest of the cast members also added to the brilliance of this movie. Most notable was Sienna Miller's performance as the girlfriend and then wife of Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>Even without Bradley Cooper, this would still be a great movie. Clint Eastwood has directed some great movies and for sure this will be ranked as one of his best movies yet. He sticks to the movie's plot without adding too much useless sub plots. The two hours of this movie are filled with rich and important events. You never feel that a certain scene is useless. Clint Eastwood has never disappointed in this matter. One of the strong points of Eastwood is that he is always straight to the point. You never get bored with his movies.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a must see. You get to witness the story of one of the great war heroes. You get to see the story from Kyle's point of viewand how the war affected his family and himself."

","A subdued celebration of a warrior's skill and a sorrowful lament over his alienation and misery. The movie, set during the Iraq War, has the troubled ambivalence about violence that has shown up repeatedly in Eastwood's work since the famous scene, midway through ""Unforgiven,"" in which the act of killing anguishes the killer. Eastwood, working with the screenwriter Jason Hall and with Bradley Cooper, who stars in the film, has adapted the 2012 best-selling autobiography by the Navy SEAL sharpshooter Chris Kyle (which was written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice). ""American Sniper"" is devoted to Kyle's life as a son, a husband, a father, and, most of all, a decorated military man—one of the most lethal snipers in U.S. military history. Kyle, who made a hundred and sixty confirmed kills (and more than two hundred probable kills), is always sure that he's defending American troops—and his country—against ""savages."" Perched on a rooftop in Ramadi or in Sadr City, he's methodical and imperturbable, and he rarely misses, even at great distance. He shoots insurgents, members of Al Qaeda in Iraq, and, when he thinks it necessary, a woman and a child. He's haunted by the thought of the Americans he hasn't been able to save. Cooper is all beefed up— by beer as much as by iron, from the looks of it (it's intentionally not a movie-star body)—and he gives a performance that's vastly different from any that he's given in the past. With fellow-SEALs in the field, he's convivial, profane, and funny; at home with his loving wife (Sienna Miller, who's excellent), he's increasingly withdrawn and dead-eyed, enraptured only by the cinema of war playing in his mind. The movie reality created by Eastwood is powerful and intense, and ""American Sniper"" is arguably his best picture since ""Unforgiven."""

","Well this movie put me into one hell of a roller coaster ride not because it was good at all times but because there were lots of downs in the plot , more than i had expected from a Clint Eastwood movie. First thing off the bat , this movie was shot with realism in mind , this by far is one the most realistic ground to earth biopic military cinema I have watched in a long time. The protagonist isn't hailed too much , he is put into the right stance , in the right situation with the right depth. The use of a steady camera for an action movie like this something that is really good looking at how action movie nowadays have evolved ( ahem end of watch ). What really pisses me off in this movie is the plot and character progression , and in this review i guess i would be pointing out more of the negatives than the positives because this movie has managed to leave a sour taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>1) Casting :- Perfect ! I cannot imagine anyone else who could get into the shoes of the most lethal sniper. He acted well with the script which was provided but felt a bit too dragged on and forced when it came to him acting with his co-star Elsie Robertson who are supposed to be in a relationship. The chemistry felt a bit too pushed and crammed according to me especially when the plot wants to force on the points of family problems in the lives of the seals and marines. Elsie Robertson did a good job too , portraying the life of a woman who lives every minute in a cloud of fear , of becoming a widow. Emotions are seen to hit throughout the charts but as stated previously the overall chemistry amongst them didn't catch out very well which is disappointing looking at how capable the cast and the crew are with their immense talents.<br/><br/>2) Direction :- It's Clint Eastwood , the movie is filled with his vibe and energy and his passion for direction is clearly seen here. Irrespective of his age , his hands and mind behind the camera still work brilliantly sever since Unforgiven. The camera shots between and during action scenes fit perfectly into the tense moments. But it is funny how the intense scene from the trailer was the first scene of the movie. As far as the action goes , Clint Nailed it. The sounds were top notch , every sniper with a silencer sounded like a silenced weapon every time Bradley scoped at his target there was a rush of Adrenaline. But in his path of making a realistic military movie Clint failed miserably at depicting the personal like of Kyle. Either he was concentrated on the war aspects or just too lazy , the core of the film was just left out which is a huge backlash. <br/><br/>3) Story ( Plot ) :- OK this is where everything in the movie falls apart. I am glad about the fact that Clint stayed true to the source material given to him , in fact the plot is pretty much linear and one dimensional. The story was crying of depth which the script writer Jason Hall just left out in the blue. Following are some of the problems that i faced while and after watching the movie<br/><br/>i) Plot Progression :- The movie had a total runtime of 120-130 minutes but wasted it's time on unnecessary aspects like Kyle's cowboy passion and stuff. Instead that time could have been utilized at developing more about Kyle's childhood , his relationship with his brother.<br/><br/>ii) Character Progression :- Bradley meets a girl , they hang out , he goes to war and his wife calls him telling she is pregnant . That is quite seriously how the scenes progressed. There was little to no explanation and absolutely no hints of relationship and chemistry , the pregnancy and the relationship was just forced to focus more on the war aspects.<br/><br/>iii) Fault in marketing :- The movie was sold to us as an intense sniper action movie with a runtime packed with tense set pieces and heart pounding moments. Let me clarify something . It is nothing like how i described it above. This movie should have been called American Shooter or American Gunman because the movie shows Kyle Sniping for the first 30-35 minutes and last 10 minutes of the movie which is kind of sad especially when the actual sniping in American Sniper is only quarter of the total runtime. Lethal shooter yes , sniper , maybe , but the movie has shown me only a few scenes proving the point, and that opening intense scene in the trailer , that's the only intense sniper scene in the whole movie.<br/><br/>I rated this movie an 8 on my first viewing but as I keep thinking about it , the movie keeps going down and down with it's score , the ending , please , the ending was incoherent , loosely left , i get the point that the ending was the way it was described in the source material , but as a part of the movie , the way it was shown , was complete misstep.<br/><br/>On a whole this movie is a good time if you are going in for a 2 hour action flick with little to no character development. This movie is something really perfect if you were bored one day , and watched it when you had absolutely nothing to do , after watching hangover part 2 again. The plot is jumbled , though linear was convoluted by the director , the relationships are messy , but overall for the production money put into this , I would say it's a good action movie , not a very good standalone."
"jogocar","10","9","35","24 January 2015"," Eastwood is a Genius and NOT for the reasons you might think.
","Before Clint Eastwood even thought of directing this movie, he was against the war in Iraq. It is my opinion, TPTB forced Clint to direct this movie. He really didn't want to direct this movie. He was given an offer he couldn't refuse. It was impossible to turn down the offer to direct. Eastwood let us in on the secret. Knowing the lies and b.s. spread by Kyle in the media i.e. the knocking down of Ventura, the murdering of the looters in New Orleans, the killing of the two would be truck thieves. Clint gave the audience his view on the whole affair by telling us that the American Sniper story is just propaganda. Propaganda to help perpetuate war in the Middle East. How did Mr. Eastwood let the audience know the whole story is propaganda? By introducing the fake baby in the movie. The baby (the story) is fake. Brilliantly subtle and so effective."

It's disgusting that the military and public are so 'brainwashed' to believe the lies that they support and get killed for 'what'?

","This is a great movie in all respects: script, acting, direction, special effects. You are gripped from the opening scene and there are no parts that drag. You have to wonder where director Eastwood found a set that looked like an urban war zone in Iraq. Yes, the language is salty, but that's the way men in combat talk. <br/><br/>The only reason I can see for it getting so many bad reviews is that the reviewers identify themselves more closely with people like Michael Moore (McCain would call him ""low life scum"") than patriotic manly men like Chris Kyle. Chris was a genuine American hero and this movie portrays him accurately.<br/><br/>This movie will help you appreciate what sacrifices American service men and women and their families make to make this such a comfortable place in which to live."
"john_seater","7","6","21","22 January 2015"," Apolitical review of an apolitical movie
","American Sniper is about part of the life of Chris Kyle, who was a sniper in the US military in Iraq. Kyle served four tours of duty in Iraq. In his capacity as a sniper and soldier (actually a SEAL), he killed a lot of people. The movie sketches his background and the events that led him to enlist in the Navy, become a SEAL, and then become a sniper. The movie presents his thoughts, internal conflicts, and difficulties dealing with the stresses of war in general and his experiences in particular. THAT'S IT.<br/><br/>I gave the movie 7 stars because of my internal rating system. Eight or more stars is a movie I would want to see at least one more time. American Sniper isn't that kind of movie for me, though it may be for others. I saw it once, am glad I did, and am satisfied. I can easily see why someone who has a closer connection to the movie (e.g., a veteran of the war in Iraq) might want to see this movie more than once. For that person, the movie easily could be an 8 or higher.<br/><br/>The acting and direction are excellent.<br/><br/>The movie is about Kyle, not American foreign policy, patriotism, or even heroism. The movie takes no stand on whether the Iraq war was good or bad. It does not present Kyle as a hero but rather as a man who did his job well. If you want to see a movie about a man's participation in a twilight war against irregular fighters and terrorists and the effect that the war had on him, see this movie. Otherwise, skip it.<br/><br/>Now for a brief remark on the large number of reviews that paint this movies as either patriotic or routine propaganda. UTTER NONSENSE. Ignore all reviews that give the movie high marks or low marks because of the political preferences of the reviewer. The movie takes no stand on the desirability of the Iraq war, on how it was conducted, on American foreign policy, or any other political issue. The movie is completely apolitical. Some of the characters have doubts about what their side is doing. The main character himself has thoughts about what he is doing. At one point, he is quite ready to shoot a kid who has picked up an RPG and is trying to aim it at some US soldiers. While holding a bead on the kid, he keeps hoping the kid will drop the RPG. When the kid does just that, the main character is relieved. Not quite what some reviews would have you believe about what the movie does or what Kyle himself thought. The movie is about Chris Kyle, so of course it shows us his thoughts about the war and his role in it. Chris Kyle is patriotic. Chris Kyle joined the Navy in part because of 9/11. Chris Kyle has no regrets for the job he did. Those are CHRIS KYLE's thoughts, not abstract statements about the desirability of American involvement in Iraq. Also, 9/11 really did happen, the enemy in Iraq really did use children and women as means to kill American and other foreign soldiers, many of the enemy were vicious people who murdered and tortured their opponents. The movie shows all that. It was part of the reality that framed Kyle's life. Nonetheless, the movie takes no stand on whether the US should have been in Iraq. The movie is about one man and his view of the world he was in and what he did in it. It is neither patriotic nor propaganda.<br/><br/>Some negative reviews complain that the movie glorifies ""a killer."" That is particularly offensive nonsense. Consider the following set of situations. (1) A soldier is sent to Iraq. He sees an enemy. He shoots the enemy before the enemy shoots him. Is the soldier a killer? If you say yes, then you are a fool, and we can stop here because you are beyond reason. If you say no, let's go on. (2) The same situation except the solider does not see the enemy. However, the soldier's buddy does see the enemy and shoots him. Is the soldier's buddy a killer? After all, the enemy wasn't aiming at the soldier's buddy. Repeat the answers to situation 1. (3) Same situation, except that now the soldier's buddy is posted on a rooftop looking for enemies so he can shoot them before they shoot the solider. The guy on the rooftop is called a sniper. He is good at his job and kills many enemy who are trying to bomb or shoot his comrade. Is he a killer? Repeat the answers to situation 1. In all the foregoing situations, the soldiers are doing their job and trying not to get killed doing it. That is what soldiers do. They are not killers for doing it. The people who sent them into combat may be evil, stupid, misinformed, or lots of other bad things, but the soldiers are just doing their job. This movie is about a soldier doing his job.<br/><br/>War is hell. It's not always clear that a war should be fought. Sometimes it is clear that it shouldn't have been. None of that is the fault or even the concern of the soldiers who fight those wars. They are just doing their job. This movie is about one of them. Leave your political baggage behind when you see this movie, and judge it for what it is."

There are no spoilers here, just bad karma. Kyle lived by the gun and died by the gun.<br/><br/>It will be impossible to ever enjoy another Bradley Cooper movie again. I had absolutely no sympathy for the character he portrayed. Kyle was a psychopath who was responsible for his own hell. <br/><br/>It is not surprising that Eastwood fostered this propaganda on Americans, given his surreal performance at the 2012 Republican convention talking to an empty chair.

","Tonight, I sat down to watch this movie with my brother and the only thing I knew it was in the running for awards and a friend of my brother had said he was underwhelmed by it, and thought it ""very slow""....<br/><br/>Having now watched the film, one thing I can say is that it is definitely not ""slow""....I mean if you are into your James Bond Style films or something with Jason Statham in it, it probably is plodding but that is because of you and your preferences, not this film. I mean it takes place over the course of 13 or so years, and a lot of stuff happens, so how you could describe it as ""slow"" is beyond me.<br/><br/>I think this drama is character driven, and about what is going on with Chris Kyle and what is going on in his head and his life as a result of what is going on around him. I would have thought that was obvious. I don't think think it's pro-American in any sense really, I think that's all a bit superfluous. I think the essence of the film is about what it means to be a soldier, and what it means to take a life and how that changes you as a person. The army becomes his family, and that world becomes his reality, and then conversely by seeing the affects of war and seeing those less fortunate than himself who have lost limbs etc. he starts to appreciate life again. I don't think there are really any judgments made in this film as regards 911 and the war that ensued. It's a film about a man in that war,the decisions he has to make and how it affects him as a person. The flags and stuff at the end may fly in the face of that, but how else would you end it....The man was a hero to his country and all those around him, but I never got the feeling he felt that way about himself....Over the course of the film, he never acted as such....<br/><br/>I liked this film a lot, but it's not a great film.

"bcrain-223-578051","9","5","17","26 January 2015"," Very Good Movie - NOT a completely accurate biography - approach with an open mind!
","This film really moved me. I let myself get caught up in the birds eye view of the war in the Middle East, as seen through the eyes of an American sniper. I thought Clint's direction and Bradley's acting were both very good. I have not served in the military, but my father, brother, and brother-in-law have. My brother and brother-in-law have both served overseas in varying capacities as part of the wars in IRAQ and Afghanistan. I really appreciate those who have signed up for duty, knowing that they could be called upon to fight in a war, and then went and served their country when called upon. Wars are scary. I didn't sign up, but I appreciate those who have. I imagine that this movie does a pretty good job of showing what it must have been like for some of the men and women who had to go to war in my place.<br/><br/>Judging from the reactions of some people like Michael Moore, Bill Maher, and many of those who have taken the time to write a review for IMDb, there are many people who do not like this movie at all. Primarily this dislike seems to stem from the fact that the movie isn't a complete biography, warts and all, of Chris Kyle the man; also, there seems to be disappointment that the movie doesn't address the larger political context of the war, that being the validity of the reasons for going to war in the first place. Although I understand these complaints, I still enjoyed the movie because of how I chose to approach the film. I didn't go into the movie expecting to see a completely accurate and faithful representation of Chris Kyle, the man. This is a movie, and the most truthful biographical films are not 100% faithful to those people and life events being depicted. The powerful film SELMA, also nominated for an Academy Award this year, is guilty of changing certain aspects of the events it depicts. A person with any ability to think should know going into films such as these that movies are NOT completely accurate portrayals of real human beings and events. Any viewer who sees this film and comes away thinking that Chris Kyle, the man, was a perfect person, who never makes mistakes, who never does anything wrong - is an American GOD so to speak - that viewer is simple-minded. I have to admit that based on some of his quotes that I've read, Chris Kyle, the man, sounds like he may have had some real problems. The film, which is about a soldier, shouldn't HAVE to address the larger context of the war, because that is not Chris Kyle's, or any other soldier's decision.<br/><br/>I approached this film as someone who appreciates that we have soldiers such as Chris Kyle, my brother and brother-in-law, the men and women from the local National Guard unit where I live, etc., etc. who have signed up for duty and then performed that duty, at risk to their lives, when called upon. The people I know are not going to the Middle East because they want to kill ""brown"" people. They went to where they were called to go, so that I could keep doing what I do. I thank them for that, and that's why the movie affected me the way it did."

","""In this life there are three types of people: Sheep, wolves and sheep dogs. I do not want you to be wolves, I want to to be sheep dogs. Protecting others."" - Wayne Kyle <br/><br/>Overall rating: 4 stars <br/><br/>Chris Kyle's (Bradley Cooper) primary goal in life was to become a cowboy. He grew up in Texas, rode in rodeos and drank Lone Star beer. Through the training and mentoring of his father, he had also developed the gift of shooting a rifle. Besides his self-proclomation of being a cowboy and he was the protector of those that came into his sphere of influence. When America started to come under various terrorist attacks, the role of protector moved beyond the Texas borders and to the people of the United States. In his thirties, Chris decided to join the US Navy SEALs to develop his skill and to become a sniper. During his SEAL training he met and married Taya and looked ahead to their life together. During this time, the 911 attacks occurred, Kyle and the other members of the SEAL team are called for their first tour of duty in Iraq. The story of American Sniper goes through the actual events that occur during their four tours of duty in the war on terror. Throughout the challenges and victories of the war in Irag, the film travels through the Kyle's experiences with his fellow SEALs and his family. The impact of the numerous tours begin to expose the effects of post-traumatic stress on military personnel and their families. Chris has to confront the relationships of his fellow SEALS, the reality of the war and, once returned at home, how he manages to handle his life with his wife and children.<br/><br/>Chris Kyle's father, Wayne, had warned the American Sniper production team that if his son's story was disrespected, he would ""unleash hell."" Yet, he stated that he trusted Bradley Cooper (Silver Lining Playbook) and Clint Eastwood with Chris Kyle's journey. Cooper bought the rights to this story and had only intended on producing the film, but eventually found himself drawn into the role. He had to bulk up to represent Chris Kyle's physical characteristics and with the direction of Clint Eastwood managed to honour Wayne Kyle's wishes and brought a very human and respectful depiction of the SEAL legend. Being a biopic and with the announcement of Kyle's death in 2013, there is a predictability to the storyline, but Eastwood manages to keep Chris' story riveting and fresh. The storyline does not pull any punches with Kyle's life. Bradley Cooper manages to prove his acting abilities and depth in taking on a larger than life character. Cooper's performance portrays the SEAL as charismatic but susceptible to human frailties. Kyle was a legend as a sniper, but did not always make the best choices with his life or career, but the scenes do not damage his credibility as a hero. Sienna Miller (Foxcatcher) is at her best in this role and manages to take on the role of Taya Kyle with a feminine strength that can truly be understood by military wives. The story will inevitably be compared to The Hurt Locker and Lone Survivor, but this film stands on its own as a worthwhile visual experience. Eastwood manages to keep the intensity of the war effort and the heart of Kyle's family life at the forefront of the story. It does not hold back on the graphic nature of wartime violence and language, but this reality is a necessity for the story's believability. <br/><br/>Throughout Chris Kyle's first three tours in Iraq, he has a spotter and friend named Winston or Goat (Kyle Gallner). In his military role he plays Kyle's conscience and one of the few individuals who confront the spiritual side of the SEAL legend. Kyle was known to carry a New Testament with him on all missions. Prior to one of the key missions in the film, Winston asks Chris about his belief in God. In the discussion, the realities of this man was that God is real, but not personal. The application of God and the Bible seemed to be interpreted as being merely superstition. Later in his time at home, he even has a discussion with a Veteran's psychologist about the 160 deaths attributed to the SEAL. Chris states that he has a clear conscience in meeting his maker. He wanted to be the sheep dog, his role was to protect others from the evil of this world and he accomplished this with his rifle. It does open the door to bigger discussions. In the end we all have to consider that we are all sheep and need a protector or saviour. Regardless of the ability to stay alive during the wartime efforts, death still comes to everyone. This film shows the need for us to protect the defenceless, but in the end the fragility of life comes down to that question, who is your God and what happens when you die? <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper proved that they have the ability to take a great story and make it into a great film. I was choked up by the American Sniper experience and the film brought out patriotism and an appreciation for the people of our armed forces. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is the God of the Bible a God of justice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:19) 2. Are we to watch out for the defenceless?(Psalm 82:3, Isaiah 1:17) 3. What happens when we die?

You got better movies about Vietnam. And when you know who really was Chris Kyle, I am not sure he is the hero America, really want, he looklikes more of a war criminal.<br/><br/>And most of the movie is a made up, to make look (people who have suffered from an illegal war from Bush) like savages.<br/><br/>Like America prefer venerate Islamohatred rather than to have a decent view on human life.

","People are seeing what they want to see in ""American Sniper"" without paying a lot of attention to what Clint Eastwood is actually saying.<br/><br/>There's been a liberal firestorm leveled at the film for its pro- military, pro-killer attitudes, to which I say: Have these people actually seen the movie?<br/><br/>I identify as liberal myself and have aimed more than my fair share of criticism at our military and the things it's used for. But anyone who thinks ""American Sniper's"" final message is pro-military is unfairly biased and isn't watching the film with an open mind. In Bradley Cooper's character, the film portrays the kinds of guys I think the military is probably full of -- guys who join up for noble ideals, are genuinely proud of America and their role in protecting it, think that's what they'll get a chance to do once they're in the military, and then are asked to do things that they can't mentally and emotionally handle. The film doesn't make a villain out of Cooper for being such a good and deadly sniper, which people seem to take exception to, thinking wrongly that if the film doesn't turn him into a villain, then it must intend him to be a hero. But I think the movie just feels bad for Cooper more than anything. He's just a decent guy who has a job and does it well, but the job he's asked to do is horrifying and something the average American can't even comprehend.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I didn't like it very much, but not for the reasons everyone else seems to have for disliking it. I felt that Eastwood wasn't sure whether he wanted to make a domestic drama or a straight-up combat film. Combat mostly wins out, with the domestic part, which should have been most interesting, feeling like a somewhat obligatory add-on, full of clichés and standard melodrama. Sienna Miller, as Cooper's wife, is a fine actress, but she's stuck with a thankless and boring role. Cooper is very good, but the movie's emphasis on combat over character development limits how effective he, or anyone else given the same role, could be.<br/><br/>Mostly, I came out of ""American Sniper"" thinking: ""That was no 'Hurt Locker'.""<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","First of all, the problem with this film is not the acting or directing. both of those roles are done competently. It contains great action scenes, some suspense and is overall a classic American inspirational movie. The problem lies on the seemingly uncamouflaged attempt to sell America. words and phrases like ""patriot"" and ""the greatest country in the world"" are thrown around constantly in order to inspire an audience with the same ideas and show America as the ""good guy"". It just seems as if they were trying TOO hard to make this a propaganda movie. <br/><br/>However, if you're smart enough to detect the movie's propagandistic nature and do not fall for the ""America is N#1"" speech, you will probably find yourself enjoying a well- made war movie retelling the true story of a man capable of amazing feats, and a ""hero"" for some, Chris Kyle. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper does a GREAT job at transmitting his characters complex psychological issues, and Clint Eastwood's directing is still a seal of quality. Don't get brainwashed into joining the US Army JUST because of this movie and you will be glad you watched it. <br/><br/>Im still not convinced about this movie being ""Best Picture"" material, and mainly after watching the other nominees, i have no doubt that this movie does not deserve to win, at least not in that category.

"PostingandToasting","10","7","28","20 January 2015"," Will American Sniper be the first War in the Middle East film to be widely embraced by America?
","War is often one of the most successful movie genres because of the glory that comes with war and the seemingly endless number of stories you can tell from it. From ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"", there have been so many war stories told, celebrated, and cherished by their fans around the world. However, for some reason the wars that have struggled to be embraced (by Americans in particular) are the ones we read/see headlines of daily in the Middle East. It's hard to say why this is. Maybe it's the difference of opinion of what the wars are being fought for, maybe it's simply hard to see the glory in a war while it's still going on. It's interesting because there have been a few films made on the subject that have been praised like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker"" (Oscar Winner for Best Picture) but I feel those films lacked a certain humanity to them that could draw people in emotionally. ""American Sniper"" may be the one film of this genre to be widely embraced by viewers.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" follows the story of former Navy SEAL Sniper Chris Kyle and his accomplishments during his four tours in Iraq. Bradley Cooper added 40 lbs of mass and muscle to play the hulking Kyle, who was a man consumed by warfare and justifying his over 160 confirmed kills down to the simplest reasoning of good vs evil. To be the type of man like Kyle or any other advanced military figure, I've always felt that you have to be wired a little differently. Obviously you have to be brave and willing to make sacrifices and hard decisions. But I've also felt like you need to see the world in a different way and be able to disconnect yourself emotionally from your environment, knowing what you are expected to do. Kyle was certainly one of these men and Cooper shines in being able to show how it was the most dangerous environment that made him feel the most alive.<br/><br/>It doesn't make sense to someone who has never experienced anything like fighting in a war. Why would anyone ""choose"" to keep returning to such a hostile environment once, let alone three more times after making it back alive once? It's a question that tortures Kyles wife Taya (Sienna Miller) who can't understand why Chris constantly chooses to put himself in harms way when she and their children are their for him? It's almost as if they can't quench the thirst for Chris like war can, which is seen when he cites the order of his life's priorities as ""God, Country, and Family"". We all know of stories of how war has changed men when they return home and Chris was definitely a prime example of how difficult it can be to re- acclimate to peaceful surroundings after spending so much time in hell.<br/><br/>It's frustrating to see so many articles published about the film where they criticize Kyle for his ""lack of remorse for the people he killed"" during his combat days. Kyle was very vocal on his feelings towards his kills as he only saw these men as enemies to kill or else they would kill him. For someone to criticize the actions of a man just based on watching a movie and to have never been a position to make decisions like he did is lazy and irresponsible. To criticize a man who was trained to make decisions involving life and death in order to protect members of his platoon and the rights we stand for as Americans is foolish.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is the best film Eastwood has done since ""Million Dollar Baby"" and Bradley Cooper continues his recent run of Hollywood success. Both lent a hand in producing the film and giving a fair interpretation of Chris Kyles life and experiences. Maybe more than his wartime experiences were the scenes of him attempting to re-enter the ""normal"" world. These men are trained to take any potential distractions and repress it so that nothing clouds the objective at hand. An American Sniper...A ""Legend"".<br/><br/>4/5"

","The movie starts with character development of a typical mid-west American ""patriot"" who has no doubts what to do when his country is under attack. Well actually he joins the army before 9/11, supposedly motivated by US embassy bombing some time during 90s, but the main trigger and motivation for this character is 9.11. Anyway, I am thinking along the line; now at some point this character will develop, and realize things aren't black and white, and start questioning the himself, the war, whatever, after all the movie was nominated for 6 Oscars. That moment never happens. There is a 30 second duologue with his comrade who has a moment of doubt, and Kyle gives him American football style answer about the meaning of war and life (""go get them, we're right and they're wrong""). The only scene worth mentioning is the one where main character watches turned off TV and hears shots and screams, showing signs of post traumatic stress syndrome. Is that all it takes for movie to be nominated? This reminds me of army propaganda movie/documentary for Vietnam era helicopter gunners; you sign up, go through some fun/hard training, meet the incredibly hot girls while on vacation on Hawaii, and shoot Charlie. And that was 50 years ago. And as many mentioned some great (American) movies about that war were made, and not this kind of one sided baby food for brain washed masses. Clint Eastwood....what can I say, not even old age can be excause for this... The reason for 5 stars instead of 1 or 2 is the fact the movie has technical qualities, and the acting isn't bad..."
"tonyflintjackson","5","6","23","19 January 2015"," Bradley Cooper is a good actor.
","Just watched this movie last night and I have mixed reaction to it. The acting (especially Bradley Cooper) is very good, the direction is OK especially coming from a 84 year old Clint Eastwood, but the storyline is average. A soldier killing many people and than getting upset when he returns who then keeps on going back to kill even more people. At some point it seems like they are trying to justify killing children in a very roundabout fashion. Some bits of this story are a little far fetched, the main characters seems to be dealing with his inner demons after killing so many people, family issues and a cat and mouse game with the ""Iraqi Sniper"" he is hunting.<br/><br/>I mean I don't know, I was expecting this film to be a army/SEAL recruitment video but it covers areas that would not go down for recruitment. It hits some harsh truths that the US soldiers have to face, it does not condone the wars or support them, it sitting somewhere on the fence. Everyone would take something else away from this, but it seems this film was made for Americans not the world.<br/><br/>Not to take anything away from Chris Kyle but it has recently come to light that he did like telling tales, not sure what you can or can not believe. At the end of the day it seems it is supposed to strengthen support for US Army (mis)adventures all around the globe without asking too many questions."
"jarenmahawky","1","10","45","4 April 2015"," ""Thou shalt not kill"" anyone?
","I can't fathom how such a terribly one dimensional, cardboard cliché and vapid movie could possibly be considered as ""good"" drama and art. The only real tragedy of this movie is that such odious crap as this is devoured down by the ultra jingoistic brainwashed multitudes without a second thought as to what constitutes as even palatable art. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the action scenes with the terrorist Chris Kyle, which I admit were stimulating; otherwise this movie is god awful trash. To start the movie was too dichotomized; this is even lampshaded where Chris Kyle gives his binary view of the world in the beginning: you're either a good guy or an evil wolf. To add insult to injury this movie portrays the deranged psychopath Chris Kyle as the good guy and the Iraqis as the savages, which is totally ironically inverted. Great nuance there Eastwood! I mean, throughout the movie every single Iraqi who gets killed just so happened to be a grenade wielding terrorist, kids and adults alike, reinforcing the prejudice that ALL Iraqis are latent terrorists, even the ones who are resisting the depredation of the imperialist invaders. The fact that resisting an unjust occupation makes you a terrorist is the most blatantly inane sophistry I've ever heard. The fact that Chris Kyle just blithely kills Iraqis under the pretext of protecting his comrades proves he's nothing more than a pernicious psychopath. Those Iraqis had families too, they had livelihoods, dreams, ambitions, yet the only ones that mattered are those of the American invaders? Logic much? That is what any rudimentary story teller will censure as being terrible storytelling, where there's no moral complexity, no moral quandary nor impasse; everything the Jesus Messiah Chris Kyle does is ipso facto correct which makes the story bland and way too cliché. A story about an illegal invasion had so much potential for nuance, grayness and complexity, but no, the average myopic American would rather watch hours of saturated propaganda with a protagonist as complex as Patrick Star from Spongebob for hours like the good little drone they are. I mentioned this earlier but the movie is also unsavorily racist. What message are you sending to your kids who're watching this movie when for hours straight they watch Iraqi men, women and children being depicted as miscreant terrorists whose only function in the movie is to act as a plot device by being mowed down like grass by Chris Kyle so he can ""save his comrades"". Not only is that obviously racist but it's terrible writing and a crude plot device to turn every character besides the main cast into worthless cannon fodder. The Iraqis are all portrayed as cardboard pernicious villains whose only lot in life is to perpetuate evil and block ""democracy"" wherever they go. The rather obvious resistance motivation doesn't exist to make this movie more multi- dimensional, it's the Iraqis have homicidal propensities by default, nothing more nothing less. Portraying people who resist an invasion as being nefarious and malevolent while the invaders are benevolent liberators is just disgusting propaganda which vindicates the oppressors and criminalizes the oppressed, nothing more nothing less. The penchant for this movie to approbate mass murder as being heroic is abhorrent. The fact that nowhere in the movie does Chris Kyle show a shred of compunction nor contrition shows not only that Chris Kyle was a murderer but that murder is a virtue. The irony of it all is that Chris Kyle is portrayed epitomizing the heroic Christian while omitting the whole ""Thou shalt not kill"" commandment. Don't get me wrong killing is justified under self defense, but it was America that attacked Iraq, not the other way around, so how is it defense? The movie takes an abhorrent taboo against every culture, unjustified killing, and seems to whitewash and laud that which should be condemned. The doublespeak in this movie would even make Orwell proud; let's not call it killing, let's call it protecting comrades. By that same awful sophistry the Japanese weren't wantonly brutalizing the Chinese in the Rape of Nanking, that was only the Japanese looking out for themselves and protecting themselves. A murderer by any other name is just as reprehensible. The fact that there was such a palpable dissonance in the movie and was never brought up by any of the characters, be it Chris, his colleagues, or his enemies, is just terrible writing. Any real story shows you not just one paradigm but several to balance them out; apparently Clint Eastwood never took a writing class before. When the cliché mantra is shoved down your throat throughout the movie without any real conflict then it's really hard to take the movie as being any deeper than SpongeBob. ""Despite what your parents may say, it is okay to kill"". The world has enough bloodshed as it is; a movie which depicts killing and extirpating others as being ""awesome"" and ""cool"" without any objection isn't ameliorating anything, it only perpetuates the problem. Depicting murderers like Chris Kyle as brave is an insult to the actual bona fide valiant heroes throughout history. A guy dressed in body armor, brandishing the latest weapons and shooting random Iraqis from a secure location isn't brave in my book. Those 10 year old Iraqi ""terrorists"" who stand up to American tanks a hundred times their size are the real brave heroes. Or those soldiers who disobey their orders to randomly shoot innocent Iraqis are also brave, along with those who are harassed for speaking out against this unjust war. By telling kids that going to random overseas countries and blindly obeying orders to slaughter people you don't even know without even understanding why as being the pinnacle of bravery do you wonder why certain parts of the world detest us? If my review offended anyone here I apologize I didn't make it any more offensive."

","This film has good cinematography, sound, and a committed performance by Cooper, and other characters. What's wrong is the screenplay. Very, very wrong.<br/><br/>I read Chris Kyle's book, and he was far from a pleasant character, however good he might have been with a rifle. A quasi-sainthood with which this film heaps on Kyle (the closing credits are disturbing to see, in this regard) with PTSD unsurprisingly put as the sole demon that interferes with that sainthood. This does huge disservice to how borderline psychopathic and jingoistic the real Kyle was to the people of the Middle East. Which you can read all about in his own text. You get none of that explored in any depth here. Because that would be 'anti-American' of course.<br/><br/>Eastwood also ought to know better as a director than to just present this Iraqi conflict as a pro American flag waving, us versus them, 'makes up for 9/11' quest. But that's what it is. The only moral questions that we're presented with are Kyle's fears about shooting children, what his work does in taking him away from his family in America, or how he balances his home life on return with helping out other vets. Little else. Nothing on the devastating bloodshed inflicted on the Middle East by the West, at least partly in the names of oil and opium.<br/><br/>You might feel moved by watching this, but you realise soon after that you've been had, if you're politically informed in any way. I don't recommend this film, and I'm glad I never paid money to see it at the cinema, or buying on video at least."
"R-Clercx","7","5","18","2 February 2015"," A movie one can rate on 2 different levels
","As a European, to me it's clear this movie is pure American military propaganda. Celebrating a sniper who shot over 100 people in a country that was invaded under false presumptions. As such the American invading army can never be heroes, they are occupiers shooting people who merely defended their country, like Americans would protect their territory. It's however a big step from defending one's own territory, to invading a foreign country and trying to glorify the people, including military personnel involved in it.<br/><br/>On a second level one can watch the movie pure as an action flick. It's well made with some suspenseful scenes and the atmosphere of being in a war is well captured. The character itself isn't that well developed however... yes, he has some doubts when shooting children but there is no much psychological exploration going on here. It's kind of a cliché: man thinks he has bigger things to do being a sniper, than taking care of his pregnant wife.<br/><br/>Is the man a hero? Surely one can not be a hero if one invades foreign soil under false pretext and snipes people who are merely defending their territory. But guess the US needed a movie like this, so the can still believe they are the policeman of the world, with plenty of heroes around."

I think he has made a very well crafted movie (so what you can see a baby doll), this is really a good story, well acted by all involved, very indulging and exciting for the viewer.<br/><br/>Maybe it is mostly by America to Americans, it is a very patriotic movie, but also a proud movie about fighting for your country, not giving up on each other, believing and hoping for the best, overcoming fears and having seen and experienced terrible things you can't even begin to imagine or express.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job in the role of Chris Kyle, he makes it all seem very real, his tours to war and all the things he has to do there, all the things that he experience and just can't leave behind, the things that troubles him and those he keeps bottled up or can't shake and explain. I really felt his dedication to helping others, not leaving anybody behind and being there for your mates and country, and you can really feel how it starts to crumble and become too much, the frustration and the feelings and anger his body can't handle.<br/><br/>A though movie, but more in a psychologically sense then in watching what is actually being shown, it is not very bloody, there is a war, but most of the struggles are in his and your mind."

","American Sniper is a biopic of Chris Kyle who served the US military during the war in Iraq, with his skills leading him to a reputation as their most lethal sniper, by the amount of kills. As the human inside, we see him as an obvious patriot, while struggling with a conflict of being haunted by war. Summing that information up is what mostly justifies the entirety of the film, but even so, it's still not kind of enough. There might be more compelling stories to tell within the biography of this man, surpassing the film's common view to him as an American hero. The war itself is also portrayed as one-sided which makes it less groundbreaking. While the craft and the acting are strong enough to keep up the film's value, it still doesn't hide the fact that there is something lacking in this character study.<br/><br/>There has been several controversies in Chris Kyle's career that didn't make it to this biopic, the film's perspective to the soldier is his heroism, how much he is committed to fight and die for his country. The big love for one's nation is an obvious trait defining a US soldier, as well as suffering the usual condition of conforming himself into war, almost forgetting how to live normally with his family. The movie does well examining this side of the character, especially when it shows the effects of war within his humanity. But the ordeal only goes beyond the reminder of the jolted pain and noise of warfare once and however gets easily resolved. A better exploration of this conflict is an opportunity left out hanging, but what it has shown is already well depicted anyway. The movie probably hails too much to the soldier which keeps repeating his praise and only leaves his forgiving flaws.<br/><br/>The war, while excitingly directed, gets an underwhelming treatment. The battle never gets a shade of gray, the enemies are basically just bad guys willing to kill without any remorse, no matter how young or old they are. Not that this is a big deal for war cinema, but this is basically just typical, that it could have been way effective if they're mostly faceless. The other soldiers don't get the development they needed for us to remember or actually care for them as characters. Luckily, the action is expertly handled, brimming a lot of tension around the battlefield, as bullets fly sometimes unpredictably, also showing how their actions affects the people outside their fight. The moral dilemma of taking down someone only comes if the target is a child, which is once again typical, but still remains compelling to bring pressures to the Sniper. Bradley Cooper does well as Chris Kyle, living up with the man's patriotism and strong will.<br/><br/>American Sniper doesn't really dare to go beyond to what has praised the soldier, we do see his flaws as a human, but the most questionable ones are mostly left out implied. Great biopics often tend to challenge the figure, but here he is noble, nothing more and nothing less. It can be both acceptable and not, but the craft and talent still spares a lot of excellent achievement, which makes it quite gripping. The film seems to avoid too much serious criticism, but then this is a story of patriotism and seeking beyond that might be too much to ask for."

I think Clint Eastwood was aiming for that kind of response, he wanted his audience to leave the theater feeling moved and thinking ""Wow, what a touching film.

It opens with a fairly shocking realisation, that he is going to have to kill a child who is about to throw a grenade at one of the US tanks. We then cut away to a montage of Kyle's growing up and development. He watches 9/11 on the TV and decides that he needs to fight for his country - he is a true patriot. (I was initially annoyed at the use of 9/11 as a plot point, but then remembered it's a true story, and let it off slightly). What follows is 2 hours of war, interspersed with a bit of his family life, but to the extent that everything feels clipped. Of those in the army, only Kyle really has enough time spent on him, so when the others die it never packs the emotional punch that it should. We get brief snippets of Sienna Miller, who plays Taya Kyle, being unhappy with Chris' devotion and damage, but never long enough that you truly care.<br/><br/>This would all be okay if it wasn't for a crucial flaw in the film's process - nothing made me care about Chris Kyle for the vast majority of the runtime. A biopic only really succeeds if you're rooting for the main character, and here I didn't feel that at all. Bradley Cooper does act fairly well, but the material is lacking and this causes the film to feel like a list of his kills rather than an emotional journey. The saving grace of the film is the very end, when he resigns from service after his fourth term (most of his friends seem to be dead by now), and he decides to do some good at home. He helps out veterans with little hope, and we see the effects of shell-shock on him. Finally, we're given the slightest glimpse that war isn't as cool or easy as you might think.<br/><br/>Eastwood's direction seems quite hands off, and the cinematography is washed out and unremarkable. Having seen 'Mystic River', 'Gran Torino' and 'Changeling' fairly recently, it's a shame to see his directing style become a bit lazy, as if he's relaxing into a process rather than really committing himself to the film.<br/><br/>I did clock on leaving the cinema that the film might not be for me. I'm not American and I'm not that patriotic. I'm a fairly pacifist person and fundamentally disagreed with Chris Kyle's job. But the way the film is made causes it to live up completely to the joke ""American Propaganda"", making the American soldier look like the hero, and any Muslim character instantly a bad person. I was annoyed while watching it because it didn't interest me or emote me, and because I couldn't help but remember that it's nominated for 'Best Picture' at the Oscars and 'Gone Girl' is not. I watched a number of great films last year, and a fair few of them were way better than this.<br/><br/>You may really enjoy this film. You may relate to its message or its main character in a way that I could not. You may admire his patriotism and desire to save his country by shooting people who couldn't see him. Unfortunately, I did not."

","Firstly, Clint Eastwood has acted and directed in Superb Movies like Gran Torino, Dirty Harry series and The Good. This time Clint went Bad and the outcome is Ugly. Clint is ageing so its natural to get dim. This film is about a guy that loves killing women and children, which is acceptable in USA as the murder rate and serial killer list in USA is high (Check wikipedia for facts). It makes sense for doughnuts to consider this serial killer a hero. Fortunately for this Serial Killer, although he mentions He loves killing in the film, He can get away with it because of his Job. He kills people because of voices in his head, sorry, i meant he was told to by a voice in George Bush. Its no secret, The whole world knows apart from Doughnuts what Propaganda is. This War was a disaster and lots of injustice towards women and children but who cares. Doughnuts have been brain washed to hate certain races and its no surprise that doughnuts will enjoy this biased ridiculous film as you can hate certain races in this film.<br/><br/>I give this film a 1 out of 10 because i found the bit funny when the US Soldiers go to the enemys house, The enemy would mix toilet stuff with food and serve the us soldiers. They were dumb enough to eat it."
"CMTiago","5","7","30","18 February 2015"," Enjoy your movie, America
","Before I start the review, I just need to say that for a non- American such as myself it's a bit tough to connect with someone like Chris Kyle. While I do understand that not every person in the US is praising this film as well, I feel I may just need to explain my stance when it comes to this movie and it's review.<br/><br/>So in short, the film tells the story of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL that is sent to Iraq in the course of four tours and there is becomes a legend by having over 150 confirmed kills on duty. However glorious his presence is looked at in combat, he fails to leave this environment mentally, therefore separating him from his family emotionally. This right here was a great plot point that could have actually been expanded during the film. Instead we see this troubled man doing what apparently he seems to like most, and that is fighting for his country. The need to showcase the war scenes is totally fine by me, as it is a great display of Kyle's patriotism and his obsession with the cause. Still a little more balance between his life as a soldier and his life as a family man would have made the experience much more approachable to me.<br/><br/>American Sniper ends up being a disappointment, as it features a talented actor in Bradley Cooper and is directed by a Hollywood legend in Clint Eastwood. His agenda in this movie is clear, which is what pisses me off about this movie. I have loved some Eastwood's previous work and Cooper wowed me in Silver Linings Playbook. In here I'm left with a movie that downright justifies the Iraq invasion and presents a man that, no matter how Bradley Cooper or any other actor portrayed him, I couldn't give a damn about. If anything I feel sorry for his wife and kids that had to endure long periods without him and ultimately lost him when he was in a good place.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"

","I met a man who came back from a long tour of war about a few years ago. He was a Sniper in great shape but with a huge moral problem that hung over him when we met. I questioned him as to what was bothering him and after great reluctance and me pursuing it gently, he opened up. He was a trained killer and not just in sniping either. He had killed so many people he lost track and was tortured by what he did. He had been through much counseling, received input from religions and friends and still couldn't find his peace on the subject matter. I asked him why he was staring at me when we first met. He said ""I was assessing the best way to kill you and I had three ways to do it"". He said he couldn't help this thinking and carried it around with him all this time. I realized it was his training which I rated a ten for effectiveness but with personal chills added! I asked just for the hell of it how would you kill me? I am a 5'11 with a heavy muscular build in great shape guy. He says he would have chosen a blow to the neck area and when I pressed him for details, he left it at a head blow area below the neck and felt uncomfortable discussing it with me. I also noticed his demeanor changed from civilian to professional killer and he noticed it too. Both of us changed the subject. I left him with...you know you served your country and did your duty and it had to be done and he says I know all that and have heard it before. He just couldn't come to grips with what he did. This movie tends to glorify the work that had to be done. But this man I spoke with remains highly conflicted and in pain in regards to it. BTW...there are Snipers out there that don't want to be known, glorified or identified. Famous for killing people? As far as a movie goes for entertainment purposes...be entertained, enthralled and even satisfied for getting your price of admissions worth. But ponder the true cost of the story and the part man plays in it.....Definitely a popcorn, snack and tasty drink movie"
"eddie_baggins","7","4","14","26 January 2015"," Over-hyped but still solid stuff
","Talk about poetic license. Having read Chris Kyle's autobiography on his time in the Navy SEALS and his experience as a sniper in the Middle East, there was countless times throughout this picture that I caught myself questioning whether certain things happened and other times I was bemused at just how much screenwriter Jason Hall had adopted the story of Kyle into a more by the numbers hunt for the ""Big Baddie"". While Hall and director Clint Eastwood have meddled with many of Kyle's most central experiences in the war, at its core American Sniper is still an often thrilling and well made (if slightly by the numbers) examination on war and the toll it takes on those within it.<br/><br/>A story and subsequently movie tailor made for those with the stars and stripes proudly flying outside their house, American Sniper is an often fascinating look at the burden war takes on an individual and those living with them. Chris Kyle and his dedication to his SEAL brothers and the want to protect them is an amiable ambition that supporters or detractors of the war could only but admire. Kyle was a man that put country first, God second and family third, a somewhat questionable order of life's priorities that endure thanks to Kyle being totally sincere. In Kyle's autobiography it was clear that the man had a deep love and desire to protect his country and that's something Eastwood and Hall get across well whereas something they strangely struggle with is Kyle's actual sniping. A large chunk of Kyle's tale is how he managed to bag 160 plus confirmed kills but here in this movie Kyle's sniper escapades feel like an afterthought. Its clear director and screenwriter thought it best to find another anchor to lay their movie on and you'll see more of Kyle with a machine gun than you'll see sniper battles so it comes with a pre-warning not to expect to many long range cat and mouse battles. With the focus somewhat laid off seeing target after target drop to the ground due to Kyle's keen eye the film finds its soul at the centre of Kyle himself and his relationship with his wife Taya.<br/><br/>In a story that seemed open to extract emotion out of the battlefield, American Sniper is a strangely emotionless affair when it comes to Kyle and his comrades. With weakly drawn and short-changed side players, you'll struggle to find emotional investment in Kyle and his brothers of war yet thanks to Cooper's stunning turn and Miller's nicely constructed support, the film finds much needed heart in the love of these two people. Cooper really does give a career defining turn, physically different and sometimes unrecognisable; Cooper inhabits Kyle with a respect and believability that elevates a stock standard tone to another level. Whenever he is beside Miller or simply on the phone to her, the film feels more alive than any of the so called big battle sequences and it's a credit to Hall and also Eastwood that they have accomplished such a well-drawn relationship to pay homage to a genuine real life love story.<br/><br/>I don't feel that American Sniper is an amazing film, a film somewhat undeserving of some of the plaudits placed upon it by the Academy but it's a film that does its job in a way you'd expect from such an experienced filmmaker like Eastwood and a nice step up for him in quality after a string of recent misfires. Elevated to another level by Cooper's great portrayal of Kyle and with a powerful last 10 minutes, many will be calling American Sniper one of the better films of recent memories despite it being a sometimes frustratingly cold and generic America FTW tale. In the end American Sniper could've been something more but also so much less and judging by its incredible box office and audience reception, that's all anyone has asked for.<br/><br/>3 and a half unfortunate rattlesnakes out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","I understand that Chris Kyle is a hero in the eyes of the American people and he did do an important job but this film goes way over the top . In fact i wouldn't have been surprised if this had started with the commonly seen cartoon Marvel introduction , it's that sycophantic and it's no coincidence that this directed by Clint Eastwood. Bradley Copper does a decent enough job , as does Sienna Miller and it does entertain if you can see through the stars and stripes. It's a shame that Eastwood didn't make this more of anti war movie because then this film could have worked but sadly this is just a pro American film made for Americans."
"Joxerlives","7","6","25","28 February 2015"," Quite a good film but possibly the most polarising of all time?
","Judged as a film alone this is a pretty good story. Clint Eastwood directs well, the cast do a fine job, the action sequences are exciting and it walks a fine line with it's tone, veering effectively between 'war is hell' clichés and celebrating Kyle's undoubted skill and bravery. It doesn't depict war as anything but brutal and horrific and the traumatising effect it has on its' participants is plain for all to see. Having read the book my main complaint was that we don't get to see the beach-ball story (a group of 16 insurgents using beach-balls as flotation devices to attack a US position via a river, Kyle letting them get midstream then shooting out the beach-balls and letting them drown, killing sixteen enemy using only four shots) or what he actually earned his medals for, rescuing wounded Marines on a couple of occasions. If I was a to pick a favourite scene it's him killing an insurgent and his spotter not even acknowledging it, so routine has this become or him winning his future wife's hearts by holding her hair up when she drunkenly vomits on their first meeting (who says romance is dead?). <br/><br/>What's amazing about this film is the visceral reaction to it from its' opponents who simply cannot accept it because it differs from their own viewpoint, Kyle derided as a bloodthirsty racist killing machine monster of big oil war criminals who wish to poison the children of Iraq with depleted uranium and re-establish colonialism, the entire film a work of slanted propaganda and wishing they could give it less than one star as a rating. The only conclusion you can reach is that left-wingers are deeply intolerant people who don't countenance views different to their own or that possibly they heard the hype and hadn't seen the film? I wonder if Audie Murphy or Alvin York ever had to put up with this kind of disgusting abuse?<br/><br/>For the record Kyle never claimed to have shot looters after Hurricane Katrina, he merely discussed rumours of other special forces soldiers doing that with another SEAL. No one has ever been able to substantiate the story of shooting 2 car-jackers one way or the other nor the facts of his drunken brawl with Jesse Ventura, Kyle being dead before the case came to court so not being able to give his side (I'm happy to put it down to alcohol and PTSD on both sides).<br/><br/>So, ignore the American Sniper bashers, it's a great film, see it with an open mind and decide for yourself."
"moviejaysin","5","7","31","12 January 2015"," A colorful story, a mediocre movie at best
","Right of the bat, Bradley Cooper is amazing in this movie, far better than I thought he was going to be. He brought feeling and gravitas to a role that was sadly one dimensional and not well written. Sienna Miller is as always forgettable and many of the other actors are sadly interchangeable, with none of the character development seen in other great true war movies like Saving Private Ryan or Blackhawk Down.<br/><br/>I din't think any of this is the actor's fault, Director Clint Eastwood has made some amazing films in the past, but seems to be losing his grip lately (J Edgar was terrible and Jersey Boys was not as good as it should have been). <br/><br/>It's a shame because I wanted to love this movie, despite the controversies surrounding Chris Kyle, this is an important story about a war many of of don't fully understand. Generation Kill ad Hurt Locker both did great jobs of bringing home what our soldiers are facing for us in Iraq, and Lone Survivor showed the camaraderie or the Seal Teams in modern conflict. American Sniper failed to build on any of those films and instead was merely a propaganda piece with one stellar performance and a few well shot scenes (although none that will stay with you). It will be forgotten soon, which is not what Chris Kyle deserved."
"StevePulaski","6","5","20","19 January 2015"," When the character can't overcome the legend
","Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" put me in the same kind of mood ""Lone Survivor"" did this time last year, in that I was reflective of why so many Americans, myself included, rush out to the multiplex to see a new war movie. The answer, from what I gather, is fairly simple, in that most Americans have very little conception as to what occurs overseas, and that mediums like books and films are our windows to the frontlines of combat. With war films based off true events, factual accuracy is always debatable, and the persistent fact checking often circles itself enough to the point where you don't know what to believe; nonetheless, if the combat and the human stories are done correctly, along with the presence of a clean structure, you will feel a war film and that's just about as good as anything.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is destined to be the audience favorite of the next few weeks, and to be fair, it's easy to identify why; if you're someone who hasn't seen a lot of war films, or even if you have, this particular film packs a serious punch. A lot occurs in a little over two hours, and images and sequences many won't be used to will likely upset viewers and provoke feelings and attitudes that aren't usually provoked, even when watching a war film. At the end of my showing, over eighty people walked out in stone-cold silence; it was one of the most somber and telling signs I've ever witnessed exiting a movie theater. Everyone, regardless of their opinions, had just witnessed something that had them at a loss for words or an inability to speak their opinions as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the deadliest sniper in United States history, a Texas native by the name of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), who enlisted in the Navy SEALS following the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies. He was eventually drafted into the Iraq War following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and went on to earn the name ""Legend,"" for his prolific body count and his persistent loyalty to his squadmates. However, back home, as one would expect, his Taya (Sienna Miller) feels his absence, struggling to raise children and maintain their home, especially when every time Chris returns home, he is burdened by nudging thoughts of discomfort and an inability to readjust, which makes him want to return to the frontlines.<br/><br/>The film keeps one foot in Iraq and the other back in Texas, showing the contrasting lifestyles and the effects each one has on Kyle has a person. Iraq has him in a mood that is constantly alive, working to protect and operate as cleanly as possible, where back home shows him burdened by the thoughts of his current disloyalty and his persistent thoughts of war, as he clearly starts to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. A great scene in particular has Kyle staring at a Television set during a party, with thunderous explosions, helicopters, and combat being heard at deafening levels, leading one to believe he's watching coverage of the Iraq War; a brief pan around to show us his point-of-view shows the television set is turned off.<br/><br/>Eastwood keeps ""American Sniper"" grounded in humanity when it comes to showing the scenes involving the after-effects of each of Kyle's four tours in Iraq, but neglects to develop him as a person. A critical structural flaw in the film occurs within the first half hour, where the scene from the teaser trailer - showing Kyle with his crosshairs on a suspicious woman and her child as they harbor a grenade towards U.S. soldiers - remains a teaser in the feature film, with Eastwood cutting away from the action as it's about to unfold to show Kyle's life as a child before returning back to said scene to witness the outcome. During the time where Eastwood and writer Jason Hall expands on Kyle's upbringing and eventually enlisting, significant father/son moments and true motivations are simplified, resulting in a rushed treatment of the founding years of the character's life. On top of that, Eastwood corrupts the suspense he conjured from the trailer of the film by interrupting such a tense scene in the feature film, taking us out of an environment and interjecting us into several others when he should've kept us grounded in one.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the character of Chris Kyle remains largely a vapid caricature, characterized only by such buzzwords as ""legend"" or ""amazing,"" never giving us the tender, more human side to the man that the film has initially suggested. What we largely get are combat scenes that are sometimes gripping and other times spatially incoherent or certain scenes that lack emotional leverage because they spell things out through the use of dialog or obviousness (IE: Kyle's face staring into the television as he witnesses one of the World Trade Center towers collapsing into rubble). While Cooper may be giving us one of the strongest performances of his career, effectively achieving the combination of unsettled and fragile, Hall's writing greatly shortchanges Sienna Miller's character, who is resorted to nothing more than being a wife who constantly calls her husband in either frustration or sadness and doesn't become her own central identity.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, there's a real overload of content here in terms of how much the film shows and how deep it's willing to go in certain situations. Eastwood and Hall do their best not to leave a stone unturned, and Cooper follows along nicely, creating a character who can be fearless at times and unsure and self-critical at others. ""American Sniper"" will please a great deal of audiences, but serious issues with the film's structure and depiction of its titular character should not go unnoticed despite the film's ability to captivate and illicit emotions."

Then he meets cute-faced girl with a character at a bar (she states she despises marines, but attends regularly a bar always crowded with SEALS, marines and the like...).

(well, if you watch ""Green Zone"", an interesting and pretty good film, you might get a clue about it) <br/><br/>He proves to be an effective sharpshooter, and becomes appreciated by his comrades as they feel safer when he is around, but eventually he gets bored of being the whole day lying on his stomach and aiming with his gun, and decides to join the guys who patrol the streets and break into more or less every house in the neighborhood, it's good to go out and stretch one's legs from time to time. <br/><br/>Eventually, a counterpart turns up in the enemy lines, kinda modern Saladin or Baybars, cool-looking Middle Eastern guy with a damn good shot and leadership abilities!. Then we expect the film might become a sort of re-edition of Jude Law vs. Ed Harris duel ""Enemy at the gates""-style... far from it... Nothing particularly interesting happens for a long stretch. <br/><br/>Our SEAL guy goes back home and then to Iraq again several times, meanwhile his child is born and cute-faced wife gets angrier and angrier at him since she considers he is neglecting his family and becoming obsessed with war (C'mon! take it easy, don't women who attend military men-crowded bars always dream of becoming the spouse of a hero??).

The therapy consists of meetings to talk and share experiences, and an additional activity. What activity?... maybe a reader's club where they comment on books? No; maybe occupational therapy workshops on some kind of craft-work, music? Nope; maybe excursions and trips to the countryside for fishing, bird watching and so on? No either. What they do as a therapy consists of... SHOOTING!!!! (yeah, I'm serious!, watch the film if you don't believe me). I wonder what life must be like when you look at it permanently through the telescopic sight of a weapon...<br/><br/>At the end, one of these shooters shoot the shooter, and he dies.

"loveanni08","7","4","15","6 March 2015"," Direction!! Acting!! American Sniper!!
","BY STEPHEN MARCHE<br/><br/>American Sniper, Clint Eastwood's Iraq War film starring Bradley Cooper, opened last weekend to a small measure of controversy and an epic public response. The movie made an estimated $105.3 million over the long holiday weekend, an absurd sum for an R-rated war drama devoid of superheroes. It broke two January box-office records previously held by Avatar—by Avatar, for the love of God— and it has already surpassed almost every Clint Eastwood movie's lifetime gross in a few days. (Unforgiven made $101 million over its entire run.) Most remarkable of all is that American Sniper deserves all its success. It is the first great film made about the war in Iraq. (It follows sniper Chris Kyle's tours in Iraq, which included the Second Battle of Fallujah.)<br/><br/>The controversies surrounding American Sniper are predictable, although still quite silly. Michael Moore made the claim that snipers are cowards, and then seemed struck that anyone was offended by the remark. A bizarre statement, truly. You can accuse Navy SEALs of a great deal, but cowardice is not on the slate. Others have more seriously taken issue with the way the film represents history. To which I can only say that going to a Hollywood movie for a history lesson is like going to a brothel for a lecture in philosophy. You're in the wrong place.<br/><br/>THE BEST BEST PICTURES FOR MEN<br/><br/>A MICHAEL KEATON STORY HE WOULD RATHER YOU DIDN'T... No one is denying the quality of the film, well, with the exception of those fake babies. That would be nearly impossible. What makes some critics uncomfortable is their perception of the film's celebration of violence. Chris Kyle, whose autobiography provided the basis of the film, was the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. He was a naturally gifted shooter from boyhood, and his gift was nurtured by dedicated training until his deployment to Iraq, where urban warfare provided the perfect venue for its expression.<br/><br/>Eastwood does not shy away from displaying Kyle's incredible skills with a rifle, it is true. But to say that American Sniper is pro-war or even a simply heroic portrait of Chris Kyle is deliberately to misinterpret it. At the beginning of the story, we see Kyle as a child in Texas. His father instructs him in a simple code: There are wolves and there are sheep and there are sheepdogs in this world. And he is to use his violence to be a sheepdog rather than a wolf. In the broadest terms, the story of American Sniper is that of a man given this incredibly crude ethical system, thrust into the morass of the Iraq War, and watching it crumble.<br/><br/>During his first tour, Kyle is forced to decide whether to shoot a young boy as he runs toward a convoy of soldiers with what appears to be a grenade. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan progress, as the tours add up, the decisions become even more complex and the purpose of the violence less clear. Kyle's sign is a crusader's cross. He displays a skull very similar to that of the Punisher comic-book character on the side of his Humvee. He wants to make war on ""the evil"" of ""the savages."" He takes missions out of a spirit of personal revenge. His counterpart, his foremost enemy, is a sniper named Mustafa who takes videos of his kills and sells them on the street. But at least when Mustafa goes to kill, he's in the same country as his babies. ""God, country, family"" is Kyle's motto. It's also the motto of ""the savages."""

","The cinematic craft here is uninteresting with nothing really to recommend it. I put that aside. This is woeful stuff indeed for other reasons.<br/><br/>What irks most is the tremendous sense of complacency. You'll see this in how it starts. A cowboy who never had the slightest interest in the larger world before TV footage of the US embassy bombings interrupted his beer drinking session one night, suddenly awakened by a sense of purpose. From his end, someone half the world away woke up and decided to bully America for no reason.<br/><br/>The film takes care to make the whole thing, repeated tours in Iraq, about the dogged effort to apprehend a hight-ranking al-Qaeda man. It's something the viewer can substitute as a reason for leveling a country if he absolutely must have one, tied to 9/11. No mention at all of the bugaboo with WMD or Sadam anymore, it has been purged away.<br/><br/>But of course that's all something someone like him might truly believe. Here's the tricky bit. The protagonist never questions anything about his mission but how come Eastwood doesn't? Oh there is some moral pause in all this like when he watches through the sniper's lens at a child trying to pick up a RPG, wishing he just drops it. There is some indignation during the funeral over how long this crusade must go on. We do see returning veterans shattered by horrors. But how come the worry is only about what our people have to suffer in service to country, never why?<br/><br/>The ending crystallizes this ignorantly narrow focus in a larger way. <br/><br/>The American hero has kind psychiatric help waiting for him, he gets to heal in a spacious house with his family. He gets a long funeral procession with flags waved along the streets. A movie about him. It reminds me of watching an NBA pregame last year where US army veterans were paid respect by the whole arena; going beyond political right and wrong, I was amazed truly by all this structure in place to receive them. Iraqi lives on the other hand are truly wretched, nameless, ""terrorists"" on their own country when seen through the lens of the foreign sharpshooter there to liberate, Iraqi structure reduced to the stone age.<br/><br/>Oh I don't subscribe to the notion that people in the area are happy to lead peaceful and tolerant lives if we only just stop invading. Collective soul in the area has been shaped by forces that divide deeper than anything that happened 50 or 100 years ago; Iraq being a fairly recent adoption that stands on what used to be the border that rival Muslim empires ravaged for centuries. It might have stone aged itself like Syria these days and Lebanon prior without any other help. But I would rather lament this and the ravaged soul and plight of the area before that of the American hero who made it back."

","I have to be honest I really enjoyed watching this film. Bradley Cooper was amazing as Chris Kyle, one of the deadliest snipers in American history. The scenes of the war were gripping and emotional and the scenes at home depicted the problems that people go through when involved in a war.<br/><br/>Although a good watch the political stance on this film was ridiculous. Every shot Chris Kyle made was apparently clean and just. In this film if he kills a man, woman or child they're almost always pulling out a bomb or shooting at American soldiers. That is ridiculous! With 160 confirmed and 250 claimed kills by Kyle we are taught to believe that every single kill was because this man was protecting his country and the Iraqis were all terrorists who were about to kill an American soldier Every Iraqi in this movie is depicted as an insane suicide bomber who will stop at nothing to kill American troops its ridiculous. I think that Chris Kyle is nothing more than a glorified serial killer who should have gone to prison for the obvious war crimes he committed. He is not a hero! 250 claimed kills! The man probably went out of his way to kill anyone with a Karan. No way were even half of these kills a life or death situation.<br/><br/>Now was not a good time. With the Charlie Hebdo incident people in western society are going to view every Muslim as a terrorist like Kyle did.

"sesht","Null","5","21","17 January 2015"," Persuading the chair
","Well, I'm a huge fan of Eastwood, and had begun digging his work more so after he began directing. And to forgive an old man his eccentricities, I probably even stood up for him even after he talked to the chair at the last big RNC shindagig. <br/><br/>But, and to be fair, if one had thought that the stupidly titled 'Lone survivor' had something of a 'right' slant in terms of being pro-war and unabashedly gung-ho in terms of its (misplaced?) patriotism when it came out (I was one of those people who thought that), that movie doesn't have anything on this. <br/><br/>Another question that sometimes sprang in my mind, especially watching the initial 'conditioning' sequences, was if Eastwood himself was doing a 'Colbert' on us, and STO'ing (stating-the-obvious) on the evolution of the American soldier (and mercenary). <br/><br/>Unapologetic about its pro-war message, which, I'm sure, has as much to do with the 'original' work it was based on, about the 'legend' with the most number of confirmed sniper kills, Chris Kyle, this movie is completely underwhelming from start-end, and not just because of its completely predictable, by-the-numbers storyline and unimaginative screenplay, but also due to the fact that there is simply no arc of any kind, with the supporting actors just standing in and playing obeisance to the 'legend' on play throughout, just serving as those hangers-on in local mainstream flicks that have no other role than to just egg our hero on, waxing (once again, unimaginatively) eloquent about how great he is, or how great his deeds are, to anyone who'll listen. Cases in point - the sequence on the rooftop during the sandstorm, the VA guy meeting near a concession stand, Sienna Miller's final scene gratefulness on the 'legend' coming back to them (which goes completely against the grain of what her character stood for in quite a few of the earlier sequences - in her defence though, it might have been pages being filled from real life, but Eastwood has been a better film- maker than this cookie-cutter work testifies). <br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the key characters involved in the conditioning of the 'legend', his father and his brother (not directly, but by being his enabler of sorts) , and discarded ruthlessly as and when Eastwood needed that. Now, my question - if that was a decision of sorts, perhaps to make this more film-able, then why wasn't more attention paid to the so-called tense action sequences. There have been better examples of wartime movie-making, stuff like 'Black hawk down' or (shudder) 'Behind enemy lines' and the like. For someone who made the haunting 'Letters from Iwo Jima', this is a huge come-down, and I am not getting the decision made to even decide to film this one- note piece. <br/><br/>Having said that, Cooper gives it his all, and though it (ideally) should not overshadow any of the other best actor nominations out there, it is a good, sincere effort from him, and he's saddled by the burden of not being given more scope in order to showcase his talents more. It was also disappointing that his supporting roles were just mainstream tropes and not much else. <br/><br/>I have been vocally supportive of Eastwood's directorial work before, including lesser works like 'True crime', 'Blood work' and 'Changeling', but cannot support his work on this, or even his motivation to choose this as his directorial vehicle. This is the man that made 'Unforgiven', and even one of my favorite movies of all time (A perfect world), and he's telling us that he couldn't get even a smidgen of that angst into this movie, regardless of the book it was based on? Come on. Maybe I might have felt different if I were American, but I'm not too sure that makes a difference on appreciating a work of art."

","Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) and his brother are raised by their hard-nosed father to be sheepdogs defending against the wolves of the world. They are weekend rodeo cowboys. After watching the African embassies bombings, Chris signs up for the SEALs and meets Taya Renae (Sienna Miller) at a bar. They get married and he goes off to Iraq as a sniper. On his first tour in Falluja, he kills a kid with a grenade. He returns on multiple tours and facing a skilled Olympian sniper called Mustafa.<br/><br/>The war action is quite tense. Clint Eastwood's years of experience have laid the foundations. This is skillfully made despite the fake baby. The biggest pet peeve is these guys chatting on patrol which obviously leads to an explosive attack. It's a bit of a trope. Chris' private life is well shown but his closed off nature is not always the most compelling drama. It also hits a little too much on the head sometimes. For example, he's talking to Taya on the phone when a battle explodes around him. It's an interesting but overwrought scene when it happens the first time but the movie returns to the well again. This is a very much heroic portrait which may annoy certain people. As a movie, it mostly works well."
"ashray-gunjur","6","4","16","20 January 2015"," The best war movies are always harrowing. American Sniper is this and more- an exploration of humanity, masculinity, and potentially, our downfall
","There's a certain bleakness about war for me. That we, as people, are driven to kill each other on the battlefield, again and again. And again. Being born into a relatively blessed time, decades since any major conflict that would have involved me had I been alive, it's still surreal to imagine that to wage war is inexorably human. That for the longest time, men have been driven to kill other men, for kin or country.<br/><br/>In talking about sheep, wolves and sheepdogs, The American Sniper paints a picture of why some men choose to engage in war. To fight the good fight. To stick up for those who can't stick up for themselves. And in someway i felt like it insinuated- to lose that belief, that drive to 'fight the good fight' is to let yourself die in the heat of battle. But how could you not second guess what you were doing, if it involved killing children, destroying homes, invading another person's land, their land for millennia? I'm always struck by the irony that, to be a war hero means to be incredibly good at killing other people, efficiently, effectively.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper paints an enthralling portrait of the archetypical American hero- the sheep dog, tough guy, with his southern gentleman-ly manners and undeniably human morality. Perhaps what i don't think it does is capture the humanity of the Iraqis. Save one example, we don't come across any Iraqi civilian who's not out to get Americans. Perhaps showing the human side of Iraqi life wasn't an aim of the film. But i do think it treaded the border between aggrandising the heroism of war and shuddering at it's wretchedness very finely.<br/><br/>Overall a great film to start 2015, and likely realistic- but very much a patriotic representation of an American war hero- that perhaps misses detail on the other side of life in war."

If he decides to do something, he does it. He never misses his target, protects his brother at school, decides to become a navy SEAL so does, just like that. We are shown some brief scenes of muscle bound men being doused with water but again, at no stage is there any depth or exploration of the cardboard characters or chance of failure. Our hero decides to pick up the leading lady in the bar, again, succeeding where other's have failed.<br/><br/>Then it's off to Iraq to fight, wait for it, Al Qaeda.<br/><br/>Based on the 9/11 Commission report, there were no Al Qaeda in Iraq before the illegal U.S. Invasion of Iraq. They came much later. Clinton Eastwood conveniently tells us all the Iraqis ARE Al Qaeda, a blatant lie.<br/><br/>There is an endless supply of Iraqi sniper fodder with a spider man like enemy sniper who jumps from roof to roof, able to catch up to the U.S. troops in humvees. These Iraqis show no fear or feelings and could just as well be mindless zombies.<br/><br/>At the end the U.S. Troops move around on top of a roof in plain view of the enemy sniper who somehow can't see them, but a little later our hero can see him. Then we have our hero talking to his wife on his sat phone while being overrun. While everyone else is shooting, he is talking to his wife! So very unrealistic.<br/><br/>I used to think a Clint Eastwood movie would always be good. I didn't expect it could be this bad."
"lokilfa","5","5","22","25 January 2015"," America, not ready yet
","While admiring Eastwood directing in general and particularly the two great historical war movies on Ivo Jima, I've had no satisfaction in watching this biography.<br/><br/>Even if the real person was true hero or a troubled killing machine, or both, you're not likely to find out. Cooper delivers a 'piece of stone' two dimensional character with pathetic supporting wife by Miller. Nearly impossible to empathise these two, their interaction never gets deeper than stitched-up dialogue and empty predictable routine. Maybe they are good actors, but script and direction muffled them into stereotypes.<br/><br/>All other characters are just stereotyped scenery, even the little credible antagonist is not given much to go around.<br/><br/>Storyline is bumpy and void of purpose, a sequence of tours of duty with dull character progress, at the end of the ride events described might have taken place in two weeks, no story progress or evolution felt.<br/><br/>Photography, music and all other tech aspects are great as expected, sadly that does not translate into enhanced narration.<br/><br/>Just to be clear: war in Iraq good? Or bad ? Who cares! It should be the story of a sniper, a single man by tactical definition. It would be stupid to judge this on your moral and political scale. And yet all you get is a hollow tale with politically correct tones and dubious patriotic purpose. Do not look for catharsis here just ask for a well told biography, but you will leave empty- handed. My ignorant conclusion is that American society and film culture is not ready to examine the events portrayed. Eastwood might have his own political beliefs but until now that had never stopped him from delivering immersive storytelling. Maybe twenty years from now we will get a great film on subject. Not yet."

","Now that the Oscar nominations have been let loose on the world, it is time for me to catch up on all the films that I haven't seen which have been nominated for 'Best Picture'. Beginning my journey, albeit a very small one with only three films needing to be watched, is American Sniper, the new movie directed by The Man With No Name, starring Bradley Cooper, last heard as a gun-toting raccoon in last years' wonderful Guardians of the Galaxy. Shall we begin?<br/><br/>American Sniper focuses on the life of Chris Kyle, the ""deadliest marksman in US military history"", who during his time as a Navy Seal, racked up 255 kills. 160 of which were confirmed, whilst attempting to highlight the effects war can have on soldiers, both in a wartime environment and a 'normal' one. The word, ""attempting"", is probably the key fulcrum on which this review is based as the movie fails to paint a picture of how horrific war actually is, and instead, relies too many times on scenes that go full-on Call of Duty, with Black Hawk Down being the obvious inspiration, which in my mind, is something I have seen too many times before. <br/><br/>In terms of the good, Bradley Cooper does a solid job portraying Kyle, whilst Sienna Miller, who subsequently has seemingly reappeared out of nowhere in American Sniper and Foxcatcher, does an equally as good job playing the role of the estranged wife who is caught between Kyle's love for her and his love for war. Aside from the two Kyles, the rest of the film is seemingly enriched with 2-D characters who come and go in relatively forgettable fashion, whilst the contrast between Kyle and the enemy sniper is rather poorly done and should have had more depth in order for me to actually care for the twisted relationship between the two. The word ""depth"", in general, springs to mind, as their simply wasn't enough in this film to justify its' two hour plus run-time, and it seemed to drag on and not really grip me like I wished it would. <br/><br/>Overall, American Sniper, is a solid, yet unspectacular, flag-waving war film that attempts to show the true horrors and effects of war yet only succeeds in falling flat on its' face. Although it has been nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the forthcoming Oscars, it is probably the weakest of all the films in that category and in my opinion, should easily be replaced by Foxcatcher. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 6/10"

The story is flawed from the very beginning. <br/><br/>A true story about a Texan wannabe cowboy, Kyle, who after witnessing 9/11 decides to join SEAL and kill bad guys in Iraq! WHAT?!? Iraq which has nothing to do with 9/11? Or did he just assume that since ""all Muslims are terrorist"" what difference does it make if i kill them in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya? Well, the buck doesn't stop here - and this is where i am assuming Eastwood took the liberty of giving the sniper competition between kyle and his rival arch enemy the maximum amount of screen time making it almost the main plot. Which does build some amount of tension but soon dissipates within a new york minute with a one-inch-punchy climax.<br/><br/>Cant even begin to talk about kyle's relationship with his wife and children because it is so amateurishly executed unable to fully express his dilemma before and after the war.

This film, for just the ""film"" aspect of it was good, it being of an actual man that lived and died for his country to help defend freedom, being free from people that don't have an outlook of long life but only my purpose of being here to spread fear, then killing amongst the world to what I believe is ""my calling, from my god?!"". My father was in the army for 6 years and was a marksman, and growing up he said it was the greatest years of his life. You can read the synopsis and get the rundown of the film, yes. Go watch it. What I take away from this film is a brave man, that was built to succeed in the military, the film shows him neglect his wife and kids by serving 4 tours, but she should have known going in, this is what he does. A military man is about structure, discipline, and never quitting. Most women would say, "" oh he had a family, he should have never went to his fourth tour"", then he would forever want to go back. I believe war is something that once your in, you need to see an end result to feel like you've been risking your life, for a true purpose, Chris Kyle at the end of this film fulfills his purpose. His life was taken far to early, and by a man who needed more help. So, I salute you Chris Kyle......may you rest in peace, for I am able to write this because of what you were defending."

It is much more like a recruitment film for the US Army: ""Every patriot American go abroad for protecting US interests and kill anybody, even the children"".

I'm pretty sure skimming through the scripts can yield more parallels. This is how bas AS is.<br/><br/>I don't think this exercise in hagiography does the memory of Chris Kyle any service. The movie seems to care only about glorifying ""killing bad guys"", without any attempt at looking at the elusive bigger picture - why do the ""bad guys"" fight us? What's the war about? Do the means justify the greater goal, which... I'm not too sure what that was? I can only think of ""Trial at Nuremberg"" as an example of how American movies used to be, and that one was about the aftermath of a war the US had actually won (or helped win). That one was more introspective, wondering whether the US had the right to judge the defeated, asking whether the Germans shouldn't be allowed a little dignity, after all. No such questions in Clint Eastwood's movie; one character has some doubts, only to be quickly dismissed by Bradley Cooper's character in 2 sentences. Yay - just like old Soviet propaganda movies."

But what most of you'd be wrong about is why.<br/><br/>JUST HORRIBLE! I think the movie does a great disservice to Chris Kyle. He along with the Marines he served with are made to look inept. The combat scenes written for these guys have them hesitating all the time, or worse yet, unable to sense any real danger. Here is the recounting of one totally ridiculous scenario;<br/><br/>Sent to find the second in command of the head terrorist in Iraq, known as the ""Butcher,"" they are fully armed and ready to take on this evil enemy right? Yup, so they break into the Iraqi home of a family. They quickly subdue the 50 year old man, wife and kids. Okay fine. Then they show them a photo of, ""the Butcher."" The family of course knows nothing. Upstairs the Marines go, full metal jacket like, and set up the stake-out. With what you might ask? .. A camera, and there the photo-journalist waits along with Chris and other Marines.<br/><br/>Enter the 50 year old Iraqi family man, ""hey, you guys want some dinner?"" Of course young Marines and Navy Seal Chris are totally into a good meal and so very hungry so all seven of them head back down to the dinning room where Mrs. Iraqi has made them the Iraqi equivalent of Thanksgiving dinner. (photo-journalist stays upstairs with the camera of course.)<br/><br/>Low and behold here comes Walter Cronkite, hey guys look at this cool photo I got of the ""Butcher"" going into the villa next-door!"" Wow cool says Navy Seal and 7 Marines, now we know where he is, let's eat! BUT the plot thickens ...<br/><br/>Good old Chris Kyle is no silly Marine, he notices something odd about their friendly Mr. Iraqi guy. He has CALLOUS ELBOW! Now every good sniper knows callous elbow when he see it, so Chris very politely excuses himself from the feast to use the little Navy Seals room. And what does he find is seconds? The STASH of AR-15's rocket launchers, IED's and ammunition, he's got the guy, he is no Thanksgiving day turkey, he's a terrorist!<br/><br/>Back to the table, ""what should we do with him boys?"" (scene change) Iraqi guy is pushed outside his quiet terrorist family abode, he walks pensively across the street to the ""Butcher's"" door, politely knocks, and guess what? A bunch of the terrorist neighbor guys are very unhappy, (it's after 10 pm) and they come out shooting. <br/><br/>All the while the ""Butcher"" quietly leaves through a tunnel under the backyard fence! NOW PLEASE, even Don Knott's in Mayberry NC would have seen that one coming! (Google it kids)<br/><br/>The entire movie is like that, completely silly. But what really topped off the disingenuous nature of this FARCE is using real combat vets at the end of the movie along with actual footage of the tragic funeral of Chris Kyle. It totally disgusted me using these guys and that footage to make money.<br/><br/>Many people loved this piece of trash. Chris Kyle and the Marines who fought and died in Iraq deserve much better than this garbage!"

Even in the film, Kyle says to a fellow PTSD soldier.."" a hero is a position you don't want to be in"".. I've seen a lot of complaints regarding Kyle and his victims(mainly the children he had to kill). The screenplay was taken directly from the autobiography Chris Kyle wrote before his untimely death.. so its his own experiences. Eastwood and Cooper project those experiences, in the most respectful way to the Kyle family. Cooper said on the Howard Stern show recently that ""Chris Kyle's father would have hunted me and Eastwood down, had the film portrayed Kyle in any bad light"", which may be the reason why the film is so straightforward in its approach. Spoiler: You don't actually see Kyle die in the end, it is rather a remembrance and celebration of his life in pictures/short film of the actual funeral proceedings, memorial after Kyle was killed at the Shooting Range. I believe all that footage/pictures are taken from the Kyle family..

","Every review seen by this author has either brutally criticized the film for all the wrong reasons, completely missing more troubling mistakes, or falsely promoted the film as patriotic, pro-war or anti-Muslim, which is also wrong, completely missing Eastwood's point. It is as if the film is only seen through a political lens regardless of being critical or supportive.<br/><br/>The film is artfully produced and saturated with a sense of futility, empty heroism, dread and the soul sucking nature of war. Despite Eastwood's political conservatism his work and particularly stylistic choices have always been great. This author approached his latest film with trepidation but ultimately agreed with Eastwood's statement that it is an antiwar film- one that dramatizes how innocent deaths are just a fact of war, how many of the ""insurgents"" may be ordinary people trying to survive, assumed guilty at a critical moment, and killed, and how even the most venerated soldiers can come back in a state of spiritual crisis. The film shows nothing but horrible events carried out by all sides and a gravitational downward spiral inside the central character, who meets his fatal end. <br/><br/>The film's popularity with the right wing is reminiscent of the way skinheads showed up in large numbers to ""Romper Stomper"" a 1980's Australian film that was a scathing indictment of skinheads. Maybe fans are drawn to any dramatization of a certain character and scenario, even if the message is a critical one in order to re-enforce an identity or seek camaraderie (ie a pro-gun or anti-Muslim social phenomenon).<br/><br/>What is wrong with ""American Sniper"" is far more complex than lionizing pathological bigotry. Whatever Eastwood has done wrongly he has not done that. The screenplay itself is rather good. It is not pro-war. It does *not* elevate religious bigotry, it just depicts it plainly. It does not denigrate Iraqis in any way, it just shows the US military doing it. It shows that plainly and without bias. Anyone with a moral foundation will be repulsed to see it, regardless of how that callousness is perpetrated by the central characters. Part of Eastwood's point is there is no moral compass in war scenarios. You have to find your own way through the events in the movie just as someone might in reality. There are few indicators in reality (except bad ones), and Eastwood offers none to his viewers, yet Kyle's ultimate fate is the telling of the tale.<br/><br/>Eastwood's mistake, possibly inadvertent, was making Kyle seem like a reasonable person. Kyle's own autobiography may indicate he was not.<br/><br/>Eastwood depicts Kyle as an anti-hero, as opposed to a blustering or pathological islamophobe capable of killing at will. He depicts Kyle as someone beginning to wrestle with some form of remorse for his actions or what he had been a part of. This is actually more insidious or propagandistic than showing a plain, ugly truth but every reviewer misses this possibility (even Chris Hedges).<br/><br/>Eastwood may have underestimated Kyle's martyr-like stature to some people. Perhaps in order to make a more meaningful and relevant story, he cleaned up the central character and inadvertently white-washed Kyle, because who would care about the story of a patriotic psycho? Is it possible Eastwood did not know of Kyle's popularity, his subsequent popularity if the film did well, or did Kyle became popular as the film was being released, changing the social context of the film?<br/><br/>Whatever the case, Eastwood claims it's an anti-war film and it clearly is, but on the other hand Eastwood should make a statement about Kyle and why he erased whatever pathological ugliness existed in his biography while retaining his name. That is what he did wrong. On it's own, Eastwood's story is a good, realistic, relevant war fiction but regarding the real Kyle it is probably a dangerous, misleading white-wash. It might have the effect of lionizing the real, controversial Chris Kyle as a hero not based on his life but based on the film. His real biography probably does not support his heroism (or even anti-heroism). <br/><br/>There is the question of Kyle's real actions vs. macho bluster, but his writing has taken on an independent effect at this point. Eastwood needs to explain why he took such a possible license and diversion from Kyle's own biography. The popularity of the film should not translate to popularity for Kyle if it is wildly inaccurate."

","While not a fan of Clint Eastwood's directing, it is undeniable that he reaches his full potential with American Sniper, a film based on the autobiographical novel by the late sniper, Chris Kyle, who boasts the most recorded kills of any sniper in U.S. history. That is if Eastwood's goal was to become America's answer to Leni Riefenstahl. As even her most dubious critics will admit, Riefenstahl captured some amazing images that are still remarked on to this day, but it was all done in the service of making Nazi Germany idealized. Similarly, Eastwood captures some fine technical achievements, but wants to fall back on a seriously laughable claim that his film is ""not political"".<br/><br/>I have actually read Kyle's book and for a film that is ""not political"" it works overtime to provide Kyle with introspection, personality, insights and philosophies that are no where to be found in his novel. Eastwood has the Kyle of the film raised with a nonsense philosophy of the world being comprised of sheep, wolves and shepherds (ostensibly Kyle) all imbued by his stern Christian Texas dad. This black and white mantra apparently allows him to rise to greatness as a sniper mowing down Iraqis. Kyle is depicted as being single-minded, yet regretful of having to pull the trigger. The Kyle of the novel was anything but regretful. There is no such philosophy provided by his father in the novel. Kyle, in his own words, was absolutely thrilled to be at war and gunning people down. There was no introspection or regret involved. He comes off badly as a clichéd white Texas, Christian gun fanatic, who was beside himself to find an outlet that allowed him to take out real people ""legally"". He informs us that had he not had a family that society expected him to return to, he would have been happy continuing on as a sniper. A long way from the outlook of the WW2 soldiers, who did their patriotic duty, but who looked forward only to returning home to their loved ones and peace at last.<br/><br/>Kyle also claims to have killed two men in Texas and murdered at least 30 U.S. citizens in the wake of Hurricane Katrina from atop a post on the Superdome. If true, then he is a violent psychotic who used a conflict to disguise and promote his true inner self. If false, he is a habitual liar whose word on anything should be considered dubious. The latter is certainly backed up by a court case with Jesse Ventura where a jury rules against Kyle and he was forced to pay up.<br/><br/>Even worse, Eastwood uses his film to blur history and try to gloss over the Bush administration's lawlessness in the Iraq debacle. Through clever images, he tries to link Iraq with 9/11, which is a long discredited lie. He never mentions the discredited reason for attacking Iraq, the weapons of mass destruction idiocy, because that would clash with the black and white viewpoint of the film and its main character. Instead of getting any kind of nuanced picture of Iraqis invaded and attacked in their own country for trumped up reasons, they are all depicted as crazed savages. All of Kyle's kills are, of course, justified despite split second reaction. The word ""hero"" is blindly bandied about so much until it ultimately has no meaning whatsoever. The only performance of note is Bradley Cooper's central one, which is solid if not spectacular. Although truthfully, many of the scenes of Cooper being ""heroic"" rather distressingly resemble the sequences in Inglorious Basterds where Daniel Bruehl's German ""hero"" sniper sits in a bell tower repeatedly gunning down Allied troops, while the German audience viewing his escapades deliriously applaud over every death.<br/><br/>The film also relies on American viewers being ignorant of the details of the Iraq conflict. Eastwood provides Kyle with an adversary of Bondian villainy - a sniper on the other side - with whom he gets to play a cat and mouse throughout the film. Incredibly, while this larger-than-life villain gets barely a mention in Kyle's book, he is elevated to gargantuan proportions in the film so that we can root for Kyle. The film also has this villain switch back and forth between Suni and Shia for convenience, which is something that would never happen. We are also shown another villain who drills holes in the heads of young boys, which would no doubt raise the outrage in anyone. Except such a sequence never happens in Kyle's book, and the screenwriters unwittingly give the background information on this character and give him a denomination that would have made him an ally to U.S. forces. But why should we care for piddly details when Eastwood and his writers don't.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, we get a huge piece of propaganda that glosses over the origins of the Iraq War, turns its people into violent savages, gives George W. Bush and those responsible a pass and we are supposed to overlook its goal and content because its technical aspects are well done. At its center is Kyle, who repeatedly boasted that he loved killing and was glad to do it. A man who made a number of discredited claims. Most telling, Kyle claimed that the majority of the proceeds of his book would go to veterans charities. However, apparently less than 3% of the millions raked in have gone to said charities while the late Kyle and family kept the bulk. Certainly it is their choice, but propping up a con of massive charity at the expense of other fighting men, reveals a certain lack of honor and character. Is this really the hero we want representing America to the world? If yes, then we have fallen farther than expected. Audie Murphy must be rolling in his grave."

","Someone compared Chris Kyle with Tarantino's German sniper, one of the important characters of Inglorious Basterds who symbolized the nazi propaganda glorifying its Third Reich.<br/><br/>I couldn't agree more with this association about both soldiers.<br/><br/>Although Fredrick Zoller, the Tarantino's sniper, is a fictionalized character apparently inspired by another fictionalized character (an American hillbilly sharpshooter from Howard Hawks' Sergeant York, or/and by a real Austrian sniper, Matthäus Hetzenauer), as much as Chris Kyle was indeed a real person (and American Sniper is a tribute to Chris Kyle's autobiography), both snipers had served propaganda regime agendas, and their respective integrities were inflated on their testimonies as in every war heroes, to promote war for political purposes... since Proto-History, at least. <br/><br/>The difference is one movie uses the soldier as a satire and the other as a glorification but both focus on justifying the stage of war with patriotism, heroism and comradeship diluting the rational interpretation of war itself. <br/><br/>Simplifying, at the end of this intellectual roller coaster journey about pro or contra arguments which this movie pretends to state about war, one is certain: war is justifiable if not to backup and respect the bond between your ""brothers in arms"". Well... nope. The valorous feelings a soldier might have with his comrades don't necessarily correspond to the political agenda of War itself. His valour does not equal to ""the"" valour of War.<br/><br/>Because I don't buy simplistic arguments, I give one awful star against the gratuitous promotion of violence, stupidity, absurd blinded patriotism, ignorance, lack of questioning, arrogance and imperialism. Specially because I like Clint Eastwood and because he's supposed to be an example of wisdom, a cultural symbol, a... well, a sort of utopian faded memory of what half America was before it became a corporatist separated continent chronically corrupted:<br/><br/>Everything which stands against America's Declaration of Independence, Justice and Liberty for All, sadly transforming ideals into crap and propaganda those which we've learnt and assimilated as ideological true, not political agendas or corporatist interests! <br/><br/>For the ones that simply didn't follow Iraq War, or simply had a restrict perspective about it and were ""pushed"" by their apathy to consent it, ""Colateral Murder"" exposed the banality of massacring Iraqi lives (out of a danger zone); the outcasting ""execution"" of Bradley Manning showed what happens to someone who's ideologically truthful and stands against what is wrong and therefore against the instituted powers; the war itself against the non existent evidence about nuclear warfare, against the demonstration of a progressive willingness of Saddam Hussein with UN inspectors showed the imposing standing of USA against everyone. The lunatic association about 9/11 and Iraq put a cherry on top.<br/><br/>Shame on hypocrisy and inconsistency and please, instruct yourselves before having a mass opinion about things. Be critical, skeptical, and above all rational.<br/><br/>Don't make mistakes, I sincerely love The critical America I just can't stand bull-evacuation."
"ElMaruecan82","4","4","19","22 December 2017"," The Good American, the Bad Arab and the Ugly Movie...
","In a Hollywood Villains' Special, the late critic Gene Siskel stated that movies like ""True Lies"" were predictable consequences of Arab terrorism. One could say the same about Clint Eastwood's war blockbuster ""American Sniper"" with September 11 as the moral alibi. The context is to blame, yet we blame the people, the film is no ""Apocalypse Now"" but Arabs are no Viet-Kong either.<br/><br/>I'm a huge admirer of Clint Eastwood and I've always avoided this film. Even in ""Unforgiven"", a movie I despised, the ruthless executioner had a few words about the men he killed. ""American Sniper"" doesn't bother and I almost admire its boldness. Chris Kyle, the titular sniper kills Arabs, but since they're all portrayed as heartless ""savages"", there's not even one millisecond allowed of ethical contemplation. Even in ""Saving Private Ryan"", for one moment, there was Steamboat Willie, although his sympathy capital was averted a few scenes later.<br/><br/>No such thing in ""American Sniper"", a film shot in Star-Spangled Banner colors, white for the purity of Americans, all noble-hearted God-fearing souls with great values such as family, loyalty and friendship, and red for the dirty bloodthirsty Arabs. No wonder the experience of the films inspired some enraged tweeters to go kill a few Arabs, after watching ""American Sniper"", you'd think you're doing the world a favor, I mean, is there any other community where mothers send their own children to death? Chris Kyle's best-selling novel didn't give much latitude for mercy, and neither does the adaptation. <br/><br/>Yet I somewhat felt engaged by the character study about the patriot who ""did his job"". And there's nothing in Bradley Cooper's performance that doesn't do justice to the legacy of Chris Kyle, he was an American Sniper, and well, he ""sniped"". But he had that alpha-male presence, towering over his comrades, lifting heights, even his son is the tallest of his school and is predicted to be 6'4 tall, this is definitely the best breed of men, which says even more about the ""container"". After all, doesn't Kyle believe that America is the greatest country?<br/><br/>Anyway, there are probably good Arabs who aren't all bloodthirsty savages but these are not the Arabs Kyle, or Eastwood, or any viewer was interested in. Fair enough. But even with that mindset, it was a close call before I decided not to press the ""Power"" button. Eastwood made the right choice by throwing the most offensive material in the first quarter because whatever happens to Arabs after that is never as insulting as this opening. The film starts with muezzin call and in the same time, you see a scarf-clad woman giving a weapon to a little boy. Notice that when the kid is shot, the woman doesn't even weep or take him in his arms, she takes the grenade... so she proves Kyle right.<br/><br/>Once again, after ""Rules of Engagement"", we have the obligatory portrayal of Arabs as savage people who don't hesitate to sacrifice their own lambs. And we have the obvious parallel between the muezzin and the illustration that Islam is rotten to the core, and then we have the sunny Texas, a good old church and a father teaching his sons not to fight unless it's called for. There are three people in the worlds: wolves=evil, sheep=blind or weak, and sheepdog. Guess who are the wolves? Cut to the Nairobi attacks and Kyle's engagement in the Army and of course September 11 immediately dissolving to Iraq. <br/><br/>So, we're supposed to believe that this war on Iraq was fair and driven by the patriotic fervor of American youth decided to avenge the innocent victims of September 11. Give me a break!<br/><br/>Yes, the film doesn't care about politics, but neither did ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""The Deer Hunter"" yet these movies dared to question the necessity of these wars. In ""American Sniper"", this is not even left as an option, just when you're trying to convince yourself that this war is pointless, there's an Arab or an Iraqi who makes it ""personal"". While we can focus on Kyle's conviction and dedication to the American flag, there's nothing that ever raises the question of the war's usefulness, why would he believe that killing a bunch of Iraqi would protect American families back there. <br/><br/>And even in 2014, we all know it was a bunch of lies. Please, Mr. Eastwood, why smacking all these grandstanding poses over our faces... ellipses are great narrative devices, but not at the expenses of intelligence. Violence wasn't taught in Iraqi schools! ""American Sniper"" was too one-sided it was painful.<br/><br/>The film wasn't even ""bad"" technically, but if you believe this is a masterpiece, keep in mind that any Iraqi director with half the talent of Eastwood could have made a similar movie from the other perspective, with a little focus on one jail torture or two. Eastwood's focus was Kyle and while he can't speak for himself, the man wasn't the fondest on Arabs, but the film makes no effort to show one Arab with one redeeming quality. I didn't expect ""Battle of Algiers"", but even ""Inglourious Basterds"" had good Germans!<br/><br/>Some say the Charlie Hebdo attacks' context didn't help either, but let me remind that in 2014, hundreds of civilians died in Palestine and no one gave a ****. So this is a real revealer of a disgusting hypocrisy. What is not tolerated for Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood can get away with it... and right now, he's preparing his next movie about other terrorists attacks. Any occasion to show the ugly side of Arabs is welcome (and once again, the film was shot in my country, Morocco). <br/><br/>And what could have been an ""interesting"" reflection of violence's blindness, I mean by that the untimely death of Chris Kyle in 2013, well that he was killed by non-Arabs was one fact the film wasn't interested in. One-sided to the core... or as if hating Arabs was the best way to honor Kyle's memory."
"Bruce722","6","4","19","18 January 2015"," Should've been an HBO miniseries.
","American Sniper is yet another example of why more stories should be told through a medium more akin to an HBO miniseries, similar to John Adams or Bands of Brothers. By trying to force Chris Kyle's incredible life story into a 2+ hour traditional film format, the story did little to no justice on Kyle's impressive accomplishments, both militarily and as a man. The result was a very jumpy and shallow viewing experience where you didn't feel a connection to Kyle's SEAL teammates or his wife, Taya. The actors, namely Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, did the best job they possibly could've done with the script they were given. The script was the best it could've been when trying to fit into the clichéd 2-hour time slot. But it all comes back to the decision to make this into a movie. It just wasn't possible. There were also some directorial decisions that I found highly questionable but they weren't major nor were they things most people would either pick up on or care about. Ultimately, this review should end on a high note though, so I will point out the strongest element of the film: the ending. The closing 10+ minutes are incredibly moving and deliver, what I believe was the entire purpose of the film itself. They leave you in awe of the man, the myth, the legend. The decision to leave the remaining credits without audio was also a genius decision. I've never left a theater and felt like I was leaving a funeral. I believe that is the appropriate feeling that this movie should portray and I commend Clint Eastwood for making that so."

","Jack Reacher once said ""it's never the same with a sniper out there"". I imagine that to be a very true statement. 'American Sniper' is the true story of Chris Kyle a Navy SEAL sniper who went on four tours of duty to Iraq and set records for the amount of people he killed during his career. Now, instantly you can imagine the amount of political debate that is going to take place over a film like this. Do you portray him as an out and out hero? Do you portray him as a hero, but also put a negative spin on his actions? Tough decisions for the filmmakers to make right out of the gate. Did they do a great job with them? I'm not entirely sure.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Lead role for this film. The Academy loves an actor who transforms oneself for a role and that's exactly what Cooper did putting on an enormous amount of weight. He also had to learn a Texan accent which I felt he absolutely nailed. The thing that's going to stop him winning is probably more the film than anything. It just never gave him that one scene to blow us away with. Still he was incredibly consistent throughout the film and being nominated three years in a row is no mean feat.<br/><br/>The film's biggest downfall is that the first four-fifths of it feel like we are just going through the same experience over and over. Not a lot is really being added to the story along the way. We understand what is going on and it just feels a bit like it's being rammed down our throats. Clint Eastwood has proved himself to be a fine director in the past. I noticed in the trivia section an interesting comment relating to Chris Kyle's real life father telling both Eastwood and Cooper (who also produced the film) that he would ""unleash Hell"" if his son's memory was disrespected in the film. I can't help but wonder whether that had any effect over certain scenes they might have liked to include along the way. There's no dodging the fact that people with certain political agendas are not going to like this film.<br/><br/>That being said it has been nominated for Best Picture and while it has next to no chance of actually taking home the award that's still an impressive accomplishment. It seems the Academy likes to put at least one war movie in the the category each year ever since the success of 'The Hurt Locker'. The movie has only been out a few days and already it seems to be stirring up a lot of debate, as was probably to be expected. I know I plan to go and read up about the real life events and do some fact checking against the movie to see what was included and what wasn't. All that aside though it's a pretty good watch for the most part."
"jdesando","Null","4","19","15 January 2015"," It's rough out there, even in real life.
","""That was evil like I've never seen before."" Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) <br/><br/>Besides The Hurt Locker, I can't think of another film that better expresses the frustrations and horrors of the war in Iraq than Clint Eastwood's American Sniper. Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is called ""Legend"" by his fellow troops for his sniper expertise, 160 confirmed kills to be precise.<br/><br/>Based on Kyle's writings, the film is executed in a stark, realistic fashion that Kathryn Bigelow would approve. The colors are bled out, like the camouflage desert uniforms; the dust swirls at times like the fog of war, and true to the genre, the middle-class home life is less than glamorous with a wife clamoring for her husband's return. Taya (Sienna Miller) was seduced by Chris after meeting him in a bar (even though she avowed no interest in the ""self-centered pricks""), a metaphor for her seduction into thinking she could marry a SEAL and have a normal family life.<br/><br/>The abnormal life is couched in four tours for him, each one progressively distancing him from his family. He feels the obligation to protect them and his buddies from evil. Having not accepted the fiction of WMD's, where some other soldiers have, he doggedly pursues the enemy the best way he knows how, as a sniper, and a very good one at that.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in Fallujah are even more horrific than those in Fury because the enemy is not in tanks but hiding in civilian clothes. It is virtually impossible sometimes to tell the good guys from the bad. For example in an early sequence, Chris is faced with the ultimate sniper horror: a mother and child walk suspiciously toward a group of soldiers, and he must decide if they are hostile or not. Even our cool-hearted protagonist has to pause in situations like this.<br/><br/>Eastwood has again shown that a director need not be young to be relevant and powerful. American Sniper will make you happy we have just about left the Iraq theater, but it will not make you feel safe for the rest of our engagements in the mid-east."

","I've decided to make this a spoiler free review because if i would include spoilers i would have to write about every single flaw that i found in detail, but i'm not very motivated to do that because in my personal opinion this movie stole enough of my time already.<br/><br/>To sum up my opinion, i think this film overall is not that bad. The cast does a decent job, the score is kinda neat and the scenes that play during the war are made well. The patriotism can get annoying at times but it's never too distracting.<br/><br/>But in the overall picture i started to notice many little flaws. So many in fact, that i started counting them during the view and in the end i found a total of nineteen. While those are not big flaws, it is the pure sum of them that makes this movie so inedible for me. Because there weren't ten minutes in this film without a moment were i couldn't stop thinking how stupid something in the film was and that really ruined my experience. <br/><br/>I know it seems lazy that i don't tell what all those flaws are, but when i write them down and somebody notices them because i pointed them out, then i'm more or less guilty of ruining their experience.

","Unlike many reviewers (most of them paid film critics), I will try to separate my personal animosity to US policies in the Middle East from my measure of the artistic merit of ""American Sniper"".<br/><br/>My wife insisted on us watching ""American Sniper,"" then lost interest in the first hour. Most of the truly engaging, emotional scenes are revealed in the trailers. What comes in between those engaging moments are detached episodes chronicling Chris Kyle's tours in Iraq. I admire Kyle for his personal code. However, I did not admire Kyle's inability to question the policies of those under whom he served, even when director Clint Eastwood slyly presents evidence to motivate Kyle to do so. What Eastwood does fail to do is provide a subtle transition from extroverted ""good old boy"" to extreme introvert; whom, in his wife's words, is ""not here"". However, I doubt any director could have done so, given the absence of such scenes in the screenplay.<br/><br/>This being said, while Sienna Miller is very good, Bradley Cooper, as ""Chris Kyle"" is nothing short of extraordinary. I cannot imagine another acted who could have done it better.<br/><br/>Without revealing the end of the movie (which is ridiculous, given it is ""old news""), let me say it is perfectly appropriate. Chris Kyle paid the appropriate price for using his skills to help the wrong people.<br/><br/>I give ""American Sniper"" a ""6""."
"andrewestrella","Null","5","27","26 November 2018"," Am I Supposed to Care for this Guy?
","My review for this film is not even going to revolve around my opinion on the real life Chris Kyle. Yes, he has said some horrible things, but that is not what my four stars are for. My four stars are for how horribly propaganda-filled this horrendous patriotic film is. Wow,I have never seen such a black and white picture view of any type of war in the first place. Didn't you all know that every single individual in Iraq is a terrorist, while every American is a pure saint? There are no grey lines here, because once you are in Iraq, every child, mother, and father is going to have a bomb strapped to them, at least according to this film.<br/><br/>I also disliked how perfect Chris Kyle was portrayed in this film. Why is he so perfect? I mean I get it, his wife has so many struggles with him, but even when he is back at home, he happens to run into former veterans who praise him for being a war hero. Chris Kyle (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) was just awful, I'm sorry. He triggered me to no end. I also just love how he goes from cowboy to army man in what feels like seconds, all because of a news story on the TV. ""Look what they did to us,"" says Chris, the savior, Kyle. And then he joins the war, nice job!<br/><br/>Also, I now it's a biopic, but the integration of his relationship was just bad. They had no chemistry until the last 20 minutes of the film. It was so laughable. The fact that this girl would fall in love with an ignorant, self-centered (and yes, him wanting to help others over his own family is self centered) person triggered me. This overly patriotic man has such a black and white picture of the world. It's America against the world, right??????? But yeah, the relationship was stupid and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Also, the editing was atrocious and laughable. The passage of time in this film was so horribly done that I began to lose track of where we were in the story. The story goes from him being a cowboy, to him being in the army, to him impregnating his new wife, to him having a son, to him on his second tour, to him holding his newborn daughter, to him coming home yet again in like 30 minutes. It's so unbelievably stupid! And the editing will go from him shooting at a range to him kissing his wife to him at army training to him then having a kid. Like what was even going on? I understand the film is long already but couldn't we get some time to embrace some of the emotions?<br/><br/>The action sequences were boring too. Some guy on IMDB described the film as a feature length version of the short Nazi propaganda sniper film found in Inglorious Basterds. This film was just so repetitive in the action, that I honestly could not even take it. I really didn't care about anybody who died and I didn't really feel any tension, except when kids were about to get shot or when bullets ricochet to people's faces.<br/><br/>My final complaint, among many, is the use of a doll instead of a real life baby during a scene between Chris Kyle and his wife. It was so obvious it was a baby, and when they were handing the baby off to each other, it looks goofy as heck. I have never seen something look so fake. It looked like they were carrying some Baby 🍼 👶 Alive doll. If you can't accord a baby, why even include it?<br/><br/>Also, when they got married, they announced Mr and Mrs. Chris Kyle??? What the heck? Is the wife's name Chris?<br/><br/>Anyways, why do I give this film 4 stars instead of 1? Well, surprisingly enough, I found the last 20 minutes of the film to be surprisingly genuine and good. The wife and the husband had some chemistry, finally. I actually loved seeing Chris Kyle doing everything his wife has been begging for his him to do all of this wife. I loved seeing him finally have some intersection with his kids. It was honestly kind of beautiful. And the final scene and credits makes me wish the film developed so much more of that throughout the rest of the film. It was so good and emotional.<br/><br/>To sum things up, I enjoyed the last 20 minutes of the film, and the rest just was laughably patriotic and just pandering. Boo! For anybody that wants to actually enjoy your main character, watch Kyle's fourth tour and on. You might actually not be bored and start to care.<br/><br/>Honestly, what was Clint Eastwood thinking with this film? Wow."
"buny101","8","5","27","17 January 2015"," good movie lousy baby props
","It was a solid movie. I have heard it was a rehash of Hurt Locker, but I didn't see Hurt Locker, so this is still a fresh movie for me. Basically, as a boy, Chris Kyle, the American Sniper, is told by his father that there are three kinds of people in this world--sheep, wolves, and sheep dogs. Sheep are innocent people, wolves are evil and victimize sheep, and sheep dogs go after wolves with a vengeance. The movie follows our loyal sheep dog as he realizes he needs a purpose in life, and joins the Navy to be a SEAL to save American lives. The movie was fairly good, and it's based on a true story, so there is that going for it. There were a couple of issues that knocked it back two stars--the stupid prop babies were so fake, it was almost shameful. I expect props like that on movies from Lifetime, but my wife insists that they use real babies in their movies. These weren't even half way decent props, and were painfully obvious to be fakes. It is almost like they bought Penelope Pee No More at Toys'R'Us and threw it in the film. Hate to be that picky, but it did take away from the film, and thus, a distraction. The other star is knocked off due to the movie looking at possible angles, but then not really exploring them. Chris Kyle was a sheep dog, but maybe he became a little more wolf than dog, and the movie didn't let us see that ""wolf"" in him for very much. It could have been a full movie on just watching a man with such high ideals for himself lose his way, and then seek it back out. There were other stories hinted at that never really panned out, like his protective nature over his brother, or his father/son relationship with his dad, and so I'm not sure if there is more to the story, or if, in real life, it never panned out, either. If it didn't happen, then oh, well. But since it was glimpsed so earnestly, I kept expecting it to be revisited and resolved, and the movie just forgot about it. Still, a solid movie, and much better than A-Team (Bradley Cooper in that) and I'm glad he decided to act and not give it to Chris Pratt (his co-star in Guardians of the Galaxy and the current darling of the theater). I like Chris, but it was nice to see Bradley shine. Good job."

","First let me make my political view clear.I am leftist and I believe USA is an imperialist power and Hollywood is a tool to shape public opinion in the country (and outside). Second, I appreciate Eastwood's talent as an actor and a director. Third, I know Eastwood is a right wing conservative.But although we have completely opposite views I recognize that he is not the typical simple minded conservative.<br/><br/>So reading the plot and the reviews and having my political point view I watched this movie with an opinion already shaped. At first thought I could easily say this is another USA propaganda film with good heroic American soldiers and uncivilized Muslims. But is it?<br/><br/>The film is a good film and as in all good films everyone sees what he wants to see. So a simple minded American citizen who doesn't understand that American soldiers are sent to kill people not to protect their country but to pursue the interests of USA bourgeoisie will watch a film about a typical American hero.<br/><br/>And what a leftist will watch you ll ask. Well what I saw was a killer destroyed by his killings. I saw that killing even for a high purpose (as he thinks) is not something without a cost. It destroys the soul. And if it destroys the soul of an individual imagine what happens to the soul of the community or the country (USA in this case) that gives misery to the people of this world."
"davideo-2","7","3","13","3 February 2015"," Compertently made, but overly simplistic of a complicated and emotive set up
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>As we open on Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) on the battleground in Iraq, we see him faced with the most unenviable of dilemmas: his target sight's set on a young child, who's been handed an explosive device, which is to be thrown at his comrades. Will he pull the trigger? Before we can find out, we are thrown in to reverse gear, as we learn of Kyle before he signed up and became the solider with reportedly the highest number of confirmed kills ever, through to the severe PTSD he developed after several tours of duty.<br/><br/>While enjoying a film career with a fine and varied back catalogue, Mr. Clint Eastwood has never been one to steer too far in to the murky waters of controversy, which has sadly befallen him with American Sniper, one of many inevitable biopics revolving around the Iraq war, and the tense political climate that followed. Certain segments of the media and society have accused it of war glorification and a celebration of American imperialism. The politics are pretty much set in stone beforehand either way, but this is undoubtedly an overly simplistic and under developed film that, for it's basic competence and technical flair, fails to really get under the meat and bones of itself.<br/><br/>It plays, as it does, as an examination of one subject, a deeply flawed and morally questionable man, who despite showing bravery and dedication in going to Iraq and protecting his comrades, evidence has shown he thought of the Iraqis in a less than commendable way, even if many were shooting at him and trying to kill him. The film seems to generate controversy from any number of angles, and Eastwood has applied a deft approach to this real life killing machine, right up to the end showdown with the Olympian Iraqi sniper, resulting in a fastest finger first dual ('you feelin' lucky? Well, do ya, punk?') <br/><br/>For quite a huge downside, there's a fairly high upside, too. Cooper was enthusiastic for the lead role, and he fits it quite well, managing Kyle's gravelly Texas accent and mannerisms, and gliding through all the dramatic elements of the film. Eastwood thoroughly pores over all of Kyle's post war life, and his lack of stability as a civilian, in public and in private. It's the sort of thing he's known for, and despite some hiccups, he still does it well. ***"
"kunalkhandwala","Null","3","13","2 February 2015"," A riveting story of the 'legend'
","Aiming for the deer through the bushes, young Chris Kyle quickly learns the importance of getting the job done and the honor in being a guard dog of the sheep. These humble origins turn him into a cowboy who competes at various rodeos with his brother until he learns about the bombings at the US Embassies in Africa. An urgent desire to serve for the nation with his remarkable skill as a marksman, gets him enlisted for training as a SEAL. Clint Eastwood yet again indulges into the mindset of a man, a violent one, whose troubles during war were brought back home. Completely avoiding the controversies surrounding Chris Kyle's stories and claims, Eastwood chooses to remain true to his achievements on field and their repercussions back home. 'American Sniper' will evoke an enduring sense of patriotism for the men who win and lose at wars in faraway lands and concern for the trauma that seldom leaves them. <br/><br/>As he takes aim for a headshot on an Iraqi boy carrying a bomb given by his mother, a flashback into Chris Kyle's past reveals the origins of this man of violence. After negating the threat to the convoy, Chris and his team team are assigned to take down an Al-Qaeda leader and his second-in-command, the butcher. Plans with an informant fail terribly as an enemy sniper renders the SEALs helpless and they barely manage an escape. Chris goes on to kill numerous potential threats, earning him the weight of being the 'legend'; a title he would rather keep undisclosed from his wife. Taya (Sienna Miller) is a caring wife and mother who reminds Chris that apart from being a hero for his country, he is a father and a husband. With a bounty on his head declared by the enemy, Chris departs from his wife and new- born son for his second tour that would bring success to his team against the butcher. By his third tour though, the enemy sniper 'Mustafa' causes serious damage to the SEAL team and its morale as Chris continues to remain edgy and uncomfortable on his visits back home. There is a responsibility upon Chris' shoulders that is beyond just that of reporting for duty. Perched on rooftops overlooking the movement of convoys and teams of Marines and SEALS, Chris eliminates any threat to his team. He thus feels that he is entrusted with saving the lives of every single soldier on field. While at home, playing with his kids or watching TV, Chris is haunted by the notion of the being constantly at war, trying to save those he couldn't. <br/><br/>The fourth tour to Iraq would require the American Sniper to take down the threat of Mustafa deep inside enemy lines. Motivated by revenge for the loss of his friends, Chris takes a seemingly impossible yet very risky shot at the Syrian Olympic shooter and exposes his team to an astounding number of insurgents that swarm into their building. With a fast approaching sandstorm, not fast enough backup of forces and depleting ammunition, the SEAL team is faced with more than just the enemy's gunfire. This thrilling sequence is brilliantly directed by Clint Eastwood who doesn't shy away from incessant bullet firing and other imminent dangers. <br/><br/>As Kyle calls it a day, he takes the advice of his wife and sees an army doctor who recommends interacting with soldiers who have just returned from active duty. Through their physical and mental injuries, Chris' compassion serves as a purpose to life after war but he could only find peace for a while.<br/><br/>The engagement with the war in Iraq makes the audience want to return to the battle field as much as Chris desires to. Eastwood takes us right in the middle of the battles through the eyes of the sniper and behind his life and death decisions at the spur of the moment. Bradley Cooper's sincere portrayal enables the director to keep it real and engaging. With his Texan accent and cowboy swag, he pulls off a mellow character who transforms into America's most lethal marksman and a struggling family man. This has to be Bradley Cooper's role of a lifetime. Sienna Miller's expressive emotions create conflicts for Chris but behind it all is her love and concern as his wife. <br/><br/>Tom Stern's cinematography in the tense war zones as well as the gloomy surroundings of Chris' return to home portrays the environments as they are for the characters. Combined with the visual effects and stunts, it creates some riveting action sequences that are among the best of Eastwood's films. As a director who cares about the human element in his stories, much attention was paid to depicting Kyle's struggles. Yet, for cinematic reasons the director chooses to overlook Kyle's interaction on media upon his return, rather leaving him with recovery from the post-war stress. <br/><br/>The up-to-date individual and readers of Kyle's best-seller would know how it all ends but Eastwood's culmination of the narrative is genuinely moving. He engages the audience with Kyle's character so well that the end leaves us hanging in disbelief. Yet, there is an overwhelming sense of pride and patriotism that builds up to it with the pin-drop silence in the theater in the last few minutes being a testament to Chris Kyle's heroism and Clint Eastwood's remarkable direction of powerful human stories.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.689 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","Before going to the cinema to watch American sniper I was not expecting a lot of this movie, and it might be the reason why I liked it ! <br/><br/>Nevertheless I'm not entirely convinced ! Even if this film is very interesting I'm bored of all those movies which are the ""new propaganda"" of the US army where the SEAL is nothing but the best in all fields ! He always take the good decision , as a consequence, he never fail. I know what you can say : But that's reality, that's a true story ! Sure ! But American sniper is only depicting what is favorable for the Americans in an exaggerating way. American sniper is the true story of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), a sniper who is now a sort of legend in the US army because he killed an estimated 255 persons during the Iraq war. This film exposes the hardships these warriors are exposed to and I think that's the most accomplished thing Eastwood (the director) does here. Making sure that the war at home is just as intense as the reality, as the war in Iraq. <br/><br/>The movie also shows an interesting relationship with the family of Kyle, showing that it's hard for his wife too. One of the most heartbreaking scene is when we see kyle back home and his wife trying to communicate, he does not answer like if was not in this room, like if he still was in Iraq  But that's all, in this film you don't learn anything more about C.Kyle, and the end of the movie does not give more explanations. <br/><br/>To conclude this movie is very entertaining but does not have an objective look to what really happened and to who is really Kyle Korver : As for me murder does not make a person a hero."

"jolly_miller","6","3","14","13 February 2015"," Worth A Watch, But Not The Hype
","In brief the story is based on truth. An idyllic American patriot, personified in what is now an American legend. Chris Kyle played by Bradley Cooper is that living legend, a slightly lost American man whose heart strings were slightly more than tugged on that fatal day, September 11 2001. We see him watch the tragic event unfold like millions of others all over the world on the television. And it is that ammunition that fires him into joining the seals and serving tours of Iraq. Becoming hell bent on killing as many 'enemy' soldiers as possible. Which is what drove him to fame, his kill count soon became the largest in American history. <br/><br/>The story briefly, but only briefly touches on the tragedies of war and the true victims. Which is the local people living under a regime that makes them fear for their life. But the only time that we get to witness this is when an Iraqi father and son are forced into helping the American soldiers, which consequently leads to their public brutal murder. We see Iraqi women helping such murderers and an Iraqi child trying to pick up a bazooka to blow up and American tank. Which when thought over, shows the inherent hate these people have for foreign invaders. However, I don't think we are supposed to sympathise with them. You don't have your natural war cliché characters which is good news. Usually you have to waste your attention on a gun hoe loon and a completely irrelevant comedic character during popcorn war films. Although in regards to the cinematography, the film doesn't quite know where it sits. With shaky hand held cameras, to sophisticated birds eye views, to a heavy usage of CGI. A strange cross between Green Zone, which is your typical 'popcorn' war film and Hurt Locker, which was a far rougher, grittier interpretation.<br/><br/>The problem with keeping the storyline so strict to the truth is the film is spread over a time span of 15 years. Which is quite a long time to follow someone who's changing quite rapidly. And it is because of that I never really felt connected to the character. Even as a non American it was obvious that he had a good heart and intentions. But I am someone who looks into the more politically motivated scenes behind the war. Understanding that there isn't necessarily 'baddies' and 'goodies'. Either way we are quite quickly told that the Iraqis are the 'baddies' and American's are the 'goodies'. <br/><br/>Cooper is very much in the limelight of recent years. After his success in The Hangover he has done well to shake off that comedic typecast. (Silver Linings Play Book, American Hustle, Limitless). However, and I'm no Texan but I can tell when Coopers accent fails him, and it does a few times throughout the movie. Saying that he fitted the bill very well, nothing outstanding but a likable and realistic portrayal. <br/><br/>I wonder and fear for the films intentions. It seems very much like a film that interprets war as a game. Kill counts were at the start of most conversations between soldiers. All boasting that Kyle was a 'legend' for so many kills and many wishing they were just like him. The movie certainly glorifies killing in the name of your country. 'Country, god, family' is a line that made me cringe. But overall, Kyle is distant from his wife, children and home life. His lack of mental stability when trying to integrate back into civilian life hardly depicts a model father or husband. I only hope that those with a smaller attention span would have waited around to see the end and not run out to enlist."

I don't mind to say why I think the Transformers movies have been huge disappointments or why another movie was not in ""too slow"" but rather it was moody and atmospheric. However, after watching American Sniper I was sheepish to admit that I had felt more than just a bit restless and bored in the theater. I felt a little bit like I just ""didn't get it"" which made me feel bad and I felt a little perhaps unpatriotic in not clapping in admiration when it was over (there was clapping and one guy upon exiting the theater remarked about he was surprised that the applause wasn't more exuberant).<br/><br/>I will not pose this review as a conversation on what the message of the movie was or if it did not paint a true picture of Chris Kyle, although those are both rich topics to delve into. Even if this were not based on a true story, if Chris Kyle had been a fictional character, I do not feel the film did enough to investigate him. There was the scene that from his childhood where his father told him that in that family they did not raise sheep or wolves, but rather sheepdogs. This was our evidence that Kyle had a savior complex, but I don't think it was enough. There was the scene, again as a kid, where Kyle's dad praises his son's take down of a deer and that he had a special talent. Again, not enough depth to explain what made Kyle ticked. Instead we have four tours of duty played out in full and monotonous detail. I became more invested when Kyle was between tours and back home, trying to fit into life. If these tours were used more as flashbacks and related more through comparison and contrast into that ""ordinary"" life a better pacing would have been achieved.<br/><br/>I read that Steven Spielberg had almost made this move and that he had taken a slightly different approach as an entry point. He would have brought the enemy sniper more into focus. Showing that the two snipers were two sides of the same coin and that perhaps war isn't about good and evil or if it is, it is from the vantage of where you stand. Maybe this would have been too similar to Enemy at the Gates, I'm not sure. I do think it would have made the movie more interesting for me at least.<br/><br/>I do know several people that liked this movie. People that are reasonable and intelligent and who hold opinions that I would usually consider.

","Wow this is a film that has polarised opinion - and I think incorrectly.<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way first. The second Iraq war, which is where this film was based, was one of the most illegal and immoral wars in modern times for which the two main culprits (and those behind who were pulling the strings) should be behind bars in The Hague at the start of a life sentence (which, frankly, would be far less than they deserve).<br/><br/>BUT... the film is not about that. It is not a film about the Iraq War, it's a biopic about one soldier who fought in it. As such it takes his view of things, and sees it entirely through his eyes. And these eyes belonged to almost stereotype - a Fox News-watching, right- wing America-luvvin, Bible-toting, gun-carrying, Texan who sees the world in entirely black and white. Indeed had he not really existed I think the film might have been accused of wild exaggeration.<br/><br/>Remarkably he claims not to be a red-neck, though interestingly only on a technicality.<br/><br/>Indeed by all accounts if anything they calmed him down a bit, missing out his claims to have shot looters after Hurricane Catrina. Even so he still does come across as not very pleasant, nor particularly bright, describing the enemy in nothing but derogatory terms, really believing that but for him they'd be invading the USA tomorrow, and completely failing to imagine what he would do if the boot was on the other foot.<br/><br/>As such the film is close to brilliant. It really does capture Kyle in all his red-neck ""glory"" without going over the top, to the extent it seems that fellow red-necks love it.<br/><br/>But that is not all. Rarely has a film depicted the problems faced when the ""hero"" returns home so well, both the problems for him and those around him, and how only by being with fellow veterans does he begin to come down - as perhaps only they understand. <br/><br/>As for the in-theatre stuff, it is very well done indeed. Yes, the Iraqis come over as 100% evil one-dimensional moving targets - but that is how Kyle saw them, and this is a biopic (remember?).<br/><br/>Performances? Bradley Cooper, who is in just about every scene (as he has to be) is stand out. A remarkable performance he inhabits this complex but also simple character like a glove. He is superb.<br/><br/>So spend some time with this flawed individual, and be thankful I think that you never had to be with the real thing."

","The movie is not anti-war, as some have argued. It is anti-warmonger, and definitely shows many of the hassles a sincere warrior must endure, especially the misunderstanding received at home and in war. My only real criticism of this movie is that, like ""The Mockingbird Part 1."" it is screened in a slightly vertically compressed form, making vertical dimensions at least 10 per cent less, making most of the actors seem stocky, and scenery heights with characters in the shot seem lower than scenery without characters. Jason Hall is not that buff, in spite of working out for the part. In one scene, in the Iraq base, one character is seen lifting makeshift weights. Unfortunately, the weights shown are about twice the weight lifted during the Olympics, and this attempt to depict the SEALS as brawn not brain is misguided. Overall, Hall plays Kyle in a very understated way, showing much of the ingrained humility and humanity of the few true exceptional warriors I have met or commanded. How action affects warriors, and how non-combatants misunderstand them or simply do not care, comes out strongly. The movie is slow, much slower than (say) ""The Hurt Locker"" or ""The Green Zone"" but manages to maintain interest. It is good that it was made soon enough after Kyle's death to be released while the relevant combat is still underway, to show those who claim to support war that there are severe effects on the humanity of all involved, and that these effects do not vanish when the troops come home."

","Nudity has never added to a good story line. In fact, thanks to the section under Parents Guide, I've managed to avoid watching the movies containing lascivious content. 
My guess is... this is how most of depraved Hollywood directors get producers to fund their film expenses. Offer a pervert to be on the set while filming the nude shot for a price.
There is absolutely nudity of a topless female standing in front of a window.

","I was very reluctant to see this movie, but then decided that I should see it because it is so popular. I liked some of Eastwood movies and did not like this one. It was just one killing after the other.<br/><br/>I did not pay for it. Thanks for that. I did not enjoy the movie, I do not enjoy watching people killing other people. I did not enjoy the implication that this war was okay and what the US did over there was okay. There are these millions of Nazi films showing how effective the German military was. Does that make it right?Should we glorify certain Nazis because they were good at what they were doing?<br/><br/>Obviously Clint Eastwood as director and Bradley Cooper as producer and star knew exactly which trigger points to use to get the average non-thinking American to get into the movie theater and like this movie.. While we are now dealing with thousands mental and bodily cripples in this country due to this war , this guy obviously got over his killing spree without problems. The number of disabled veterans has jumped by 25 percent since 2001 _ to 2.9 million _ and the cause really is no mystery. And as we are hearing in the news a lot of the Veterans seeking help get ignored by the authorities. While the companies who were working as non military support in these wars made a killing financially. I would have applauded this movie if it would have shown much more how the life of these soldiers who signed up for these wars, was destroyed by it. How the life of the soldier's families got ruined by killed or disabled family members who served. <br/><br/>There was no reason for this war in the first place and we all have to live with the consequences for the next decades. This is why so many veterans commit suicide, this is why we have veterans running amok with PTSD or just drop out of regular life. In former wars like the WWs for example, everybody had to serve and when they came back all of them had the same experience. In these wars with the voluntary army you have a few who have to carry the burden and are deployed over and over again until they are mentally or bodily destroyed. <br/><br/>Military is brainwashing. Brainwashing somebody to become a killing machine without thinking. Just following orders. Will that ever stop?"
"Leofwine_draca","7","3","16","17 April 2017"," Eastwood comes up trumps again
","American Sniper is another true tale boasting exemplary direction from Clint Eastwood, nowadays a master craftsman in his elder years. The subject of the film is the American invasion of Iraq in the early 2000s, and the film follows the path of a famed sniper who chalked up an endless amount of enemy kills during his multiple tours of duty.<br/><br/>Like THE HURT LOCKER, this is a gritty and realistic film that seeks to get into the heads of the soldiers involved on the ground. It does so admirably, building up a fine psychological portrait of the main character, and Bradley Cooper impresses in a role in which he mains himself virtually unrecognisable from the brash, handsome leading man so familiar to audiences from his roles in LIMITLESS and THE A-TEAM among many others.<br/><br/>The film features plenty of battle footage in the form of chases, shoot-outs, and a suspenseful siege situation. Obviously, sniping plays a big part in the action and the sniper scenes are hard-hitting and realistic; I also appreciated the moral dilemma bits that are presented throughout. The bits back home are less enthralling, although the climax is very well achieved and Sienna Miller gives her best performance yet."

The acting support is simply not there, Mustafa character is not develop enough to trigger any decent thrill or dialectic. It's quite boring in fact after about 1 hour. The family fights are long, unwelcome, redundant and badly act. Bradley Cooper makes a good Texan red neck. In fact the real Kyle is even more controversial. Watch him on YTube. The story of Kyle, pretending to have knock down Jesse Ventura at a SEALs party is quite pretentious & greedy (for the purpose to increase books sales). Ventura won more than one million $ in court for that fairy tale. Ventura didn't even know Kyle before the book release and have probably never been close to him physically.

"drqshadow-reviews","6","2","9","14 May 2015"," A Strong Action-Heavy War Film That Hints at, But Ultimately Skirts, Deeper Meaning
","Chris Kyle, sniper extraordinaire and lightning rod for many reasons (some of which are entirely of his own creation), gets the close-up treatment in an appropriately controversial film. Much of the popular criticism centers around Kyle's casual, almost matter-of-fact tone about the inevitability of American military involvement in Iraq and a simplistic, one-dimensional perspective on the native combatants. From what I gather, much of that was toned down from his autobiography, on which this was based, and on the screen it's somewhat more excusable. In an industry that's already seen the likes of Rambo and Commando, it's hardly the first to commit that sin, though it does remove us a bit from reality and make the production's more grounded, thoughtful aspects a bit tougher to swallow. American Sniper's battle scenes are a major strength, intense and morally-exhausting, but occasionally they drift into idol worship and stretch to assure the audience that his strikes were justified. Kyle's descent from suave, charismatic bar-denizen to haunted, self-righteous battlefield legend is a difficult but effective journey, well-managed by Bradley Cooper in the leading role. The frequent hints and nudges about his struggles with PTSD on the homefront are nicely done, too, right up until the closing moments when the film spontaneously lurches into a tacky fairy-tale ending that felt so jarring and undeserved, I wondered if it might be a dream sequence. It's better than I feared it might be, but asks many more questions than it answers and quite often falls short of delivering on teased potential. As snapshots of a superstar's life behind the scope, and behind the battle lines, it works. As a finished thought on the man himself? Not quite."
"deltaforce7","3","5","35","3 April 2015"," Confused movie full of 2-dimentional cardboard characters
","I would like to make this review about the movie in question, while avoiding as much political rhetoric as possible. This site is not a political publication, so we all should concentrate on talking about movies here. I cannot believe how primitive and illogical this movie turned out. I expected something deeper and more believable from Clint Eastwood (don't know why, but I did). What is there to like in this movie? Well, maybe some good camera-work, some FX, such as the sand storm scene. Those turned out fine. What's so illogical about this film? Many things are.<br/><br/>For instance: 1) The main character who considers himself such a dedicated, G-d fearing Christian doesn't think twice about stealing from a church (although it is just an old Bible, but theft is theft, especially from a place of prayer; Kyle never reads this Bible, though. Some Christian.). 2) Then, this same dedicated ""christian"" eagerly runs on multiple killing sprees all over the world shooting not just adult male combatants, but also women and children -- all based on what he saw once on CNN. Isn't it just lovely? The CNN folks don't blink twice before telling everyone about Australia building a wall on the border with SLOVENIA. A wall. On the border.<br/><br/>It order to feel good about these killings, the main character just calls the people of Iraq ""savages"". According to this movie, it must be cool to be killing ""savages"", if CNN tells you so. But then again, since ""...In real life Chris Kyle and his fellow SEALs were such big fans of GI Joe that they named their vehicles after 2 of the characters..."", there is no reason to expect any extreme intelligence there. 3) Being an experienced sniper, the main character occupies same poorly protected and not tremendously well hidden spots for hours, making multiple kills without ever worrying about being detected and taken down with an RPG or a mortar, although later on one single shot made by Kyle causes his team to be immediately noticed and what looks like hundreds of enemy combatants attack the team. Kyle's spotters don't ever do any spotting. They just sit down somewhere making jokes or snoozing. I guess that Clint Eastwood is not really familiar with some basic principles of sniping and doesn't really know that a long-zoom rifle scope usually produces a very narrow field of view that makes it hard to see ""the big picture"" around you. So this Kyle character goes on identifying targets, correcting for wind and temperature, taking targets down all on his own while endlessly chatting on the radio and on his phone. What a marvelous fairy-tale! 4) He constantly loses expensive equipment, such as a sat phone, a customized sniper rifle, and he never gets reprimanded for it. Then eventually his comrades practically lose him in a sand storm. 5) Counter-sniping in this movie never involves any use of artillery or air assets. All the snipers just run from/after one another while dodging bullets. Counter-sniping done western-style.<br/><br/>While true patriotism is admirable and there must be more movies made depicting it, this film is full of what is called ""patriotic garbage"" in its purest form, which is very unfortunate, because it cheapens image of a real patriot. Most of the ""civilian"" scenes are nothing but clichés and they merely water down the action. So, generally speaking, this could've been a great dramatic and action movie, but it leaves a comic-book impression with compete and utter disregard for any aspects of morality. Certain scenes are obvious plagiarisms ""borrowed"" from Top Gun and Black Hawk Down. When a director lacks his own original ideas, it is a HUGE 'minus'. This movie seems to be highly rated and well accepted by other CNN/Fox viewers. Not a 'plus'."
"tedg","Null","3","17","2 June 2015"," Focus
","I watched this like many others, consuming a rather simple story. Superficially, we are to admire this soul, both as an individual and representative of a collective who 'serve' us. As with Forgiven, we have some subtle exit from the story in the direction of despair for the country.<br/><br/>Along the way we have several other stories. In fact, the whole kick in the chest is that Chris Kyle didn't matter at all. <br/><br/>One extra story is that in his eighties, Clint Eastwood is still making films, competently. Any studio is eager to work with him because he is economically focused, doing what is needed only, and cleanly. In a way, Clint is the film model for this stereotype: cowboy, deadly, focused on the mission but quietly preoccupied. Tracking Clint (and Woody and Ridley) through their films is a lesson in mature creativity. <br/><br/>Clint is also a student of film history and appreciates the exploitable quality of neonoir. A key element in traditional noir is a regular guy caught up in forces not of his control. The other key element is that his life is manipulated by the viewers collectively. Neonoir adds some on-screen collective that the viewers join. A layered tension is in how the hero fights with this manipulative force, joined with our unease at being part of that force.<br/><br/>How Clint exploits that here: We identify with the hero in some ways. We would love for evil to be discrete, identifiable and killable. Slinky, dirty babbling people are handy tokens. We also identify with the nation that created this mess nearly from scratch. It is us that in some recognizable measure (in this film) that has ruined this simple man.<br/><br/>About the story itself<br/><br/>I have a study of men who as filmmakers integrate their creative work with their lovers as actress. It is a pretty amazing thing to see collectively and presents a sort of meta-love story more powerful than the tales we see in the on-screen story. Clint himself has done this when younger.<br/><br/>But what about when a filmmaker is past sex, when hormones are no longer harnessable in the service of creative power? It isn't celibacy, because there is no tense denial. It is always in the context of memories of loves sustained, and costs of passion. And it is always there, always. Watch how he says goodbye, first to Iraq, then to the family."

Still, until the very end, I assumed that Eastwood directed a satire about US and US attitudes towards war. Then I came to IMDb to check out what other people thought about the film and I realized thatit wasn't a satire!? I don't know what Eastwood was thinking when he was directing this one, but, being a huge Eastwood fan over the years, I am disappointed to say the least. Unfortunately, some people don't seem know when they have crossed a line and, also, they don't seem to have true friends to tell them that are in the wrong path."

","A technically perfect film but c'mon you knew that even before the title rolled. Eastwood, formerly the #1 film star in the world (which makes me how old?) knows more about framing a shot than most other directors have forgotten.<br/><br/>It is above all else a biography, and those are not common in Tinseltown anymore. The rules for bios are different. There was George C Scott as Patton and Burt Lancaster as Jim Thorpe ... etc.<br/><br/>These were not dramas. These were not entertainment. They were ..... shadows of what was.<br/><br/>One of the problems with bios is that they tend to be tied to the era of the of the main character and that too limits commercial long term appeal.<br/><br/>Which is why even now the Biography channel has made more bios than Hollywood ever did ... or ever will.<br/><br/>And it is also a tragedy. On many levels. On the obvious level (the ending, no spoilers). And on the metaphysical level. One has to wonder how kind history will be to the Iraq incursion 50 years from now? A lot of things change over time. We work the Germans and Japanese today without any problem. WW2 films do not have the popularity they used to. So where will American Sniper be in 50 years? Just asking.<br/><br/>The acting is understated because that is what you do in a bio. Miller is stunning even without her usual blonde hair.<br/><br/>Almost a guilty pleasure in its own way.

This movie has both a love affair and the war drama you would expect from a movie about an American sniper, but neither really catches on. The part of the movie in between deployments doesn't really do anything for the story, and it really reduces the overall impression of this movie. It seems as though this part of the movie hasn't really received as big an effort as the parts when he is deployed in Iraq. <br/><br/>The combat scenes are very convincing, they reminded me of Black Hawk Down, and you really can't put a finger on those parts.

","American Sniper tells the story of Chris Kyle, an Iraqi war veteran and Navy SEAL who during four tours of duty became known as America's most deadly sniper. A good 'ol boy from Texas who spent much of his early adulthood without purpose, attempting to be a cowboy and getting into fights. This all changes when our embassy's are bombed in Africa and the American public first hears of Al-Qaeda. Kyle finds his purpose and enlists in the Navy.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is excellent as Kyle and deserving of his third consecutive Oscar nod. The rest of the cast of primarily unknowns performs well under the steady direction of Clint Eastwood. Make no mistake that, although this is a tale of duty and sacrifice, Eastwood's conservative leanings are more than readily apparent. Also, the fact that it is based on Kyle's own book leaves us with a feeling we aren't being told the whole story, or at least not objectively.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many people have a difficult time separating the soldier who is doing his job and following orders from the politics that sent him or her there. This clouds their view of what for the most part is an entertaining and well crafted film.<br/><br/>We feel for his family as they miss him each time he gets deployed and how they cope when Kyle comes home, struggling to find normalcy. Kyle is besieged with the sounds and visions of the battlefield when home and consistently dwells on his unfinished business overseas. <br/><br/>The combat scenes are well done and impactful. However, the constant reminder that he is ""a legend"" in the military community, from people he meets at home and abroad, gets to be a little tiresome after a while. I also thought his personal battle against a skilled Iraqi sharpshooter named ""Mustafa"" was a little ham-handed.<br/><br/>In the end Eastwood crafts a film that effectively shows the horrors of combat and how those horrors deeply affect the soldier's home life. I leave the decision of whether Kyle is an all-American Hero or perhaps something else, up to you."

"themonkeewrench","6","4","29","28 March 2015"," Worth the Watch
","Reading through so many reviews on here and it is simply making my blood boil. Most of them, I have found to be more personal opinion based on the guys actual life and/or profession and their personal views on the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, that any movie review is completely obscure. The reviews are in fact more propaganda than the movie in which they are reviewing. <br/><br/>So here is MY movie review: #1. This movie is a typical ""War"" Movie. It has action scenes that are filled with suspense that will keep you engaged. #2. The Role of Chris Kyle was convincingly played throughout most of the film. #3. Director Clint Eastwood, does take an artistic view and adaptation of Chris Kyle's Autobiography, American Sniper, to which I think shares between a 50 and 60% likeness to the book. #4. The ending of the movie, does evoke emotion and admirable respect for a man who would have died for his country, brother frogmen, and the Marines that he frequently provided overwatches for. <br/><br/>I think that the movie would have been better had they stayed more with Chris Kyle's words, than with these artistic directions that had augmented the story toward more of a propaganda role. He shouldn't have made Chris' decision to join the military in response to political causes, but should have acutely and astutely shown us that Chris had always been a patriot and had been considering the military as a viable career option even before he joined up with the rodeo. <br/><br/>Even with these things, the movie is still worth the watch. <br/><br/>It is important to know before watching that this movie isn't about convincing anyone over the political aspects of the Iraq war. It isn't about why we got into the war or whether it was justified or not. And I think that is just as well, because in life, Chris Kyle didn't really care if it was a ""justified"" war, or a politically correct war, as some would want to judge it as. For him, the U. S. Government, called him into war, pulled him out onto the front lines to perform the job that the government has trained him to do, which is to kill enemies of our nation and of our soldiers. He put it very clearly. He didn't care about a single Iraqi. He wasn't over there to protect them, or to bring democracy to their nation. He was there to save the butts of the Marines, Army and other SEALs from immediate harm and/or certain death.<br/><br/>I have found it odd over the months that so many people empathize more with 160 people he killed than the unknown quantity of American lives that he has saved. It wasn't killing or the thrill of that made him shoot. It was saving the lives of his team, Marines, and Army, anyone he was watching over. They lived because HE had their backs. Every time he killed an Iraqi with an RPG, he brought home another soldier to their family. That is why he didn't want to quit. He found it intolerable to stand on the sideline and watch his brothers die, especially when he had the ability to save them. <br/><br/>People are content with labeling him, and sure at times all labels apply from the right perspective. But I am sure that the service men, he helped to save, I bet their families are forever grateful that he didn't hesitate to pull that trigger."

","American Sniper was an interesting look at the life of sniper Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American history, and his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (P.T.S.D.) or it could have been. The acting was very good, especially from Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle. Unfortunately, all of the other characters in the film were focused on so little that they sort of just fall into the shadow of Chris Kyle. The military shootouts and white-knuckle decisions were masterfully done. It should be noted that there were a couple of scenes involving gruesome scenes with young children that could be very uncomfortable to watch for some people. As hinted at earlier, the scenes at home, where Chris Kyle had to face his inner demons and watch as he and his wife slowly fall apart were very underwhelming and often ended way too quickly without answering or addressing anything other than pointing out that there is a problem over and over again. The resolution of this film was WAY to fast and lacked any emotional impact. Many military movies had great shootouts and action scenes, so this movie needed something to stand out from just a bland movie, and while it had a huge opportunity to do that, it did not take it. The movie was very black and white and did not explore the moral gray areas of war as much as it could have. This is not a bad film. It just does not deserve be known as one of the best military films ever made. To summarize this movie in one word: overrated."

","Of course Clint Eastwood is a great film director and this movie is technically very good. The fighting and shooting scenes are particularly well filmed. But in what concerns contents it is just only passable. This is based on the true story of Chris Kyle an American that decides to enroll himself in a special army corps after he sees on TV the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in New York. He becomes a special shot of exceptionally good aim who kills lots of enemies in Iraq as a sniper which makes him a legend. He can shoot them at such long distances that might make it a bit unlikely in the view of anyone who has served in the army even if he uses always a telescopic sight. He goes there in four tours leaving wife and two kids at home something that his wife doesn't particularly appreciate. The story in itself is not more dramatic than in most war movies. It has nothing special to be marked."

I believe this is a movie that is not to be seen if you don't share that American ""patriotic"" feeling, since all it did to me and my friends was to make us angry. The movie only shows that American propaganda of how they are these heroes and protectors, while the Iraqis are only savages who deserve to die.

"ethanmidd","7","2","11","31 January 2015"," Not Eastwood's Best But Not His Worst
","In my opinion, I don't think Eastwood has made a great movie since Gran Torino. Changeling and Invictus are good; J. Edgar and Jersey Boys are okay films. However, those movies did not give me an impact like Gran Torino. Unfortunately, American Sniper did not do that but I still overall enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood does a good job on giving suspense. I could feel the tension with the audience members and a sigh of relief when the movie immediately does to another scene. The film does it consistently and it really doesn't get tiresome. Even though I could feel the tension, I really wasn't on the edge of my seat at all like the audience. I think the only reason why I didn't feel this way was because I already knew about Chris Kyle. Those who don't know anything about him were probably more interested than me.<br/><br/>One thing that I really appreciate about this movie is that it shows the effect of what happens after you leave the war. I mean I felt bad for this guy many time because it was haunting what he was going through. However, there were scenes that involved Sienna Miller's character and those scenes broke my heart. I won't spoil it but goodness it is heart wrenching.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper did an excellent job. How he gained weight for the role and talking with that thick slurred accent helped me feel like I was not looking at Bradley Cooper. It's not my favorite performance (it's American Hustle) but he did do a good job. I don't believe his performance is Oscar worthy though. I just thought there were other performances that I thought were better. Sienna Miller also did a great job. I feel like she's under looked because of Cooper and also because there fantastic female performances. I'm telling you though she is good and those scenes that I mentioned earlier will prove my point. <br/><br/>I don't believe this film really deserves a nomination for best picture or actor. The movie itself and Cooper's performance just did not hit me with an impact like some other movies and actors. However, American Sniper does an excellent job on showing how war can traumatize those who fought for our nation. There were some scenes that felt incredibly long, but there were also moments that were heartbreaking. If you don't know the story of Chris Kyle, then you are definitely in for a ride."
"LouisGur","5","2","11","23 January 2015"," Not really sure if I like this movie, or hate it for that matter.
","Eastwood is back! One of the best directors in Hollywood. As soon as this movie was announced I added it to my watch list without knowing the plot or anything. Several years later, I saw that an actor I had been following for a very long time (Kyle Gallner) was going to be in it which made me more excited for it. I still didn't know the plot though. Time went by, and suddenly it came out. It got zero nominations at the golden globes so I thought it was just another bad Eastwood movie, but a week later it was announced that it had been nominated for 6 academy awards. Now I had to go see it.<br/><br/>American Sniper is as you may hear on the title a war film. The story focuses on a man named Chris Kyle, who decides to join the navy in his thirties. He becomes a sniper for SEAL and is sent to Iraq. If you've been on the internet the latest days, you've probably noticed that this film has lead to a lot of debate on the internet. That's not surprising in my opinion. It's really hard to make movies about wars these days. There will always be people who only wants to know if the movie is patriotic or not. However, unlike many user reviews I will not be focusing on my actual opinion about the Iraq war.<br/><br/>There are both good and bad things about American Sniper. First off, I must say that Bradley Cooper is very well casted as Chris Kyle. He actually fit pretty perfect for the role. The movie wasn't only about war. It focused a lot on homecoming, how it is for Chris to return home to his family from the Iraq war. This is portrayed very well in the film. I think Clint Eastwood should have focused more on that part instead of the war. <br/><br/>The scenes in Iraq were often too long and sometimes kind of meaningless to the story overall. I'm not sure if the point is to feel like a patriot or an anti-American when you watch those scenes. I experienced both things, although the movie of course had to be a little patriotic at some parts. But that's what military is about. If you want to protect your country, you have to be a patriot (as they say in the film).<br/><br/>American Sniper also had a few touching moments. But most of the time they were basically introduced and then forgotten for the rest of the movie. I probably like this film though, but I'm still not sure. Of course I don't want to see a movie that's patriotic throughout, but if you compare this to Zero Dark Thirty and similar movies I didn't really feel there was too much off it. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has directed a pretty unpleasant experience, that is both good and bad. It's definitely worth checking out. I'm however a bit surprised it received so many Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>However, I really dislike how this movie is advertised. It is basically marketed as a teen war thriller with Robert Patinson in the main role. That's why the audience I watched this movie with, was pretty annoying. I guess half of them didn't even know what the Iraq war actually was (teens in Europe don't really know about it too well)."
"rubenm","6","3","21","3 March 2015"," American snafu
","As far as I can remember, this is the fifth movie I've seen about the Iraq wars, after 'Three Kings', 'Route Irish', 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Green Zone'. From those five, 'American Sniper' is the most patriotic, the most war-justifying, the most pro-US. But it's also the most shallow and the most one-dimensional. <br/><br/>In a way, it has the same set-up as an other classic American war-movie: The Deer Hunter. Blue collar, well-meaning young guys sign up for the army because they think it's a good thing to do. In the war, they get damaged beyond repair. When they return home, it's impossible to pick up their old life. <br/><br/>So far for the similarities. Whereas The Deer Hunter delves deep into the psyche of the soldiers, and into the way the war changes their lives, American Sniper stays on the surface of what really happens. The film only offers simple statements and easy explanations. By linking 9/11 to Iraq, the film also deliberately makes an historical error. <br/><br/>As a Hollywood blockbuster, 'American Sniper' is entertaining and efficient. But as the historical document director Clint Eastwood probably had in mind, it's disappointing. Not because it's too patriotic, but because it underestimates its audience."
"rik-taylor-72-242302","6","3","21","18 January 2015"," Very American and like a skipping stone across Kyle's life
","American Sniper follows the life of Chris Kyle, Americas most prolific sniper with 160 confirmed kills of men, woman and children. The film takes us from when he was a boy, learning from his dad, through his enrolment and training and his tours in Iraq up to his death. <br/><br/>It was interesting watching him having to make quick decisions early on in terms of taking the shot or not but it soon became repetitive when he embarked on the second tour, becoming even boring for anyone who knew that he died in a shooting accident back in America. The whole film just felt like it was glorifying American soldiers and like a tribute to Chris Kyle rather than telling a complete story. We never really got to know any of the other soldiers in his team making it hard to be bothered when some of them die. We never really see what happens to his brother, he sees him once and then he's gone. There's a big scene in which we see him learning life lessons from his father as a boy but his dad never comes back into it. Even with his wife it feels like every time he comes home it's just filler waiting for him to go back and there's no clear story or emotional build up there.<br/><br/>Overall I was disappointed with the way the film went. Maybe if it just focused more on one of the tours rather than spreading out and showing little bits of each it would have been more complete. Or if it had gone more into the PTSD aspect, instead it just showed he had a problem but then in the end he seemed to just get over it."
"emilwijeweera","5","4","33","30 June 2019"," A watchable, competent but morally irresponsible film
","Well, I did not want to pay money to see this but saw it last night on ITV (UK).
I am not a Clint hater; I loved Gran Torino and Flags of our Fathers, I even loved Clint's Dirty Harry outings, especially Magnum Force.
American Sniper is watchable competently directed, but I think the writing is pretty below standard, considering the importance of the subject matter. The film worries me as it leaves out important elements if this really supposed to reflect true events. If this was an action flick written as fiction, I would have no problem with it.<br/><br/>I have not read Chris Kyle's book, but knowledgeable reviewers have said that it is different from the film and he is far less noble than the film suggests. I also reject the premise that a sniper is a hero. Killing someone from a long way is skilful, not brave. The same goes for drone or apache pilots shooting up some guys with akm's when they don't even see you.<br/><br/>Others point to the propaganda in the film, which is obvious. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, yet this is never commented on by the troops. I have known a few guys who were in US army and marines. They are not all dumb robots, they ask questions and would wonder why they were in Iraq. None of this is discussed in the film. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people died in Iraq, in suicide bombings, crossfire and US action; none of this is mentioned. A good film gives context; this does not. In his Iwo Jima film, Eastwood shows the humanity of the Japanese, who committed some hideous acts when they invaded China and other Asian countries; where was the empathy for the Iraqis here?<br/><br/>I suspect that this film was made with the help of the US military; that would explain the lack of criticism of the US forces or policy. Any film made with military assistance will be biased towards it. This goes for war, action and disaster films. Note that Apocalypse Now was made in the Philippines using Hueys from Marcos' army.Coppola could never have used USA equipment.<br/><br/>The shooting of women and children is well directed and not glamourised, but then how could you show it otherwise? I don't know if women and kids actually used weapons like this in the insurgency, but if they did, Coopers portrayal is believable and sympathetic, until the second time he may have to shoot a boy trying to pick up an RPG. Wouldn't a decent Kyle try to scare the boy off with a warning shot instead of waiting for the boy to aim the weapon?<br/><br/>One good element is the reference to PTSD, but this more attention. Cooper is brilliant and Miller is believable as his eye-candy wife. I found the sudden end with the lack of dramatisation of Kyle's death a cop-out. The scenes of the funeral procession were also out of tune with the rest of the film, cheesy and playing to naive audiences. I felt guilty for watching this film but cannot deny that it is an engaging story, whatever parts are true."
"Enthouse","5","3","22","21 February 2015"," Not propaganda, but not a great movie either.
","First of all, I'd just like to point out that this movie was unbiased. I am not an American and I think politics is almost always futile.<br/><br/>This movie did nothing more than show us the life of Chris Kyle. Kyle is not portrayed as a hero or even someone likable. He's an ignorant, misinformed, violent man who's good with a gun. That's it. Of course, he's brave. Anyone who puts themselves in the line of fire is brave, but he has no heroic characteristics and this is what we see in the movie. To people who watched this and called Kyle a hero, and to those who called this movie propaganda, I'll say watch this again without your minds made up. If anything, this movie is a satirical criticism of Kyle.<br/><br/>To support my point: 1. He constantly refers to the Iraqis as ""bad guys"" and he is not concerned about providing some sort of security for the innocent Iraqis who helped the Americans. So he displays ignorance and apathy.<br/><br/>2. At one point, he even says that an Iraqi who was previously helping the ""bad guys"" and later died trying to help the Americans deserved to die because he had picked the wrong side. When living in a place like Iraq, people don't have the freedom to choose a side. That man was probably just trying to survive and provide for his family. Anyone with half a brain can figure that out.<br/><br/>3. After that man died, we see Iraqis who are expressing their anger at the soldiers. For viewers who couldn't figure out that Iraqis are actual human beings with feelings, this scene would at least cause them to doubt the soldiers' (and Chris Kyle's) actions. The camera then focuses on the skulls on the soldiers' tanks to further signify that to many Iraqis American soldiers are just killers, not saviours.<br/><br/>4. In another scene a soldier tells Kyle he doesn't know whether what they're doing in Iraq is right. Kyle responds with ""We're just here to kill bad guys"" or something along those lines. Kyle was shown as naive and simple-minded. Definitely not characteristics of a ""hero"".<br/><br/>5. After the scene in which that Iraqi child and man are both killed, those same people who provided the soldiers with intelligence, Kyle expresses no remorse. Because as long as the soldiers get what they need, who gives a crap about the innocent civilians of another country, right? What sort of a hero does that? <br/><br/>I could probably come up with plenty of other scenes if I gave it some more thought. This movie presented Chris Kyle as an ignorant man who was good with a gun. Clint Eastwood does not make him seem intelligent or likable or compassionate. Chris Kyle is NOT a hero. I wish people would stop calling him that and stop making it seem like the movie presents him as such.<br/><br/>On the other hand this move was well-made. It was shot and edited well. Bradley Cooper did a good job as Kyle. However, Kyle is just such a simple, uninteresting character that his life couldn't carry the movie. There is no conflict in his life. He just wants to shoot people. As a result, the movie has no plot and no structure. Kyle has no opinion on the impact of war, or anything really. The scenes with his girlfriend/wife just dragged on and the scenes during the war desperately need a direction and conclusion. There is not a single interesting, conflicted, intelligent character in this movie. I don't even know the point of this movie.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is dull. By the time, it got to his last tour I just wanted it to end. I even stopped paying attention during that sandstorm scene, even though I think that was supposed to be the climax. I'd say, watch it just to see what it's really about. Don't take the overemotional liberals' or conservatives' word for anything when going in to see it. You'll be surprised."
"alasdairwildman","7","3","22","15 January 2015"," I may be on the otherside of the planet but Bradley Cooper can still get a head shot on me.
","This film was surrounded by hype and the word ""Oscar"" has been thrown at it a lot, however it lacked something. At times it tried to be a classic Iraqi war film with houses and cars blowing up left, right and centre. In others it was slow and showed the impact of war on the soldiers and families. If one theme had simply been explored then the film probably could have blown us all away however it felt as if it tried be everything. Tried too hard to cater to the masses. That's not always a problem but can leave you wanting more. Wanting to know more about other characters. Wanting to know more about the relationships that have been built. <br/><br/>The film was enjoyable throughout but maybe I've just seen one too many war films that this one didn't quite capture me as much as I was hoping."

"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","2","12","27 January 2015"," Powerful movie with a limited scope
","American Sniper is on pace to become the most successful movie of 2014 and the most successful war movie of all time. Director Clint Eastwood's latest movie is a biopic of the life of a soldier, Chris Kyle, a Navy Seal who served four tours in Iraq and became the most successful sniper in American military history with 160 confirmed kills. Critics have generally been favorable, but a small vocal group has sharply criticized it for various reasons, including stereotyping Muslims and for overlooking some of Chris Kyle's personal vices. Regardless of your point of view, Eastwood has clearly struck a cultural nerve here. As a portrayal of American soldiers during the Iraq war, this movie will be hard to top, but its perspective is limited nonetheless. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, in an Oscar nominated performance, plays Chris Kyle as a confident go-getter. Kyle becomes a Navy Seal shortly after the al Qaeda bombings of the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, but the movie quickly moves to his first tour in Iraq. The character might sound like a giant boy scout, but Cooper plays the part very sincerely. <br/><br/>The film provides little sense of the causes of the Iraqi insurgency. Instead, Eastwood chooses to focus on Chris Kyle's battle experiences and the toll they place on him. (SPOILERS) The film's opening scene perfectly depicts the pressure that snipers are under during urban warfare when a mother and her child walk out of a building and attempt to throw a grenade at American soldiers. Kyle is visibly shaken by the prospect of shooting a woman and a child, but this doesn't stop him from doing his job or quell his pride. Kyle pushes himself to kill every insurgent and he puts himself down if any American is injured or killed. His fellow soldiers give him the nickname ""legend"" because they feel invincible when Kyle is protecting them. <br/><br/>Eastwood directs the sniper sequences very well, but the film somewhat degenerates into standard action movie fare when a Syrian Olympic sniper champion named Mustafa hunts down Chris Kyle after a bounty is placed on his head. Kyle is determined to kill this sniper because he has killed a few of his buddies. This revenge subplot, while entertaining, feels somewhat artificial in a movie that otherwise feels pretty authentic. Despite the pedestrian subplot, the last battle sequence is an epic shootout in the middle of a sandstorm that is visually amazing and very suspenseful.<br/><br/>Warfare is only half of the story though. Kyle is increasingly withdrawn every time he returns home between tours. His wife, played by Sienna Miller, feels her husband slipping away. While the theme of the soldier who cannot adjust when he comes home may be familiar, American Sniper depicts the conflict between a man's duty as a soldier and his duty to his family better than any movie I have seen. Posttraumatic stress disorder is also portrayed very authentically and respectfully. Eastwood deftly shows that war can nearly destroy a person even when they are not fighting. Ultimately, PTSD proves to be Kyle's downfall, but not in the way you might expect.<br/><br/>Much has been said of this film's blind acceptance of the Iraq war as a noble cause. This is not what I saw. Chris Kyle believes in the cause he is fighting for, and he does not regret killing to protect his soldiers, but this does not mean the movie endorses war. War is painful and clearly has a serious toll on everyone involved. The movie is subtly critical of Kyle's blind faith in the Iraq war in two key scenes where two of his fellow soldiers (including his brother) question the wisdom of the war. I believe that Kyle's refusal to accept these criticisms is how he keeps himself going, and just because the film does not outright condemn Kyle for his beliefs does not mean it supports the war itself. <br/><br/>The most controversial aspect of this movie is the portrayal of the Iraqis. Kyle and the rest of the soldiers repeatedly refer to them as savages, and there is no effort to really develop any of the Iraqi civilians. I understand the concerns about stereotyping, but anyone whose opinion of Muslims declines because of this movie was ignorant to begin with. <br/><br/>Still, I am torn on this portrayal of the Iraqis. A biopic demands that the film be told from Kyle's point of view. The fact is, soldiers see a lot of gruesome things, and Kyle's belief that the Iraqis are savages reflects the fact that there are some savages in Iraq. The ISIS videos should not leave any doubt in your mind about that. To an extent, I respect Eastwood for not kowtowing to politic correctness. <br/><br/>On the other hand, narrowly framing the Iraq War through an American soldier's point of view is indicative of the country's inability to really try to understand Iraqi points of view. The limitations of the biopic format give Eastwood an out, an excuse not to tackle this perspective. To do so might have offended the core audience this movie is geared to: American conservatives. This does not mean the movie has to defend al Qaeda or the insurgency, but a little bit of effort to portray Iraqis as something more than one dimensional stand ins would have gone a long way towards improving the film. <br/><br/>Eastwood has produced a film that will keep us arguing largely because we are still arguing about the Iraq war. I think the movie will stand the test of time for respectfully tackling the pressures faced by American soldiers, but it seems clear to me that a response is called for. We need a movie that tells the Iraqi point of view. If it does come out of Hollywood, I wouldn't expect it for a long time."

","First of all, hat's off to Clint Eastwood for such amazing directing, and also to Bradley Cooper for delivering an outstanding performance. The story itself is about a sniper at the Iraq-America war which is quite a sensitive topic. Automatically, your views about the war would affect your opinion of the movie, and since I am totally against it, I must say I was not moved much by the movie.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was going to focus more on the idea of how men are changed by the war, which it did but just not enough. I also thought it was sometimes a bit politically motivated to justify America's actions and illustrate the heroism of its soldiers.<br/><br/>All in all, it was not boring and it is impressive on the technical side, but it is probably aimed more towards American audience and not international audience."

","I was disappointed in this movie after reading the book some months earlier. In his autobiography Kyle is unsparing in his self-appraisal. Kyle tells us from the beginning that he is no hero and certainly no role model and proceeds to tell us why in unsettling detail: an extreme alcoholic with a violent temper, borderline abusive husband and initially a neglectful father, saved from jail time by overly indulgent judges, Kyle finds his purpose and a home as a Navy SEAL. Rather than show us the complete man, the movie is more an exercise in hero worship with typical American war heroics more at home in a WWII era film. It would have made a more complete and absorbing movie with a picture of the whole man as Kyle intended for us in his book. He found peace and was restoring the nearly broken relationships with his wife and children at the time of his death which made his death even more poignant. But that might have been too complex a tale for American audiences looking for a tale of good guys versus bad guys."

","Amid its unanticipated parade into this year's Oscar race (6 nominations including BEST PICTURE and BEST LEADING ACTOR) as an extremely late contender, and more astonishingly, its domestic box-office outburst since last week, Mr. Eastwood's biography of Chris Kyle, the most prolific Navy SEAL sniper, arrives to the fore in Egypt. <br/><br/>The film stirs a massive controversy in the states albeit it has achieved a career peak for the octogenarian film legend, as there is a pungent odor of jingoism permeating the narrative, particularly centers on its defamatory depiction of Muslin race in the Iraqi war zone, what is exacerbating is that under the current international circumstances, it doesn't help to dissipate the acute prejudice in the stateside, pitifully, Eastwood could not been more open-minded in his well-executed anti-war drama. <br/><br/>Conspicuously, this film is relentlessly sending an ant-war message from A to Z, but it could be shallowly misread as a bias propaganda simply because the whole perspective is from the slant of Americans, how perilous the front-line is, how the inner struggle comes to pester his conscience when Kyle (Cooper) is facing menaces from suicidal children and women, how devastating when the casualty befalls on your teammate, etc, while mistreating the middle east counterpart as canon fodder or barbarous murders (even towards their own kind). <br/><br/>Back to home, Kyle (Cooper)'s PTSD symptoms are zoomed in on empathetically, from his withdrawn numbness stiffly obstructing a normal communication with his wife Taya (Miller), to his fitful violent behavior due to his hallucination or an aggressive paranoid towards the quotidian life, Kyle's hero-status is not a desirable one, when praised by a young veteran (a delightful cameo from Jonathan Groff), whose life he once saved, Kyle's robotic reaction potently suggests that it means nothing to him, even though he proudly proclaims that saving lives is the noble cause for his actions. <br/><br/>Indeed, if one can discard the miasma of racial disrespect (frankly speaking, a very difficult task to pull off), Eastwood has made quite an engaging film to behold, the incontrovertible grip to his brainchild can be traced seamlessly through the horizon-widening hovering shots by DP Tom Stern, the stifling sound department throughout the taut action sequences, the life-or-death suspense within one trigger by its swift editing and an end-game retreat in a lifelike sand storm. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper gives a formidable performance here, a sea change in his physique is too evident to ignore, but Kyle's elusive persona doesn't proffer too much Oscar-worthy moments for his, we can only assume that Academy is still in the honeymoon period with him, three nominations in a row is an overachiever (especially considering the über- competitive candidates this year) which seems to boomerang within certain time (as the case for my ginger goddess Amy Adams). Sienna Miller, whose career has been in the stagnant water for years, certainly receives a stimulating boost this year, after a small part in another Oscar-hopeful FOXCATCHER (2014), her role as a supportive wife pans out convincingly without any bells and whistles to enliven Taya to be a character with any noteworthy novelty, only to testify she has honed up her acting chops and can shoulder on some more challenging projects now.<br/><br/>American SNIPER cannot evade to be compared with Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER (2008, 8/10), which is far more humane and non judgmental in its integrity. Theoretically it could have been a top dog in its game, but Eastwood's right-wing stand does taint its wholesome awesomeness, however as far as profit is concerned, we onlookers should not bark at the moon, it certainly eclipses everybody's expectations, there is no losers in this round, notwithstanding that it is a shade pathetic the sensation falls upon this ill-devised picture."

","As a veteran myself i think there is probably no other man in history will ever be more decorated in war as a sniper than Chris Kyle. this movie is not only motivating but it's also an i opener for what his life was like and what you see through the eyes of the scope. If you have read the book you know exactly what i'm talking about. I think the sad part is that all some people will see is a movie that they feel is made solely to make money and tell a story of a true warrior who survived multiple engagements and then was unfortinatley killed in a terrible shooting at a gun range. this movie portrays the life of an American hero and someone who loved his family i truly commend clint eastwood for taking this movie into realm and making it an instant war classic and helping chris kyles legacy live on in our memory"

","I thought this movie was pretty terrible. Not quite I wish I could purge the memory from my soul terrible but definitely I wish I could get that time back terrible. I know many people are criticizing the film for it's political stance but I think that's a bit unfair just on principle. The problems with this movie go beyond that however. The scene where Kyle's credo of Sheep/Sheepdog/Wolf is introduced was just poorly done as a scene and it didn't flow naturally with the movie on top of that. It was like they finished filming the movie and realized this line that he's strongly associated with was missing and hired a couple of random people off the street to improvise a scene using the line then spliced whatever they came up with into the movie at a completely random point. The scene of young Kyle hunting with his dad was not quite as poorly handled but felt similarly superfluous. The real problem with the movie which can't be tied to any specific moment however was it's failure to really humanize Kyle. I'm not a cold person by any means and I simply felt nothing at the end of the movie when it's hero met his tragic end. It was like hearing a death statistic, I just acknowledged the fact there was one less person on the planet without really any empathy for those lives who were effected by that event. Filming and Acting were decent for the most part but nothing to make up this movies shortcomings."
"Laakbaar","7","2","15","25 February 2015"," The story of Chris Kyle
","Setting the political issues aside, I enjoyed this movie. It provided insight into the life and culture of Chris Kyle, the Navy Seals, the American military in Iraq and Texas. They tried to instill conflict and a plot into the story in various ways, but this is essentially a biography with the focus being on several tours in Iraq. There's not much of a story to tell. The scenes in Iraq felt realistic to me and give me the feeling that I have a better understanding of what it was like there.<br/><br/>About the political angle, I feel I have an open mind. I can enjoy a Michael Moore movie as well as movies like this. This movie definitely had a POV I may or may not agree with, but every movie has that. It didn't feel false or racist or manipulative or strident to me. It did seem to have a good deal of American jingoism. However, I was willing to forgive that because Bradly Cooper's performance made me feel sympathetic to his character. The bit at the end was a little too much for me, but I simply left the theatre a few minutes early.<br/><br/>Is Chris Kyle a hero? I'm not sure. But I didn't need to think that to enjoy this movie. It's interesting enough that this guy has become an icon to many in America.<br/><br/>I'd rate it about 7.5. If you're a Cooper fan you shouldn't miss this one."

"netengccie","8","3","28","8 October 2015"," Really? You people are that ignorant?
","Does this rank as one of the top films ever? No. This year? Probably not. However to read the reviews and see people call Chris Kyle a coward, murderer, loser, etc is just plain stupid. You may not like it that he killed men, women and children but in the reality of war, life becomes very plain. I look at that person and assess the situation; and I have less than a second to make a decision. Don't judge someone that makes a decision and stands behind it. Don't judge someone by a movie. There's more to Chris than what the movie shows. If you've been in that situation you understand that it takes a certain mentality to do what is ordered of you. Sometimes you mentally remove yourself from the situation and just do what you have to do to make it to tomorrow. It's sad to see so many brainwashed Dems, that honestly believe that Repubs and military are a bunch of knuckledragging killers. What you people don't understand is that we do the work you're afraid to do. It's fine if you don't like the movie, but keep your brainwashing (do you really believe Hillary was ignorant about Benghazi?) to yourself. Review the movie, not spew your jacked up views of the world and the US's political stage. Get off your ass, brush off the potato chip crumbs, put on your velcro shoes, get in your Prius and drive down to the local enlistment office and sign your name. It frustrates me that you people bitch about everything yet you do nothing about it other than complain. As the Colonel said, ""I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way, Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post."" Either you get or you don't. If you don't, that's OK, that's what the rest are here for; to protect the sheep that baa."
"SausagePourVous","6","3","28","26 March 2015"," Uneven,thematically schizophrenic film that none the less is watchable.
","I am not quite sure what Eastwood was going for here. To mess with and twist up our expectations and views of brave soldiers or to bring a true American real-life hero to life in a pretty accurate accounting of his tours in Iraq.<br/><br/>See,what we know of Chris Kyle is what he himself said;He liked killing. He wants nothing more then to protect his countrymen and when he's at home with his lovely wife(Sienna Miller,for the second time in 2014 playing the wife of an ill-fated character)he is distant,thinking about all the people he is not able to keep safe.<br/><br/>Cooper plays the role very well,making Chris socially awkward and introvert,clearly very often displaying signs of an anti-social personality,only at home in war. <br/><br/>The screenplay seems to suggest that 99% of all Iraqis want Americans dead,even the friendly ones...they are however referred to as""Savages""by our lead character and nothing in the storyline seems to criticize that even remotely as very small children and women fall prey to the....justified?...bullets fired from our protagonist.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very intense and well-edited,filmed with a sure hand by Eastwoods number one,Tom Stern. American sniper has some really nail-biting sniper-moments(Though the title is a bit misleading,only on parts of his first tour and last is Chris Kyle actually a sniper).<br/><br/>The film really is lacking though when it comes to having fleshed-out characters(Cooper,yes,Miller mostly just gets to be upset and frustrated) or even remotely interesting support. A powerhouse like Whiplash can not only survive but thrive with a two-character setup,this film has problems since the problems the couple face pretty much just goes round in circles and circles,same issues facing the couple at the end of tour 1 as tour 4 and any other character just drifts off in the periphery while the main character here doesn't really develop a whole lot.<br/><br/>It was a powerful enough film to warrant a viewing. Maybe a second one would make it more clear what Eastwood was going for;As a portrait of a sociopath and an unrelenting patriot,this film works. As a tribute to a true American hero,the film can come off as repulsive and very manipulative. I chose to see it as the first of my two options,though I highly doubt that is what Clint was going for."

","American Sniper is a must-see for those who are craving for the powerful war movies. Clint Eastwood's six academy nominated film is worth watching overall. Bradley Cooper's portrayal as America's most lethal sniper is undoubtedly his best performance yet. His dedication of changing his physique and getting the vocal similar to Chris Kyle is simply impressive. He totally deserves this year's Oscar nomination. The story telling is quite compelling, yet it occasionally fills with unnecessary political propaganda in the life story of the ""Legend"". All technologies in making of this film will make everything seemed so realistic which will make you feel with the Iraq war experiences as if it is happening just right in front of you. Overall, ""American Sniper"" is definitely not a feel good movie as it has some tragic events which are currently happening in this world. Combining with the brilliant sound effects of intense shootings and realistic cinematic shots will make you to be on the edge of your seat during the entire running time."

That is what Chris Kyle did to the end. Even when his duty ended, he was still assisting victims of the war and giving them hope and courage.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood does a fine job of depicting Kyle's 4 tours in Iraq. This film really speaks to the trauma and difficulties war veterans have and sends a message raising awareness to help soldiers who were wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Very good movie. Sad story."
"plpregent","6","1","5","18 June 2015"," Scratching the surface
","It's always tricky to review a biographical war drama centered around a war hero, especially when that specific hero emerged as such in the middle of a modern-era conflict that still divides people's opinions. On one side, there will be the usual anti-military guys yelling that it's U.S. army propaganda on the first occasion, and on the other side, there will be the pro war people who'd be ready to shoot you in the face if you ever were to hint that there possibly is a conspiracy behind 9/11. Both groups unfortunately can't seem to have a nuanced opinion on such a sensitive subject, even if their lives were to depend on it.<br/><br/>First off, I'm not American, and I always try to play the devil's advocate when it comes to these sensitive subjects because, in my humble opinion, the truth usually lies right in the middle of opposed polarized opinions. Second, I want to review this as a film. I'm not here to judge the morality behind Kyle's actions, or behind the conflicts he was a part of.<br/><br/>American Sniper begins with a montage of the early adulthood of Chris Kyle. The film does not drag with the introduction to its protagonist, and quite frankly, it could have gone a little longer. Mr. Kyle enrolls in the army, we see a few boot camp sequences, outlining his strong character, mixed in with glimpses of Kyle's urban life, notably when he meets the woman that soon enough becomes his wife. The film pretty much keeps rolling with this exact same formula until its ending, alternating between polished combat sequences from Kyle's tours to Iraq and his family life, which ends up being greatly affected, as if Mr. Kyle's mind never leaves Iraq, even when his feet are planted on U.S. soil.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's directing is probably the film's strongest asset. The war sequences are very well shot, and the camera's calmness during Kyle's homecomings progressively fades away to match the camera's nervousness that is initially exclusive to the war sequences as Kyle's mind becomes increasingly affected by his trips to Iraq.<br/><br/>On the downside, American Sniper's duality becomes redundant after a while, especially when it comes to Kyle's family time, which has a considerable clichéd feel to it, and is simply not very heart warming. On one hand, you got Chris Kyle the soldier, the man that's barely shook up after putting a hole through a child's body, and, on the other hand, you feel like Eastwood is trying to portray a tough-minded, sympathetic character whose allegiance to his duty is untouchable but who also happens to be a caring husband and father, as any typical model American citizen would (or should) be. Unfortunately, with the lack of a proper introduction to the character, a lack of key moments that truly define the character, and the shallowness of the paradox between Kyle the soldier and Kyle the family man, the viewer is left with very little food for thought.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's performance is nonetheless interesting, as he does manage to make the most out of a character that's limited by average screen writing.<br/><br/>And here lies the real problem of American Sniper : lack of depth, both in its depiction of the character and its portrayal of a problem that strikes several war veterans : post-traumatic stress disorder. This probably should have been the key theme to exploit, and while this is what it becomes towards the end, it feels like American Sniper barely scratches the surface. This is definitely unfortunate. Personally, I thought this was a missed opportunity to elaborate on a problem that is key in this specific story.<br/><br/>If you think post-traumatic stress is an interesting subject, I would highly recommend you watch Harsh Times, a David Ayer film which spends nothing more than the opening credits sequence to show war images, and then spends its whole runtime portraying a character struck with post-traumatic stress disorder, his personality, his actions, his ambitions and how his whole life and the lives of his surroundings are affected. For amazing modern war sequences, Black Hawk Down's and Lone Survivor's, in my opinion, surpass than the ones offered in Clint Eastwood's film.<br/><br/>That being said, American Sniper is still a competent feature, and juxtaposing combat sequences with family life to bring up the post-traumatic stress theme was an excellent idea. However, the way everything is delivered prevents it from becoming a truly engaging film both emotionally and cinematically."
"sgholbrook","6","1","5","13 June 2015"," ""Fades to Black.....""
","Very good film to represent war, I think it was done pretty accurately. At least that's how it feels for someone who hasn't been to war. The movie seems to be filmed in a slightly different way to usual, skipping big moments usually hovered over for too long in any other film. It says ""this is going to happen"" and then skips to the chase and cuts straight to it happening, I liked this as it seemed to work well with the film. It follows an interesting relationship between one man and his family and one man and his army crew (whatever the special name is for them), but can be quite slow at times although they are cutting big bits out, and seems to go on for quite a bit. The action scenes are great with some really gripping decisions in the balance and DOES seem completely realistic. My MAIN problem with this film, is that it takes the jump cut editing a little too far, so much so, that it feels like the film has no end. At one point the screen fades to black (out of no-where) and writing comes up explaining the end of the film as if they couldn't be bothered to film it. It was a BIZARRE experience ! I will certainly remember it, but that doesn't necessarily mean I liked it !"

","A book that was hard to ignore becomes a movie that is even harder to ignore.<br/><br/>It's difficult to just review this movie without acknowledging the book and the controversy that surrounds them both.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, it would be nice if every human conflict was resolved around the negotiating table, but that is not the way of this world. As for the use of snipers, I think if the other side uses them you would be crazy not to use them yourself, and go them one better, And that is where this story fits in because it's about America's most effective sniper whose job was to protect soldiers on the ground as they fought their way through the embattled streets of Iraq.<br/><br/>The book had a harder edge than the movie. Chris Kyle wrote it from a personal viewpoint without much reference to the rights and wrongs of the conflict. The movie tones down some of the more disparaging descriptions of the enemy with only a passing reference to 'savages'. Although the accuracy of some sections of the book have been questioned – including a court case for libel, I have no difficulty accepting its basic truth.<br/><br/>The argument that erupted over the morality of sniping is an interesting one, especially in light of the history of America's armed forces. Sharpshooters were a feature of conflict in America from the colonial period right through the Civil War up to the wars of the 20th century and beyond when the term sniper became more commonly used. Seen that way, the Navy SEALS have built on the legacy, honing the skill to its ultimate level, epitomised in the abilities of warriors like Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>In their anger over the movie, it's interesting that some commentators have actually called Kyle a coward, although I don't recall them being as outspoken over the other famous snipers throughout history – Vasily Zaytsev at Stalingrad for example.<br/><br/>The movie is straightforward and polished. Bradley Cooper projects a powerful personality as Chris Kyle, and Sienna Miller complements it in the role of his wife, Taya.<br/><br/>I think Eastwood was right not to include a couple of scenes from the book, which would no doubt have been more contentious: the incident with the Tunisians and the beach balls for instance – it may have got laughs for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Eastwood also shows the price the military has paid by giving roles to a number of badly wounded veterans. ""American Sniper"" shows Eastwood's skill in creating emotion with simple scenes such as when Taya watches Kyle leave for the last time with the man who is destined to kill him.<br/><br/>With so much publicity, no one is likely to accidentally stumble across this movie and be offended. All things considered, other than the argument that war itself offends our humanity, ""American Sniper"" seems reasonably even-handed in its approach."

","It is very difficult to judge this film without referring to politics. One can just read the viewers opinions in IMDb.<br/><br/>One of the first scenes in 'American Sniper' defines the world of the hero. It's a childhood scene. The hero as a kid sits at the family table with his father, mother, brother. The father tells his view of the world. It is divided in sheep, heard-keepers and predators. Predators try to kill, sheep risk to be slaughtered. Nobody in this family will be a sheep. The 'yes, Sir' typical to the traditional American way of kids addressing fathers follows. This is the same 'yes, Sir' used in the Army.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood makes films with a talent that is in competition only with his skills as an actor. My problem with many of his films is that his heroes are so far of my world that I cannot avoid detesting them, as much as I admire Clint's artistic skills. True again for this film about the most decorated sniper in the history of the US Army.<br/><br/>Now, the issue is that the hero described in Clint Eastwood's most recent film is a real character. The authors of the script did not even change his name (it's Chris Kyle) and many of the facts and situations described are taken from a book inspired by reality. We are shown a young man who decides to switch from rodeos to becoming a soldier after seeing the news on TV about the American embassies being blown up at the end of the 90s. 9/11 follows (again as a piece of TV news) and this is enough to convince him that his tours of duty in Iraq serve the noblest possible cause. If he ever asks questions about the policies of his government, if he ever has any doubts about his life being torn to shreds by the conflict between his duties as a soldier and the duties to his family - these are never shown on screen.<br/><br/>There are two other memorable scenes I took from the film. In one of them an Arab kid takes a rocket launcher and almost fires it. The hero prays that the kid drops the weapon so that he would not be obliged to kill him. His prayers are heard. Later in the film an Army shrink asks him whether he has any regrets about what he did during his service (he is credited with 160 enemies killed in action as a sniper). 'No, Sir' he answers, the day he will face the Creator he will have clean conscience about each of them. I could not avoid asking myself the question - what if that kid would not have thrown the weapon and would have been the 161st? <br/><br/>Can soldiers involved in the bloodiest of the wars ever come home? Mentally, with their souls intact? Such questions are asked by many films and are asked implicitly by 'American Sniper' as well. Apparently the film takes no position while it describes a real life character who can be read both as a hero and as a casualty of war. I can but admire the splendid acting of Bradley Cooper who simply brought back Chris Kyle to life of screen. Eastwood's story telling skills are exquisite, and while I am no big fan of war scenes I liked the way he staged these. I liked less the one-sided view of the conflict and the situations in Iraq, but let us recognize that this is a film about an American soldier and his perspective of the war. The fact that this is the kind of hero glorified by the society tells more than anything about the world we live in."
"sanjin_9632","1","3","31","9 December 2018"," I would give it negative 1000 stars if I could
","I watched this sorry excuse for a film only to see how much crappy propaganda
Eastwood was able to incorporate. As a kid I used to adore Eastwood and his overly *masculine* (judge, jury and executioner) personas in movies. That is not the case anymore. Eastwood has always been a political hard-liner.. on (Firefox) and off the screen. Taking political views into consideration, C. Eastwood and Ch. Heston could've been brothers. I don't know why, but in recent years (and projects) Eastwood has been focusing more than ever on one-sided portrayals of Americans being the heroes. In my humble opinion CHRIS KYLE IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE A HERO. A person with so many kills on his belt is A KILLER PURE AND SIMPLE, NOT A HERO.
Also, don't let me get started on B. Cooper. Personally, I think the guy has a terrible vibe. To me he seems incredibly ignorant, arrogant, selfish etc. All in all, just a horrible human being. One of the most unsympathetic people I've ever seen on screen. Enough about Cooper.. he doesn't deserve more of my attention.<br/><br/>Let's have a look at CE's last 5 movies..<br/><br/>J. Edgar = probably a good portrayal of Hoover, since the guy must've been a complete psychopath. Still one of Eastwood's worst movies.
Jersey Boys = the exception here .. not bad, but not great either
Sully = boring boring boring boring .. only for U.S. audiences. A pilot did his job and landed a plane. Wow. How mesmerising.
15:17 to Paris = one isolated incident turned into something epic .. propaganda in its purest form .. some of it may actually be factual. I'm pretty sure there's been a similar (or even better) story somewhere in history not involving U.S. soldier's on a train. Why not tell that?<br/><br/>..and this pile of crap.<br/><br/>A couple of questions regarding Hollywood movies/blockbusters:<br/><br/><ul><li>When there's an alien invasion or attack of any kind,</li></ul>why do these events always happen in the U.S. ?
<ul><li>Why is the U.S. always portrayed as the world leader and/or hero in such situations?</li></ul><br/><br/>Furthermore, something to think about:<br/><br/><ul><li>Americans (U.S. citizens especially) are among the dumbest, least educated nations in the world. They may have some of the best schools/universities in the world, but only a small number of the world's population is actually allowed to attend, rendering their over-priced existence insignificant. The *normal* school system over there is horrible. Designed to manipulate more than educate.</li></ul><br/><br/>Nuff said.."

","Clint Eastwood lucks out from being a longtime member of the good ol' boys club of Hollywood with his most recent film American Sniper.<br/><br/>Once again a good film gets elevated to greatness thanks to longstanding esteem, name recognition and likability of the star power of American Sniper's director Clint Eastwood and producer/lead actor Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>Based on the real life of one the most lethal American sniper in United States history, American Sniper tells the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Kyle is a born and bred patriotic Texan-American cowboy who, upon news of the September 11th attacks, decides to join the military and serve his country. His unique ability as a marksmen means he gets enlisted as a SEAL to be a sniper and is deployed to Iraq. American Sniper tells the story of Chris Kyle's military and personal life and impact each has on the other.<br/><br/>This may be an unpopular opinion, but on the whole American Sniper was rather bland and unremarkable. The first forty five minutes are relatively and unnecessarily slow paced as the groundwork of the plot and of Chris Kyle's life is laid out. And yet, even with all this time dedicated to cultivating a complicated character – it's too subtle and simple of a character and a film. American Sniper does nothing new or unique to differentiate it from its peers. It is not surprising that Kyle returned to America with PTSD after spending an extended period of time deployed in the Middle East where he killed countless insurgents. Jason Hall's screenplay does little to show a conflicted, pained, stressed man trying to adapt to the normal marital and familial life – the key factor of the film that is supposed to be unique.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, though adequate, does not inhabit his role with unspoken power. Chris Kyle is viewed as an American national hero in some parts of the country and Cooper does not emote quiet strength necessary to transcend the screen and engage the viewer. Further, Kyle was an impressive man physically and though marketing articles continually state Cooper gained forty pounds of muscle for the role, it is evident this propaganda is not true and more of a campaign for Oscar buzz which is just off-putting.<br/><br/>The plot of American Sniper is highly relevant as the war in Iraq and the Middle East slowly winds down. For that, it won't be surprising if American Sniper is a success in the box office, especially in the central and Southern parts of the United States where national pride is especially strong. Further the editing by Joel Cox and Gary Roach, specifically the battle scenes, are superior at at accurately capturing the war experience in Iraq.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases and award nominees."

","This is one of the american movies that depicts the American army as the extreme good side, and all its enemies as Satan. There is nothing good about a war, and there is no definite good or evil. Although there were extremists in Iraq during the American war there, there were innocent people who were killed, prisoners who were violated and women who were raped, and finally it's the American army that raged a war against Iraq, not the contrary, and Iraq has nothing to blame for the events of 11 september. To sum up, I'm so disappointed by how much superficial the story and the value that it defends."

What the war was about and why American soldiers died on foreign land and why American soldiers killed people in another country. This is nothing else than propaganda showing it's ugly face and I'm so sorry that Clint Eastwood is the director. There are so many stories true to the American nation, it's values and it's youth that sacrificed their lives for it. The true testimonies and stories takes away the need of this story and this movie. The need of this move did never exist. Now this movie is made and we will all have to accept its role as a part of our historical legacy. It will always be known it is built upon lies but also hailed to in expression of patriotism. How sad. All the respect I had for Mr Eastwood is gone. It saddens me that this movie profoundly redefines Mr Eastwood in my point of view. A movie should not need to be rated like this. A movie should be rated for its story, the artistry, the craftsmanship and its visualizations of its makers.

"oliverdearlove","3","2","18","15 November 2017"," Sniping at American Sniper
","I went and saw this film at the recommendation of a cineaste. It is about a sniper who kills a lot of people and then is killed in civilian life himself The main trouble is his home life or lack of it and the less than full support that his wife gives - in the real life the widow says the portrayal was acceptable. I thought a lot of the goofs were to hide operationally sensitive material - but he never has a spotter. The sniper has a gopher who banters with him but no one with binoculars spotting targets. The sniper takes telephone calls more than once from his wife whilst he is under fire or looking for targets. The Baby is plastic (already er spotted by other reviewers) The child ages five years but Iraq seems to remain the awful mess that the Americans created, when the sniper signs up for another tour. An Iraqi asks ten or so American Christians to an obviously Islamic Meal (Eid al fitr) and no one senses that it is very odd that the Iraqi seems to have no suitable Muslim friends himself to share this important event with. The calluses on the host's elbows show he is a sniper but not The Sniper that they seek so they sort of let him go. The Sniper snoops around the host's house and a creaking floor board luckily gives a way the arms cache hidden beneath the host's floor. This is very lucky as the floor is composite terrazzo - and the cover is a metal plate and there is not a floor board in sight to creak. Will the snipers run of incredible luck run out ? Yes at the end of the film - kind of friendly fire In the Boer War 1899 - over 95% of bullet injuries were head wounds because the Tommies wouldn't stop looking over the top of boulders and the Boers would pick them off. And Dang me! a hundred years later the American were still doing it in Iraq - there is an awful lot of peeping over solid brick walls - one time even the Sniper does it and doesn't get his head blown off even tho the Daeesh sniper is waiting for him. So all in all - since we know the ending, a film to see in company and pick at."

","I give Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood a hats off for a great film however, let's remember that Chris Kyle was soldier following orders, and he was a troubled man. He is the symbol of propaganda being used by the corporate-owned media in cahoots with the military industrial complex war machine in this country that continues to spread misinformation, misery, hate and destruction around the globe for sensationalism, greed and profit. Eastwood does not confront that hypocrisy nor does he confront the PTSD many soldiers face after returning from war and our government's apathetic attitude towards those who served our country. Heartbreaking to know that Chris Kyle's memory is being used to perpetuate that lie.<br/><br/>The film Syrianna with George Clooney perfectly reflects the reasons of why the United States is in the middle east.

"akwonghuynh","7","1","6","30 July 2015"," See it as a biography and not as a war film
","At this film's emotional core is a family man who goes to war. That's as much as I can simplify this movie without misconstruing anything. Like most modern war films, ""American Sniper"" has come under fire for being a propaganda movie. As an Australian, I can honestly say, I don't see it.<br/><br/>This movie has been labelled as anti-Muslim and so on, but I honestly don't see it. People who claim this movie is anti-Muslim generally refer to the scene where Chris Kyle is about to shoot a boy carrying explosives towards an American convoy (as seen in the trailer). I can see where people might say this move is anti-Muslim, but I don't agree with it. I see it as a really nasty situation of ""do you shoot the boy?"" or ""do you hold your fire, thus letting the boy blow himself up along with twelve other American soldiers.""<br/><br/>There's also another scene where a boy is tortured and killed with a drill because insurgents believed that his father was giving information to American soldiers. I can sort of see how that could be interpreted as propaganda, but that would be stretching it.<br/><br/>Now, on the war front side of the story, a very unique warrior's psyche is shown. I don't know if it was just me, or whether it was intentional or not, but, at first Bradley Cooper really sells it as Kyle just wants to become a SEAL. And then during the Kyle's multiple tours and his wife asks him why he still wants to go back, Kyle states that he does it to protect his family to which his wife responds that, that is not a real reason. Bradley's execution of this scene leaves you thinking whether or not Kyle does truly want to protect his family, or that war is where Kyle feels most at home. Again, this does not strike me as propaganda, but it is quite amazing how people would instantly label this kind of behaviour as psychopathic.<br/><br/>The home front side of the story shows how Kyle is revered by fellow soldiers and at the same time, shows the toll it is taking on him, his marriage, and the psyche of his brother (though short that scene, it is powerful regardless).<br/><br/>In short, I still have a hard time wrapping my head around how this movie is a propaganda. Eastwood's previous films such as ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers"" bring a very human element to battlefields that have been romanticised by propaganda, as well as criticising those who do not understand war. To say that ""American Sniper"" is anti-Muslim is a bit mind boggling since ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" portrayed the Japanese soldiers as men fighting for their country - not as a one-dimensional barbaric bucktooth cartoon. My guess to why this movie is labelled as propaganda is because of the title and the promotional poster. After all, seeing the name ""American Sniper"" with a soldier holding the American flag does certainly invoke that image of patriotism.<br/><br/>It's best to watch this movie as a biography and don't think too much about trying to find whatever propaganda message is in it, because honestly, I couldn't find it. Enjoy the story."
"kosmasp","7","1","6","3 July 2015"," Controversial?
","Yes it is. But we're talking about Clint Eastwood here. And while he did talk to a chair (something I actually thought was funny as an ""act"", not so much what he was saying), he's still a good director who's able to juggle things around. And make them feel right - or as right as it is possible.<br/><br/>Many have and will call Snipers cowards. People who are not going into actual fight that is going on, but wait and have to kill a lot of people from long distance. But we do get a glimpse into what might be going on in the head of one of those men. Bradley Cooper is once again mesmerizing in his portrayal. And while I was not aware of all real life incidents that happened, that might have elevated the whole story for me."

However, despite obvious time and resources invested in the effects and action, nothing really stood out about the story. It started out at a certain level and stuck to it throughout to the end.

","I read a lot of one star reviews that claimed the movie was a bunch of propaganda and I can only conclude they are referring to the news footage in the film of the 9/11 attacks and several American embassy bombings that occurred around those years, I think the footage lends to the character development of Charlie the protagonist of the story and to anyone who saw those planes fly into those buildings as I did on that day who still draws out conspiracy for the sake of propaganda I'd say give it a rest because no one really cares what you think anymore.<br/><br/>I was ready to give the film 9 stars just to offset the nonsensical rantings of all the one star voters but to be honest it wasn't as great of a combat movie as I'd been led to believe with the scale of 10 leaning towards a movie more like Black Hawk Down, truth be told I thought the action sequences seemed like something you see in a lower budget film or even something made for cable television and quite frankly I'm starting to wonder if Clint Eastwood hasn't become menopausal with all the tear-jerk reaction scenes that are shot each time Charlie Kyle comes home from a tour.<br/><br/>Did I care for Charlie? Nah, he was kind of a dick but I would imagine most SEALS are, considering their really just trained for one thing and with that said I supremely value the contributions made by them on behalf of their fellow soldiers; this guy prevented the bloodshed of many American soldiers and for that he should be commended as he was with great pomp and fanfare... but seriously Clint just do a film without all the emo stuff for once will ya? I gag on that crap and have hated your movies since Mystic River for just that reason... start taking hormone replacement therapy or something to remove all this effeminate crap from your films.

"ahegde3149","6","2","19","17 January 2015"," A patriotic biopic which is not quite captivating as it unfolds, but Bradley Cooper's committed performance alone makes it worth a shot.
","As the closing credits roll, I believe the American audience would be stunned by chronicles of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American History. Now will the Non-Americans be equally stunned by the experience? Of course. I wouldn't say equally, but remarkably enough depending upon your sentiments about army-people. American Sniper puts forth the patriotism and heroism of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who is gifted with enormous talent and accuracy in shooting. With record number of Sniper kills associated with him, he saved countless lives on the battlefield and and had soon become a 'legend'. Now I don't want to draw any comparison with what is depicted in the movie and what actually happened, I will just review it as an independent film.<br/><br/>Chris's father told him and his brother to always be the 'sheepdog', the protector who will go to any extent to provide protection from the evil. Initially Chris was just a cowboy, but after watching US embassy attacks in Kenya on TV he decides he has got more to his life and joins Navy SEALs. At the same time he marries Taya (Sienna Miller) a woman who initially said to him she would never marry a Navy SEAL until she falls for Chris. His first deployment was in Iraq, where he faces a tough situation where a woman and kid try to attack them with grenade. With his pinpoint accuracy he takes both them down as his first kills leaving their troops safe. It does look plain and simple on screen, but from the point of view of the man about to pull the trigger whose decision is going to decide another person's fate its a whole different scenario. Over his first tour, Chris kills numerous people and keeps getting more and more recognition. He talks to his Wife who is pregnant over phone time to time. After returning from his tour, he and Taya have a boy. Despite being home with his family, Chris still faces the trauma of war zone and at the same time has determination to protect his country. After the 9/11 he is more determined to go back on field and goes on second tour to Iraq. But this time his wife worried about whether he will ever return. Plus, the enemy camp has deadly sniper who was an Olympic medalist and now an opposition for Kyle.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, as the director at age of 84 brings the realism of war ideally. The war action and shooting sequences are nicely done and edited. Technically the film is really strong, but I wish they did something better than the poor CGI Sandstorm in last part. Based on autobiography with same name, American Sniper does good character study of Chris Kyle and his emotions. Bradley Cooper seems to have put in a lot of effort for building the body apt for the role. Also his expressions on the battlefield have necessary aggression and the touch of conscience at the same time.I doubted the Academy for his nomination, but I was wrong. While character of Chris Kyle gets the necessary focus, but there is nothing interesting to talk about anyone else. Taya his wife, does nothing more than worry about Kyle most of the time. As for soldiers on battlefield, most of the people change over the different missions, leaving Chris the only character to deeply root for. The screenplay though I thought was not as great as the performance and is quite generic. Apart from the few war fight sequences there isn't much meat to fill up its run time. Still it runs for 132 minutes which felt like divided into 4 parts, each one for his each tour to Iraq. And each part starts becoming less and less interesting than the previous.I think we should have seen more development on Chris character when he is back home than on field. Also the war tension is missing mostly apart from few scenes.Like the one moment when Chris has to decide whether to shoot a small kid who tries handle a grenade launcher and he wishing badly that kid drops it, the scene was quite intense. There is lot of violence, one scene was difficult to handle, where a terrorist kills a boy drilling through his head. Oh God! Captures the savagery of the kind animals there are in this world. Another thing I did not like is ridiculously less use of background music, the experience would have been a lot more intense and filled with lot more emotions with a good score.<br/><br/>In the end, American Sniper is not very captivating all the way. Bradley Cooper's performance adds the necessary depth to character of Chris Kyle elegantly. While rest of the things don't match up, there is abundance of patriotism. Even if this is overused in films a lot, American Sniper works as a good biopic which doesn't decentralize from its main character. Definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>RATING:[3/5]"

This film is very similar to GT in scope.. it has very little of it.<br/><br/>Lets see if this is true;<br/><br/>In GT, an angry old man meets a family of koreans, whom he fought in the war. We discover that he's not really angry, he's just very experienced with the world.He takes a young korean kid under his wing, and then proves to everyone he had a right to be ""angry"", when he sacrifices himself for the freedom of the korean family.<br/><br/>Or in short, character A is the way he is, because death is closer than you think. And then he dies. <br/><br/>In American Sniper, we have a character who is going to kill an enemy sniper, and then he does. The climax of the story is made obvious since the very beginning of the film, in plain speech no less. The ""butcher of baghdad"" story is just a framing device.<br/><br/>In both situations the character doesn't change, doesn't grow, it's just one straight line from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Play Misty was not very different, but at least the characters depicted were unusual, and it had a story which you would not read about in mainstream, more so during the years when it was filmed. <br/><br/>So, to recap; <br/><br/>I thought American Sniper was extremely well made. The production is stellar, and this is where AS derives most of its entertainment value from.<br/><br/>The story is flat. The character's involvement is marginal. <br/><br/>The ""at home"" sections were not disturbingly soppy, but i felt they didn't add anything to the film.<br/><br/>The final ""war changes you"" bit was almost forced in, and thankfully not made into the main story, because god knows we've see that one a million times already.<br/><br/>So what you have is a really well done if somewhat simplistic war film, like dozens before it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but for that mid-week entertainment, it's worth a decent<br/><br/>My vote: 6.5/10 - it's OK, but its not very exciting."

","I came to the movie theater, expecting 'murican propaganda... This movie actually surprised me. It surprises me even more because it's Clint Eastwood behind the camera.<br/><br/>Now, let me tell you why it's definitely not American army propaganda, and at the same time, we will encounter some of the weakness of the flick.<br/><br/>1) The idiotic motivation of the main character to go to Iraq. He decides to go serve his country for obscure, unclear reasons : ""Oh my gawd, terrorists are frightening, I best go to Iraq to kill them all"". It makes little to no sense and to me, it's satirical. Otherwise, it's stupid.<br/><br/>2) 1000 days spent looking for a few guys. American troops at their weakest. No efficiency, the main character even get grounded at one point of the movie. They don't know what they do and where the villains are. They waste time and money. And it makes to movie kind of repetitive : looking for the bad guys, go home, looking for the bad guys, go home etc. <br/><br/>3) Does he even have a family ? We know little about his wife and kids, nothing about his parents. By the way, the wife and kids are here because they have to, because C. Kyle had a wife and children, not because they were necessary to the story. He focuses on war, war, war. Even home, all he cares about is war.<br/><br/>4) All war and no play makes Chris a mad boy. It becomes more and more crazy towards the end of the movie. He doesn't talk to his wife, he almost killed a dog, his blood pressure is insane. This is for me, the best part of the movie. It shows what effects war has on a human being, and what he becomes because of that. It also shows what extremes they have to face. For example (it's in the trailer), when his hesitate to shoot on a boy trying to lift and fire a RPG launcher at his colleagues. The character is also hunted by all the people he could not save, rather than those he killed. For me, the psychological aspect of Chris Kyle is the best part of the movie. Too bad it's so little of it.<br/><br/>What more can I say ? Flaws : Iraqi people are not even considered human beings, rather targets or enemies. Plus, Chris says himself that the US are the good guy and the Iraqi are the bad guys. Thus, disregarding the fact that the US army is a total intruder to the Iraqi soil.<br/><br/>The whole flash back at the beginning, when he hunts with his dad : pointless. Adds nothing to the story, means nothing. - The action's repetitive and therefore tasteless.<br/><br/>The whole ""Chris Kyle is a legend"" thing is too much<br/><br/>Now, I'll finish this review with what I liked : Bradley Cooper is one hell of an actor. He is the best C. Kyle I could ever think of. <br/><br/>As I already said before, the whole psychological aspect of C. Kyle is really interesting, and I wanted more of that in the movie.<br/><br/>Not a bad flick, overall. But if you want to see a great, satirical war movie, watch Full Metal Jacket."
"guisreis","5","2","21","20 February 2015"," A propaganda movie to legitimate that USA invades other countries
","In spite of his extremely conservative political view, Clint Eastwood has already showed that he may be a quite sensible director, in movies such as ""Gran Torino"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Invictus"" and ""Unforgiven"". Though, ""American Sniper"" reinforces the bad conventional wisdom about him, as a macho cowboy who loves guns and do not care about their effects. It is a militaristic and imperialist propaganda, which tries to legitimate the aggressive foreign policy developed by the United States. The film simply does not discuss why Iraqi children, women and obviously less equipped men tried to kill those servicemen from USA, who were invading their country, their homes, harming their families. Television shows the 9-11 attack, but is it that automatic to view the invasion of other countries as the way to defend the United States (Bush doctrine)? The sniper and other SEALs are shown calling Iraqi as ""savages"", arguing that US is the most important country in the world and might be defended... quotes of stupid people, which would dampen any credibility in the eyes of more critical viewers, but how many spectators will not notice that and simply support that USA invades other countries? The movie shows rebels as sadistic criminals who damage the local population, what is convenient for the support of Bush doctrine, but is that fair? Why local people supported them? Are American soldiers less sadistic? Were American soldiers just defending their colleagues (who were invading Iraq!) and were the rebels assassins who wanted to murder Westerners (and not to protect their country and people)? The sniper from the other side, Mustafa, could have been much better developed, showing the feelings of the enemies, but director's blind patriotism did not allow it. In the first part, the movie reminds a lot Brazilian ""Elite Squad"", which shares the main good and bad traits: very entertaining, technically well done (Eastwood made amazing war scenes), but supporting bad practices from the troops (in the Brazilian case, it supports torture and disrespect for human rights in the invasion of the homes of poor people in slums in Rio de Janeiro by the BOPE, an elite group of military police as the SEAL is for US Navy). The biggest resemblance, though, refers to the heavy ""Full Metal Jacket""-style training of servicemen. A very bizarre and disappointing thing in ""American Sniper"" is that the main character is humanized after that, while we could expect that he would become even more violent and nervous than he was in the cowboy days of the beginning. His family life is by far the most interesting issue in the movie, but the bad political job in the war footage obfuscates it. There is something odd in Hollywood war movies: they are seldom critical about USA, dealing with the conflicts as good Americans against evil foreigners or, when this approach is almost impossible (like in films on Vietnam War), they focus the internal psychological problems of soldiers and veterans, not caring about the aggression per se, as there were only citizens from US suffering and no people being slaughtered by them. To resume, although ""American Sniper"" is technically well done, it is the worst film directed by Clint Eastwood ever (or at least for a long time). The patriotic melodrama in the end does not help to change this opinion. Cold murderers are not heroes."

","""American Sniper"" is a tale of vengeance.<br/><br/>Sparking lots of controversy over the morals of the film, there really wasn't a lot of content to criticize. Honestly, it is an enjoyable action film. It's a shoot-em-up hate-the-bad guys flick the same we've seen over and over, even from Clint Eastwood. The setting, of course, is different, and the story is supposedly true. The story is based on true events, and that is unfortunate. But this is a very intimate look into the perspective of one man.<br/><br/>This needs to be understood.<br/><br/>The performance of Bradley Cooper is really great, and he got into shape to look like Chris Kyle for the role. This is to honor one man and what he did for our troops in battle, even if the film makes him out to be almost a superhero stronger than any other soldier.<br/><br/>To dissect the morals of the film, we can look specifically at one scene. The ""sheep, sheepdog, and wolves"" speech that the father of our hero (the Chris Kyle character) gives to his sons after one defends the other in a typical fight at school. The father says that his family is to be full of sheepdogs, leaders who take care of the sheep and protect them from the wolves. He then threatens a beating with a belt if either of them become wolves. Part of me was kinda wishing Jules Winnfield would bust in with a silver pistol and give his famous speech from ""Pulp Fiction"" about the path of the righteous man, which is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyrannies of evil men. But ""American Sniper"" is just not that kind of a film. It's a guy in a white hat vs. a guy in a black one. It's American vs. Foreign. It's not one to be talked about and philosophized over. Kids will not look at Kyle and want to be him like he is their hero. This early scene merely establishes the need to be a protector. So Chris Kyle becomes, literally, a Punisher, as if he is the character from the comic book (excuse me, ""graphic novel""). The terrorists (from 9/11) are established as wolves, creatures that feed upon sheep without mercy. The sheep are the American people. And the sheepdogs are our troops. These analogies were not in the book written by Kyle (with other writers).<br/><br/>The following features minor spoilers from the film (Although you may already know the true story):<br/><br/>What we don't see in the movie...are the politics. But here's what is shameful...this could have been a love letter to our troops. This could have been a ""thank you."" As the end credits roll, there is no music, as if to honor our fallen hero (Chris Kyle was murdered by an unfortunate soul suffering from post-traumatic stress because of the war) with silence.<br/><br/>I tried to imagine what women in the audience would be thinking during the scenes where Chris Kyle's wife begs him to stay home. He is suffering from the stress caused by war. At the sound of a lawn mower, he is on high alert. At the sight of a child playing with an aggressive dog, he is prepared to kill the dog (no harm comes to the dog because his wife interferes).<br/><br/>There is hardly any attention paid to PTSD (post-trauma-stress-disorder) which is caused by exposure to war (among other things, I'm sure). Chris Kyle doesn't suffer from it. The man who killed him doesn't appear in the movie (which I'm thankful for, as he deserves no recognition). But the questions about how we're taking care of our troops remain.<br/><br/>And as much as Clint Eastwood has been a great filmmaker, he's lost his touch long ago. (""Mystic River"" was masterful, and obviously ""Unforgiven"" was a masterpiece, but at least with that film, the vengeful hero was known as a really bad guy who was meant for hell). This film's best scene was the climactic finale firefight in which we are introduced to the bad guy we've spent the film hunting before the good guys know he is there. This adds suspense as Hitchcock might have added suspense. However, Clint Eastwood is no Hitchcock. He is especially no Sergio Leone. Clint Eastwood has just made his ""Transformers.""<br/><br/>Stop reading now to avoid political comments:<br/><br/>His now the face of the GOP: An old, angry, rich white man who, at one point, argued with his imaginary version of Obama in the form of an empty chair (also a true story). He supports the Republicans (the Grand Ol' Party, or, GOP). He is seen as the face and voice of Republicans.<br/><br/>I'll respect Clint Eastwood as an artist (art can transcend viewpoints). He is in plenty of my favorite films, and I'll watch them over and over. He's spoken out in favor of gay rights on the political spectrum. But let me leave you with a list of things the GOP does NOT support:<br/><br/>H.R. 466 – Wounded Veteran Job Security Act became H. R. 2875. <br/><br/>H.R. 1168 -- Veterans Retraining Act<br/><br/>H.R. 1171 – Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization<br/><br/>H.R. 1172 -- Requiring List on VA Website of Organizations Providing Scholarships for Veterans<br/><br/>H.R. 1293 -- Disabled Veterans Home Improvement and Structural Alteration Grant Increase Act of 2009<br/><br/>H.R. 1803 -- Veterans Business Center Act<br/><br/>H.R. 2352 – Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act"

","Im a man of facts. I do not say something unless I know for sure that Im right. I have heard all of all the drama about Chris Kyle being accused of lying, but Clint Eastwood screwed up the movie. Fact (1) At the beginning of the movie Chris does his Seal Training. Chris is asked by his drill instructor how old he is. Chris responds back by saying, "" Im 30 years of age. "" Fact (2) After Chris finishes his Seal training he meets that woman at the bar. After that they become a couple and she gets pregnant. After that in the movie she yells out to Chris by saying, "" Oh my God Chris, come look. "" She is referring to the planes that are hitting the World Trade Center that her and Chris are watching on the television. Fact (3) At the end of the movie is the funeral of Chris. It shows how Chris was born in 1974 and how he died in 2013. Can you do the math ? If Chris was born in 1974, and Chris was 30 years of age like he said to his instructor when doing his Seal training, then that means he did his Seal training in the year 2004. Um, the attack on 911 happened in the year 2001"
"santiagocosme","7","1","7","1 May 2015"," Hold on till the end
","I must admit that the first hour and a half was a bit of a pain, and I really wasn't getting into the groove of watching the movie. I felt bored and I kept looking at my watch. For me it was just another American movie who glorifies their soldiers who are sent to foreign countries to eradicate evil from the planet. A typical American film where their soldiers are portrayed to being just and honorable under any circumstance. Yes, you could say this is not totally true as Bradley Cooper is seen shooting kids several times, which is hardly a honorable thing to do. But even then, the director manages to make the Afghans look more evil than Americans when one of their leaders kidnaps a kid and puts a drill through his head to kill him. Pretty graphic I must say. <br/><br/>The thing is that after that hour and a half, Bradley Cooper finally comes home. Unfortunately, the war has taken a toll on him. It's hard to say whether or not he is mentally deranged, but you feel his family is not completely safe around him. For me, the last few minutes were the interesting ones (along with a few minutes where you see the ability of the Sniper in the battlefield).<br/><br/>Without the last half and hour, I don't think I would have rated the movie with more than a 5. But since it managed to make me feel emotional at the end, I have to give it a 7, which I think is about right overall. Enjoy!"

","I don't wanna talk about direction cause it's Clint Eastwood and this is a master piece of war movies. But I wanna talk about that stupid screenplay ,about what you call ""Arabic terrorists"". This movie exposes American citizens -American writers to be accurate- ignorance and I don't blame them cause I know how the American media worked hard to build that picture, it took them several years. But there is something you should know <br/><br/>1st- 11 September attacks has nothing to do with Iraq it is all about Afghanistan but I think you will be shocked if you read wiki leaks documents as you will know that America has been warned by many countries about this attacks before it happens but simply the USA let it go!!! which makes many questions about what it was planning for? and what if all that was planned to invade Afghanistan! by the way did you know that Afghanistan is not even an Arabic country?!, if you don't know that it means you still know nothing about the middle east. 2nd- You should know too that America Invaded Iraq not for saving the world from what they called ""weapon of mass destruction"" but it is all about Oil as the American military forces didn't find a nuclear shoe right there. 3rd- what you suppose people to do when you come on their country, ruin their life claiming that bullshit. Armies have no rules they 're killing women ,children and so on. forget about the movie,Soldiers have no mercy they kill every one and every thing, but the USA wants that people to say hi from the speculum of the sniper when they're being shot so you can say now that people are not terrorists. there is no need to mention violations of America in wars and what happened in different detains wiki leaks said that too. <br/><br/>you should either know that Arabs don't have sheep and deserts that only comes on your TV cause that idea helps your country to come on arabic countries more and more cause it gives you an impression that Arabs are retard and savages and we gonna make them civilized ,actually they don't, as ""the white power"" gonna take the oil only.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanna say that Arab society is not civilized as much as USA but it is not retard as much as you think. you should use your mid and don't let the media come on your mind cause you will be a civilized American citizen but mentally retarded."
"Discogodfather9622","6","2","23","13 January 2015"," Good movie with a TERRIBLE ending.
","Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) directs the true story of Chris Kyle, touted as ""the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history."" Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, an average every man who after watching the terrorist attacks on the twin towers decides to sign up for the Marines. He is told he should try his hands at being a Navy Seal, which he passes with flying colors and becomes a sniper for the group. Sienna Miller (Layer Cake) plays Coopers wife, Taya. Miller does an excellent job as the no nonsense but loving housewife. I enjoyed American Sniper for the most part; it was interesting seeing Kyle return home to the mundane and adapting to family life after being told that he has had 160 confirmed kills. Having said that, there were a few eye rolling, hoorah, cliché moments but that's to be expected in most military movies. My biggest gripe was the absolutely TERRIBLE ending. It literally comes out of nowhere and feels rushed. Coming down to a simple text on the screen explaining what happened to Kyle. It's almost as if Eastwood forgot that a movie was supposed to have an ending and quickly threw something together. An ending for me can make or break a movie; this ending goes down as one of the worst for a major motion picture."
"vistheindian","7","2","24","10 March 2015"," Little too much 'Murica
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After the events of 9/11 Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), who initially wanted nothing more than to be a cowboy felt the need to use his talent with a rifle to help the American army. So he joins the SEALs and becomes one of the best snipers recruited in American history. However, as the war starts to take a toll on him he is torn between his duty as a soldier and responsibility as a husband with children. There is no doubt Clint Eastwood is an excellent director, and he clearly pulled a performance from Bradley Cooper of the same caliber. Controversies regarding the real Chris Kyle aside, it is still hard to ignore some of the bias in the film. Nevertheless, the movie itself is well shot and acted, delivering some tense moments. In that regard American Sniper gains not all but some of my praise.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>When going into watch the movie, I was fully aware of the controversies surrounding Chris Kyle as he was in real life versus how he is depicted in this film. However, I'm not here to judge the real Chris Kyle, I'm here to share my thoughts on the movie. That'd being said some of the aspects of the movie makes it hard to ignore the politics. Nevertheless I want to make it clear that all of my views will still pertain to the film.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a very well-directed film both in terms of the action and the character drama. There were many moments in the movie where you feel the silent tension of making a decision as a sniper. I thought the weight behind some of the decisions to pull the trigger was captured perfectly. Even I who never held a gun in my life (except in the virtual battlefields of video games) wondered what I'd do if I were in his situation. Of course, there are some embellishment of explosions and such, but as a whole the shootouts felt grounded with some sense of consequence. Bradley Cooper did a great job in this film. He was able to portray the struggle of being veteran in a nuanced manner. The fact he has PTSD is not hammered over head for the audience. So was he Oscar worthy? Well no, I could think of two other actors that could've taken his spot in the nomination. But that is a topic for another long conversation, so I won't elaborate on that.<br/><br/>As for the problems I had with the film, there's only one but a pretty significant one. The movie is heavily biased and I am not even referring to Chris Kyle because I set that controversy aside to enjoy the film. Not once are we shown the ""good"" guys of the other side. Apart from one translator, every single non-American in this film is either a terrorist or only share information when forced to. That can't possibly be the reality. Dare I say it, at times I was reminded of the mock sniper propaganda movie from Inglorious Basterds. I have friends and family in America, and of course I know most people wouldn't be blinded by the bias. Then again let's be honest here, there are people out there who will take this movie a bit too literally. That's why I think it's a little irresponsible on the filmmaker's part to completely ignore the Iraqi contribution to the American army in the war effort, some of which the real Chris Kyle benefited from. Imagine if we had seen a more fleshed depiction of the Iraqi people. Perhaps a family that is also struggling between wanting to help the Americans and keeping their relatives safe from the terrorists. Those parallels would have deeply enriched the movie.<br/><br/>I recognize I did touch upon some politics here, but it had to be addressed. Yes there are moments where the movie screams 'Murica!' Still Bradley Cooper's performance and the intense action resulted in an engaging film. I like the movie overall, I just think there was a missed opportunity here to show the contribution of the Iraqi side as well.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"wherestheapes","2","2","25","28 December 2018"," The ""Black Hawk Down"" of the decade
","While I've never been a diehard fan of American gritty war films, or the genre in its entirety, American Sniper is a solid booster to the patriotism injected into movie goers during Black Hawk Down. That same level of intensity and chauvinistic furvor carries here, and Cooper does a fantastic job of portraying the American legend Chris Kyle.<br/><br/>The plot draws a beautiful juxtaposing line of life on the battlefield versus life at home. The small details displayed in Kyle's behavior, health, and mannerisms by Cooper start to instill the maxim that maybe the soldier never truly leaves the battlefield, even while embraced in the comfort of his/her living room arm-chair.<br/><br/>While the film could retrospectively be brushed off as a popcorn film lacking any sort of depth, I believe American Sniper deserves a place on the pedestal of our minds as a hallmark of what a war film should be and how dramatic events of war time should properly be portrayed<br/><br/>Overall I am forced to give this movie a 2/10. I would have given this film a 1/10, but during discussions of the film or the historical events in which it is based, sometimes the word ""guerilla"" is used when describing the fighting style of the enemy soldiers. Sadly this is not the type of gorilla I want to see in cinema. American Sniper totally overlooks the important role most gorillas or other apes play in mainting their respective ecosystems. During their daily movements, the walking styles of most apes actually tills the soil of the forest floor, facilitating aeration of the soil, creating a healthier and more stable container in which rainforest plants or other lowland greens may thrive! This important, understudied, and often overlooked fact is totally disregarded in American Sniper; they don't even know that gorillas are far more important than guerillas."

","Reading negative reviews, I wonder if any actually viewed the movie. The story is about the life of Chris Kyle; mostly as a Navy SEAL. It is not about the US decision to invade Iraq. During the battle of Fallujah, SEALs were often used both as snipers and as embedded assets with the building clearing teams. Both experiences took a toll on Chris as seen through his relationship with his wife and the men he served with. Maybe not a hero to Iraqis, but a life saver to hundreds of American soldiers trying to make Fallujah safer."

","I'll start this review out by saying that I know people have strong feelings about Chris Kyle - some think that he was an infallible hero who gave his life for this country, and others say that he was a liar, a racist, and a serial killer. I don't care, and have no judgment about Chris Kyle - I didn't know him personally, and can only judge what I saw on screen. This is, after all, a movie review.<br/><br/>American Sniper tells the story of Chris Kyle, the 'Devil of Ramadi'. He was a Navy S.E.A.L. who has 160 confirmed kills with a documented 255 probable kills. He's the most lethal sniper in United States history in his four tours overseas.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, who has made an amazing looking film. Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, and is the highlight of the film. His portrayal of a tortured man at work and home is captured perfectly. Cooper looks amazing in the movie - clearly he bulked up for the role. Sienna Miller plays his wife.<br/><br/>Aside from the piles of insurgents, the main villain in the flick is an opposing sniper named Mustafa. Their cat & mouse game brought memories of Enemy at the Gates, and was thrilling. The war scenes looked realistic and brutal, but the scenes of Kyle back at home left something to be desired - specifically one scene that I'll touch on in a moment. The ending is also very clunky.<br/><br/>The scene. The scene that I'll forever remember from this movie. It's not a scene where someone gets a limb blown off, or a soldier making a kill at ridiculous range...no...it's not a scene with great emotion or acting gravitas...no...it's a scene of Bradley Cooper holding a baby. Specifically, a baby that's faker than those plastic TV's that litter the inside of model homes, or a ring that you might get from a quarter machine. Could Clint Eastwood not get an actual baby? The baby he's holding is so ridiculously fake that it took my wife and I right out of the movie. Normally she doesn't notice things like props, but she picked this one right out of the lineup.<br/><br/>Aside from the prop baby, the movie was pretty good. It had some pacing issues, and like I said, the ending is a bit clumsy, but it's a good movie. A good movie I'll probably never want to see again."

The film, as a whole though, is another story, but I'm sure many will disagree with me on that. However, the film being nominated by the PGA... It's a solid film, pretty good even, but it really doesn't deserve any other of the big 8 nominations other than maybe Cooper. Overall, recommended, even if nothing amazing."

Where the director could've chosen more passive means of communicating the violence of war; he opted to blatantly throw it at the audience, as though trying to give the viewers the kind of psychological damage that the plot explores.<br/><br/>Some scenes didn't feel shocking for the sake of shock value, but just lazy storytelling, something that Clint Eastwood has been guilty of before.<br/><br/>It's a good story, for sure: but it's not well displayed.

However, it has no balls. The Jihadi are all the same, mindless faceless barbarians attacking and killing from hate alone. The Americans are all nice guys with a life back home, protecting each other. The lead actor is a walking cliché: the Texan who is taught by his father to believe in God, shoot and protect the weak and goes to war when he sees a bomb attack at an American embassy abroad. Basically all characters are cardboard.<br/><br/>Within minutes you know that it will all going to be a propaganda piece. This movie lets every American redneck have a picture of Chris Kyle on the wall above their bed and to want to kill some ""Hajjis"". Eastwood defended his film as antiwar, but I call BS. The hero of the film went to Iraq 4 times and the movie kind of lets the viewer believe he would have returned if it weren't for this wife and children nagging on him. The only antiwar piece in the entire story is in that one line of text at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know what Chris Kyle wrote in his book, nor do I know if the depiction of his character was accurate in both book and film.

","American Sniper is an American war film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the self-biography about the sharpshooter Chris Kyle. Chris is American who dreams of becoming a cowboy but after the events of 11 September, he decides to join the Navy Seals. Throughout the film we follow him on his trips to Iraq to fight against the terrorists, and we also see him during his trips home to the USA in between.<br/><br/>American Sniper feels very American and patriotic. The film has more or less divided USA in two sections, while some praise the film for its portrayal of the American soldiers' heroic efforts, others feels it hails and embellish a devastating war. I feel there is some truth to both sides because on one hand it shows the brutality of the terrorists ways, even against their own population, but it also shows the American soldiers breaking in to homes of innocent people and using force and violence to get their way.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has done well with the direction because we truly experience the soldiers' fear of never knowing who to trust, whether it's grown man or a small child. The war scenes are well made and they don't feel shaky or edited too fast just to force a feeling of action. Bradley Cooper does a really good job, probably the best I've seen of him so far, but I still wish we could have gotten to know his character even more. He's obviously a patriotic American but what really motivates him besides the love for his country, is sometimes hard to understand.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel the film is OK and worth watching because it actually shows the brutality that was the war in Iraq, but I still can't help feeling that sometimes it seems Clint Eastwood had to bow down a little too much before Kyles' family. It appears they couldn't include some scenes just because his family didn't approve. As a story American Sniper doesn't feel unique or contributing in some new way for us, the audience, but I still feel you can watch the film and make up your own mind.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

","Right... It is very hard to review a movie like this and judge it only by its plot, screenplay, acting, etcetera. This has got to be one of the movies that scream ""'murica, hell yeah"" in your face the most. The whole ideology of being a ""hero"" is just plain wrong in the first place, according to this movie a hero is someone, who goes to a foreign country and kills hundreds of people, who were ""attacking America"" .<br/><br/>We don't clearly know whether it was a good depiction of how Chris Kyle's war tours really were, i surely think it wasn't like that. But this movie just portrayed a random, dumb guy seeing an ad on TV of American soldiers dying in Iraq, what made him join the navy seals in order to ""protect"" his country, just like Americans are taught to believe. There is no reason to go further into the topic of American propaganda, so lets just establish, that you will get a lot of pro American military conversations, scenes and the vibe of the whole thing overall is like that, so just take that into account before watching this.<br/><br/>Aside from all the propaganda, everything else was just great, it was intense, made you feel like you are out there on the battlefield yourself. Had awesome scenery and decent acting, Bradley Cooper was outstanding, Oscar nomination well deserved. It would have been one of the best war movies ever made, only if it wasn't so biased, but that doesn't stop us from ignoring all the nonsense to just focus on the good parts, which the movie didn't lack. Chris's mental journey was what i enjoyed the most, his relationships with his wife, in and out of Iraq were interesting and i loved to watch him transform into a different person. <br/><br/>I will not rate this 1/10, only because of its massive Hollywood censorship, like most of the reviewers here. This movie deserves more for its great qualities, it was enjoyable, it was beautiful and pleasant to watch. So ignore the flaws and enjoy!"
"Seth_Rogue_One","7","1","11","8 November 2015"," A extremely polished picture of a complex war
","American sniper is not a bad movie, not at all. But it suffers from heavy patriotism and lack of self-distance which narrows the war and it's players down to the simplest of terms: the Americans are the heroes who can do nothing wrong and the Iraqies are the villains who are wicked by nature.<br/><br/>It's to the point that it can be used as a recruitment video for the Navy Seals, and I'm sure that many American children watching it will want to grow up to become snipers themselves and fight for the American way.<br/><br/>One could argue though that the whole movie is seen from Chris Kyle's perspective but even so, I'm sure that he witnessed a far more complex situation with plenty of grey areas and not just everything in black and white as what we witnessed on screen.<br/><br/>If you can look aside that it's a fairly enjoyable tale, with pretty natural acting with Bradley Cooper in a more restrictive performance than we are used to from him alongside a thick Texas accent... Was it worthy a Oscar-nominated performance? That I don't know. But it was good enough, just like the movie.<br/><br/>American patriots will love it, while the rest of us have to take it with a little grain of salt."

","Clint Eastwood does it again with this beautiful masterpiece titled ""American Sniper"". After watching the movie many times as well as doing some reading on the story itself, this movie couldn't have been done better. The cinematography was simply amazing, the story was off the charts, and the actors within this amazing cast performed perfectly. American Sniper is a sad story to see such a wonderful person worked so hard to save everyone he could yet it all ending the way it did. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, it's a tear jerk-er, it's an adrenaline rush, it's just an emotional roller coaster if you have any heart for mankind.<br/><br/>Great movie!<br/><br/>Now I've saw some interesting reviews pointing out that Hollywood's message to the world on such a topic is wrong; and I fully agree with that. I think what everyone should take away from any message that Hollywood or any form of National media does or says is to fully pass it off as garbage. The media does not point out any truth in the world, or anything of value, it is one sided and only tells stories to keep our minds at bay from whats really going on in the world."
"lee_eisenberg","5","1","11","7 June 2015"," Chris Kyle must have been crazy
","The main thing that I derived from ""American Sniper"" is that Iraq War damaged Chris Kyle even more than he already was. From what I've read, Kyle called the Iraqis savages. After serving several tours there, he came back more screwed up than ever. It's hard to tell exactly what sort of position the movie is taking about the war (Clint Eastwood claimed that it's an anti-war movie). What should be of concern is that large numbers of people want to hear absolutely no criticism of Kyle. I recently read about a woman who wrote something critical of him, and a bunch of people verbally attacked her, writing threatening things on her Twitter feed (even going so far as to say that Kyle died serving his country, when in reality he got shot dead on a shooting range by a disturbed ex-Marine).<br/><br/>In the end, we must never forget what a terrible decision the invasion was. Thousands of dead Americans, possibly a million dead Iraqis, and Iraq is now overrun by ISIS."

","My opinion is based on the entertainment of the movie. The movie was filed with emotion, action and history. I greatly enjoyed how Cooper displayed the character of Chris Kyle. Most cases are not as severe, but nonetheless, by presenting PTSD it caused the audience to think more of the trials troop may have to endure and understand the burdens some veteran's have from being in war.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed how the film caused the audience to feel such emotion, especially at the end. By showing those who respected him, with the pictures and videos at the end, much of the audience I attended really reacted with similar respect. Emotion often times leads to a stronger opinion and my opinion is positive for this film."

","I didn't get around to seeing this movie because it's just not my style. But often I will watch something because of the awards and the hype and I am pleasantly surprised. ""The Hurt Locker"" was an excellent film. It was riveting because I really cared about the characters and their resolve. This has some of the same issues but doesn't come close to the former film. Here we have a man whose reason for fighting has to do with what he sees on television. He is a man with little moral compass. He just would like to kill the bad guys. This whole film is so loaded with the military agenda, it makes a hero out of a guy who assaults women and children (yes, I know they carry bombs--but that's because this movie feeds us this). He goes into the houses of terrified people, begging for their lives, who don't happen to speak English. Hollywood and Clint Eastwood create a milieu where the deck is totally stacked. The domestic side of it is pure applesauce. The wife back home that he picked up in a bar. The atmosphere of violence that stays after all that this guy has seen. I was surprised at how manipulative and uninteresting the film is."

","Having read Chris Kyle's autobiography and watched many interviews with him I was very disappointing in the inaccuracies in the story. It was a good homage to an incredible man and his fellow servicemen but why not just make it true? Wouldn't that just be more heartfelt and a better story? The writers were attempting to make a more flowing storyline with extra excitement and most of the details were somewhat right but jumbled around and mixed up to give a completely different plot. Bradley Cooper did a good job of getting Kyle's personality and physical appearance down pat. There were definitely a few directing errors that came from Clint Eastwood (easily not close to his best work), even down to a blatantly plastic baby doll that ruined an entire scene. It might have been better as a movie than an adaptation but my viewed was permanently skewed having read the book making it a disappointment for me.<br/><br/>Book: solid 8/10 Movie Adaptation: 5/10"

","I have to admit I went into the movie expecting more of a documentary type story than a biopic/action drama. That being said, American Sniper in my eyes was a safe attempt of a controversial person that could have been something much deeper. The movie paints him as the Superman of our armed forces (which is probably true) and slowly shows the toll the war has on his personal and professional life. <br/><br/>It's a sad story no doubt, seeing even the mightiest of heroes affected by PTSD and the cost of war, but at the same time the movie shies away from the overall impact it has. We are only shown glimpses of his personal life and each time it gets worse and worse, but this is where the movie made the mistake, it shows too much action versus not enough of his personal life. We can easily see his professional career is very decorated and impressive, the movie boasts more than enough action to make him look like the hero he is, but the movie moves away from his personal life which is where we could have really got up close and personal.<br/><br/>Though the movie is quite fictitious from what I have read, the acting and general story are quite impressive. American Sniper is sure to be a crowd pleaser (already has a Cinemascore of 'A+'), it's a good war movie with an interesting lead, but the movie doesn't go deep enough on a personal level and tackle the numerous controversial moments of his life."

","This movie is technically very well made, Bradley Cooper is also an excellent actor. But thats the positives.. <br/><br/>This movie is like a childs view on war. The good guys are the invaders and to not show that they are invaders they face nasty guys that they themselves created. Its in an insight into that somethings wrong with the American psyche after nine eleven. Its hard to get why they wasted so much time in Iraq and the result of that war was the worst possible, there's a lot of other countries that had to suffer for this stupidity. <br/><br/>The simplicity of the sniper (don't know if its similar to the real person but from what I heard the book shows a really nasty person) with the stupid categorization of wolf, sheep and the superhero that defends the gutless sheeps from wolfs is so stupid. And this very simple guy have heard this as a kid from his father and live by this simply division of people as a grown up. Scary person indeed.<br/><br/>Its kind of scary that this movie has so many people in US watching it. This movie could have been made by fox news and they also have a lot of viewers.

","American Sniper (2014): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Max Charles, Luke Grimes, Kyle Gallner: Relentless account war drama about a title that nobody desires after the explosions cease. Bradley Cooper plays Chris Kyle, a Texan who was raised on hunting and being a man. He is recruited eventually to go to Iraq where he would become a legendary sniper. Sienna Miller plays his wife whom he met in a bar. This is a tremendously weak aspect of the film. After they meet her scenes are reduced to either phone conversations or his temporary returns from duty. Two of those phone conversations occur in the midst of enemy attack. The first time, with her realization the life threatening her husband faced, works, but the second call within battle seems a bit forced. When he does return she argues with his distant behavior. Also, they have two children and time just jumps ahead and it lacks involvement. It also doesn't help that during one scene the baby being held is actually a doll. Another big flaw is that, outside Kyle, none of the other characters are very broad. Bradley Cooper brings out the anguish of somebody celebrated as a legendary sniper yet he doesn't celebrate it because killing people takes an emotional toll from the start when he is forced to shoot a mother and son whom are armed. Clint Eastwood brings out the intensity of war and the difficulty of normality once these soldiers return home. While this film is strikingly well crafted technically, for a superior film with very similar themes is Brothers, where characters are more involving and the message still hits its target. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","Finally watched American Sniper. Now I understand the backlash against this film. While it's very competently filmed and acted, it completely whitewashes the main character, who was, essentially, a mass murderer. There is no nuance in the script or portrayal of Chris Kyle, apparently a man without any gray areas. And it overlooks the obvious irony, that he was, in turn, killed by another gun toting mass murderer. Then there's the issue of whether bringing a psychotic to a gun range for ""rehab"" is such a good idea. Clearly not. And it ignores the fact, as most of the media has, that someone else was killed that day besides Kyle.<br/><br/>In all, the film will make you root for the ""good guys"" without raising any questions about whether they are all that good. It completely misses a great opportunity to delve deep into the issues of soldiering, mental health, gun culture and PTSD. I expect more from a great filmmaker like Eastwood."
"cestleilacherradi","4","1","13","4 June 2015"," Killing kills
","Hi, <br/><br/>I am just gonna begin with an excerpt of a review found here = <br/><br/>""I don't give a flying crap about anybody's politics when it comes to making movies. If they're great films, they're great films period. I've been in the film Industry for 33 years and I was deeply impressed with Eastwood's take on a story of constant moral dilemma, vs Patriotic duty.<br/><br/>Here's a guy that was motivated to defend our world and country against Psychotic Terrorists killing innocent people all over the world...while living on the edge of fatherhood. The inner conflict and balance of creating such a powerful reality, was right on the money.""<br/><br/>So, with all due respect, there is already a contradiction, a big one, in this review. So the first idea is that movies are great beyond politics. The second idea is... political! <br/><br/>America is SO egotistical. What is shown in this movie is NOT reality. Are Americans still able to realize that? Or not? Hello, does anybody not find it strange that almost all Arabic people seem evil? So what? Arabic people are genetically bad? <br/><br/>From beginning to end of this movie, while I was seeing the American guys having trouble with warmth, I was thinking : ""What are you doing there? Doesn't that give you a hint that you have nothing to be doing there? What on earth are you doing in another country, blowing houses, and terrorizing people?""<br/><br/>No, that is absolutely normal. Of course, if they have been hurt, they can hurt. That is the pivot key of Americans security system. Oh no, it is bigger than that : if they can be hurt, they can hurt. So they can hurt you even when you have not yet hurt them. Isn't that great?<br/><br/>But why on earth do they kill people that they could shoot in the leg and then make prisoners? Tell me why. Why US people who are so overarmed need to kill a human target, even when they're like ten on that human target ? Pleasure to kill, maybe?<br/><br/>And why on earth does that movie just shows embassies attack and 9/11? Why doesn't it give a much more realistic representation on what happened between America and Arabic countries for ... let's say 50 years? In order to give the viewer a closer idea of what really gets America in Arabic countries and on how America is not just a victim of Psychotic Terrorists.<br/><br/>And why is there so little shown about the family of the child who has been killed? What will happen to her? Why not show what is happening for the Arabic people that have to live in hell all the time? They don't get times off tours... They're hurt in their houses... <br/><br/>It indeed seemed to me in this movie as if the life of an American person was worth more than the lifes of the Iraqi persons. At least this movie shows that idea, that I am sure some Americans share, clearly. What is not clear is : does the director feel that way too, or does he just show the awful ego of the US Army??<br/><br/>For instance, when the 'hero' talks to the family of the child who later is killed, doesn't that make sense to immediately protect the family? Oh no, let's check it out and we'll come back later after everybody had the time to come see that family. Hein?<br/><br/>Does the US Army really work that way? I mean, really, this movie is not a good publicity for the US Army. It really doesn't look like very strategic. Big egos, big tits.<br/><br/>I strongly advice you to watch another war movie : Good Kill. Yes, true, that last movie is not spectacular. But hello, that is a war movie. We're not supposed to have fun watching a war movie, it would be a little bit perverse, wouldn't it? <br/><br/>I don't want to watch an exciting war movie, a riveting war movie, a jack-ass war movie. War movies can only exist us to teach us what the end of this movie teaches us well if we care to listen : killing kills.<br/><br/>That is the only good point of that story, actually of the real one, but it is not really a good point, it is just sadly the flat truth : killing kills.<br/><br/>And America with her right to bear arms and her death penalties is a top leader in the world about this."

So real life stories are not that exciting and that's how scene after scene were played with little adrenalin in between. So he went and without giving much thought decided to be a Seal. No big deal. And training... easy! Just a cold mud pool by the beach (where's Louis Gossett Jr or Lee's Emery Gunnery Srgt?).

And the story goes on with the neglected wife clitché. Yawning already. And more clitches coming up. Who will he confront? You guessed it right, Mustafa, the Arab sniper. Anyone would expect this will be the movie climax but it just happens in another bland scene. Of course he is gonna win this confrontation, if not no one would pay the ticket price. Oh.. and he barely made it to the truck in the sand storm... lucky guy! (one tiny little bit of adrenalin here). Now you know the movie is about to end and he returns home with brain damage (oh... this is new!). Next is the ToysrUs baby moment... come on Clint, this is ridiculous. And ....

"graupepillard","7","1","13","21 January 2015"," A Sniper is an official governmental assassin
","Two of my very favorite Clint Eastwood directed films are MYSTIC RIVER and MILLION DOLLAR BABY- one probed deeply into the corruption of the human psyche, and the other celebrated the triumph of one woman's will to succeed in a world ruled by men - so I always go out of my way to see his work and hope not to be disappointed. This time I was disappointed because my heartstrings were not pulled, but on further reflection, I thought that the characterization of a ""hero"" had a complexity in the very lack of emotional ""tugs"" - which made sense telling the story of a man who is able to preserve his sanity being an official executioner, a job that needs him to be dispassionate and composed, and who becomes a champion of American values to his fellow compatriots. In war morality is abandoned.<br/><br/>American SNIPER based on the true story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, considered the most lethal sniper in US military history - also nicknamed by his comrades ""Legend"" - served 4 tours of duty in Iraq and considered himself the quintessential American ""patriot."" This movie is a portrait of a man who puts country above all else, a man who is steadfast in the ""rightness"" of his actions in protecting the honor and citizens of the United States of America; an exceptionally skilled marksman and lover of guns, and a man who was not introspective and never understood that he was in an occupied land where the population was fighting the ""invader/savior"" whose culture was totally different from theirs. <br/><br/>How do you fight against the major power in the world? You use the new tactics of war - guerrilla hit and run bombings, employing sniper sharpshooters and even indoctrinating women and children into the great beyond of martyrdom. American SNIPER also sets up a gunslinger/HIGH NOON mano a mano duel between two exceptional skilled assassins - each convinced that murdering for one's country and protecting one's brothers-in-arms is the ultimate reward.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper - beefed up to look like Chris Kyle gives a fairly good performance as a stoic, stone-faced and hardened Kyle relishing doing his job; knowing he is the best at what he does and making sure that he protects his""family of brothers"" his fellow Navy SEALS. We see him working out physically - his flesh thickening and tightening up, as does his spirit and thirst for revenge. At what point does a job become something you cannot do without - falling in love with the ""sandstorms"" of war?<br/><br/>Eastwood also gives us flashbacks into Kyle's childhood - a father who instills a sheep vs. wolf vs. sheepherder mentality into his boys. You protect your own (sheepherder) - no matter what the cost in order to become a man. Sienna Miller plays Chris Kyle's wife - a stereotypical view of a woman taking care of the family, giving solace to her husband, and a mollifying device necessary to show the main character's ""soft"" side, but still clichéd and thinly drawn. She is background support.<br/><br/>Marines in Humvees their breadth filling the narrow roadways with skulls painted on them, disembarking and knocking down doors where families are huddled; soldiers ill-equipped to communicate with the population that they are administering leads to strategic errors; treating your enemy like the dusty dirt of the streets invites brutal retaliation. Both sides are heinous and savage in fighting the confused and demoralized battles that were the mainstay of being in Iraq. The ""shock and awe"" of this haphazardly planned war brought home thousands of veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and placed young men and women who volunteered in the name of their land into a future filled with struggle and tragedy. It was and is shameful."

It's also a ""recent"" war movie and I personally know a few who came back- some who came back sick and others only as a fond memory. In MY mind? This movie was trying to satisfy two types of movie goers. 1. The action junkie and 2. the ""Chick-Flick"" emotional journey movie. Again in MY mind? It failed both. Too scattered. One minute he's a child learning how to shoot the next- he's going from tour to tour and finally comes home. Inbetween? It's back and fourth between home and war, back home, back to war. I think the reason this movie is SO popular right now is because we Americans are sick and tired of being hated in our own country BY our own countrymen. Gun hate also has a role in this too. Americans are realizing- the once great and powerful United States of America- is slowly but, surely being turned into a third world country by a President seemingly not caring in the least. In fact- this movie represents the anger and dissatisfaction of where this country- the United States- is being led. And finally- in MY mind, this is exactly WHY it's so popular and profitable."
"notafanof","5","1","14","21 August 2016"," Surprisingly Average
","Clint Eastwood is one of the great living directors, and his primary strength is character development. Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Letters from Iwo Jima- all of these films are the work of a master director who understands story structure and has a nose for character development. Which is why this film shocked me. No character is developed in this movie. I thought that Eastwood would portray Chris Kyle as a three dimensional character with real world worries, but no. He is merely the vessel this film has to follow scene after scene until the movie ends. And that's all this movie is... A collection of scenes that run together with no real purpose other than that Chris Kyle is the primary subject of them. The film has zero sense of pacing because the movie has the structure of: Chris Kyle joins the Army; Chris Kyle goes on a tour of duty; Chris Kyle comes home to family drama; Chris Kyle goes on tour; Rinse and repeat until the movie's Hackneyed and cliché finale. The weirdest part of this film? There is an actual villain in this movie that is exactly like Chris Kyle, and whose purpose is to challenge him. It's ridiculous and very out of place in this movie. In fact, it feels tacked on as an afterthought. Probably because Eastwood realized that his main character was facing no adversity in a WAR film. The movie isn't terrible, but it is definitely rushed- which is surprising, as Mr. Eastwood's films usually have far more nuance to them. 5 out of 10."

","American Sniper (2014) This is a biographical war drama directed by Clint Eastwood and loosely based on the memoir American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. A Navy S.E.A.L. sniper saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Coming back home after four tours of duty, he finds that war was easier to deal with than the aftermath. The film also receives mostly positive reviews from critics. Bradley Cooper's lead performance and Eastwood's direction received the bulk of the praise. It drew some controversy over its portrayal of both the war and of Chris Kyle, himself. It received six Oscar nominations, but only winning one award for Best Sound Editing. It was the second most profitable picture of 2014. The film is engrossing, poignant, and both heartbreaking and heartwarming. It's distressing when people are critical of the film for reasons other than the acting, directing or quality itself. It's about their disagreement with its political attitude. This is a well constructed film and is very entertaining. That's a simple fact. It's a dramatic interpretation and isn't claiming to be anything else. To criticize it for things it never claims to be, just isn't fair. I recommend this movie, but if you are unable to put politics and personal feelings aside when watching it, you only keep yourself from enjoying a very good film."
"JrnlofEddieDeezenStudies","5","1","16","12 November 2017"," I should have loved this
","First, let me say that I'm not very much into politics, so my views about this film have nothing to do with political views, or even moral views or anything like that. Even though this is based on a true story, I watch films like this as if they're completely fictional. And I watch films from more of a ""formalist"" perspective.<br/><br/>I do like this genre. I'm writing having just seen this film for the first time in late 2017. Both ""The Brave"" and ""S.E.A.L. Team"" are about halfway through their first season, and so far I love both. I love video games like the Sniper Elite series. I've enjoyed playing the Call of Duty games.<br/><br/>And I did like this film. But in my opinion it has some serious problems too. I want to talk about what I believe the problems are. The problems are why I didn't love this film. I'm assuming you've already seen the film, or you at least know a lot of the plot basics.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, director Clint Eastwood tells this story in a very choppy, superficial way, with too many plot holes and too many befuddling character actions.<br/><br/>The timeline jumps around, with an early flashback that has to be gleaned simply contextually. All of the jumps have to be gleaned contextually throughout the film. That flashback works out fine, although when we jump forward in bits and pieces I had a bit of confusion re whether I was still watching the two brothers or different characters. I was confused why they were all of a sudden rodeo cowboys, because the film just jumps into that with absolutely no preparation or set-up. And all of a sudden Chris not only has a woman he's living with but he's already having problems with her, she's already fooling around on him, etc. That part is like we've jumped to at least the middle of something that should be a separate film, where unfortunately we've missed a bunch of important scenes.<br/><br/>A couple later jumps, halfway through the film, are even more confusing. Chris's military team apparently blow up a terrorist known as ""the Butcher."" Meanwhile Chris's wife--who by the way does a couple personality 180s that are never explained or justified--is pregnant with their first kid. Well, not too long after that, we jump at least four or five years into the future, because the kid is now four or five years old, but (a) Chris goes back to the Middle East as if it's the very next tour relative to the one where they blew up the Butcher and Chris's wife was pregnant (so what happened during that four or five- year span?), and (b) they talk about the Butcher as if he's alive. For a minute or two, I was assuming that the plot must have jumped back in time in the Middle East again. This is one of the problems with doing time jumps only contextually, so that they're unannounced.<br/><br/>The Butcher is never brought up again, so I guess that they did blow him up. A couple other plot holes are more problematic. Chris's brother, who seems increasingly weaselly and traumatized by being in the military in a war zone (we never see why), more or less just disappears from the film about halfway through. Chris's parents are never mentioned again after the early flashback scenes, either. I don't know why. There didn't seem to be any sort of problems in their relationship with Chris. More seriously, though, is the fact that one of the most interesting things about the true story this is based on is the fact that Kyle wound up killed by a fellow military member, only once Kyle was back in the States, back in civilian life, and where he was trying to help out the guy who killed him. We're given no details about this. We're not shown it. We're only briefly shown the guy when he shows up at Chris's house, they drive off, and that's it, the film is over. We learn that Chris was killed via a brief title card.<br/><br/>Maybe most problematic though are the characterizations. I mentioned Chris's wife's 180s earlier. Well, Chris is portrayed as quite enigmatic and as increasingly unlikable. There seems to be something seriously wrong with him mentally, and it only gets worse as the film goes on. You want to kick him at times when he's on the phone with his wife during battle rather than concentrating on the turmoil at hand. And then you want to kick him when he's back home and he seems increasingly catatonic, as if he couldn't care less about his family--at least not until he gets back to the Middle East, so that he can call them during the middle of a battle again. And then eventually, it seems that Chris's mental problems have more or less vanished with no explanation. It's another plot jump effectively.<br/><br/>Akin to Chris's distractions with phone calls, both the U.S. soldiers and the Middle Easterners are regularly shown behaving as if they don't quite grasp that someone could be shooting at them at any moment, from any possible angle/vantage point. They'll be la-di-da-ing around and then oops! I'm shot in the head, where that consequence is of no surprise to the viewer, if only the characters had a bit more awareness of the peril they're in.<br/><br/>Focusing only on the problems, it must be a wonder why I liked this film at all. There was enough that I liked, but I certainly didn't think it was perfect. Since comments seem to be either praise or political or moral complaints, I wanted to bring up some things that I feel are formal flaws with the film."

","I really didn't care much about the politics of the movie. It is obviously a recruitment tool by the US military to urge kids to join the army. So I would purely evaluate it on the merits of filmcraft, acting and storytelling alone.<br/><br/>The production of the film is very commendable. The scenes of rubble and ruined infrastructure are exceptional, as I couldn't point out where the exact location the movie was shot (perhaps some place in Easter Europe?). The acting by Cooper is also noteworthy. <br/><br/>As a standalone action/ war movie, it is pretty decent but to be honest, there is much to be desired here. The action scenes are a hit and miss; what stood out is an ambush scene somewhere in the middle. Also, the scriptwriters ripped off a few scenes from Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (using a mirror to see who's shooting and the way the rival sniper was dispatched is almost identical to how the German sniper got wasted in that film). Additionally, for a movie supposedly about a sniper, there isn't much sniping going on but plenty of scenes of Cooper using an automatic weapon.<br/><br/>Better just watch this on cable or rent the DVD. Enemy at the Gates is a superior sniper movie."

","When I first came to American Sniper, I came expecting nothing from the movie overall but I was pleasantly surprised at how the action scenes were constructed and how credible the story was built -; stories from real lives of the troopers in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>The first thing I appreciated from the movie was the fact that they showed not only the actions of the soldiers on the field, but also the psychological impact this brought about on family and loved ones. And, realistically indeed, you can see the psychology of Bradley Cooper deteriorate all throughout and to a point where he even loves killing and is only concerned about what happens on the field to a stage where he completely disregards his family. This movie in that respect really gives a neutral yet good perspective about what really happens in a soldiers life during conflicts.<br/><br/>The second element, I'm quite amazed that they did not cut out certain scenes that might seem difficult for the spectator to handle. Children in these situations can also be kamikaze, granted under the brainstorming of the parents, and soldiers have to be able to deal with them, eventually eliminate them. The movie showed though both situations - children who play with weapons but are not kamikaze but can be mistaken for ones and those who use them to kill.<br/><br/>Overall, enjoyable movie that I really recommend for everyone to watch."

Basically this movie succeeds in drawing a highly contrasted black and white world, where good is good and evil is evil. You won't become much headache for watching this film. Beyond its wishful thinking, I would not doubt, that anyone participating in any war is victim to PTSD, what does give me some headache. However, this wasn't subject to this movie. as questionable as the director Clint Eastwood could have been, American sniper goes astray from what could have made this film a good one. It is too shallow, too gentle, apparently double-pro-American and harmless. What Client Eastwood made was a movie giving you a traditional view on topics of today. A global confrontation of indignities and violence, which best is used a exciting scenario. No rules, no questions, just survive. Funny however, as Client Eastwood was the director, and I always thought this guy is an actor, living a fulfilled live, and not a hymn composer, trying to present us his collection of ""gun men never die"" stories.

I'm not really sure what Mr. Eastwood's angle was here, but judging from the fact that it's based on an actual memoir, the general feeling of manipulation as the viewer, and my usual ability to spot propaganda from a mile away, I can probably guess.

","Based on the true story of Chris Kyle, an expert marksman and U.S. Navy Seal, Bradley Cooper portrays the main character who fought in the front lines during the Iraq War.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is seen mainly through Kyle's viewpoint. He is a devout patriot and sees his mission as saving his country and its people. This is a fair viewpoint but the movie avoids the many counter-arguments happening at the time of that very divisive war.<br/><br/>The Iraqi people are mainly portrayed as the ""evil bad guys"". None of them has a chance to express their story of how they feel about a foreign military invading their country or how they might feel the need to defend their people as Kyle does about his people.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film doesn't have a totally hawkish viewpoint. It is quite honest in the difficulties faced by soldiers after returning home. For Chris, this is mainly reflected by his wife, played by Sienna Miller, who is clear in her unhappiness about Chris' drive and how he has changed. Though Cooper gives a rather good performance, there could have been more depth and subtlety in the portrayal of someone who is driven while denying the effect of the traumas he has experienced.<br/><br/>At times, the film seems too long but it ends with a very moving finale that is felt well after the movie's completion.

Every aspect of the movie tried to show the importance of war (without explaining the reason for them going to war in the first place) and worshiping the America's most lethal sniper as God.<br/><br/>Though Kyle's character in the movie was interesting and empathizable, but people who knew Kyle claim otherwise; some say, he didn't even have a conscience.<br/><br/>Even if we neglect those character aspects, the story was quite one-sided.

Chris Kyle just had such an incredible and difficult background to jam into a 2 hour movie and I felt that they were trying to rely too much on the action and not enough on the drama, although there the action was overused it was displayed well. There is also no development for any of the other characters in the movie. It seems like Kyle was the only character in the movie that mattered.

Instead, in this film he focuses on the bloody combats in the warzone. The emotional subplot is only minor, as if they are filler scenes between the intense combat scenes. The result is that the emotional side of the film is much underdeveloped, and even rushed and inadequately expressed especially after Chris congress back from the fourth tour.<br/><br/>As a war thriller, ""American Sniper"" is good.

"bibeaultj","5","1","19","25 February 2015"," A Tedious Slog
","I'm not going to talk about my political views on the Iraq war-or war in general in this review. This is a review of the movie itself. However, I will say that this is pure American military propaganda and shouldn't be seen by anyone who has the slightest anti-war sentiment.<br/><br/>By the way, this review has extremely minor spoilers (can spoilers for a biopic really be considered spoilers?) <br/><br/>American Sniper is directed by Clint Eastwood and is based on the autobiography by soldier Chris Kyle of the same name. It features Bradley Cooper as the soldier during his time in the Iraq war. It also details his experience as a child and shows how he first met his wife, played by Sienna Miller. During his time period in the war, he also has to make many difficult situations in which he is forced to make a quick decision. These scenes would be intense, however they're incredibly overdone. There were more POV shots of him looking down his scope than I can count on my right hand. But we'll get into that later.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is functional as Kyle. He doesn't give an amazing performance, not one that you haven't seen in other similar war films anyway, but it's gripping enough to the point where it pretty much becomes the best part of the movie. His wife is good, although I found her to be a bit over the top in a few scenes, and his fellow soldiers do good jobs of playing soldiers, despite not remembering any of them.<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues with this movie is the direction. Clint Eastwood, an 84 year old man at this point, continues to become more lax with his films. It isn't directed with any passion at all like his other films like Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. It seems like he's trying to set a world record for most reused shots in a single movie. Like I said earlier, there are so many shots looking through the sniper scope, and then cutting to the finger itching on the trigger. The action scenes aren't poorly filmed, but they do a poor job of building tension. It just seems like Eastwood put a camera on top of a building and told people to run while shooting guns.<br/><br/>The story becomes pure tedium. It follows a structure that is: Kyle goes to war, returns home, goes to war, returns home. His wife is portrayed as a stereotypical naggy wife who keeps telling him not to go back. She even threatens one time that if he goes again she probably won't stay, yet he goes anyway, and of course she stays with him. So what was even the point? When he finally returns home for good, his experience with PTSD is completely overlooked and is wrapped up in about 10 minutes. I know I said I wasn't going to talk about the propaganda in this movie but this is a moment that can't be missed. It basically says ""Oh, go to war and one session of therapy and you'll be fine in no time!"" when really it takes months upon months to get over the horrors of war. I guess while I'm on the topic it should be mentioned that throughout the whole movie Kyle is portrayed as a hero, which isn't true to fact at all, and is really frightening, especially since this is a man who's idolized for killing over 100 people and being extraordinarily racist.<br/><br/>Something I've noticed with more and more biopics lately is how they never show the death of their subject, it's told to the audience through text. Despite not being a fan of Kyle in real life or his portrayal in the movie, raw, emotional power can certainly be drawn from the death of the movies subject, yet the movie doesn't show it. It's just as perplexing as not showing Turner's suicide in ""The Imitation Game"" but that's another story.<br/><br/>The dialog in this movie is functional. The editing, sound mixing, even the score, are pretty functional. None of them really stick out, which is an extremely big issue, since there are so many war movies nowadays. It does nothing to distinguish itself.<br/><br/>The one word that can describe ""American Sniper"" is lazy. Every aspect of it, with the exception of the performances, seems extremely dry and passionless. It feels like Eastwood looked at the finished product and said ""Eh, good enough!"" If it wasn't for the propaganda, I'd give this a 6/10, but it can't be ignored that this movie idolizes it's ""hero"" and the military, which is why I give it a 5/10. A good central performance can't save this lazy effort from Eastwood. Maybe it's time for him to retire."

","Intense biographical war drama based on the memoirs of Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper who became the deadliest marksmen in U.S. history while serving multiple tours of duty in the Iraq War. The film traces his early days in Texas as a hunter and failed rodeo cowboy, until the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings inspire him to enlist. A dedicated serviceman, his commitment to fulfill his duty drastically affects his psyche, making it that much more difficult to maintain a regular life with his wife and children. Like many films of this genre there's likely some artistic liberties that were taken, but the story is still compelling, more for the quiet, intimate scenes where the gung-ho Kyle wrestles with his demons, rather than the battle scenes which cover more familiar ground. Eastwood's transitions and passage of time aren't especially smooth, but they're compensated for by realistic, thoughtful depictions of post-war veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, perfectly embodied by a transformative, tour de force performance from Bradley Cooper. ***"
"Turfseer","6","1","26","7 April 2015"," Eastwood's portrait of famed sniper is pretty much a white wash but that does not preclude the film from being entertaining
","""American Sniper"" is based on the best-selling memoir of sniper extraordinaire, Chris Kyle, aka ""The Legend,"" responsible for those ""160 kills"" during the war in Iraq. It's basically an action film focusing on Kyle's four tours of duty in Iraq as well as the relationship he had with his wife, when he was back on the home front.<br/><br/>Director Clint Eastwood's main dilemma is how to flesh out Kyle without turning him into a saint. The best Eastwood can come up with is to suggest that Kyle may have been a victim of PTSD (this is suggested when Kyle tells his wife he's coming home after enduring a particularly hellish encounter with a mass of armed insurgents, at the end of his fourth tour of duty). Eastwood might have felt it necessary to play down Kyle's ""gung-ho"" attitude toward the war a bit as it might not sit well with those who can't imagine that some soldiers simply enjoyed being in combat (like Kyle) and weren't all victims of PTSD. But significantly Eastwood leaves in a scene toward the climax when Kyle emphatically denies that he's a PTSD victim to an Army psychiatrist, after almost losing it when a dog gets a little too frisky with one of his kids during a family barbecue. This seems much more realistic than the film's scenarist's apparently invented explanation that he finally came home due to ""stress."" <br/><br/>Amy Nicholson, of The Village Voice, is on to something when she writes that, ""the humble Kyle on screen is Kyle with his flaws written out. We're not watching a biopic. We're watching a drama about an idealized soldier, a patriot beyond reproach, which bolsters Kyle's legend while gutting the man."" Nicholson is mainly referring to three troubling facts about Kyle that Eastwood conveniently leaves out of his hagiography. First and foremost is the troubling lawsuit that Jesse Ventura won against Kyle's estate after his death. Ventura claimed that Kyle defamed him, falsely claiming that they had engaged in a barroom brawl. There were also troubling unsubstantiated stories such as Kyle's claims that he picked off looters during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and killed two carjackers in Texas after they tried to rob him.<br/><br/>Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune also promotes this idea that Eastwood plays down some of the more troubling aspects of Kyle's character: ""American Sniper,"" from a script by Jason Hall, soft-pedals the book's version of Kyle's bar-brawling, God-fearing zealotry, making him a more humble and companionable movie hero caught in a war Eastwood has no interest in putting up for geopolitical discussion."" <br/><br/>Xan Brooks of The Guardian, also bemoans Eastwood's simplistic analysis of the Iraqi War: ""It's just that American Sniper is so conditioned by its first-person shooter aesthetic that it never widens its focus or pans left or right. Kyle's wife is left hanging, while the war on Iraq is a just, noble cause. Meanwhile the Iraqis are reduced to a band of shadowy savages, darting like phantoms through the alleyways and led by a terrorist Satan who likes killing small boys with a drill. No doubt this sensibility reflects Kyle's experience and if so, that's fine. But I couldn't help feeling that the film rather risks letting its man off the hook. In failing to interrogate the raw matter of Kyle's book, it simply decides to print the legend instead."" <br/><br/>The early sequences in the film prove effective as they are true to Kyle's recollections of a strict father who trained him how to shoot and emphasized the importance of finishing a fight. But it's surprising to discover that the confrontation with a cheating girlfriend never happened and Kyle's motivation for joining the SEALS had nothing to do with watching the bombing of the American Embassy in Kenya on TV (Kyle had always intended to join the military after he finished attending school).<br/><br/>Kyle's relations with his wife Taya is pretty accurately portrayed, including their many arguments about being away from his family. In one action scene, Kyle drops his phone and Taya is horrified to hear the sounds of battle, without Kyle responding. This is an event that actually happened. Kyle's decision to finally return home after the fourth tour was much more likely related to his fears that Taya was going to divorce him than being depressed about killing the rival sniper Mustafa or being almost killed during the culminating firefight.<br/><br/>One scene that's not mentioned in Kyle's memoir is when he and his fellow soldiers are invited to dinner by an Iraqi man and his family. During this dinner, Kyle leaves the dinner table and discovers a cache of guns under a floorboard. While it's quite an exciting scene, Kyle as an intrepid investigator, proves to be a fictional conceit! The big dramatic moment when Kyle kills rival sniper, Mustafa, is also a work of fiction. Kyle only mentions Mustafa in one paragraph in his memoir and stated that other snipers may have killed him (but this was never confirmed).<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" has some excellent combat sequences and will keep you glued to your seat while those are going on. But the scenes of domestic disharmony between Kyle and his wife prove to be somewhat repetitious and lugubrious. If you're looking for a complex portrait of an American soldier, you will not find it here. Eastwood's take is pretty much a white wash, although this does not preclude the film from being pretty entertaining."

How does the main character cope with the mental injuries he is left with after the war? Now it feels the movie starts at 20 minutes before it ends when Chris Kyle finally returns home from his last tour and there is no time to elaborate on how he got over his PTSD and his life back together again. One visit to a shrink seems to suffice, even in apparent full denial of his symptoms. This movie fails exactly where other biographical movies do; in too broad a portrayal of the life of its main character. It leaves a lot of loose ends and feels rushed.

So what happened?<br/><br/>I think a large part of the reason this film felt like such cold utility is its inability to address Weapons of Mass Destruction and George Bush, meaning the constant beating around the bush this film specialises in seems to imply the invasion of Iraq was a just response to 9/11.<br/><br/>in the film there is no sub-narrative or extra time spent discussing the American Invasion and Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) fighting in Al Qaeda, which once again gives the impression that the Iraq War was contrary to Al Qaeda at the Outset, accidentally stating that America had invaded Iraq because it had developed into a focal point of Al Qaeda applications. in reality, Al Qaeda and Iraq cultivated outside of the American Invasion.<br/><br/>This review was extremely rushed, but I hope it allowed just a bit of insight into my viewing experience.

It's certainly not a fresh and original take on the trauma of warfare, but it's certainly presented well with decent seemingly realistic gun-play and some very harrowing moments - like seeing a young child and his mother being killed by the protagonist in one of the opening scenes (arguably justifiable in the context of the scene, but nonetheless an intense moment of ethical dilemma). So I think it's fair to say that this film doesn't exactly pull its punches. And while American Sniper comes with a good helping of chest-thumping patriotism, which is to be expected from a Clint Eastwood film, it still does an okay job of at least giving some humanity to the opposing side like showing a picture of the enemy sniper, Mustafa, as a Syrian gold medalist in the past. It's limited, sure, but at least it's there.<br/><br/>However, the cinematography isn't all that special, the score is unmemorable, and very few of the characters outside of the few in the main cast have any character development whatsoever, thus the few that die leave barely any emotional impact and the ones that survive are wholly unremarkable. In addition, its realism and accuracy to the real-world events is questionable to say the very least (but again, that's expected with most films like this) and some of the special effects like the helicopter in the sandstorm are quite bad. Not to mention that clearly fake baby doll which everyone has already talked about at great length, so I won't.<br/><br/>Overall: 6/10"

","This movie got an Oscar nomination but only because it was a movie about a supposed ""big"" or serious subject - America's wars - and because they increased the number of films which receive best picture nominations....<br/><br/>It is by no means a ""pro-USA propaganda movie"" and it's quite disturbing to see the number of reviews which say that.<br/><br/>Like with any movie titled ""American (something)"" I was skeptical that this could live up to the idea of being as grand and spectacular as America itself, or that it would give us some kind of ""insight"" into the American psyche, and what makes an American sniper so different from say, um, I dunno... a French one... yada yada... etc.<br/><br/>And unfortunately I was right, ""American Sniper"" hugely fails most of all to give us a spectacular visual display of why he was such a brilliant marksman or soldier. We're largely supposed to just believe he was because of the way his buddies and fellow soldiers call him ""legend"". Only near the end of the film does it even attempt any visual effects (some simple slow-mo), when he's taking out his main enemy. It's not surprising that this movie was so poorly and half-heartedly made, the director Clint Eastwood was already in his early 80s by the time this came out.<br/><br/>At the same time. his romance with his wife was not delivered really memorably in my opinion, so it failed to tug on the heart strings when she was talking to him on the phone from 1000s of miles away. None of the other soldiers make any impact as memorable characters, unlike in classic war movies such as Full Metal Jacket. Everything here is bland, mediocre and by the numbers.<br/><br/>There is little-to-no memorable dialogue and at one time the movie just kinda forgets which decade it's supposed to be set in - the part where Kyle says something to his wife about ""people spending time on their phones"". People didn't complain about people ""spending so much time on their phones"" back in the 2000s when this guy was in Iraq. That's a 2010s complaint, which makes the movie one which seems to zone in and out consciousness much like you would if you were in the actual desert.<br/><br/>This is a lazily scripted movie because the writers knows that you already know the story. We all know about PTSD (which was never actually covered), we've heard about it hundreds of times, and we all heard about the sniper being killed by his own crazy ""buddy"".<br/><br/>But seriously - how could this film be ""US propaganda"" when the movie both opens AND ends, concentrating on the idea of Cooper's character pointing his rifle at children? The movie is clearly either conceding ground to the idea of, (or living in the world where) the US was a big nasty human-rights-hating bully which goes around the world killing innocent foreign kids just because eeevil Bush and Cheney felt like it.<br/><br/>Despite being over five years old and the massive pandering that I pointed out above - lame, one-sentence reviews continue to pour in for this movie, from god knows what physical and mental locations, calling it ""FASCIST UMurriCunnn Porpppraguuurnduuuuuuuuuuurgh"" and the like, which is a lot more eye-opening than this weak movie was. Oh and Clint Eastwood continues to pump out yawnfests that take 100+ minutes to play out the opening paragraphs of famous/historical peoples' Wikipedia articles. That's probably one of the reasons why Hollywood now makes less money than the videogame industry, despite folks having to pay four or five times for a new game what they would have to pay for a movie ticket."

"tabuno","7","0","17","15 January 2019"," Decent But Missing The Crispness
","18 January 2015. This movie is about Chris Kyle, a real Navy SEAL, who made several tours in the Iraq War and considered the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. What this movie attempts to accomplish apparently is both an action movie and a biographical movie about Chris's wartime experiences and his transformation as a human being as a result on his relationships. While the movie does a decent job with both, it somehow misses the mark.<br/><br/>Both Enemy At The Gates (2001) and Spy Game (2001) offer more richness and depth of the sniper experience. In Spy Game, Brad Pitt is trained in the nuances of espionage while in American Sniper, Bradley Cooper, is seen being trained in intense but more basic training. But one would expect to see more specialized training which of SEALs are well known and which supposedly is put into some use later in the movie. There are some questionable decisions or lack of both in strategy and on the ground on the part of the United States military that are explained or complained about in the movie. While there is some rationale for the one-sided portrayal of Americans as the good guys and Iraqi insurgents as the bad guys, Enemy At The Gates seemed more intimate because both Jude Law as a Russian sniper and Ed Harris as a German sniper are presented as human beings with a sort of dignity and code of ethics, who respected each other (of course, in reality it's likely impossible to know how Chris and his arch-enemy felt about each other). Nevertheless, Chris's brother's character seems underdeveloped and possibly of some important value to the story of Chris Kyle which was apparently not incorporated into the movie.<br/><br/>As for the cinematography, there is something lacking in the crispness and intimacy of the photography that seems to distance the audience from the action. Such sharp resolution, especially with a biography, is made more potent in such movies as Saving Private Ryan (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), Hurt Locker (2008), Jar Head (2005), We Were Soldiers (2002), and even Anglina Jolie's Unbroken (2014). Perhaps, an excellent portrayal of war might to found in the docudrama television mini-series about World War I, The Great War Diary (2014) As for character development, there seems to be something missing here too. Perhaps this is unavoidable, as a military man who experienced several tours of war and Chris's upbringing may have shut off his inner self from the rest of the world, but nevertheless, the intensity found in such characters as Angelina Jolie's performance in Changeling (2008) or Christian Slater's performance in He Was A Quiet Man (2007) is missing.<br/><br/>It is understandable why this movie is being nominated for awards, especially due to its relevant subject matter, the impact of war time experience on soldiers, yet even at the end, there seems to be a lack of full awareness and understanding on the part of the audience as to Chris's experience towards life and death."

","If the first casualty is truth then any reporting, on any level, on every war must be a lie. Simple right? Not so. Of great credit to any nation is the finesse with which their propaganda machine can revise, repackage and recreate a lie which has been told a number of different ways already. Grab the gullible with the thinnest veneer of purported reality, then when they forget that it's only a movie, once that magic spell has been cast, take them to wonderland, the chocolate factory and the North pole all at once. Throw in a cross genre spell ingredient like Rom-com fantasy leader Bradley Cooper, and his soulful baby blues, suddenly the producers are atop the highest tower shouting 'show me the money'.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: this is one of those hum-vees. It is only a movie. It has several well used aspects of the film story teller's trade. It has a soundtrack. It has Revillie, several times. It has well practiced film masters offering their expertise in presentation. It attempts to access feelings in the viewer. It seems to do these things acceptably. Acceptably. Not fantastically. Not well. It is no more than a $12 blow job off a corner hooker. Any votes cast in the first few minutes, in the after glow, are dubious at best. When that hooker looks up with big brown eyes in the last moments and says I love you, expect to be spit on. It was interesting, it was even momentarily entertaining, but it was only a story.<br/><br/>Before putting a score to this controversial modern fantasy ask yourself some hard truths about it: Did you manage to keep focus all the way through? Did you ever have the slightest doubt about any of it? Did you want to shout out 'that's not right'? Did you pause and come back? Perhaps you missed something and said 'oh well doesn't matter'. If you can say yes to any of these then ask yourself one more thing before rating this film: was it really that good, at all?"

","No doubt, Clint Eastwood is a genius, he can like no one else deliver a slow, deliberately theater-style film of such a slow and often plodding tempo that you want to jump forth as quick as possible.

This film suffered too much heavyweight praise, it has become almost a sacred cow that is not to touch or to be tampering with. Ay, anyway, the film is not without its weaker moments. it is painfully slow far too often, it is very bleak and often too stifling. It is often fer too repeating, and yeah, it smacks of Hurt Locker way too much. Bradley Cooper is a great amazing drama heavy, he does his job very well. But the feeling of some highly strung trying of being more authentic does not leave me even now. Sienna is cool, too, but often too schematic or withdrawn.

So he joined the SEALs in order to become a sniper. This film is about each point of a soldier's life. It deals with his life far away from his family, his life in Iraq and his inner struggle between killing or being killed. The film was inspired by a real story. It's a really emotional film which perfectly transposes what a soldier can feel. It is very well filmed and Bradley Cooper is a really great actor.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This story's focus is the man, Chris Kyle, less the Iraq war. Kyle becomes known on the battlefield and back home as a highly effective sniper amassing a record number of enemy kills. The movie follows his reason for enlisting, honing his skills and shows his effectiveness over a few tours. It also shows how he is mentally effected back at home with his family. The story feels like a bulleted list told very straightforward; not very creative. Bradley Cooper immerses himself in the role and becomes Kyle and does a great job portraying a wide range of emotional states. His performance is what keeps this movie from drowning as just another bland Iraq war movie. Complete with many expected emotional scenes to draw out audience emotions and true sad ending to the life of a awarded soldier.

"Amestrada04","Null","0","14","18 April 2017"," Perhaps the best Film on the war in Iraq
","There are not many films that have come out worth mentioning on the War in Iraq. The Hurt Locker although Oscar winning suffered tremendous criticism from Veterans pointing out the outlandish inaccuracies portrayed in multiple scenes. Six years later we get American Sniper, a film made by a man who actually served in our Military. Although this films primary focus is on Chris Kyle - ""the deadliest sniper in U.S. History"" it is still a film about the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>From the opening scene we are dropped into another world. The call to prayer, the dilapidated buildings, and streets filled with trash. We see U.S. troops patrolling and preparing for urban operations and then meet our main character providing overwatch from a hidden rooftop. The scene sets the tone for the rest of the film - which is not concerned with Political Correctness nor sparing us from the gruesome details of this war.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper does an excellent job portraying in my opinion an ordinary man who did some extraordinary things. I don't believe Clint's intent in making this film was to worship Chris Kyle or the Navy Seals for that matter but to make a film that all Veterans could relate to in one way or the other. Many Vets experience difficulties with their wives when they are deployed whether they experience combat or not - it is a sacrifice. All Vets have to deal with adjusting to home life after they return from a deployment. The strength of Cooper's portrayal of Kyle was showing us someone the vets can root for. A man who loved his country, hated the evil that threatened us, and was willing to do something about it. Although I do not believe everyone is called to serve in the U.S. military I truly believe it was Chris Kyle's calling to do what he did. Was he a perfect man? Of course not but the film shows I believe that from a young age he was being Guided to fulfill this destiny.<br/><br/>One area of irritation I found in this film was the constant bitter tone of Sienna Miller in what seemed like every scene of their marriage except for the ending. I'm sure there were moments like these but I'm sure there also had to be moments of great joy that were perhaps left out for the sake of time. Overall this film is absolutely worth seeing, whether you served or not. Although it is not the best war film ever made, I believe it to be the best film on the war in Iraq so far. I believe we will have others in time and hopefully one day just as Oliver Stone, a Vietnam Vet gave us Platoon - An Iraq war Veteran will one day give us a film that truly shows what our boys went through over there. Thank God for men and woman who are willing to serve in the Military or in any way that helps our country."
"Tehmeh","7","0","11","1 April 2017"," Review of the movie, not of any realities or politics surrounding it.
","This is a movie about Chris Kyle, a sniper and a navy SEAL, famous for ridiculous amounts of confirmed kills. ""American Sniper"" is based on Kyle's own autobiography. And that is all this movie is. Some things are bound to be more dramatized for the movie for narrative's sake, some things probably left out for the same reason, and it certainly isn't preaching about politics. It's the first war movie for a long time where ham-fisted political commentary is not present. So I take it for what it is, instead of whining about what it isn't.<br/><br/>""American Sniper"" is a thoroughly well-executed movie. It's confidently directed, well-shot, well-paced and well-acted. It works. It never fully reaches its potential, but then again it's never bad.<br/><br/>This story isn't told in ""acts"", but ""tours"" instead. Build-up at the beginning doesn't waste any time, and after that we get so see the four tours in order. After every tour, the main character Kyle (Bradley Cooper) spends time at home, finding it difficult. Every tour gets easier for Kyle in the battle with his brothers in arms, but harder at home with his wife and children. This flow or the narrative works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>There is a simplistic ""rivalry"" going on throughout the film. It feels like some old-fashioned revenge-based action movie at times, where the main character just has to beat the ""final boss"". I can't say I hate it, since it tightens the movie at some level, but I can't say I love it either. Anyway it's there, it works, but I can't help but feel the artificial nature of it. I wasn't there (in Iraq) though, so I can't complain about it any more than that, nor can I pretend to know what really happened.<br/><br/>There is a sense of PTSD awareness in this film, and I applaud ""American Sniper"" for that. But herein lies the biggest disappointment: it's not examined nearly enough. For the movie to strike that really powerful chord, PTSD in all its ugly glory should've been more of a focus and dramatized. We get plenty of hints and good, subtle moments, but never the scene that really pays off. Then again, this might have been the case with the book too, I don't know.<br/><br/>Cooper is very good, and gives a somewhat subdued performance. Everyone else is at least okay, even though sometimes the other characters might come across as cardboard cutouts. Sienna Miller is good as Kyle's wife, even though her role is just that and not much else, and Keir O'Donnell equally good as Kyle's brother with his limited screen time.<br/><br/>And even though Cooper is good, I would've wanted to know the character better. There is a certain disconnect, I'm not entirely sure what he's about. Perhaps the book didn't paint that picture either - and autobiographies can't always be trusted if that was or wasn't the case - but I would've liked to care more. When the movie isn't about the war itself, it's important to fully flesh out the character. I understood the character, that wasn't the problem, but I wanted the movie to go so much deeper. It didn't.<br/><br/>It's a Clint Eastwood movie, so don't be surprised if you're not being preached to. Many people seem to take this movie as jingoistic preaching though, simply because it refuses to put down the troops and also because it doesn't shove a political message in your face like every other war movie nowadays. Perhaps it's not politically correct, and perhaps it only deals with the book, not with all realities and events that might have taken place. There is some patriotism involved, which in itself should not be a bad thing. I do not hold these things against this movie, and I certainly don't expect movies to educate me or pander to me. I expect them to tell a story from whatever viewpoints they choose, and if something gets me interested, then I will find out more and do my own research.<br/><br/>To summarize, ""American Sniper"" is a good movie. It doesn't reach the heights of a great movie because there is a certain disconnect concerning the lead character, and the PTSD elements aren't dramatized enough to my liking. But as it stands, it is good. If you are a person who pukes at the sight of patriotism, then you might not like it. If you are a person who demands sensitive subjects handled from all viewpoints and politically dissected whenever possible, this might not be for you. For everyone else, I recommend this movie. Take it as it is: as an adaptation of an autobiography, adapted by people who know their craft."

","I could only watch the first half an hour of this. Where in Gran Turino Eastwood crafted a fine film, in Sniper I was left feeling put out. The child killing scene is obviously supposed to highlight the evils of Jihad but he brings it in too early. I was initially reminded of the NAZI's employment of child soldiers at the end of WW2 but then Eastwood drops a sniped enemy soldier into the frame in a way that was just wrong. Do soldiers really seem so casual about death in this way? I doubt it. Where Clint made some really good points about violence in Outlaw Josey Wales and the Dirty Harry films, here, this comes across as a propaganda film. And make no mistake, I am aware of our current war (being British) and this could have been a worthy effort. But better, more thought out propaganda (not to mention entertaining) films were made in WW2. I support the difficult efforts of both American and British soldiers as well as Iraqi soldiers currently winning against Daesh in Iraq, but they deserve better than this. To be fair this is a film aimed at the American market that could be difficult for a Brit to understand."

The Iraqi people were seen as evil and bad in this movie, even though they were just trying to defend their country from the American invasion. I also want to point out that this man in the movie was motivated to go fight in Iraq after seeing the 9/11 attacks. This even though Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with those attacks. I wonder if this movie would have been as great if it was from the point of view of an Iraqi sniper..<br/><br/>Like I said, this was a great movie in terms of its story and its action. If this were a story about Bradley Cooper killing deadly aliens I might have actually really liked this movie (though I fear it wouldn't have been as loved by others as it is now).

Inspired by love of country and war and hate terrorists, he does four tours in the Gulf War and racks up kills. Cooper is charismatic, but his character is one dimensional, like a human version of a loyal hunting dog. They even make him look stupid. <br/><br/>Sienna Miller (Foxcatcher, Factory Girl) is his nagging wife. She was annoying. You married a combat soldier! Don't break his chops for leaving you to go fight. That's what he does. In any case, Kyle doesn't come off as ""husband of the year."" That's the problem. It was yet another learning-to-be-a-better-father redemption arc. <br/><br/>First, Liar Liar taught us the importance of being a better father (hint: spend time with your kids and use the term ""buddy.""). Then Left Behind took it in dogmatic directions. Grownups 2 touched our hearts with a lesson in fatherhood, followed by Chef, Term Life, etc. <br/><br/>I recently caught up with the woman behind the learning-to-be-a-better-father movement, screenwriter Ashley Atkins. She said she could not explain the rising popularity of the theme/meme, but I couldn't help noticing a tattoo reading ""Daddy's girl"" on her lower back. When asked about her own father, she started crying. <br/><br/>The dramatic tension should have been from a mission, or sniper's adjustment to civilian life while coping with combat-related ptsd, how it was billed. Inmthree hours, they glossed over these elements and the conflict had to do with his strained marriage. <br/><br/>On another note, I didn't get why people were calling Jesse Ventura unpatriotic for suing Chris Kyle in real life. Just because the guy is a war hero, Ventura is supposed to let people think he beat him up?<br/><br/>The aforementioned notwithstanding, if you want a lesson in true patriotism, check out American Sniper. I read a review on here where the poster accused Chris Kyle of having no regard for the lives of innocent women and children. What we he supposed to do when they pointed a rocket launcher at American troops, throw them a birthday party? <br/><br/>On an even other note, what is with the constant ""pulling your loved one into the shower or a pool with their clothes on"" trope in romantic montages? Thanks a lot, Illuminati! Now us regular guys are going to be expected to bust that move in real life. Maybe some of us would rather bathe in peace, without soaking wet clothes. <br/><br/>Sniper is definitely a message movie. Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry; The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) directed and you can see his footprint on it. The storebought conservatism was a little too pat for me. Warning: this picture contains gratuitous use of the word ""savage.""<br/><br/>All in all, Chris Kyle was a bona fide war hero, but American Sniper was a one-trick pony."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","12","25 September 2016"," An understandably engaging war drama
","When it comes to war in general, the concept has taken many forms for different films. Some glorify it to no end while others give their audiences an understanding of certain tragic events that occurred at specific times. Whatever the case, viewers should understand that war is an act that no right minded individual wants to pursue. However when it comes to protecting others, there are only select groups of people who know that joining the military, navy, police force, firefighters or what have you is the only way to do it. The people who join these groups are the ones who are humble enough to put their own lives at risk for the sake of others. It's these kinds of people that deserve the highest of respect because of their contributions to our safety. And for every war, there have always been decorated war heroes. Most recently the biggest name to be spoken of was Chris Kyle, a registered sniper with 150 plus kills during his time in the service. To most, that is an astounding and an unheard of record.<br/><br/>Based on the autobiography of the same name, the movie follows the life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) from buckaroo cowboy to an all out killing machine. Adapting the book was Jason Hall, the writer to Spread (2009) and Paranoia (2013). The intriguing part to this is that Hall really turned himself around as a writer. Both Spread (2009) and Paranoia (2013) were critically panned when they were released. This production on the other hand was the highest grossing film in January in many years. Perhaps it was in due part that Clint Eastwood served as the director to the movie. Either way the script has several areas to consider that prove to be why the film was so successful when it was released. What moved Kyle to joining the military was after seeing the 9/11 attacks and from there on he was determined to help protect his country and the people who shared his feelings. What's also important to note is that Hall's script includes Kyle's wife Taya (Sienna Miller). Together her subplot represented another critical issue - PTSD.<br/><br/>For several combatants who enter the field, many do not come back the same way they entered. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is shown in this movie as a layered issue. That's an important point to make because it's not always one event that can cause it. Sometimes it's a culmination of things. This is especially compelling because of the realistic situations that are setup. Some scenes that are depicted in this movie are not what many films would dare to show nowadays. It's a very touchy topic but this is what elevates the tension. Finally after dealing with all these morbid situations, it's difficult to return home and feel the exact same way previously. This is shown properly through Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller's interactions with each other. As separate thespians, Bradley Cooper practically fully embodies Kyle and that means every aspect. Also not once does Cooper raise his voice, he's always very soft-spoken. Miller on the other hand shows how she gets concerned for Kyle even though she knows he's doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect about Kyle is the fact that he never asked for or reveled in his status as ""The Legend"" that everybody loved to call him. Cooper played Kyle as a guy just trying to do what was right. He didn't care about the awards or nicknames, he was there to protect others and that was it. There was one writing flub within the execution though. Chris Kyle's brother Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) changes motivational views on war; the character and topic is never addressed again. It seems that including Chris Kyle's brother was important enough to start out with but then as one brother develops the other fades away. If this was the plan, why even bother including Chris' brother? And this wasn't the plan, why was his character arc cut out of the final print? It doesn't make sense. As mentioned before the tension is pretty high due to the realistic imagery and violence. The kill shots are thankfully not as ridiculously outlandish as the action in other films like Sniper: Reloaded (2011). They do contain blood but it's mild and that's how it should be.<br/><br/>Tom Stern was credited as the director of photography to this movie. Stern has also done camera-work for films like The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) and The Hunger Games (2012). For this feature, Stern has a number of wide scope panning shots that display the type of terrain and settings that veterans of the military had to withstand. Along side that are the confusing number of houses each team had to check and evacuate when it came to sectioned off areas. Stern was also able to show just how dangerous tasks like these are because of how easily hidden the enemy can be. Strangely enough one strategic element that was mainly absent through the running time was an appropriate musical score. For the 2 hour long movie there were a few synth bass and short piano cues but none of them stood out. Either the music was borrowed or composed by an uncredited composer. Either way the movie mostly works even without the score, but it perhaps could have been even more memorable if it had a recognizable theme to it. Oh well, their loss I guess.<br/><br/>The script has one minor problem with a character and the music is surprisingly mute but in its entirety, the movie makes out fine. Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the legendary sniper is worthy of playing the veteran, the realistic war scenes are quite tense and the development of the lead is thought provoking."

","American Sniper, the name alone will either rally your sense of nationalism or make you roll your eyes as a propaganda piece. First of all, regardless of how you view the subject matter, I think we're all in agreement that Bradley Cooper absolutely nailed this role. As far as this films controversies, I tend to lean liberal but did not view this film the same way most liberals do. I feel like much of the hate this movie garners, is because of the location the story is set in, the Iraq war. By now we've all accepted the absolute disgrace that war was to America, but this movie isn't telling the story of the Iraq War. Instead, this film is telling the story of a soldier who served in it. A soldier who sees the amount of combat Chris Kyle saw has a difficult road and inevitably develops a complex character. One scene struck me more than any in the movie, during the scenes in between his tours it often showed Mr. Kyle sitting in his living room watching film on the war, while his wife asks if he can turn it down. Further into the movie he is again sitting in his living room, we don't see the TV yet, but we hear the incredibly loud and unmistakable sound of war. As the camera slowly pans around till it ends up behind Kyle, you see him staring at a turned of TV. No more film, no more wife telling him to turn it down, because he carried the sound of war inside his own head at all times. If anything this movie should encourage Americans to not only step up the care we provide our veterans, but also make sure our leaders aren't sending them into the wrong wars. Chris Kyle made a sacrifice, his wife did as well, and his children were subjected to this sacrifice. I believe this sacrifice is no less powerful due to the mistakes our leaders made, because if they had chosen the right war Chris Kyle would have gone all the same. We can recognize this sacrifice without endorsing the war. Because this film isn't about the war, it's about Chris Kyle, and it's one hell of a film"

","This movie came in for an avalanche of adverse criticism from many who claimed the film is all lies, and is just a massive piece of Republican propaganda.<br/><br/>When I read this, I wondered if I had seen the same movie.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is a major Hollywood director of much distinction, as is Bradley Cooper a major box office star, and it seems very difficult to believe that the Republican Party (who 99% of Hollywood hate with a purple passion), would be able to exert any influence on how this movie was put together.<br/><br/>The movie was a major hit all over the USA, and it broke box- office records for an Eastwood movie. The movie was made because Hollywood knew it would put bums on seats, not because the Republicans told them to make it.<br/><br/>The fact remains that Chris Kyle is credited with being the most lethal sniper in US history, with 255 kills of which 160 have been officially confirmed.<br/><br/>So where is the disgraceful distortion and fabrication?<br/><br/>It seems that many in the anti-war brigade seem to think that any war films that are made about Iraq and Afghanistan should proclaim from the hilltops how wrong it all was. The 'anti-war brigade' complain bitterly when Kyle and his fellow marines call the enemy 'savages', and that the film doesn't try to show the enemy's' point of view.<br/><br/>Why should it? It's a film about an American sniper – pure and simple. They call the enemy 'savages' because it is their job to kill them – or more accurately – kill or be kill. What would they have them say to the enemy? <br/><br/>They are trained American killers, and they are doing what they've been ordered to do. If you want to see a film about the wrongs of war – don't go and see American Sniper. All armies have snipers – they always have had and always will have. It's a not particularly glamorous or even heroic part of warfare, and I didn't see anywhere in the film where Kyle tried to suggest that it was – in fact if anything, the contrary is true.<br/><br/>His fellow SEALS said he was a hero – but not Kyle, he knew better. He was just doing his job. Even his own brother, who was also in the army, made some serious anti-war sentiments when Kyle met him at the airport Todd McCarthy of ""The Hollywood Reporter,"" wrote: ""A taut, vivid and sad account of the brief life of the most accomplished marksman in American military annals."" Retired snipers have stated that the movie is very realistic in how a sniper is portrayed. It is a particularly unpleasant, un-heroic 'profession'; but hardly a piece of Republican propaganda.<br/><br/>As with all movie bio-pics, it contains scenes that were based more on the creative minds of Hollywood writers than in fact – what's so new about that? Has there ever been a war film that is based 100% on fact? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Now to the movie itself.<br/><br/>I must say up front that I'm not a big fan of war movies. No matter how well made they are, I always become confused when I am watching war action sequences. I never know exactly what it is they are trying to do, which fighters are on which side, who is killed, who are the killers and even when the fighting comes to a 'ceasefire', I don't even know who has won, or who gained the advantage.<br/><br/>To me most war scenes in movies are just explosions of violence where people from both sides are killed and wounded, but I rarely have any idea what is really going on. No doubt film directors would be horrified to read this as I'm sure they plan and create their war action sequences with meticulous care, but for me and many – it goes right over our collective heads. In this respect, 'Sniper was better than most – especially when Kyle working as a sniper, as we can see who he is aiming to take out, and whether he succeeds. But as soon as Kyle joins his squad on the ground then things become murkier, although I have to say, I did more or less follow most of the action.<br/><br/>The film is a very interesting account of an American patriot who went back to Iraq time and time again, (four tours of duty), saw countless of his comrades killed or maimed. He eventually takes retirement for the sake of his wife and family; only to be killed back home by a mentally deranged veteran he was trying to help.<br/><br/>He was clearly troubled by what he was doing; he knew he had to kill to protect his fellow fighters, but took little pleasure in it. When he went back to the USA at the end of a tour of duty, demons haunted him, and he had great difficulty adjusting back to civilian life. The film also does an excellent job in showing us the pain and distress of the families back home in America.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie erroneously shows Kyle taking out an Iraqi sniper called Mustafa who was an Olympic level marksman operating in Fallujah. In his autobiography, Kyle himself stated that ""other US snipers killed him"". Does it really matter? He is indeed credited with killing an insurgent from a mile away.<br/><br/>Eastwood is one of my favourite directors and he never makes a bad film. This is not his best, but all in all it is a pretty good effort and is worth seeing – even if you are an anti- war liberal.<br/><br/>It depicts life as it happened, both in Iraq and back home, in interesting, entertaining and dramatic ways that held my attention throughout.<br/><br/>Whatever your personal feelings about war, it is a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>mobithailand.com"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","10","22 March 2016"," Bradley Cooper shoots it up in this missed opportunity that is completely underwhelming
","Chris Kyle is the most famed sniper in U.S. military history. He killed nearly 160 enemy soldiers during the war in Iraq, documenting himself in his book ""American Sniper."" Now Clint Eastwood directs Bradley Cooper to portray Chris Kyle as the diligent soldier who slayed those who tried to harm him. Demonstrating the effects the war had on Kyle, Bradley Cooper gives a solid performance in this underwhelming war film that fails to be thoughtful or interesting for one second. Sure, Eastwood films a couple of intense war scenes, but he does a terrible job of showing what the war was really like. Eastwood uses the PSTD cliché like almost every other war film, which shows the lack of originality this film, has. Perhaps why it is so bad is because Chris Kyle just wasn't a good writer. After all, the film was adapted by Jason Hall. The script is yet another cliché, giving regurgitated dialogue to undeveloped characters. Bradley Cooper seems irritated throughout the whole film, tired of being in the same type of scene for two hours without anything interesting or profound to say or do. The biggest head-scratcher is that Chris Kyle is only seen using a sniper a couple of times throughout the film, but uses a semi-automatic assault rifle constantly. Not really a sniper after all. The ridiculous controversy surrounding this film is pathetic as well, but the real issue is that ""American Sniper"" fails to do anything unique or astounding given the strong source available to create a good story."

Then at the end we finally have a glimpse of the cowboy we first met, while at the same time see that he was changed.<br/><br/>But I wasn't as emotionally invested in the film as I thought I'd be. Probably because the movie has a tendency to look like an add campaign for the U.S. Military. It's not promoting war or anything but it kind of looks like a nicely directed action-based commercial. Despite the intensity, the violence, and the drama in some scenes it's the archive footage that got to me.

"jimbo-53-186511","5","0","11","14 November 2015"," American Sniper is an OK film but it seems to be getting more praise than it actually deserves
","American Sniper chronicles the life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) who grows up to become a Texan Cowboy. As a child he was taught by his father to become tough and never to back down from anything. In a bid to assist in the war against terrorists, Chris quits being a cowboy and decides to join the Navy SEALS. It is at this point that he meets his future wife Taya (Sienna Miller). However, the horrors of war soon begin to have a profound effect on both Chris and his family.<br/><br/>I'm going to start by saying that I don't know enough about the real Chris Kyle to determine how accurately this picture truly reflects what he is really like. Therefore I'll leave the historical accuracies/inaccuracies to those that are more in the know. Here's my personal take on the film....<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about this film is that it suffers from a bit of a haphazard narrative (at least in the early stages). It seemed to jump very quickly from one aspect of Chris' life to another - him going from being a cowboy, to deciding to become a SEAL, to his marriage to Taya seemed to all come and go before you can even pause for breath. I'm almost certain there were gaps in here that could have been filled just to flesh out the story a little bit more.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film is that the story itself simply isn't as gripping as many other war films. Whilst the cut backs between the war and Chris' home life are clearly there to show how war has affected him, it did interrupt the flow of the film and sometimes made it feel a little bit drawn out. Many of the characters here were also a little flat and the camaraderie between the veterans was a bit hit and miss.<br/><br/>One thing I did quite like about it is that it did try to give some balance to Chris as a person; in Iraq he's dubbed a Hero and a Legend for his superb marksmanship (the flag-waving element with all of this is absolutely shameless). However, when he's back home the cracks start to appear and the effects of war highlight some flaws in his persona. On balance I'd say the glorification of Chris Kyle overpowered any attempts that were made to show any flaws in his character, but I appreciated that an attempt was at least made to show some cracks in his persona.<br/><br/>I remember all the hype surrounding Bradley Cooper and his acting performance being 'magnificent' in this film. Well all I can say is that he certainly wasn't bad here, but his performance here is hardly one that merits as much praise as it has done. Sienna Miller puts in a good turn as Chris' wife (I didn't actually realise it was her till I saw the end credits). All the technical aspects such as direction and cinematography were all above average.<br/><br/>American Sniper isn't a bad film, but in an already crowded field of war films it lacks the excitement and suspense of many previous efforts. The Hurt Locker is a film that focused on the Iraq War which I thought was much better than this film. For me, American Sniper was nothing special and at best it's an average war film/character piece that probably wouldn't have got anywhere near as much hype or attention if Eastwood's name hadn't been linked to it."

Bradley Cooper has an incredible performance as Chris Kyle as well as Sienna Miller. Clint Eastwood's direction also makes you feel like you're dead smack in the middle of this war. The problem with the film lies in the scriptwriting. It's flimsy and didn't really know what it was doing. The directing was unable to match with the screen writing. Eastwood's realistic directing and the unrealistic dialogue clash into this weird mesh of a film. However, it is definitely worth seeing for the sake of Cooper, Miller, and Eastwood."

","Just like Fury isn't a movie about World War II, American Sniper isn't about the Iraq wars. Nor is it about 9/11. And most certainly not about an American Sniper. This movie is about America.<br/><br/>This is what a hero should look like according to yourself, Eastwood tells us.. Did you not decorate him? Did you not buy his biography in droves. Did you not read the book from cover to cover? Did you not gulp down the story of an all American blond haired, blue-eyed Caucasian guy with a pretty girl-next-door wife, who goes out to protect the greatest country on earth? A man of duty? A man of inner nobility? An all American hero?<br/><br/>This is why it doesn't matter whether the movie is set in Iraq, the Outer Hebrides or Middle Earth. This is why it doesn't matter who the enemy is. And this is why it doesn't matter whether the movie contains a truth or not. The only thing that matters is the larger than life depiction of an unblemished hero.<br/><br/>And Eastwood doesn't hold back and goes one step further. The American sniper invades, for it matters not. The American sniper shoots enemy soldiers, because they are not. The American sniper takes out women and kids, because they are not.<br/><br/>Any unease that an American soldier might have shot a someone in violation of the Geneva-convention is taken away by clearly depicting the enemy for what they are: orcs<br/><br/>And did you not notice how unlike reality this is? Is that what really happened, America? Was every civilian death such a clear case of the enemy using any means whatsoever and thus justifying a reaction in kind? Did you really wait for the civilians to show their hostile intent before gunning them down?Did the fog of war not exist in Iraq? Or did you flatten their houses and mow them down with machine guns before they could become a threat? All to protect the greatest country on earth?<br/><br/>Perhaps it was Eastwood's intent, or perhaps not, but the movie is a mirror to what America is not. The more shinier the American sniper becomes the starker the contrast with reality this picture is.<br/><br/>The American sniper is all what an American soldier should be like.. So unlike reality.."

","Now here's the thing. Due to really the people that supported it and glorified the film's real life protagonist I felt rather inclined to rate this film 1 out of 10 stars and call it a day but this regional entertainment retailer always has this great sell on DVDs and I got this movie for a dollar so I set my politics aside to honestly watch this film. One thing that always catches my eyes in a Clint Eastwood directed film is it's boring monotone lighting which is kinda present in American Sniper accept for the few (and there are few) scenes of the American sniper being the American Sniper. I appreciated the honesty of this films politics but I found a certain Life and World Changing Cliché scene to be pretty funny. But I did not feel while watching American Sniper as I do in every recent Eastwood film (with the exception of Letters From Iwo Jima) the continued boredom until the sweet inevitable credits. But in between the realism in the film's depictions of contemporary war is the blah rhetoric of an average stereotypical jar-head either listening or speaking to Bradley Cooper who is the only reason I rate this film an 8 instead of a 7.

Eastwood is known for making movies with a patriotic edge. But it seems that many folks feel that this beyond the pale. Why is it that no American filmmaker should EVER make a movie that is pro-America, or pro-American military? Can not a single movie ever depict white people acting heroically, and non-white people behaving basely? Do these leftists think that this reflects reality?

"MUFCOK","7","0","4","25 June 2015"," Very tough to review, I have very mixed feelings about this movie.
","American Sniper was one of those films that carried a massive hype, everybody was talking about it upon its release and it seemed that everybody, other than myself had seen it. Because of this hype I was expecting an experience that was vastly above average, sadly I was a disappointed. American Sniper is a well-made movie and I did enjoy it but it was nowhere near as good as I was expecting/ hoping that it would be. <br/><br/>Since watching this movie I have seen many negative reviews online from people who were genuinely offended by this movie. They believed it to be an insult to American Citizens and a generalization of the Iraq population, portraying them (men women and children) to be all bad and evil. Having read reviews and re-thought on American Sniper, I can now appreciate these people opinions and sadly this movie has huge questionable issues.<br/><br/>American Sniper shows a blindly biased account of war from an American Citizen, with no real motive or intention apart from a flashback or him killing a deer as a child, getting cheated on by his girlfriend and most importantly; seeing 9/11 unfold on the TV. American Story is another Hollywood blockbuster which tries to convince the audience that glorifies war and gives another ignorant biased view of life on the frontline. War movies are always a touchy genre, they can often glamorise war and make it seem that everything is acceptable in the name of 'fighting for your country'. <br/><br/>The plot of American Sniper states that It follows the story of his struggle to deal with real life and how returning home from war is such a difficult task. We hardly see any of this though; we don't get much story of his time with his family. There is little, if any, character development, Chris Kyle is portrayed as a killing machine, no conscience murderer, then on the other hand they give a half-hearted attempt of showing him as a family man, riddled with guilt over the war. It all feels very confused and lacks identity. The biggest positive of this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He has really developed a name for himself over recent years with some great performances and American Sniper is another great example of his acting ability. The supporting cast all do a respectable job and the direction of the movie is also satisfactory. The action War scenes are very well done and choreographed well, they don't contain endless shots of 'shaky cam' which makes for much easier viewing. When I initially watched this I didn't pick up on the negative points so much, I enjoyed the movie on first viewing, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was still a good movie. However I now cannot help but realise the huge negatives that this film contains. <br/><br/>I knew nothing of Chris Kyle but having researched him after viewing this movie I can now agree with many of the negative reviews on here. He was portrayed as a war hero, his real life personality and actions are displayed as black and white in this movie which is simply not the case in real life.<br/><br/>Overall as a movie: It was a decent paced war film with solid acting but lacked any depth, identity and powerful scenes. Rating this movie on the movie alone I would give it a 7/10. However having researched the back story and real life events I find it hard to view this movie in a positive light and I can completely appreciate the bad reviews and controversy that surround American Sniper."

","I am not a native Texan, but having lived in Texas almost 30 years makes me almost a native. When Chris Kyle was murdered in 2013 by a war veteran he was trying to help it made big news in these parts. So it was with that in mind my wife and I went into viewing this movie.<br/><br/>In summary it is a super-good movie, thanks to Clint Eastwood who directed and supplied some of the music, and Bradley Cooper who did such a fine job portraying Chris Kyle. It shows the difficulty these young men and women operate under in a foreign land to fight terrorism. It can't help change you, and most of the core story here is how it changed Kyle, and his ability to deal with the real world and fit back into his family after his last tour of duty.<br/><br/>It is based on his own book, but some of the incidents have been questioned, and surely some changes were made when developing the script for the movie. Still it is a very gripping drama, as much of the action is portrayed as what the sniper sees through his scope as he surveys the comings and goings below his usual high perch atop a building.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is super as Chris Kyle and Sienna Miller is super as his wife Taya Kyle."

","The lion's share of ""American Sniper"" is spent overseas and on the battlefield, but it's not that war movie that really interested me. It's the scenes when Kyle is back home that the movie bears some real weight. This character is so hard-wired and mentally with his brothers-in-arms that he can't explain to those back at home why he has to keep going back to Iraq. But it's also heartbreaking to see the destructive effects on his family life. Chris and his wife started out s something exciting, but the relationship suffers when he's back home; the anxiety increases simply when they're having a marital chat.<br/><br/>It might be that, between ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"", I've just gotten bored with battle scenes in that region. The shootouts and ambushes weren't doing it for me (well-staged though they were). Not sure. But when the movie becomes (almost) anti-war is where the real tension happens. And give Bradley Cooper some real credit here; he really seems to inhabit that Texas drawl, rather than just affecting an accent. That, and the bulked physique, he's throwing himself into this role.<br/><br/>7/10"

","While American Sniper is an entertaining movie, I don't think it's as thought-provoking as I'd like it to be. This seems like a wasted opportunity to me. Instead of an interesting character study, we instead get what is mostly an action movie, with some hammy drama thrown in. Chris Kyle always felt in the right even when he was clearly wrong. He seemed a nearly flawless man, when in actuality he was quite flawed. He's a proved liar, and slanderer, yet the film portrays Kyle as some kind of flawless American Hero. At no point in the story did I feel the tension Eastwood was trying to invoke. The situation with his wife, and child, are clearly meant to be stressed, nigh on the breaking point, but it never felt like the weight was there to back up the performances. Everything felt so safe, and not at all stressful. It's shot beautifully, and there are some interesting visual choices. One example: a sandstorm where we can see just as little as the soldiers can. Little touches like this make American Sniper at least enjoyable for one watch, but repeat viewing is unnecessary. If you can get past the glaring omission of some of Kyle's less-desirable character traits, you'll most likely enjoy the film."

I was surprised that Clint Eastwood did this since he can be a good director when he can like in Letters From Iwo Jima and Grand Torino, which I WILL review one day. Anyway the movie starts with the sniper played by Bradly Cooper, at the front lines. Then it flashes back to his upbringing hunting with his dad. Then he joins the Navy Seals after seeing an uprising on TV with his brother after a rodeo.<br/><br/>He seems to do good for the training that's being thrown at him and then he meets a girl at a bar before his sniper training. They start to hang out every now and then and then get married. The sniper gets sent to the front lines and gets his first people kills, a boy and his mother, and has regrets at first. Then it ends up being in the middle a sniper vs. sniper story when he tries to stop a rival sniper from killing a kid. That sniper vs. sniper story dates back to Vietnam my dad told me, also thought it would be an action movie but it's a drama.<br/><br/>There's also this scene with him pinned down at some building and then a sandstorm comes by. Thought that was the end but it wasn't and it was hard to see everything when it hit. I also remember this quote from the movie when the sniper says ""Hell of a thing to stop a beating heart."" and that's so true. The ending I won't give away since I don't want to spoil it for all of you but it's pretty powerful. Even touched my dad a little.<br/><br/>The whole movie seems okay like a 7 out of 10 and my dad thinks Bradly Cooper looks like Sean Penn.

","First of all let me say it is difficult for me to review a movie like this one. Because I'm against war, and certainly wars that are not justified at all. America had no reason at all to start a war in Iraq. The only reason they started a war there is for oil and for weapon business. Like most of their wars actually. You will never see them going to war in countries where there is nothing to gain. War is for idiots and anyone that is condoning it is an idiot as well. If that is the definition of being a patriot then patriots are complete fools. The man in the story obviously liked killing people and should certainly not be remembered as an hero. But that's how I'm thinking about wars, patriots and all that kind of unimportant things in life. Now about the movie I have to admit that it is a good movie. Well directed and with an excellent Bradley Cooper. I wished every war movie was just fiction but it isn't. We are the parasites of this planet and we will eventually completely destroy it. Too bad but that's how it is, too many idiots in command and too many idiots following their orders..."

","Review: I really didn't know that this was based on a real person called Chris Kyle who got killed by another war veteran who was suffering with post traumatic stress. When I saw what happened to him at the end of the movie, it did touch me because he lived through 4 tours of duty and killed 160 enemies which saves many people's life's. It does seem more like a documentary than a Hollywood blockbuster, so you feel like your in the heart of the action which gave the movie intensity and anticipation. Bradley Cooper wouldn't have been my first choice to play this role but he done a brilliant job as the American Sniper who had difficulties with his personal life whilst serving his country. Once he decided to call it a day, he still had problems with every day to day life but you could see that his family life had improved. That's why the ending really touched me and I have to say that a Clint Eastwood done a great job with such a delicate story. Its only been 2 years since he was murdered so this amazing story meant a lot to many people, especially his wife and children. From an entertainment point of view, I did enjoy the film and the action scenes were shot extremely well. The love story was also put together well and it gives you many different elements to Chris Kyle who achieved so much in his 38 years on earth. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: What an emotional story! Bradley Cooper was last seen in Serena and American Hustle so I wasn't expecting to see him in such a manly movie about a war hero. After watching the documentary about the making of the movie, he really did give this movie his all and he spent some time with Chris Kyle's widow, with Clint Eastwood, so they could get this picture exactly right. Judging by the money that it made at the box office, it's obvious that many people were touched by the story and it always helps when you've got Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood on board. Its hard to believe that Eastwood can still pull out major blockbusters at the age of 85 and he still has 2 movies in the pipeline. Bradley Cooper hasn't stopped working since his major role in the Hangover in 2009 and with his films grossing over 2 and a half billion dollars, he has definitely become a major league player in Hollywood. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch for its intensity and emotional storyline which has been put together well by Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $545million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama movies about the true story of Chris Kyle who saved many people's life's on the battlefield but sadly was murdered by another veteran who was suffering with stress. 7/10"
"brchthethird","7","0","3","4 June 2015"," PTSD and the toll of war on the soldier's psyche
","I went into this film with a little trepidation due to the extremely polarized reactions I saw online. Beyond that, I really wasn't too familiar with the film or Chris Kyle's life outside of the tragic way he died. Now that I've seen it, I can say that it's a good film, although its subtlety might be the reason some people read it the way they do. Far from being a pro-war statement (or anti-war, for that matter), its primary focus is in showing the toll that war takes on the soldier's psyche.<br/><br/>A run-down of plot details isn't really necessary because you can just pick up Chris Kyle's autobiography if that's what you want. The basic structure is a series of sequences that go from Chris's home life to each of the four tours he served in Iraq. After each tour, you can see the effect that his job as sniper has on him psychologically. This is perhaps the film's best asset, although it doesn't really start to pay off until about halfway through. Before that, you have to deal with about 30 minutes of rote setup that establishes Chris's character: an all-American guy with simple values and morals. Odds are, this is what the more conservative viewers in the audience are drawn to, although to take what Chris says at face value is to miss the psychological underpinnings and point of the film.<br/><br/>What works against the film is, unfortunately, the direction. Clint Eastwood might have been Chris's dream director (according to his wife, at least), but it's quite apparent that he was merely a hired gun. The battle sequences, which one would expect to have some flair, were competently staged but executed rather stiffly. That's not to say they were all bad, though. There were a couple of moments that really worked on a visceral and emotional level, one of which was used as a selling point in the trailers. In the scenes back home, Eastwood steps back further and lets the characters and drama unfold naturally but the whole thing still feels anonymous from a directorial perspective.<br/><br/>Of course, given that I enjoyed the film there is plenty to give it credit for doing right. Chief among these are Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, who I feel were perfectly cast. They looked like their real life counterparts, and Bradley Cooper did some DeNiro-level character work in terms of turning himself into Chris Kyle. However, given the film's focus on war's toll on the human psyche and its effect on family, Sienna Miller did an amazing job portraying a wife who only wants to have her husband return to her alive and mentally be there. Even though it takes a while for the film to show its hand, once you see Chris Kyle's struggle to return to normal life after returning from the battlefield, all of the simplistic setup somehow feels worth it.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't see what people got so up in arms about. No, the film doesn't question American involvement in the Middle East or the morality or war in general. It also doesn't paint Chris Kyle as some savage-killing hero/real-life Rambo. Even in the few moments where Kyle is referred to as a ""legend"" he never feels quite at ease with the designation. To him, being a sniper was a job he did to protect his fellow soldiers. Simplicity of character should not be mistaken for the film itself being simplistic. Despite the unspectacular direction (and some ridiculous CGI bullet time), I thought American SNIPER was a subtle, maybe too much so, examination of the detrimental effect that war can have on the mind of a soldier and the lives of their family."

"bryanmillsfist","6","0","13","24 May 2015"," So-so war film.
","Much love and bile has been directed at this film. The debate says more about the viewers than it does about Chris Kyle. In this post-Vietnam/Iraq world many desire their war films to be more Platoon or Thin Red Line than The Longest Day. Others want the exact opposite.<br/><br/>This film is more along the lines of the traditional depiction of war with some modern touches. Whilst not as simplistic of a depiction of a soldier protagonist as in John Wayne films American Sniper lacks the moral complexity of films like Full Metal Jacket.It's a passable depiction of war. It certainly is no classic along the lines of Blackhawk Down or Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>American Sniper ultimately will be known more for the furor that it caused than it's contents. The debate is between two groups of people passing judgment or giving out praise to a life they don't much understand.Americans more than ever are ignorant of war and what it means at a philosophical level and for the people directly involved in it. <br/><br/>Some say this film is propaganda, but that is not a legitimate argument. Oscar Wilde once said that ""Truth is rarely pure and never simple."" It's the arrogance of people today that leads them to think they know the truth when all they know is what others have told them. Reading articles or viewing documentaries doesn't mean you know what went on. All it means is that you read or viewed someone else's view of what occurred. The real truth is known only by those who were there.Every other person's opinion stands is wholly dependent on the information given to them(and thus susceptible to manipulation.) It is a fool who thinks that only the government lies and deceives about war. <br/><br/>Movies are points of view. As a result they are all biased. To label American Sniper that went all movies are intrinsically biased is ludicrous. Frankly, those who accuse it of that are simply angry that the movies does not depict their point-of-view about the events at hand.<br/><br/>There is another issue I have to tackle that is with hypocrisy. Much has been made about the depiction of Iraqis in this film. It's been called racist and simplistic. That allegation made me shake my head. This film depicts Iraqis as every non-German World War Two film depicts the Germans in the Second World War: Simplistic one-dimensional characters. I have yet to see Michael Moore or any leftist complain about the unfair depiction of Germans in films.<br/><br/>What it boils down to is that this film isn't anti-war and thus is being torn to pieces by those who are stridently anti-Iraq War. Conversely, those who openly support the war in Iraq love this film because it seemingly confirms what they believed. Ideological bias has impacted how this film has been received and the critiques of it have to be viewed with that understanding.<br/><br/>American Sniper is a middling kind of movie that Eastwood every so often produces. For every Letters from Iwo Jima(brilliant) there is a Flags of Our Fathers(meh). Sniper is decidedly in the latter category."

It was more then two hours long but felt like five because of scene after repetitive scene of Bradley Cooper shooting people from rooftops.

It was also very predictable - very much like the screen writing efforts of James Cameron there is absolutely no subtlety here. <br/><br/>I think this was ultimately supposed to be a film with an anti war statement but it could have been accomplished much more economically and more interestingly than it was. One of the things I look for in a really well made movie is the feeling that every scene is integral to the plot - this film failed that test. Close to an hour could have been edited out without any real loss of understanding on the part of the audience.<br/><br/>I can understand why this was nominated for technical awards - the sound editing was very well done - but really shocked that it made the list for best picture.

","Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" supposedly tells the true story of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, a soldier who has become a legend for killing over 160 Iraqis during his three tours of duty in Iraq. I am so ambivalent about this film because on one hand it's superbly made (with first-rate performances by Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller); on the other hand, it strikes me as insultingly oversimplified in its portrayal of socio-political conditions during the Iraq 'war' as well as barely touching on the serious psychological effects returning veterans have had to deal with. Moreover, its screenplay by Jason Hall used too much 'artistic license' -- for example, in real life Kyle never engaged a sniper-antagonist named ""Mustafa"" (an actual sniper killed somewhere else) -- and Hall deceitfully sanitizes Kyle (who bordered on being sociopathic in his callous and joking attitude to his many kills).<br/><br/>The worst thing about the film, however, is the patronizing and jingoistic last sequence of Kyle's memorial service, ending the film just like a commercial for the armed services. In the theater at which I saw it, many veterans (who have been deservedly proud of their service) began shouting and egging other audience members into loudly chanting over and over as the end credits rolled, ""U.S.A.! U.S.A!"" as if it were a sporting event (during which time I had to suppress my own very different thoughts at the Bush administration that put them there). Here, the film was reaching far beyond honoring Kyle but pushed it to hero-worship. I think veterans like Kyle deserve a less clichÃ©d, more nuanced portrait of the sacrifices they made, including an accurate detailing of the psychological damage veterans had to cope with after coming home. This part of his real story was virtually ignored, only hinted at (e.g., in the scene of the family dog). Eastwood should have been more concerned with ending on the tragic human cost over any patriotic sloganeering for people to cheer at."

Instead, the director emphasizes on the psychological collateral damages occurring on soldiers and vets.

Validity of igniting the war in Iraq now we all know was triggered by confusing pictures that Bush and Blair drew for their own people. Those who were told Iraq had the Weapons of mass destruction. A Moslem nation somehow related to Osama Bin laden. On the other hand we had patriotic Iraqis ( some call them insurgents) who also felt the invasion of their homeland by foreign powers is worth fighting for. Two sharp shooters both protecting their own kind with so many similarities.

But the film is not plagued by its politics as some feel it is. The shades of grey may not be vivid but it is also not black and white. Chris Kyle may be presented as a hero in many ways in the film, but it is not clear cut, and he is wrestling with some demons, not that showing Kyle recoil at killing people is redemption enough. Granted, the film does have some nauseating jingoistic moments - you can't end the conversation of an entire war based on the notion of protecting buddies. But nevertheless, it's an average film. The typical war film you get these days don't try any more or less harder than Sniper does. It is well done in the technical department with the sound design and editing salvaging what it can when the writing gets messy. The real highlights of the film are Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. The latter is great if underused but it's mostly refreshing to see Cooper not try to show off how much charisma he has and actually be transformative and nuanced in a way. Still, nothing special overall, only worthy of conversation because of Oscar nominations and box office. <br/><br/>6/10"

","American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood is nominated for 2015 Academy Awards under Best Picture category. However, it fails to impress much like The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and others. American Sniper is a simplistic story of Chris Kyle, the most successful sniper during US-Iraq war credited with over 160 confirmed kills. Chris was a cowboy from Texas before getting into SEALS, which he joined after watching attacks on US citizens by Arabs. Chris was commissioned on 4 tours to Iraq over a period of 10 years and he was literally the most lethal sniper that Americans let loose on the Arabs. His first kill was an under-aged child and second a women, trying to attack US military convoy with a Russian grenade. Chris was getting better every time he killed a suspect, however after each tour when Chris was back home, he started developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder syndrome (PTSD). The movie essentially revolves around the 4 tours and how Chris deals with PTSD. What disappoints is that American Sniper is neither an action packed war thriller nor a heart thundering violent drama, it is somewhere in between like a dull diary of a soldier. Bradley hardly adds any meat to his role, as even George Clooney could have played the same role with his natural poise. Personally, the title sniper is bit misleading, as Chris was a soldier with a rifle and maximum kills but not like Vassilli of Enemy at the Gates. All said, Eastwood manages to put across a decent war movie with landscaped cinematography and well crafted screenplay. Without commenting on its nomination to the Academy Awards, American Sniper is worth watching!"

","Riding on the coattails of current event relativism and the Bradley Cooper Hype Train, Clint Eastwood's film ""American Sniper"" promised us that it would be ""the best film of the year"" as well as ""one of the best performances of the year."" Naturally, I watched this film attempting to analyze these claims for myself.<br/><br/>Was ""American Sniper"" on of the best films of the year? Perhaps; it would mostly depend on who you talked to. In my personal opinion, I believe ""American Sniper"" was very similar to ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008); however, the latter was far superior. This comparison may come under criticism due to the fact that Eastwood's film is based on a true story while the other is not. To those that would argue this makes it more intriguing or better, pump your brakes. ""American Sniper"" is loosely based on the auto-biography of Chris Kyle himself, but some rather key character traits are lost in the movie (most likely for some kind of propaganda). If you do not believe me, I encourage you to do research yourself, Kyle is a very interesting study into psychology when it comes to the combination of hate, power, and respect. Moving on, the movie itself has some rather cheesy plot lines that look like they came straight out of ""Enemy at the Gates."" It is also an extremely fast paced film that covers several years of Kyle's life, but only focuses on a few days. In conclusion, there are plenty of other films that I thought were better this year, including ""Fury,"" another war movie that deals with psychological issues and American heroes. If you want to see a great film on war that also deals with PTSD, please give ""The Hurt Locker"" a watch if you have not already seen it.<br/><br/>Did Bradley Cooper give one of the best performances of the year? No, but he did give the best performance of his career. Unfortunately for him, many other great actors also had tremendous years. Cooper will most likely get stomped by the other nominees in the Leading Actor category.<br/><br/>In short, ""American Sniper"" was good, however; the hype, money, and recognition it is receiving are highly undeserved in my opinion. I gave this film a 7 out of 10 for a great performance from Bradley Cooper and for its theater watch-ability. If you insist on seeing any of the garbage coming out in the next few months, see this instead, hopefully it will have an extended release because of its late release date."
"mustardman29","6","0","11","19 January 2015"," First half is a recruitment video but second half feels more real.
","Based on the IMDb ratings and reviews I was expecting more and came away a bit disappointed. The first half felt a little bit like army propaganda at times. This left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth and probably ruined the more realistic second half when they started to deal with the negative effects of war.<br/><br/>Cooper did a really good job. He deserves props or his portrayal. However, I think this movie could have been much better if they didn't have to get sign off from the family and the army requiring them to portray the main character in a certain way. Also the ending just sucks and no way around that one.<br/><br/>To summarize, it was OK but not at all Oscar worthy imho."
"badado","6","0","12","19 January 2015"," Average war movie.
","I really like Clint Eastwood movies and Mystic River is among my favorite ones.<br/><br/>American Sniper is the story of an American sniper in Middle East war over several years. The movie is beautifully shot, but I really did not connect with the main character, nor the other ones. I prefed way better Black Hawk Dawn (Ridley Scott). What I really do not get is the patriotic ending, with real footage of his funeral parade.<br/><br/>Why the sniper is considered a hero (ok he saved other soldier's lives) if he killed so many people?<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie about war (not war movies) I suggest:<br/><br/><ul><li>Full Metal Jacket - The Thin Red Line</li></ul>"
"PrashunChakraborty","7","0","12","19 January 2015"," Decent, I wish I could say more
","Every year we get a new war movie around this time of the year, and all of them are decent but none stand out, last year we had Lone Survivor and now this. American Sniper continues this tradition faithfully, it is a decent movie which is passable has some good scenes, has some character development but excels in no department and has a bland protagonist. Chris Kyle the American sniper on whom this movie is based on was the most lethal sniper in American history, amassing a body count of more than 160 kills over his four tours in Iraq. In movie he is portrayed almost as Captain America honest soldier who cares about his country. While there is nothing wrong with this representation, real life Chris Kyle was pro war and had other controversial opinions which should have been included just to give more dimensions and angles to Bradley Cooper's representation of Chris Kyle, at least then the character would feel more complete instead he feels like a safe and non controversial all American hero. There are other familiar war tropes which appear in the film - making new army friends, losing army friends, PTSD, withdrawal from family, addiction to war and the rush of war all of which is decently done but again nothing stands out. Currently the film is enjoying a record breaking run at the box office and I am glad that audiences are enjoying quality films over the usual mindless action films. Clint Eastwood's direction is better than his previous effort - J. Edgar. Cooper is earnest and is freakin' physically HUGE in this movie I can already see Disney's Marvel and WB's DC pursuing Cooper for another boring superhero franchise."
