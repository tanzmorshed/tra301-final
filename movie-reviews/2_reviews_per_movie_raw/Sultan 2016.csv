","I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing ""regular"" characters, such as the journalist in ""PK"". But as a high profile corporate executive in ""NH10"" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all."

","perfectly crafted story of an individual who never gives up in life always keen to fight within him n challenges for his dignity this films gives passion to create your own entity and while the convener is alike SALMAN Khan things become much easier to impact on Hearts, Salman did full justification to rule so did Anushka. Transformation on character was made tremendously well by Salman Khan as he not only shaped his body accordingly but also on his accent. I rate this 10/10 as story leaves a message to society as well. this movie worth watching while a sweet love stories leads an inspiration all the way till the end of the movie.

"hemantnaagar","10","137","156","7 July 2016"," Brilliant performance by all...A inspirational and motivational sport drama
","The movie is one of the best sports drama ever produced in Bollywood. Can't see why some people are rating it so low, perhaps they don't know much about films. Salman's performance was outstanding and so was Anushka's. The movie is based on the life of a wrestler and how the biggest opponent of any wrestler is he himself. The dialogues in this movie are so appropriate and most of the people.The movie is an inspiration to the aspiring wrestlers and other athletes. The movie gives a strong message about how one should stick to his roots to achieve success in his life. Todays generation is filled with wannabes, what they don't realize is you can't beat someone in their own game i.e if you copy someone, you cannot get ahead of them. The only drawback in this movie was that its a little fast-paced. Otherwise a very nice. The action was realistic and very well choreographed, sound effects was one of the best in Indian cinema."

Now coming to the performances, it is #SalmanKhan all the way. #SalmanKhan is #Sultan and #Sultan is #SalmanKhan :) I cannot imagine anyone else playing the character of ""Sultan"" and that is where ‪#‎Salman‬ proved his mettle. The actor deep dives into the character as if it was tailor-made for him and gives his best. ‪#‎AnushkaSharma‬ as Aarfa is equally competent and shines in her well- defined character :) ‪#‎AmitSadh‬ ( the guy from ""‪#‎KaiPoChe‬"") finally gets the opportunity to show his acting skills and the actor does well. Last but not the least, ‪#‎RandeepHooda‬ will blow your mind with impeccable performance. The actor who plays Anushka's father does a fine job as well. :) :) ‪#‎AliAbbasZafar‬'s direction is superb.

"snaidu422","9","128","152","6 July 2016"," wrestling with life
","well,when its a salman film you were walking into, you are always forewarned about the no-script endeavors and nonsense catering to only to his fans. well! things changed a little with ""bajrangi baijaan"" last year and things also changed favorably with this year's SULTAN.<br/><br/>Sultan is a beautiful love story set within a sports backdrop. The sport is an oft-ignored and oft-looked down upon Indian wrestling and chronicles the journey of a down and out Indian Wrestler to the arena of free style wrestling, all for the sake of the love of a woman.<br/><br/>Sultan (Salman Khan) is a wayward cable operator in remote town in Haryana. His only past times include hanging out with his good for nothing pals and grab kites as they are cut down. During one of his misadventures with kites, he runs into Aarfa (Anushka Sharma), a wrestler aiming for the Olympics. Aarfa makes it clear that she only wants to get married to a wrestler and Sultan joins Aarfa's wrestling Aakhada to get trained to be a wrestler. He makes it to the state selection and gets married to Aarfa. Aarfa sacrifices her olympic opportunity to become a mother. Sultan starts winning bout after bout including tasting success at the Asian as well as the olympic games. Success makes him arrogant and it slowly blinds him with power. He heads for turkey to win an international bout inspite of Aarfa requesting him to stay back as her delivery date is fast approaching. Sultan leaves anyway. He receives the news that Aarfa has given birth to a boy. Ecstatic, he heads back to India and that's when tragedy strikes....<br/><br/>Salman Khan is a revelation in the film, yes he proves that he can ""act"" and not just stand there as if doing the audience a favor. The scene where he looks at himself with a paunch and breakdowns is one scene where he showcases his acting abilities to the fullest. The scene where Aarfa slaps him and the scene where Aarfa proposes to him are some of the scenes where he truly excels. Anushka Sharma is mind blowing, she literally overshadows the khan in their combination scenes, be it the pre-interval Hospital scene, or her re- introduction scene in the flashback or the scene where she puts Sultan in his place by slapping him, or the silent reactions to sultan's information on TV really proves what an excellent actress she is.<br/><br/>Randeep Hoonda also does his best in the little time he has on screen.<br/><br/>Music By Vishal-Shekhar is good, especially the ""baby ko base pasand hain"". The lyrics may sound lewd, but watching the song in context of the scene would definitely bring a smile to your lips. Cinematography by Artur Zurawski is good, especially the wrestling scenes, which by the way were well choreographed.<br/><br/>Screenplay by Aditya Chopra lays more emphasis on the romantic aspect which pushes Sultan to his rise and fall and....well! no complaints here as it was engaging.<br/><br/>Ali Abbas Zafar's handling of the subject deserves a pat on the back and kudos for attempting a film of this sort with Salman Khan and still come out a winner.<br/><br/>I would give it a 4.5 on 5 and would recommend it to everyone without any discrimination to their movie tastes."

","Sultan is a superb family entertainer. Sultan"" is a sports-drama film with a good dose of romance, music and emotional quotient. Director Ali Abbas Zafar has written the story, while producer Aditya Chopra has penned the screenplay for the movie, which deals with the story of heart, passion and grit in Sultan Ali Khan wrestler from Haryana. It is about how Sultan brings to life his story of love and determination against all odds. It has got superb plot and story-line and salman delivers a powerful performance. Everyone has done a great job. ""Sultan"" has been produced with a whopping budget by Aditya Chopra under his banner Yash Raj Films. The movie has superb production elements.

","The movie is a fictional sports drama but the the way it has been executed it seems real. Salman Khan and Eid has became synonymous in India. This movie is not only highly recommended for the Salman fans rather all those who love to watch brilliant mainstream cinema. Salman Anushka looks great as couple and at the same time very intense and cute. Music is add on to the movie. Specially the Rise Of Sultan is amazing track. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is always a lucky charm for Salman Khan. Vishal Shekhar first got the opportunity to compose for Salman Khan Movie. Movie will make you laugh,cry and give you goose bumps. You will never feel the movie flat because its all about ups and ups. Salman Khan is like old wine, getting better and better with the time. So, its a Super Entertaining YRF's ,Salman Khan's Film.

"chitreshgupta","8","109","142","8 July 2016"," Salman Khan cracks and bleeds in his most real performance
","So, this is the first movie where Salman Khan takes off his shirt and everyone - including Khan - shudders. Portraying Sultan, who goes from being fit and lean to a gloomy, middle-aged, paunch-burdened man, Khan performs with elan and unhappiness, his acting giving Sultan a nice, rounded punch.At the end of the day, however, Sultan is a Salman Khan film. Probably every flaw is worthy of being overseen thanks to the sheer aura of the man. The Salman who makes people stand up and scream and shout his name right in the middle of an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) sequence.Performances are top notch with both Anushka and Salman complimenting each other and the jugalbandi that leads up to their romance is highly endearing. Ali has made sure the wrestling looks real and it doesn't feel too choreographed."
"binducherungath","8","50","69","6 July 2016"," Sultan, a love story set up in the backdrop of wrestling, inspires us to fight with our inner demons and emerge victorious.
","Sultan, a film by Ali Abbas Zafar, is an awesome gift to Salman Khan fans on the occasion of Eid. Salman Khan's efforts to portray the character of Sultan are remarkable. There are four shades to Salman's character in this film, and Salman does complete justice, be it the innocence, arrogance, self-pity due to guilt or never-to-quit attitude. Sultan, a love story set up in the backdrop of wrestling, prompts you to win over self and also conveys that there is only person who can defeat us in the game of life and that is one's own self. Ali Abbas Zafar certainly knows the pulse of the audience, and he has ingrained the film with the right mix of emotions, action, music, fun, drama (a bit of melodrama too), and of course the star power of Salman Khan as the titular character. Although, one cannot expect any unpredictable twists and turns in the plot, Sultan is a clear-cut winner at box-office as well as in people's hearts.<br/><br/>Akash Oberoi (Amit Sadh), a young businessman, is requesting other board members and investors of his venture Pro-Take Down to give him one more chance to revive the same. His idea of bringing mixed Martial Arts contests to India through Pro-Take Down is not working out. Two seasons of Pro-Take Down was a loss and investors and the market writes it off, but Akash is determined to move ahead for the third season. Pro-Take Down brings wrestlers, boxers to the ring. He needs investors to trust him and put the money. His father (Parikshit Sahni) asks him to get Sultan (Salman Khan) in the ring. Akash travels to a village Baroli in Rewari to get Sultan. Frames move to Rewari, where Sultan is shown to be leading a very monotonous life. He works in Water Authority. He collects donations from his colleagues on Salary-day. Akash meets him and asks him to enter into wrestling ring. Sultan turns down Akash's offer saying that he has left wrestling. Akash was also determined to have Sultan as one of his wrestler, he gets in touch with Sultan's friend Govind (Anant Sharma). It is Govind, who narrates the much-talked about love story of Sultan and Aarfa (Anushka Sharma), and their fall-out. <br/><br/>Sultan, a fun-loving guy in 30s, runs a Mehbooba-Mehbooba cable company, loves to take up challenges to be a kite-runner. During one of such kite-running exercise, he encounters Aarfa (Anusha Sharma) with whom, it was love-at-first-sight for Sultan. Aarfa herself is a wrestler, state level winner, has done her education in Delhi, and runs a wrestling training school along with her father Barkat (Kumud Mishra) in the village. Barkat and Aarfa are very passionate of wrestling and their dream is of Aarfa winning Olympic Gold Medal. To win over Aarfa, Sultan decides to be a wrestler and reaches Barkat with the request to train him. It was not easy for Sultan to win Aarfa's heart. Sultan ends up challenging himself and ultimately does win over Aarfa. <br/><br/>Watch the film for further story.<br/><br/>Salman Khan as Sultan is indeed very good. He is able to win people's hearts with his performance. Anushka as Aarfa has given a very convincing performance. Both Salman and Anushka have picked up Haryanvi accent well. Anant Sharma as Govind is very good, he is effortless in portraying his very much affable character. Kumud Mishra as Barkat and Amit Sadh as Akash Oberoi are also very good. Randeep Hooda as Fateh Singh enters the film as a coach for athletes, and his cameo is a significant part of the film. Randeep, as always, has given a great performance as a tough coach. Farrukh Jaffar as Sultan's grandmother has a small but very amiable role. Parikshit as Akash's father is also good. <br/><br/>Music by Vishal-Shekhar is very good. The song 'Jag Ghoomeya' by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is excellent. Background score is also very nice.<br/><br/>One scene, I would like to specially mention, which probably missed editor's precision (although mentioning this point is a spoiler). Soon after pregnancy confirmation of Aarfa, in a dialogue with her father Barkat, she says that they would train Sultan to win Olympic Gold Medal. But immediately after that, she is shown to be training with Sultan, rather running with him. A pregnant lady doing running exercise?<br/><br/>A scene, where Sultan breaks down looking at his out of shape physique, fights with his guilt, pain, is very beautifully portrayed. There are many scenes in Sultan, which would inspire us, evoke the fighter's attitude in our mind. Sultan inspires us to fight with our inner demons and emerge victorious, since nobody on this earth can defeat us, unless and until, we surrender, yield and accept our defeat. It also tells us that it is not necessary to always win, but it is also important to fail, since failures will lead us to appreciate success and winning. Sultan conveys that it is important to be humiliated at times to understand the importance of self-respect, prestige. It also tells us that in order to fulfill dreams, we must not move ahead so much that our people are left behind; relationships are equally important. <br/><br/>Sultan, a love story set up in the backdrop of wrestling, inspires us to fight with our inner demons and emerge victorious. ""Winners don't quit and Quitters don't win"", that is what Sultan believes and makes us believe too. Although, devoid of any unpredictable twists and turns in the plot, Sultan is a clear-cut winner at box-office as well as in people's hearts."

","We all know movies like these movies aren't made to do well with critics. They are made for a fun holiday watch, and this one delivers it perfect. It's a nice wrestling movie with some comic moments in between, a strong romance story which is believable and isn't clichéd much and the drama seems real. <br/><br/>The story revolves around Haryana's wrestler Sultan, his professional and personal life. The movie is about determination, confidence, dreams.<br/><br/>The movie is well acted by Salman Khan. He shows the intensity of a determined fighter on his face. Randeep was amazing as always. Anushka acted good but her role as a wrestler was a little less believable. <br/><br/>The action is good, cinematography looks real. The background score is nice. The depiction of rural Haryana, the language, the wrestling culture are all shown accurately. The only bad thing about the movie is that some scenes were cheesy, although it don't affect the movie much.<br/><br/>It is definitely worth a watch. You can go with family or friends and will enjoy it thoroughly."

","Don't hate me for that title, I like the story but this movie is too much ""Cliché"". Things I find infuriating are the fights. I understand the way Sultan fights is because he is from Wrestling background and all but the way his opponents fight is ridiculous. They stop fighting when Sultan needs a emotional moments and Start fighting when Sultan is ready. If you don't agree , watch ""Warrior"" , fights in Warrior are very Realistic and totally accurate to MMA. <br/><br/>And whats with the montages? The training montages are twice as much as the fight itself.That got me off a bit. Acting (Accent) was fantastic though.

Story and plot was awful too. Total waste of money. However the main actress and other actors acting was superb and will help relieve the pain you are getting while watching this movie. I have kept myself far from khan's movies in general for so many years (Irfan khan is an exception) and I think its the right decision. Public watch these movies for time pass.

"manbatistuta","8","14","22","6 July 2016"," Sultan is in good form
","Salman Khan has been on a dream run since 2010 with only one film, Jai Ho, missing the bulls-eye (it was still one of the top grossers of 2014). Each year, his Eid release only gets bigger and 2016 is no different with Sultan. <br/><br/>Summing up the story of Sultan in one sentence, Sultan is a journey of a man who goes through life's ups and downs to overcome the fight that lies within. This was prominently showcased in the pre-release promotions so the audience knew what to expect. The treatment of the film was always going to be the key. Salman films tend to rely heavily on his screen presence and often, other elements of good cinema are overlooked (such as story-line, screenplay, editing to name a few). Fortunately, Sultan is very well made. <br/><br/>The film is well balanced with strong emotions, action and drama. Whilst the first half has light comic moments and an enjoyable romantic track, the second half brings out the soul of the film along with lots of emotions and action. At 2 hrs 50 mins, the film is slightly long but this is not a major concern. The film has some great songs (Baby Ko Bass, Sultan song and Jag Ghumiya) but other songs are mediocre. The mediocre songs are interwoven into the script so probably were difficult to get rid of at the editing table. Post the interval, Sultan's plot is quite predictable. However the audience shouldn't mind the drama unfolding and this is where the director has done a fine job. He ensures the audience is kept interested and connected to the movie. <br/><br/>Barring a couple of songs and the long duration, there are a few other small flaws with the story. Salman's journey from a villager to an international wrestler is rushed and some may find this difficult to digest. Also, the final fight is very predictable but it has been packaged extremely well to make it enjoyable. <br/><br/>The performances are top notch, moreover all the characters are relatable. The lead actors Salman and Anushka both excel in their roles and are perfectly cast. Cinematography and action is top notch. <br/><br/>In comparison to Salman's recent films, I found this film to be on par with Bajrangi Bhaijaan, which means business in all likelihood will be similar too.

","Sultan is a fictitious tale of a local Haryana wrestler set amid-st the backdrop of love, loss and wrestling. The film starts with introduction to Pro take-down which is basically UFC(they obviously cannot use the name due to copyright). Pro take-down has spent 2 years in India and hasn't generated money or audience and the promoters are thinking of shutting it down. But the owner played by Amit Sadh asks the promoters for a last chance. Sultan Ali Khan played by Salman Khan is a fun loving person who is aimless in his life and tries his hands at doing odd jobs when he chances upon Aarfa played by Anushka Sharma who is a wrestler. Obviously Sultan falls for her and gets his heart broken which leads him to become a wrestler and later win Arfha's heart and many gold medals and a world championship. From there on success gets to his head and it leads to his downfall in his personal & professional life. Amit tries to recruit Sultan for Pro take-down but Sultan is adamant not to, but somehow decides for it later. From there on its about his redemption and getting his image back and how a 40 year old pot bellied local wrestler steps into a MMA ring. <br/><br/>For a long time Salman's movie have defied good story and screenplay but have managed to gross tons of money riding just on his star power. Things seems to be changing after last year's Bajrangi Bhaijaan and continues with Sultan. This movie has a good story and is narrated well by the director Ali Abbas Zafar. It has all the feel of a good drama with Earnest acting by the cast, generous doses of humor, good action scenes and some laid back Bollywood style romance with songs pictured in a farm where people are wearing leather jackets 😂. Editing although could have been a little more crisp as the only big flaw this movie suffers from is the length. It feels stretched at a 170 minutes. Fight and training scenes have been nicely choreographed and it shows that the director has payed a lot of attention to it as it shows on the screen. <br/><br/>Salman as Sultan is Sultan minus the star power and swag of Salman Bhai. He is so not himself in this movie which is such a breath of fresh air. There is a line in the movie where Sultan says that he is not a superman and it is exactly what is shown in the movie. He earns to be placed where he is in the movie with hard training albeit in a shorter frame of time(typically Bollywood). Anushka as Aarfa is brilliant again as she plays a Jaat wrestler to perfection who is trying to show that women don't belong only in the kitchen. Then there is Sultan's best friend Govind played by Anant Sharma who nails his role to perfection. Kumud Mishra as Arfha's father and Sultan's initial coach is bang on his role. Randeep Hooda as fakir Singh, shines in his 10 min guest appearance as Sultan's MMA coach. <br/><br/>The whole film has generous doses of Haryanvi and the English accent that comes from them and it is hilarious. Salman, Anant and Anushka are just too good in their accent which is a major brownie point for this movie. The songs are very good and are not dished out unnecessarily. The female version of Jag Ghoomeya in the ending moments of the movie gave me goosebumps. <br/><br/>I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone, especially to the not so loyal salman fans as this one genuinely has a good story and earnest performance by the star cast."

","This movie is challenging ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"".. both in terms of positive reviews by the critics and praising from the public. People are comparing Sultan to Bajrangi, gotta say Salman once again has given the best performance in his career, movie has the repeat value like watching it again and again. The director has brought out the best from Salman....Anushka surprised me as a wrestler, she was amazing, brilliant performance from both of them. This movie has class stamped all over it. Sultan is a touching love story with emotions, comedy, action & a powerful message; Never let success get to your head, it is complete winner, everything is just perfect be it acting,music,emotions,direction,cinematography."

","I don't know why Bollywood people put crores of rupees in making a movie that is not better than a Bhojpuri film. <br/><br/>The plot and dialogue are so stretched and unrealistic that you can't help shaking your head. <br/><br/>The director did not make any efforts to understand the wrestling sport or the Haryanvi culture. He/she just tried to shove the Bollywood masala in everything in the movie. No wonder Indian movies don't make it to the Oscar. <br/><br/>Salman's acting was also pathetic. He doesn't act or sound like a young wrestler. Anuskha's acting was no better."
"rishabanilkumar","3","13","22","8 July 2016"," Very predictable, poor plot line, too much fantasy and waste of time
","For a movie that was hyped so much, Sultan was a terrible let down. From the start, the movie's plot line was shaky and just when Bollywood plot lines were starting to hit new heights with the likes of Waiting, Aligarh, Budda in A Traffic Jam, this movie just brought it all down again. The movie involved too much fantasy and wasn't real enough that a grown adult could relate to it. I would be entertaining to 10 year old kids maybe. Overall, I don't recommend on anyone watching this movie unless you are willing to waste 3 hours of your life on something as corny and predictable as Sultan. The one thing that stopped me from giving this movie a 1 star rating is the strong performance of a few actors like Anushka and Randeep Hooda. Salman Khan was typically very disappointing."
"deepak-zeest","1","17","31","8 July 2016"," Awful mindless movie for mindless ""Bhai"" fans
","Never expected it to be good. But because I had watched his previous ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" which was a gem, I had hoped for some in-depth story and acting. Foolish of me to even think that it would happen.<br/><br/>Salman's flick is as mindless and as idiotic as it can ever be. So many plot-holes, it seems that the whole movie is about plot-holes. Anushka Sharma's character is supposed to be a fighter, and eventually she turns out to forget all her ambitions and become a child-bearing agency and marriage-goat for Salman. What regressive message does it propagate?! Are we watching a movie from the 70s or what? Jus because the ""fans"" of bhai want to hoot and whistle when he takes his idiotic entry in a movie, will the movie itself become good? This movie is such a waste of time."

Came out of cinema hall refreshed and smiling. Great movie..<br/><br/>Such was the feeling that I was sitting in hall at the end and hoping to see more of the happy story.

Throughout the film it's hard to find Salman Khan but there is the actual presence of Sultan Ali Khan. I don't want to gift all of you some spoilers as Rathyatra and Eid gift so I am not going through the entire story but it's a story of love, relationship, a journey which will definitely make your eyes wet. Kudos to cinematographer Artur Zurawski and obviously editor Rameshwar Bhagat for their extreme contribution to the film. Vishal- Sekhar done a commendable job as music director. Background score has been complemented the pace of the story.<br/><br/>Story of a local wrestler Sultan Ali Khan who never nurtured dream of anything to his dream journey of winning Gold Medal for India at Olympics.

It's a visual treat to see Salman getting out of his stardom to fit the character and delivered stellar performance . Ali Abbas Zafar has focused on the script and clap for him that he succeeded to pull-off Salman from his safe genre and it made history itself. Salman Khan at the peak of his career is extending his appeal to masses from classes.<br/><br/>Finally, SULTAN is a must watch and obviously it will be a lifetime experience."
"namashi_1","7","16","30","6 July 2016"," Salman SOARS In This Engaging Film!
","After much hype & buzz, 'Sultan' has finally arrived. And oh boy, what a winner this is! This Ali Abbas Zafar flick is an engaging & entertaining film, that's as much a love-story as its a sports drama. And its a pleasure Watching India's Numero Uno Star SOAR! <br/><br/>'Sultan' Synopsis: Sultan Ali Khan (Salman) rises from being a nobody to becoming the world champion in the world of Wrestling. But everything comes at a price....<br/><br/>'Sultan' has a familiar narrative, its the much-known story of the underdog. But, 'Sultan' doesn't settle within the rags to riches story, despite clichÃ©s. 'Sultan' is about a man, who rises form nowhere, becomes a hysteria, and then falls apart again, only to eventually triumph. What I particularly enjoyed here, was the engaging nature of its narrative, it may not be flawless, but its definitely arresting. <br/><br/>While the first-hour takes us to our hero's past, where the romance cutely blossoms with the hero & the heroine (Anushka Sharma), its the second-hour when the film comes to its truest. You watch the hero beat down & come up right from the pit. 'Sultan' is film about wrestling, but not only the one done in the ring, but also about the one we fight in our lives. Its about the fight beyond the ropes & rounds.<br/><br/>Ali Abbas Zafar's Screenplay & Direction, are very good. 'Sultan' finds Ali at his best & his unmemorable previous works, are now forgiven. His Writing follows a familiar narrative, but it doesn't fail to entertain or engage. And that's exactly why 'Sultan' works. Ali's Direction, on the other-hand, is well-done, as he has handled the film well. Artur Zurawski's Cinematography is fantastic. The lens-man has captured all the emotions, with beauty. Editing is good, but could've been sharper. The only glitch in 'Sultan' is its running-time (169-minutes). Some trimming was needed. <br/><br/>Vishal-Shekhar's Score is superb. Each & Every Track is in complete sync with the film & yet its melodious. Costume & Art Design are perfect. The Fight-Sequences (MMA) are competently choreographed & executed. Background Score merits a special mention.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Salman SOARS as Sultan. The Superstar delivers one of his finest performances to date, offering a portrayal worth applauding. His performance is arresting & his physical transformation (from fat to fit), is indeed inspiring. 'Sultan' salutes Salman's charisma & he more than lives up-to the mark. Offering Salman wonderful support is Anushka Sharma, who's genuinely affecting as his long-suffering wife. Watch her breakdown in the pre-interval scene & that says it all. Even the Haryanvi Accent is perfectly done by both the leading performers. Amit Sadh sinks his teeth into the part & performs excellently. Randeep Hooda is ever-terrific. He ignites the screen with his portrayal as Salman's bad-ass coach. Anant Sharma is first-rate. Kumud Mishra is good. Abhishek Duhan leaves a mark in a brief role. Others lend support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Sultan' is a winner! It may not offer a lot of novelty, but its undeniably entertaining. Go, Watch It!"

"dineshprakash","6","19","41","6 July 2016"," This movie has some moments
","As director Mr. Ali Abbas Zafar work is good. As a writer his story is good, screenplay is routine and dialogues are average. First half is very slow and lengthy. Love scenes are just routine. Sultan rising as a top wrestler from a common guy, does not looks very exciting in first half, even world wresting championship match looks very hurried. Film starts taking grip in second half especially after Sultan first Pro Tech free style fight. Choreography of all these matches are core strength of movie, especially first and second match. The reason behind husband wife rift should have been established well then emotional quotient will be of high order. It looks something missing in it. A girl, whose dream was just to win medal in international match, then she shifts her dreams happily towards his husband after getting pregnant but when an incident happened just mainly due to medical complexity but she totally accuses his husband for this because he was not with her when he was out of India and fighting word championship. He even wins gold medal. In climax fight the way glimpses of Sultan comes in front of him as if he is fighting with his ego and negativity which leads to victory is good. Performance wise Salman Khan as Sultan is very good even in few emotional scenes. Anushka Sharma is good. Actor who played, Govind, Sultan's friend is impressive. He is balanced throughout his performance. Randeep Hooda is fine. Amit Sadh as Aakash is OK. Music by Vishal-Shekhar and lyrics by Irshad Kamil, are good. ""Jag Ghoomya Tere Jaisa Na Koi' is very melodious while 'Baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai' is peppy one."
"utkfb","9","7","12","7 July 2016"," The story of a Wrestler wrestling against his own arrogance. Salman proves he can act and act ""well"".
","This movie starts with a new wrestling format that's doing no wonders in India. Amit Sadh (Akash) brings in new wrestling format called ""MMA"" (Mixed Martial Arts) which is facing deep troubles to promote the 3rd season. His father suggests him to find someone from India itself to represent the nation and suggests Sultan.<br/><br/>The movie then goes in flash back to let the audience know why Sultan quits wrestling. Many of the reviews would include the story is too dramatic at certain intervals but to remember Salman Khan movie is composed of Bollywood Masala that includes: Comedy, Action, Drama and some signature dance steps. This movie is no different. The only different thing to notice is the powerful performance by all actors and specially Salman. There are scenes where Salman would make your eyes moist.<br/><br/>This movie is a not just a movie about a sport but also about a beautiful relation between a man and his lady. This movie is about our Indian culture and change women are bringing in society. The movie showcases fight between a man and his arrogance and how he overcomes his own disabilities.<br/><br/>People have been commenting on Anushka's role when she was shown pregnant though her dream was to win an Olympic Gold medal. Firstly as the movie name goes it's SULTAN and not SULTAN and AARFA. Aarfa (Anushka) acts as an inspiration for Sultan. She is the reason for he turning into a wrestler and she is the reason for his Olympic gold. <br/><br/>There's a scene in which Aarfa's father does not like that she got pregnant since he wanted her daughter to win the Olympic Gold medal too. As a father his reaction was justified but when she saw Sultan rejoicing over her pregnancy she dropped the plan of going to Olympics. There are two points to be noted here. Firstly, the orthodox thinking of Sultan since he did not even think about his wife's dream of winning Olympic medal and secondly the patience and love of a woman to give up on her dreams just to see her love happy. I would like to mention about a song in a movie named Pardesi Babu feat. Govinda which has lyrics, ""This happens only in India"". This beautiful relation between a husband and wife can only be seen in India. She trains him hard to fulfill the dream of Olympic Gold which was not only his but also Aarfa's.<br/><br/>There's also a scene in the movie which has been very beautifully portrayed by Salman Khan. The scene in which he's standing in front of a mirror and looking at his protruding belly. Salman wears his shirt again and the scene has been beautifully performed by Salman. For a while I could not believe it was him. I never saw him performing so well.<br/><br/>This movie inspires us to never give up. The movie is about a person's ego and arrogance. The movie has everything that keeps you entertained till the last. There are many scenes that I wanted to mention about but these two scenes are very influential. Way to go Salman"

"ketgup83","9","19","42","6 July 2016"," ""Sultan"" is a well-made wrestling drama which delivers a solid punch. Good !!!
","There is something about Salman Khan. Either you love him for his charm, screen presence or bold attitude or you hate him due to his controversial remarks or brush with law but you cannot deny the fact that he is one superstar whose stardom and films are not impacted (morning shows were housefull at 8 AM everywhere for ""Sultan"" .. unbelievable.. isn't it ???) at the box office. Now let us find out whether ""Sultan"" (whose promo was aired one year before the film) lives up to its hype...<br/><br/>""Sultan"" is the coming-of-age sports drama which tells about the story of Sultan Ali Khan (played by Salman Khan), a wrestler whose life is like a roller-coaster rides going through various ups and down both on and off the ring. <br/><br/>Though the trailer of the film looked promising but I had doubts about the director Ali Abbas Zafar who made an average film ""Mere Brother Ki Dulhan"" before. However, I was in for a big surprise after watching the film. Ali has definitely made a good comeback with ""Sultan"". The film begins well in the present scenario showing the life of a wrestler who lost his family as well as his championship due to his arrogance. The wrestling-drama goes back into the flashback mode showing the reason behind the fall of a champion. Here you will encounter typical Bollywood romance coupled with song-dance routine and light humor to keep you enlightened. The opening scene of Salman Khan (which always is the highlight of his films) is electrifying with well-executed fight scenes between Salman Khan and other wrestlers (though the makers made it easy for a hero to defeat 10 wrestlers at the same time). The first half is fine but it is the second half which is amazing and the climax is highly effective. <br/><br/>Couple of scenes do stand out - the hospital scene where Salman finds about his son, the training scene between Salman Khan and Randeep Hooda is intriguing and MMA fight scenes are pretty realistic. On the flip side, the editing is a weak point and the film definitely could go a long way to be trimmed by at least 15-20 mins. The fight scenes initially and when Salman Khan becomes the world champion is too easy to digest. Though the songs are tuneful to ears, the wrestling drama could definitely be more impacting barring few songs in the reel. Nevertheless, the screenplay is pretty tight and succeeds to keep you at bay. Background score by Julius Packiam deserves special mention. Cinematography by Artur Zurawski is good capturing the beautiful locales of rural India. Wrestling stunts are well-executed. I loved the folk song ""Tuk Tuk"" and the tuneful ""Jag Ghoomeya"" while others were ordinary.<br/><br/>Now coming to the performances, it is Salman Khan all the way. Salman Khan is Sultan and Sultan is Salman Khan. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the character of ""Sultan"" and that is where Salman proved his mettle. The actor deep dives into the character as if it was tailor-made for him and gives his best. Anushka Sharma as Aarfa is equally competent and shines in her well-defined character. Amit Sadh ( the guy from ""Kai Po Che"") finally gets the opportunity to show his acting skills and the actor does well. Last but not the least, Randeep Hooda will blow your mind with impeccable performance. The actor who plays Anushka's father does a fine job as well.<br/><br/>On the whole, ""Sultan"" is a well-made wrestling drama which delivers a solid punch. Good 3/5<br/><br/><ul><li>Ketan Gupta</li></ul>"

Salman's get up is pretty well and he performs nevertheless good and Anushka Sharma, though in her regular image, still add some glamour in this overlong, deserted melodrama. Though the film gets dragging due to lack of shades in the story, the film does lack the regular Bollywood gimmicks or the unnecessary violence, for which the film still remains watchable.

"DareDevilKid","8","3","4","24 July 2016"," Sultan Review: Triumph, Tears, Glory, and Brilliant Entertainment
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.7/5 stars<br/><br/>O re, Sultan! Those are the words along with the infectious background score that echoes at crucial junctures in the latest Salman Khan starrer, and that's the sentiment with which you walk out after the film is over. Sultan is the kind of film that goes easy on you at the start, you won't get your hopes up but you'll also enjoy the breezy entertainment that unfolds on screen, and then gradually, steadily, it keeps growing on you till you can't help but lap up every emotion, every dialogue, every punch, every kick, every cry of pain, and every shout of triumph with open arms.<br/><br/>It's the dialogues, inspiringly emotional story, Salman Khan's inescapable on screen charm, and Anushka Sharma's knockout performance that are the real victors here. The narrative is something you'll guess from miles away, but it's the treatment and moving dialogues that completely bowl you over. Salman, who plays Sultan Ali Khan (for those still living on the moon), is a 30-year old, carefree guy, with no ambitions in life other than enjoying each day as it comes. During one such jovial incident, he bumps into Aarfa (Anushka Sharma) by accident, and falls head-over-heels in love. After a few innocent pranks to win her over, she starts warming up to him, and at this point you think you've seen it all before but the Salman's mischievous nature and Anushka's perfect Haryanvi diction and no-nonsense outlook to life is keeping you mildly engaged.<br/><br/>Until one day, when she blatantly refuses his advances and insults him for his happy-go-lucky outlook, and you realize that Sultan has something deeper in store than a run-of-the-mill love story against a wrestling backdrop. When she tells Salman that she cannot love a man she can't respect, and his on screen dad explains him that the path to respect more often than not is through disrespect, you get ready to buckle in, and be swept up in a good story that's beginning to scratch the surface. Dialogues like these are peppered throughout the movie, lending it that meaningful punch that packs an even bigger impact than Sultan's in-ring punches.<br/><br/>From here on, Sultan takes stock of his life, and his meteoric rise to the top, couple with training and fight scenes that deliver several knockout punches are a treat to the eyes. He gains respect, he gets the love of his life, he wins all that there is to win, and you thoroughly enjoy the roller-coaster ride through the first half, only to realize that Director and writer Ali Abbas Zafar (his best work by some distance) is not done tapping into your emotions just yet. Sultan's respect and honor, which he fought so hard to achieve, turns into arrogance, and this transition is shown with brilliant control and fluidity because of both the trajectory of the plot and Salman's magnetic appeal. If you thought that Bajrangi Bhaijaan was his best till date, then you've seen nothing yet. Given his meatiest role to date, Salman chews every frame he's in, and you can't help but be won over by his innocence and spirit. Where his accent and mannerisms falter, his energy and attitude with which he portrays the character keeps winning you over. The final scenes, where he fights back for his love, respect, and also humility, is something straight out of the handbook of how to captivate an audience. Salman makes sure that no one will walk out of the theater without a smile on their face.<br/><br/>If Salman is attitude personified, then Anushka proves yet again why she's one of our most versatile actresses going around today. Forget her impeccable diction that never once leaves her character, it's her silence that speaks volumes. Scenes in which she breaks down or motivates Salman again leave you transfixed at her potential to steal the show even in front of superstars. And to Salman and the makers' credit, she's no mere prop in the film. Randeep Hooda and Amit Sadh are serviceable in their minor roles.<br/><br/>A word for the music too. For once, the songs in a Salman film aren't used as breaks from the plot but take the plot forward. Even the baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai track is brilliantly integrated, and the title track will give you nothing short of goosebumps. The editing could have been crisper and there are quite a few scenes that demand suspension of your belief, like an MMA fighter eating regular food or a washed-up wrestler mastering MMA moves within six weeks, and then besting pro fighters. But, like we mentioned earlier, you can't help but flow along with the emotions of the film and ignore such logical loopholes along the way.<br/><br/>Can a 40-year old local wrestler become an MMA champ? Probably not. But, then again, stranger things happen in sports, stranger than movie scripts too. Muhammad Ali when his third championship belt when no one gave him a whimper of a chance. And, while watching Sultan, you can't help but not bother about such trivialities. You'll laugh and cry and feel sad and exalt in joy at the character's journey. You won't be able to restrain yourself from clapping and cheering him on (After ages we witnessed an entire theater clapping at several points in the movie.). Sultan is a perfect commercial entertainer and a brilliantly packaged holiday treat. It's not just a movie, it's an Eid event that Salman has gifted his fans and neutral moviegoers alike."

Sultan and Afra's relation could have been portrayed with more passion,love and complexity. Sultan tittle track is a good one and my personal favorite. The character Sultan has been written like any other sport drama.... he first gets defeated then bounces back... and there is sudden blast of energy in him and all that. But still our very own Bhaijan has put into some X-factor in ""Sultan"" which makes it quite admirable.

","Sultan (2016): Salman Khan always reserves his movie's release date on Eid since Dabangg.Salman Khan is one of the rare heroes who didn't have any commercial failure in recent times.Last year he came with Bajrangi Bhaijaan on Eid which was a huge blockbuster and even acclaimed critically.Now he is back on Eid with Sultan,a sports drama film.<br/><br/>Plot: Sultan Ali Khan (Salman Khan),enters wrestling world because of his love Aarfa (Anushka Sharma),who is a state champion.Both of them fall in love and even acquires several medals and championships.But problems arise when Aarfa becomes pregnant at the time when they get selected for 2012 Olympics.Because of this Aarfa stays at home and Sultan participates in Olympics.After winning gold medal in Olympics, tragedy strikes which changes Sultan's life entirely and shows new hurdles of life.<br/><br/>Plus Points: 1)Performances: Salman Khan is getting better in his acting since Bajrangi Bhaijaan.In Sultan he is awesome and his hard work is truly needed to be applauded.But the major plus point is performance of Anushka Sharma.She gave wonderful commendable performance.Others also did their parts well.<br/><br/>2)Screenplay: Screenplay is both entertaining and inspirational.Though it follows typical sports drama style,it has its own charm.<br/><br/>3)Pre-Interval scenes: Pre-Interval sequence in Sultan is shocking and came as a surprise.It is truly a heart touching scene.<br/><br/>4)BGM: BGM is very good and perfectly apts for this movie.Song Rey Sultan as BGM gave perfect emotion for fight scenes<br/><br/>Minus Points: 1)Duration: Movie is 2hr50 min long.Some editing could have helped in second half of the movie.Unwanted song placement in second half is truly disturbing the flow.<br/><br/>2)Highly predictable: This movie is highly predictable as it has all typical sports drama scenes.But sports drama always inspires us.<br/><br/>3)Songs: Songs are just average.<br/><br/>So,Sultan may have highly predictable screenplay but it has its own charm with brilliant performances and scenes.<br/><br/>My rating 7.25/10"
"anupapu8","7","11","25","6 July 2016"," Mix bag with Good performances , nice direction and pretty good fight sequences.
","SULTAN - I am a little confused with the fact that whether it is a Biopic or not. Because in earlier stage it has been promoted as a biopic , but now Wikipedia doesn't say that its a biopic. But i can surely assure that the movie doesn't seems like a biopic. WHY ? - because its a Yash Raj Production's film. So the story goes like this (the usual YRF formula) . The movie starts with side story , which somehow connects with our hero. Hero is not much living a happy life . WHY ? - We have a back story for that. In YRF back stories always starts with a lot of happiness. Then add some more happiness to it and then some more. O yes don't forget the songs in between. Its time for a tragedy , remember in current time hero is not happy. After that tragedy hero gets a way for his redemption , to regain his happy life , there starts the hard work and movie gets a happy ending. So that's the basic formula which YRF has , and now mix it with sports , WRESTLING in this case and you know pretty much the whole story of the movie. But you know what storyline was not something which make this movie a good watch. Its the performances , direction and nicely choreographed fighting sequences (obviously in Bollywood standards and a whole lot better then BROTHERS). I sure cant criticize the movie a lot for being full of clichÃ©s , 1 or 2 unwanted songs , some long melodramatic scenes and predictable storyline because it has many good things too. But neither can i praise it all the way . Its a mix bag. One of the worst thing is its running time i.e., 2hr and 48mins. And the predictable story line makes it hard to watch it all the way. Because of this the good things in the movies separates each other with some not so good scenes in between them.<br/><br/>Salmaan was good as a Haryanvi wrestler. He was nice in fighting scenes too. But his fighting moves are very few in numbers , and he was repeating them. Its an irony that Randeep Hudda says to him that its important to learn the style of your opponent and not a single opponent tried to learn the style of SULTAN which was so common . I guess non of them have a coach as good as Randeep. Randeep was good too as a stereotype coach , which i wish to watch more but Bollywood movies spent very less time with training sessions , mostly just a single energetic song and here your big belly disappear and you got beautiful abs. Just in 5 mins. Amit Shad underplayed his character quite nicely. But Anushka Sharma holds the character in the whole movie. She was the support , love , heartbreaker as well as inspiration for Sultan. He made Sultan what he was. Also the reason for his uprising after his downfall. The movie looked good , but not as good as Kick or Bajrangi Bhaijaan . Camera movements are nice. Music was not much of an interruption but surely can have shortened the length if edited. 440 volt was totally unnecessary . Jag Ghumiya was special , after watching it i can imagine why ARIJIT SINGH requested so much to Salmaan for not replacing his voice. So Sultan is a nice movie. At least we can say Salmaan is on the right path since KICK(although Prem Ratan was a little mistake but it was forgivable). Its far below then Bajrangi Bhaijan , a little below then Kick which i personally found more entertaining. But definitely better then Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. 7/10 By ANuP APu KuMaR .."

"mumbhaaai","6","5","10","8 July 2016"," Sultan - Over hyped film with neither substance neither entertainment
","The success of the new movie ""Sultan"" just goes to show how people believe in perception a character that's played by a superstar only supersedes the actual efforts that are needed in an MMA fight and derides the efforts of many fighters that spend years training for the fight.<br/><br/>Right from the badly photoshopped poster, camouflaged with obnoxious high sounding music, some with the trumpet (the winning wala funda), some parts of the music sound like band baaja waale in a shaadi, not sure if Sultan is entering a ring or about to enter the mandap for his shaadi. Dialogues from Rocky Balboa translated to Haryanwi, super slow- mo effects, ton of VFX/CGI to show Mr. Sultan Khan's transformation, Haryanwi Jaat language that comes and goes depending on the actors mood, and horrible fight sequences that are so filmy and outright funny that can give Spoofs a run for their money. About half the time, Sultan takes the mitti and claps to get ready while all other fighters watch him finish his drama and his stupid half smirk that is not as near as confident, rather much arrogant and when everyone's busy fighting, he does one move and rubs his knuckles on his mustache in the upper cut direction in pride.<br/><br/>Sultan, in his entire career has learned only 2 moves, one of which is described as fatal. That is Sultan's move, they say. No one gets up after that, they say. From a technical perspective, it's a rather silly,stupid, and an extremely cheesy move that WWF wrestlers have been using and has very low impact. The slams are where it hurts the most, not the rolls. But who cares about wrestling in a movie about wrestling, right? As long as it's Salman Khan with a sk4CGI/VFX body (thanks to YFX) and a 2 hour movie can stretched to 3 hours, because you know slo-mo. Not to mention, he trains in about 6 weeks for a championship that takes years to practice, frankly with a 6 week practice, you may have a hard time winning a match with a punching bag, but again, who cares about fights in an Action Movie as long as its Salman Khan with VFX/CGI body (thanks again to YFX). Also, the seriousness of the character is directly proportional to the amount of facial hair he grows. Figure of speech taken to a whole new literal level. Sultan has tried to do a Rocky, but missed the essence of Rocky.<br/><br/>On a very different note, a star is representative of the most common man's thought process, by that virtue the audiences deserve the star they get. Don't blame the movies, blame your choices."

Just because of Salmaan, people got crazy and rushed to buy tickets and Sultan became a super-hit. When people came out of the cinema, most of them were saying negative things about this movie. <br/><br/>The story-line is zero. Salmaan is seen wrestling and being beaten terribly (near death type) and then towards the end of the fights he gets up and beats the opponents and wins in all fights. Whats new?<br/><br/>And Anushka only supports or likes Salmaan when he is a star and kicks his ass when he is down. <br/><br/>Come on Salmaan, I as your fan did not expect this from you."

","I am so glad that I went to see this movie! I absolutely adore underdog stories and this is a great one. It's kind of the Indian Rocky story. Sultan has some serious charisma. His story is inspiring and heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. This movie is an absolute gem. Khan's emotional performance resonates on all levels; a cold warrior, man in love, tormented soul seeking redemption, all the way to his bum-shaking in the musical parts. Most realistic performance by Salman Khan and he does a great job at it and is still keeps the movie entertaining. It's not the normal super hero stuff we have come to expect from him, out here we see him struggle to rise up be the champion. Although the plot of standard underdog rising to stardom is common, the way it's done up keeps the things light and fun. The movie is tad too long although the only parts which I didn't enjoy were the songs, they were total waste of screen time and could have been edited out. The supporting cast were great making it a decent Bollywood style sports drama. Anushka Sharma and supporting cast hit all the notes and lend emotional credence to the movie."
"nagsaptarshi","8","2","3","24 July 2016"," Sultan rules over your heart
","Remember the climax scene of 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam'. A devastated Salman talking to God.There was hardly a face in the theater not chuckling seeing his pathetic acting skills in a scene which was supposed to be poignant.That was the lowest point of that otherwise beautifully crafted film.And that made me wonder if Salman would ever learn to act.He had already spent more than a decade in the industry by then.<br/><br/>After the ebb, it took nearly one and half decades for him to showcase his acting skills in the lovable drama 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' last year.But this year he shows his elan in even a bigger and better way.As an actor.Pun intended.'Sultan' barring the first half an hour is an outright lovable rom- sports movie made to moisten your eyes in parts and brighten up your spirits all through.I am not going into the details of the story.Rather I would just emphasize on how poignantly Sallu portrays the character of a tormented, heart broken yet innocent fallen star.Perhaps this is the first time he has accepted a role that singularly rests on his acting abilities and not on his machismo or hackneyed mannerisms.And he delivers! Yes, he rips off his shirt.But not amidst the the bikini clad firangi lasses in an exotic location.He unbuttons his shirt to have a pitiful glance at his tummy.To portray the pathos of a pot bellied middle aged frustrated sports star.How beautiful idea!His initial exuberance, jubilation and gradual anger, depression,reticence and finally redemption- all the emotions have been so beautifully portrayed that even if you are not a Salman fan, you start loving this Khan. This is undoubtedly the career best performance of Salman. Anushka looks ravishing in a character which vascilates between ambition and family.Initially she tries too hard to match Salman's charisma but gradually picks up and delivers a decent job.As Akaash, Amit Sadh is endearing. Randeep Hooda, one of the most evolved actors of Bollywood in the recent past, is a bit too over the top.It looks like his character has shades of Brad Pitt of 'Moneyball'. Anant Vidhaat Sharma as Sultan's buddy through thick and thin delivers a standout performance. The direction is good if not great.Dialogues are crispy and corny,too.Camera works are exceptional especially during the first half.Music barring the theme song and the melodious 'jag ghoomeya' does not rise above mediocrity.However,the biggest problem with this movie is its length.Had the editing been bit crispier and the film would have been half an hour less in duration minus a few unnecessary songs, it could have easily been one of the finest movies of Bollywood.But do not undermine the power of 'Sultan'.Even with its flaws, Sultan will rule your heart for quite some time. Don't miss the extravaganza at any cost.After all sports movies are not made regularly in India."

","Movie : Sultan (U/A)<br/><br/>Rating : 4.5/5<br/><br/>Salman Khan starrer SULTAN is something I was not totally prepared for, today when I watched it, and especially when I had a film like KABALI running in the opposite screen. I actually wanted to watch KABALI (which I will try to watch soon), but had to go for SULTAN because of my mother. I went in and thoroughly enjoyed. It can be said after watching the film that even after a misfire in the form of PREM RATAN DHAN PAYO, Salman Khan has managed to impress this time with his sports based action entertainer. This film not only because of his star power, but also because he's a good actor.<br/><br/>SULTAN might not impress the viewers who have seen similar films based on sports like CHAK DE India and SAALA KHADOOS. But since I haven't seen the above mentioned films yet, I can say that SULTAN was heart touching experience. Salman Khan as SULTAN, steals the show, and rather rules it with his charm and fighting skills. Anushka Sharma is impressive as a powerful lady fighter who isn't at all ready to be suppressed. Amit Sadh is quite convincing. It was really a happy moment to see Randeep Hooda in the film. He's a very talented actor and gives a controlled performance. Kumud Mishra too doesn't leave you disappointed. He's a true actor and leaves you impressed. Other cast also is impressive. <br/><br/>The music of SULTAN is pleasant and melodious. The production values are quite grand and one needs to praise the way the director has showcased the grand wrestling sequences, whether in outdoors or indoors. The fights are excellent and you'll specially love the opening fight. The story- screenplay id top notch and there are some emotionally touching sequences, especially the interval scene.<br/><br/>SULTAN is all about not giving up and rising above all odds. But one wishes that to keep the rise even higher, the film had been better trimmed to 150 minutes or around. Songs keep popping up without much time interval in the first half. But a well established second half takes care of everything. The film is a must watch for all, and as for kids, it's an inspirational and emotional journey of a wrestler fighting what was lying within him. It's also a family friendly film despite a UA certificate which it got for the action. <br/><br/>Overall, SULTAN is an excellent film that is a must watch for everyone. Given the fact that the film has already been running successfully and has been accepted all over, it is likely to be accepted further by those going to watch it."
"prateekhemdev","7","2","3","22 July 2016"," Family Sports Entertainer
","Sultan is truly a Salman Khan movie! It has the action, romance and a positive message at the end. In the first half the movie with its excessive songs and predictable story line makes reaching the interval a bit tough even though Vishal- Shekhar have done a commendable job with the music. The high of the movie is Fateh Shah aka Randeep Hooda who steals the show away as Sultan trainer. Anushka Sharma has also acted well as Aarfa and done justice to the opportunity.At the end Sultan is worth a watch for the MMA action, Randeep's performance and of course brand power of SULTAN but would have been better had the movie been a bit shorter."

","On Meerkat Wednesday I took the jump and watched this film. I was dreading it normally in this town the audiences for films listed as Bollywood they just talk and shout all the way through, only going quite when the songs play. Luckily there was only three people in the screen including me.<br/><br/>The film was a good three hours of Indian film making at its best. The simple script did not rely on an abundance of dance numbers, whistling sound effects and the brain damaged best friend. The juvenile antics of the thirty something Salman Khan chasing fallen kites was a well edited race and gave a good introduction to his love interest Anushka Sharma. The film played like a Rocky film set in the world of wrestling as a series of training scenes and fights followed the growing relationship between the two leads. The cockiness of Salman and the tragedy that befalls him works to a hard hitting end of the first half. <br/><br/>The second half working against this tragedy introduces a new cast and story line to this film and offers plenty of bone crunching fights in the ring. The songs in this film actually work and for a change does not slow down the pacing its almost 3 hour running time. The bright airy world of small town India in the first half contrasts nicely against the dark urban world of Delhi in the second half. <br/><br/>The director/writer Ali Abbas Zafar does a good job and this film easily falls into the top 20 films I've seen this year. Even the credit crawl doesn't waste time it fills the viewer in on the near future for the main characters."

He is looking fabulous in ""Wrestler"" avatar and his ""Haryanavi"" accent has added more weight to his character in this movie. I am sure he has added many more fans to his list after ""Sultan"" and definitely deserves to be tagged as ""King of the Ring"". Moving to co-actors, Anushka Sharma has once again proved her versatility in acting, to the industry and the viewers. Just like Salam, she has also adapted ""Haryanavi"" accent very nicely and is looking tough while wrestling in the ring. Randeep Hooda has played a role of a trainer and trains Sultan(Salman Khan) to fight in a wrestling tournament. Being from Haryana, he is looking fabulous as always in his character and has earned more respect for himself as an actor. Amit Sadh looks wonderful playing the role of an entrepreneur. He has very intelligently used his unique style of delivering the dialogues and personality while presenting his character.

Khan plays Sultan, a man who finds love and in order to get her becomes a wrestler, but his climb to become a national hero puts a strain on the relationship. Eight years later as a middle age man, Down on his luck, and with everything against him: age, size etc. He puts it all on the line for what he loves the most.<br/><br/>The movie is all about heart and it has plenty of it. One of the best, if not the best movie I've ever seen showcasing mixed marshal arts. It's like Blood Sport or The Quest or some other Van Damme flick were he's in the ring with a variety of fighters. He faces such real deal fighters as Marrese Crump (who wowed us in fights with Tony Jaa in the Protector 2).<br/><br/>Khan was in pretty good shape himself. Very dedicated to the role he starts out out of shape then gets back into shape and then gets back out of shape and back into shape. I just think it was cool that he let himself get fat to do the role, but even better was that we got two training montages in the movie.<br/><br/>Even the musical numbers, which I usually don't like, at least make sense when everyone breaks out in it. <br/><br/>I see the movie is like fire in the box office which is great because everyone should experience Salmon khan.<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com/"
"nidhisahni","9","2","3","12 July 2016"," Salman is just unstoppable. Not-to-miss movie
","Voila! I made it and finally took the decision to go for the movie. The movie is superb . <br/><br/>Salman Khan undeniably is the ultimate superstar of the century. He has given out his heart and soul in the movie. The song 'Jag Ghoomeya' by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is excellent. Background music is also very nice. ""Khoon mein tere mitti ..Mitti mein tera khoon"" <br/><br/>I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone, especially to not so Salman Khan fans as this one genuinely has the best performance, songs and the story line. <br/><br/>You will be awed by his moves and the flavor he brings to the table. I could see girls sitting besides me getting floored by the appearance of Salman.That's okie and we can expect that too! <br/><br/>The story also has an emotional element which adds to its feather. Although the film is bit lengthy folks but it won't give u a chance to fall asleep. In fact you would want to see it more as you deep dive into the movie!"
"sudipta2311","5","1","1","19 December 2019"," Anushka steals the show
","It's a mediocre sports movie. The wrestling techniques are on point, but it fails to pull emotional strings. They should have gone with a different male lead as it's an acting oriented role. I liked the first half better and Anushka lit up the screen as usual. Extremely routine climax spoiled the ending for me, but overall a decent movie."

","Sultan (Salman Khan) becomes a wrestler to impress Aarfa (Anushka Sharma) and discovers a great talent for it. He goes on to become a world champion, but in so doing is not there when a tragedy occurs, leading to an estrangement between him and Aarfa. Ten years later, he reenters the sports world, hoping to win money for a cause dear to his heart, reestablish a relationship with his wife, and earn self respect.<br/><br/>This is a magnificent film, with a strong and heartwarming plot. Khan takes his character through Sultan's various phases of innocence, arrogance, and brokenness believably and masterfully. He plays his role to perfection. Sharma gives a masterful performance as well. The music, songs and incidental, are good and sometimes moving. The scenery, sets, and location shots are impressive. Overall, this is a near perfect movie. I highly recommend it to both fans and non-fans (of which I am) of wrestling."

","Sultan is another masterstroke from Salman Khan. What's good: All actors performance, overall direction, music, some dialogues, action, cinematography, gripping and entertaining first half. What's bad: Editing in the second half, tiring climax, direction in some places. verdict: Sultan is different from Salman's regular flicks. It will be a universal film. People will love it. Though some aspects of the film are bad, it will be memorable for Salman's convincing performance. Randeep Hooda is fantabulous in this film."

","In what was probably supposed to be the most anticipated superhero movie of the year, Batman V. Superman (theatrical cut) was probably one of the most disappointing comic book movies in recent history. The theatrical cut is a decent watch, but the plot, writing and most of all, scene editing is absolutely mediocre in this film. Whether this was Zack Snyder's, or Warner Bros fault, the editing of this extremely anticipated movie was a disaster, as people say the much fuller, directors cut of this film is almost like an entirely different movie.<br/><br/>While seeing Ben Affleck's Batman was fun, the overly revealing trailers, god awful pacing, and ridiculous plot errors, gave the DCEU the bashing they certainly didn't want. While we were all certainly rooting for Batman V. Superman, even the biggest DCEU supporters (like myself) couldn't look past the massive editing and plot errors of this film."
"indianature","10","1","1","16 October 2016"," Good movie, worth seeing
","Apart from being a big time box office grosser, Salman Khan's Sultan released appropriately around the time when India's wrestlers won Olympic medals.<br/><br/>I saw this film last night when the TV world premiere aired on Sony Max HD. My opinion prior to viewing was that it was probably yet another much hyped box office hit. I was indeed wrong.<br/><br/>Sultan is a very good movie with an interesting and human story, superb acting, superb realistic sets and excellent cinematography. Even for those who aren't interested in wrestling. As with Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Salman Khan excelled himself. Anoushka and all the other actors were very good too.<br/><br/>The music was pleasing, perhaps one too many songs though having said that, Salman Khan movies aim to give the ticket paying theatre goer full paisa vasool so one cant really grudge the extra song or two. If I had watched this on DVD I perhaps would have fast forwarded the songs. Given the number of ads, the film went on quite late on TV but thats a small price to pay for viewing on a large screen in full HD.<br/><br/>All in all this was a very watchable movie, indeed a good movie. Keep it up Salman Khan!"
"admyit","7","1","1","3 September 2016"," Very Inspiring movie specially for any sports person !
","Sultan is the movie which I liked a lot after a very long time and moreover I watched it more than 2 times. This is very inspiring movie specially for any sports person. In this Movie Salman khan was an indigenous wrestler but because of some misshaping, his new born baby son got died because doctors couldn't manage to arrange O negative rear group of blood, the day Salman quits wrestling for few years and decided to open a blood bank in his village but he needed lots of money to open that so again he took participation in a different kind of very tough wrestling in his middle-age. He showed an unbeatable spirit towards wrestling and towards his problems which everyone should have. In the movie, Salman tries to make a comeback in this dangerous sport to represent India in Olympic games even after quitting wrestling for few years, and again he wins and becomes a world champion."
"zafar142007","7","1","1","16 July 2016"," Salman's day at work, finally through
","As an Indian, I have grown up seeing Salman on the screen, and off the screen in newspapers, often in some quagmire. I am not a fan, and for quite a while, he has been a synonym of bad cinema in my mind. For a while, he has been the face I associate with mediocrity and formula-based Bollywood film fraternity. This movie may be his redemption. <br/><br/>In fact, redemption is a major theme of this movie. The way Salman begs forgiveness is endearing and enduring, leaving you to wonder whether it was meant for us, as an audience, who know some of the hardships of his real life. <br/><br/>The movie is a fictional biopic of a champion wrestler. It's a film focusing on the sport, but the story twinges with the ordinariness of a simplistic make. It's a tailor made story for Salman, and he knows all too well how to excel at such kinds of simple-minded, gritty and human characters as Sultan Ali Khan.<br/><br/>The film was long, but quite believable. There are some 'usual' cheeky dialogues, but some are quite good, and not at all outlandish. And then there are the usual hiccups, like becoming a state champion in a month, Anushka being all thin and slim while being a state champion, and Salman being all muscular even before training. But I didn't expect even half of what I got from a Salman Khan movie. Anushka was comfortable being pretty and unforgiving, and I didn't feel she lived up to her role. It is basically a Salman Khan show, and others are pretty much in the background (that is something I would like Bollywood to change, and make more in-depth cinema). <br/><br/>One thing that I find is a good judge of whether I liked a movie or not is whether I remember some of its dialogues afterwards. Here are a few:<br/><br/>""I may have given up wrestling, but I never gave up persevering. I am alive, and kicking!"" <br/><br/>""Sometimes you need to get insulted, before you are ready to earn respect."""

Anushka Sharma lived up to the expectations with her classy acting , but one bad apple (Salman)can ruin the whole basket. And i think the main contribution of Salman to this movie was to RUIN it.<br/><br/>The PLOT was HORRIBLE and PREDICTABLE.

But Salman khan has done a fabulous job of being wrestling and fighting fit at this age...If you are looking for a good story line film go for it but don't expect much from the second half....enjoy!!!!"

","This movie is just right for the hardcore Salman fans(BhaiTards). It shows Anushka wrestle a man, defying logic (BTW there are many logic defying moments in this film). Apparently Bhai gives a speed test by chasing Kites falling from the sky. There was a scene where bhai challenges a wrestler from double weight range and defeats him. Actually he looked like a kid in front of that guy still manages to beat him (ahem.. defy logic). This movie also had clichés like- if a wrestler is pinned down by Sultan, he never gets up(passes out). Then a cliché where Sultan sees Anushka and wins a 99.9% lost match. then another one where he wins a match even after getting is ribs broken(ahem ahem.. defy logic).

"maulin5","7","2","4","8 July 2016"," A one time watch
","Salman Bhai is back on Eid. Last year, he came with a blockbuster movie Bajarangi Bhaijaan. All Non-Salman fans are saying that the movie worked just because of the perfect story and cute little Munni. Bhai's fans were saying Bhai did an outstanding job. Critics said he did a good job not more than that. Yes, I agree with that. But, for this movie, everyone is saying different! A wrestler's love story - This is what Sultan offers. Pre-interval portion is all about flashback love story of Sultan & Arfa with some funny moments, lot's of music, wrestling and emotional touch at the pick of the interval. Post interval, there is fight championship (just like we saw in Brothers!) with Sultan training under Delhi based gym trainer, come back of him in the ring, and emotional ending like a king! Salman did a better job than Bhaijaan. His expressions are so real in the fight scenes. Here Munni is Anushka Sharma. Like Bhai's any previous movies, no heroine got a major part. But, Anushka got, and she performed it really well. Even I can say that she's better than Sultan bhai! Kumud Mishra and Amit Sadh are as good as their roles. Randeep Hooda's guest appearance gets more applause and shouts than Bhai's entry.<br/><br/>Cinema-hall creates shouting & cheering three times. First at Bhai's entry, second at Randeep's entry & at the third time, it's Jag Ghumeya song. Best song from this movie is this. Bhai's that dance step is so classic. Other than that, I like peppy song 440 volts, because of it's unique lyrics by Irshad Kamil, Mika Singh's voice and it's choreography and costumes. Personally, I don't like Baby ko bass pasand hai. Sultan's title track is energetic. Others are okay. Music could have been better.<br/><br/>So, what's the new thing in Sultan? Well, I can say, Salman in drawers is the only one! Hahaha, jokes apart, yes it's a family film. You can watch it at your suitable ticket price. Anushka's best performance and Salman's fans around your seats never let your enjoyment down. If the show is full, than you can enjoy it, otherwise like what happened to me, that show is only 35% occupied, so a few shouts were heard, and therefore my friend felt the movie was too long. Though, it has not a single boring portion, but, than also, I'm requesting all the masses to shout out in the screen so everyone gets energetic.<br/><br/>On the whole, Director Ali Abbas Zafar is playing smart with using Salman, as he wants the promotion! Similarity with YRF's Brothers is still in my mind, so I can't say that this is the best film of this year so far. It's even not better than Bajarangi. So, just a one time watch."

"kumarvarun1989","6","0","0","10 October 2016"," Salman Khan cracks and bleeds in his most real performance
","There's a moment somewhere in the beginning of the film when Salman Khan's character comes to a halt at a rail crossing, and waits, just like the rest of us do, for the train to pass.<br/><br/>In that instant we know that Sultan is about to push twin boundaries. Of a star's scope, and of mainstream Bollywood. That this will not be the super-human, super-hero Bhai who has been shown crossing the tracks just a whisker ahead of a rushing locomotive from one of his several forgettable flicks. That this will be a Khan who has to, literally, do a lot of heavy-lifting to win the crown.And win it he does. 'Sultan' has him breaking free from Bhai-giri bondage by getting his character to crack and bleed. His down-and-out wrestler has foibles, is fallible, is human. Sultan Ali Khan has faults, and is punished for it. Because of which Sultan scores, and delivers a solid entertainer with heft.<br/><br/>It isn't as if Sultan doesn't struggle with its profusion of familiar tropes. There's your underdog-to-champion, in which child-like Jat Sultan is shown starting from nothing, becoming a world champion in no time at all (yes, there is some sweat and tears involved in the training, but not too much, because hey, this is Bollywood ). There's a romance which involves risible songs and dialogue ( 'Baby ko bass pasand hai', with a shift-and-lift-of-male-and-female derriers). But the girl in question, played by Anushka Sharma with sparkle, is a wrestler herself. She is a woman with ambition, and she's made to talk of uplifting 'mothers' and 'sisters' in patriarchal Jatland.There's the meteoric rise and fall-by-arrogance, but enough time is taken for us to register the downswing of our hero, even as we know that the upswing is just a few frames away. There's the cynical trainer (Randeep Hooda) who keeps chomping on food items, and who will, we know, help slap our out-of-shape, overweight wrestler into shape. This one is the most Hollywood of them all, reminding us of all similar trainers. Remember Clint Eastwood in Million Dollar Baby?But director Ali Abbas Zafar surprises us by keeping the slack moments mostly at bay in this 170-minutes enterprise. Some lines are distinctly populist, but spry enough to make you crack up: Hooda has a lovely one about 'asli Jats'. The supporting cast injects freshness, with the reliable Mishra as the 'akhara-owner' and father of Anushka, who wants his daughter to go places. Amit Sadh plays it nicely as the owner of an Indian pro-Mixed Martial Arts team, even if he owns a trope of his own: never say die. And the hero's best friend, one of the oldest tropes in the book, is a new face (Anant Sharma) who does the Haryanvi accent to a T."

","Sultaan is the kind of movie we don't get to see everyday. Not many movie makers have touched subjects like Indian wrestling before. Salman Khan essays the titular role and gives another stellar performance after Bajrangi Bhaijaan ! Anushka gives a strong performance and impresses all. The Haryanvi accent is carried well by both of them. This movie also gives an important message that do not let success get to your head and also emphasizes on the importance of family in a person's life. The feet-tapping music just adds to the already brilliant Movie. Its a Must watch ! I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

","Sultan is a story of Sultan Ali Khan - a local wrestling champion with the world at his feet as he dreams of representing India at the Olympics. It's a story of Afra - a feisty young girl from the same small town as Sultan with her own set of dreams. When the 2 local wrestling legends lock horns, romance blossoms and their dreams and aspirations become intertwined and aligned. However, the path to glory is a rocky one and one must fall several times before one stands victorious - More often than not, this journey can take a lifetime. Sultan is a classic underdog tale about a wrestler's journey, looking for a comeback by defeating all odds staked up against him. But when he has nothing to lose and everything to gain in this fight for his life match... Sultan must literally fight for his life. Sultan believes he's got what it takes... but this time, it's gonna take everything he's got. ""wrestling is not a sport it's about fighting what lies within""..... SULTAN<br/><br/>What's Good: It's entertaining, Salman is acting for real after a long time, Potential to make you laugh, cry and dance, Randeep Hooda, movie has Randeep Hooda in it.<br/><br/>What's Not: Story seems funny at times, Poor execution of plot, Music is disappointing, Poor performance of Anushka.<br/><br/>Our Ratings: Story: ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ 6/10 Music: ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ 3/10 Direction, editing and screenplay: ★★★★★★★☆☆☆ 7/10 Star Performances: ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ 5/10 Overall: ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ 5/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Worth a one time watch, Salman is in his best for sure."

","The plot is very interesting. Salman films always have a glamour and the heroines are always in good forms compared to others.Even though it was not like ""prem ratan"" it did provide the viewers entertainment till the end. Hats off to Salman.I have always watched movies having sexy scenes but i was late to recognise the way he always is.When he was busy with d case even a non fan like me was disappointed. But later i came to know that his films always get better.Anushka was seen in a diff. avatar other than the bikini costume.The conversations were punchy and emotional. The songs are very much needed in the film and hit."

","Cometh Eid, cometh the superstar - Salman Khan. Every year. His frenzied and passionate fans yearn for this festive time of the year for a treat that 'Bhai' gives them so lavishly. His movies are often characterised with insane action stunts and out of the world nutsy antics that cater to only his fandom. But Salman having reinvented himself with his last movie, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, adds another layer to a more refined form of an actor in Sultan. We see a more humane Salman as Sultan who possesses a string of diverse emotions associated with mortal beings. Salman's portrayal of emotions is bigger and grander than anything else. In stark contrast to his previous films, we see fervour and vehemence in Salman's acting. From being a happy-go-lucky wanderer who is unprincipled and directionless in life, to the most celebrated wrestler who gives India a whole new identity in the world of sports, to again facing a catastrophic turn of events that turn him to a grieving and downcast middle-aged person living a life of regrets. Does he rise again? Can he gather enough motivation and courage to defeat his dejections? ""Wrestling is not a sport, it's about fighting what lies within"". Indeed. Sultan realises he needs to better himself and fight life face-on so that he can never be again bogged down by life. ""You are never defeated until you lose to yourself"". Sultan portrays a wide range of human emotions - innocence, shame, reprisal, passion, love, vigour, humour, arrogance, guilt, regret, self- loathe, to final redemption, all at an intense level altogether. Anushka, who plays a fiery girl as Aarfa, who is also a wrestler, harbours a dream of winning Olympic medal. She insulting Sultan for being a vagabond and not having a goal in life is the driving force for Sultan who sets out to earn her respect. Anushka's acting seems to be flawless and in certain scenes she even overshadows Salman with her near-perfect rendition. Randeep Hooda in his little screen time engages the audience with his heated acting. Roars were felt in theatres when he brandished Sultan saying - ""I don't train dead people"". The rest of supporting cast fit into their roles quite well and there is no overacting in the whole movie. The movie is a true winner and do go watch it, it's every worth of money. Sultan is a celebration of the journey of hard work and zeal coupled with fighting all the calamities life and using them as a stepping stone to success. This movie is a good inspiration for quitters- it inspires you to fight on and on. Someone please let Lionel Messi watch this movie, haha he might learn a thing or two about fighting back in life. No offence meant there."

","Riding on the super stardom of Salman Khan, director Ali Abbas Zafar's Sultan is a sports drama which mixes elements of love, loss,success,pride, sacrifice and ultimately the triumph of the 'never-give-up' spirit. It chronicles the journey of a small town wrestler from the hinterlands of Haryana, Sultan Ali Khan(played by Salman Khan) - his rise, fall and his comeback to the ring and above all, his struggle with what lies within.<br/><br/>A small time cable-TV guy, Sultan is smitten by the beautiful, Aarfa(Anushka Sharma), a lady wrestler and in order to win her love,joins the 'akhaada' run by her father,who coaches the wannabe wrestlers.The happy-go-lucky guy finds a purpose in life when he is humiliated by her girl who sees him no lesser than a clown.In order to prove himself, Sultan embarks on a rigorous journey of self- transformation and goes on to win the state level championship.And then there is no stopping, he becomes an icon and wins laurels at International level as well.Sultan and Aarfa get married and start a family.All is hunky dory till a major setback brings fissure in their relationship and impel him to relinquish the ring.Its only after a hiatus, that the owner of a mixed martial art franchise coaxes him to come back to the ring and reclaim his glory and conquer his guilt.<br/><br/>Zafar weaves a plot that has all the trappings of a commercial potboiler but the spotlight here is the dedication and earnestness that Salman brings to his character and the brawny masculinity that a wrestler exhibits.The ring-fights are pulsating and your adrenaline gushes fast when Sultan thrashes his opponents with his deadly 'dhobi' slams, with the 'sultan anthem' running on high decibels.His emotional moments with his girlfriend-turned-wife ,Aarfa( played by Anushka Sharma) soar high, complemented by an admirable performance by the actress who also plays a feisty lady wrestler.Though the complexities in their conjugal relationship are well-touched, keeping in mind our Indian sensibilities,I wish the writers had developed more layers to Anuska's character.With Salman doing the heavy-lifting,she is almost cornered in the film's post interval portions.The actor, however, is in complete form - delivering a mature performance with remarkable credibility.He is the quintessential man-child,and exudes that facade with flourish.Turning guilt and redemption into a fine art, Salman makes Sultan tread the thin line between arrogance and pride.<br/><br/>The film gets a positive fillip from the impressive performances of the supporting cast - Sultan's chaddi buddy, played by Anant Sharma is specially terrific, Randeep Hooda as the cynical coach, Kumud Mishra as the inherently supportive father-in-law and the entrepreneur with a heart,played by Amit Sadh.The training regimes will leave you in awe,which transform the forty something paunchy and grizzly Sultan back to shape,vigor and a fiery temperament.Vishal Shekhar's Music is groovy and pitched at right intervals.Powered with great detailing, the sets are extravagant and the ring fights are truly brutal and authentic.<br/><br/>With a butt-numbing running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, Sultan feels dragged with a swelled-up second half and falls into the typical Bollywood clichés.Its only Salman's charisma that propels the plot forward.<br/><br/>This is a perfect 'Eid' Gift from Bollywood's infant terrible,Sallu Bhaijaan. One deserves every bit of this wholesome entertainer."

The film is recommended not only to Salman Khan's fans but also to the family audience who were awaiting a family drama high on emotions, just like YRF style.This is indeed his crowning glory as a performer. His masterstroke is a scene where Sultan is looking at his body in the mirror when it's out of shape. Sultan was backed by superb acting from its starcast. One of the best movies watched in 2016 and is definitely on its path to break the records in Bollywood."

Sultan has every thing in it and fully loaded with Action, Romance and Drama.<br/><br/>Sultan starts off with Aakash Oberoi (Amit Sadh) trying to save his business of Pro-Take Down, a sort of mixed martial arts, freestyle wrestling. His father recommends him to go and meet Sultan, a once upon time world champion wrestler, in order to save his business. As Amit starts to convince Sultan to enter the wrestling ring again, He comes to know about past life of Sultan. How he became champion and why he left wrestling. Sultan Ali Khan, who was once doing cable TV business, falls in love of Aarfa (Anushka Sharma). She rejects him because she wants to marry wrestler. Her rejection motivates him to become wrestler. Sultan turns into a passionate wrestler and starts winning championships. Aarfa and Sultan love story turns to married life. As pride takes over the mind of a talented Sultan, a loss of his loved one reduces his fame to ashes. In an attempt to regain his lost love and respect in the eyes of Aarfa, Sultan once again takes up a challenge - he joins Aakash to fight against the world champions and is ready to go to any lengths to regain everything he has lost. Sultan starts training under Randeep Hooda who becomes his coach and trainer. Will Sultan win Championship and gain back his pride?<br/><br/>If we talk about Performances, Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma both have given an excellent performances. Amit Sadh and Randeep Hooda have played very well supporting roles. Background score is just awesome. <br/><br/>Sultan's Music is up to mark. Sountracks are very delightful.

As Salman stated during the trailer that he is working towards, making self better and better by taking small steps. The chemistry was great with Anushka. After watching this reminded me Sonam pair in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo was such a waste for him. Anushka was natural and flawless as always. All other characters were also great in the movie.<br/><br/>Salman character as his mark in recent movies, which was innocent, truthful, pure and man of the word! Will be going to watch movie second time. I just do not understand why do media news always complain about the run time which is greater than 2.5 hrs. I enjoyed the run time did not seem like it was shorten, cut and hurried to make it less lengthy.<br/><br/>Harayana town like set-up was great, realistic and down to earth, nothing cosmetic.

","Pehlwani or Kusti is a form of wrestling from South Asia. It was developed in the Mughal Empire by combining native malla-yuddha with influences from Persian koshti pahlavani. In this film, traditional Indian Kusti meets the world of MMA(mixed martial arts).<br/><br/>Plot of film: Sultan Ali Khan (Salman Khan) falls in love with Aarfa Hussain (Anushka Sharma), a state-level wrestler and the daughter of a local wrestling coach. Although she was initially cold towards him, Aarfa accepted Sultan as a friend. When he began to proclaim that she was his girlfriend, she rejected him by stating that she wishes to marry an accomplished wrestler like herself. Determined to win her respect, Sultan dedicated himself to intense training and ultimately wins a state-level wrestling tournament, as well as Aarfa's love.<br/><br/>The two are married and became recognized wrestlers, representing India in various international tournaments like the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. When the two were announced as finalists for the Olympic Games, Aarfa discovered that she was pregnant. She gave up her childhood dream of winning an Olympic gold medal for India, which was then fulfilled by Sultan. To her surprise, Sultan's accomplishment made him arrogant, and he acted conceitedly during a press conference. Even though Aarfa informed him that she was nearing her due date, Sultan left to win another international wrestling championship.<br/><br/>Then an incident occurs that changes Sultan's life forever. You have to see the film to find out what happens. The film is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. He is well known for directing Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, and Gunday. Artur Żurawski is responsible for the excellent photography in the film, A native of the Baltic port city of Szczecin, he is a graduate of the Academy of Visual Arts in Poznań and the National Film School in Łódź. In 2014, he was the director of photography on the Indian crime thriller Mardaani, directed by Pradeep Sarkar, produced by Aditya Chopra, with Bollywood star Rani Mukerji in the leading role.<br/><br/>We have excellent music in the film Julius Packiam contributing the musical score and the duo Vishal-Shekhar handling the songs. Randeep Hooda makes an excellent short appearance in the film as Sultan's trainer. We have some real life MMA wrestlers in the film Tyron Woodley the most predominant of them.<br/><br/>Verdict: my eyes never left the screen from start to finish. I was lest thoroughly satisfied. There is a solid twist in the film which I couldn't predict. This is why I rate this film very highly. I am giving the highest rating possible because I am encouraging Bollywood to make more movies like these.

","Just exactly how I predicted it, the movie did not have even one element to offer apart from what it promised in the trailer. Sultan is as bad as it could get. Bad acting, lame story line, worst over all experience. Starting from the first scene till the last one, I was so uncomfortable in my seat due to experiencing extreme level of boredom and a series of cringe-worthy yet clichéd scenes.<br/><br/>The title is played over and over again until your ears start bleeding. While the story is about an individual who always fights for the sake of impressing his gf, later on wife and other people,the level of patriotism depicted through Indian flags all around the arenas etc. is awful. Sultan was an ego-eccentric human being who didn't give a rat's ass about his country or people but only cared about himself. So the overly-dramatized sequences while people are cheering for him with Indian flags in hands are plain terrible.<br/><br/>This movie is just like ""FAN"", both movies' trailers gave it all away and left nothing for the actual movie. If you have seen Sultan trailer than you have seen this whole movie and there is no need to waste your hard earned money on the tickets.<br/><br/>with all of that being said, I am still sure stupid and blindfolded Salman fans will make this piece of crap a super hit. Mr. Salman only concentrated on bulking up while needed a lot of attention in the acting area, specially with the language he was speaking. There was no home work on his part and it clearly looked like somebody read the dialogues to salman in Sultan's native language on the go during each scene. <br/><br/>Take my advice, skip this one.

The guy looked like a trainer who's fighting his own inner demons. 5)Found Anushka cute.<br/><br/>The cons: 1)Sallu doing park-our (running freestyle after the kites) was hilarious. It looked too fake man. Common, with that kinda weight n muscles, it's practically impossible. 2)Anuskha didn't look like a wrestler at all. The scene where she is doing pull ups, looked fake as her legs weren't shown. 3)In the second last match of the MMA, Sallu breaks his ribs n he manages to win the final bout.

","The swag of Sultan, played by Salman Khan, aka Sallu is back. Brace your seats for some hard hitting action, some nail biting but at the same time predictable finishes, and a cute love story which, sadly, is similar to Salman's real love life in this three hour long package. Get ready to join those group of film watchers, whose concept of cinema is limited to the greatness of 'Bhai'. <br/><br/>SOME MINOR SPOILERS !!<br/><br/>The story is about a legendary wrestler Sultan from a small town in Haryana, who was formerly a 'Dish TV' dealer cum kite stealer, falls for another aspiring one, Aarfa (Anushka Sharma). Eventually, he achieves success and marries Aarfa, but due to a turn of events, Aarfa leaves him. The movie shifts seven years later, when Sultan participates in a Mixed Martial Arts Tournament, before finally uniting with Aarfa. <br/><br/>The story was overall good and engaging. The plot was interesting, and most of the fighting scenes seemed professional. There were a few light moments as well, especially in the beginning. Although I would not highly rate Salman's dialogue delivery or more to say, attempts at comedy(that Haryanvi accent was way to made up) or dancing skills (hell even a guy on wheelchair can dance better), some of the action scenes were commendable and he acted well while he was serious. Anushka was as always fantastic with her bold avatar, which suited her character. Randeep and Amit supported well, especially Randeep's character, though not very important to the plot, was likable. <br/><br/>The messages conveyed through the movie were also very relevant, for example arrogance, determination, empowering women. In all, it deserves to be Salman's biggest. Apart from obvious Salman fans, I think it can be enjoyed by family (the reason being a number of themes being covered), although some late action scenes might appear disturbing and not for the faint hearted. What I felt good about this movie was its retaining of some general logical base and showing regard to reality."

","Well I generally write the reviews to express my, one to few opinions. It's sad that I would be required to write at least a few lines. Let's break them as pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros: A good movie as compared to those movies (most of them) in which salman khan has worked. Emotions were effective in reaching to public (not to me).Acting was good from entire cast.<br/><br/>Cons: Inaccurate fights among salman khan and his opposition. The biggest disappointment was a women giving up her dream for not going for Olympics. This nature contradicted with the nature that she exposed of being herself in first part of movie (which could have been portrayed well).<br/><br/>Movie still appear little unrealistic for which I don't have to address it as pro or con, as I don't mind. Good for maybe one time watch."
"TheFirstExecutioner","9","1","2","9 July 2016"," Sultan, the Indian Rocky
","Sultan stars Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma in the lead roles and is the story of a fighter who must learn how to fight again after tragedy strikes in his life. This movie, just like Bajrangi Bhaijaan last year, really surprised me. Sultan is actually a very well made and very entertaining sports drama like I've never seen before from India. It features characters who are charming and interesting. Salman Khan delivers another terrific performance as Sultan and he really sells the physicality and more importantly the emotional depth of the character. Anushka Sharma is also really good here too.<br/><br/>The movie is split evenly between two stories and I thought the first half really spent too much time setting up the romance rather that the other important events that take place. The romance is a bit cheesy and it's the type which you've seen from Bollywood before many times. But after the interval, the movie takes off and doesn't stop until its conclusion. The second half feels very much like a Rocky movie, but in India, and that was really nice to see. The fight scenes are pretty well done also, and so is the music. Another tiny problem is that the movie is very clichéd and it will end almost exactly the you would think it would.<br/><br/>Overall, Sultan is a terrific film. It's a movie that everyone in the family can watch and enjoy. There's a strong message about never giving up and it is heartwarming to watch. There are a few flaws I had in the first half but the movie then becomes really good towards the end. Definitely check out Sultan!<br/><br/>Sultan gets an A-."
"knkumarnikhil","10","1","2","9 July 2016"," just one word i.e. ATBB
","nice movie 'Sultan' has him breaking free from bondage by getting his character to crack and bleed. His down-and-out wrestler has foibles, is fallible, is human. Sultan Ali Khan has faults, and is punished for it. Because of which Sultan scores, and delivers a solid entertainer with heft.n that instant we know that Sultan is about to push twin boundaries. Of a star's scope, and of mainstream Bollywood. That this will not be the super-human, super-hero Bhai who has been shown crossing the tracks just a whisker ahead of a rushing locomotive from one of his several forgettable flicks. That this will be a Khan who has to, literally, do a lot of heavy- lifting to win the crown."
"abhishek-61149","10","1","2","8 July 2016"," BHAI as SULTAN means Business .
","Safe to say this is will be counted among Bhai's top five performances till date . His portrayal of Haryanvi ""Jat"" fighter is convincing . Anushka does not look like a ""Jatni "" wrestler but she makes up for it with her dialect . Randeep's role although small is high on impact . Amit Sadh does his job well. The lessons taught are for all to follow. The only person who can defeat you is you yourself. Wrestling is not about fighting in the ring but about the fight the daemons within. Its never too late to Start . <br/><br/>A great family entertainer with repeat watch value . Do give this a watch it will be worth your time."
"mpatil-27243","10","1","2","8 July 2016"," Sultan is fabulous display of wrestling and drama. It an entertainer but will give wrestling a nation wide acclaim.
","Sultan gives complete justice to its Gerne 'Sports Drama.' It is a rise, fall and rise of a champion wrestler. I don't know why people are rating it low. But this movie really deserves high ratings. Salman is yet again at his best and giving career hits. He does fantastically as a carefree guy, a lover, a champion wrestler, a lost person and at last the Phoenix risen from ashes. His transformation in both the halves is really a must watch. His Haryanvi accent too is good to listen. Anushka Sharma must be applauded for her character 'Aarfa.' She too shines in her dual shade role of a champion wrestler and wife. Amit Sadh also does well. Salman's friend is also nice to watch. Music is good and credit to the director. It is a perfect pack movie for all kind of cinema lovers."

","movie starts off on a high ... bounds it in the first half and all of a sudden loses the whole plot in second. movie shows the real dedication n hard work SALMAAN has put to bring out the best on his role but story gets week as the movie reaches its climax though we've seen many movies which makes you feel excited of what is about to come but since its a typical B-TOWN movie ..any day you would know Hero has the last laugh Anushka has done justice to his part n you'll be clueless for what reason they took Randeep Hooda in the movie ... comes in second half just to train Salman ..that to for 25-30 minutes ... n he's done on the whole its a family entertainer... just 6/10 +1 making it 7/10 only for the work of Salmaan"
"fillerruth","6","7","56","6 July 2016"," Not a great one but outstanding performance of Salman transformed this movie a good one......
","In my point of view right now Salman is the number one superstar of Bollywood. He has the power to sell a mediocre movie into 100 cr easily. He is a good actor but right now he is a brand more than an actor. Film producer and distributor sell his name as a brand. Which brand that need no marketing and strategy of sales. Just the put his name on the project and the project turned a profitable one. Again, I am not telling Salman is a bad actor but in this movie, the brand name surpassed his acting.<br/><br/>In recent days Salman didn't deliver us any good watchable movie except ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"". That was a masterpiece but rest of 10-12 releases didn't get the pass mark but all of them were proved commercially successful. These happened by the branding of Salman, not by the acting or story or quality of the film. I know ""Sultan"" have the same fate and will turn a huge commercially successful movie. But this time, there is a difference. The effort of Salman as a wrestler is outstanding and possibly all type of effort he has done for this role. Already I said he is a good actor and no wonder he has done a good acting but his effort of work out surpassed all the things. <br/><br/>I am not revealing the story but Just want to say you will not regret. The script is wonderfully written, acting of rest of the cast are very good. But one thing I want to say Anushka didn't do a justice for her role and sometimes her screen presence made me bored. I am not telling her recently plastic surgery went wrong but her acting was monotonous. <br/><br/>Songs are not great, editing was good, the direction was very good and surprisingly the story was not typical and you will surprise. The Screenplay was good and other technical aspects are average. But you will wonder after seeing Salman with a transformed body because a 51 years old person gave almost 100% effort to visualize the wrestler's role. Outstanding!!!! His effort made a huge boost for this movie. Thank you, Salman Bhai....You made me happy by this role and thanks again because this movie was not same by your other typical movie like ""Ek tha tiger"" or ""Prem ratan dhan payo""."
"umarabeer","7","1","4","8 July 2016"," An emotional roller-coaster!
","One of those movies where the script wasn't any where close to original. You will be easily able to make out ideas copied. Nevertheless, the cast, acting, direction and theme of the movie was superb. Not a big Salman khan fan but this one won't disappoint you as its closer to reality by even SK standard. Salman khan screen presence was phenomenal. There are numerous goose bumps moments. His journey from rags to fame was captivating albeit hastened from a directional point of view. No body in real life goes from nothing to a state champion and there too to beat a wrestler twice his weight. His journey to international fame does come at a cost of of his family life. <br/><br/>His son dies soon after birth because blood transfusion couldn't be arranged. His wife get angry because he wan't around and tries to break ties with him. He goes into isolation and depression and starts collecting alms for his son to open a blood bank. Life gets lucky for him. A guy who runs a professional body for MMA approaches him to fight for him. He agrees after a little soul search. What follows later re-defines him as a great fighter. His journey to excellence is accompanied with moments of soul searching and self encouragement."
"oazam","7","1","5","8 July 2016"," Dramatic sports drama with a good punch
","I was very enthralled by the genre and the story of this film. Salman Khan delivers his role extremely well as a Haryana Wrestler. Anushka Sharma's role as Aarfa was brilliantly well performed, so I give my hats off to her. Although Randeep Hooda's role was a cameo appearance, he also performed really well as a trainer. The cinematography of the movie was executed very well and was shot very realistically. The movie did have some minor problems such as the pacing in the sense that it was 2 hours and 50 minutes long. Songs were being played every couple of minutes which did take up almost half of the movie. Vishal-Shekhar deliver good songs but for this movie, it did fall flat except for Jag Ghoomeya. But overall, Salman packed quite a punch for this movie and this is a surely a family-fun entertainer. It is filled with motivation, laughter, encouragement, drama, and intriguing romance. This is surely Ali Abbas Zafar's best work so far in terms of direction and screenplay/story during his career as a director. Salman Khan sure made eid a joy for his fans. A must watch"

"ashprofessionalways","9","0","1","3 January 2017"," An heartland tale of love and redemption
","With his back facing us, he struts out of the dark alley to the ring like a celestial being, little streaks of sunlight pouring from the shafts above in quantity just enough to fashion the contours of his silhouette with gold dust as the chant in the background goes-""Khoon mein tere Mitti, Mitti mein tera Khoon; Upar Allah, Neeche Dharti; Beech mein tera Junoon"". The crowds in the movie become delirious as Sultan makes a grand entrance,as the crowd in the theatre goes berserk at the first sight of Salman. Salman's playing his favourite alter ego- that of a man child with a magnetic charm for the infinite time to the same effect; this time he's called Sultan.<br/><br/>A quintessential Bhai movie is nothing but an elaborate vanity exercise comprising of-catchy numbers, quirky signature steps and fourth wall breaking sequences with iconic lines when Bhai is done breaking some bones. Sultan does all this and much more. It gives us a protagonist who is not saddled with the task of catering to the legion of fans of the star alone. He is a fallible person, who crumbles under the impact of defeat. He is an illiterate who knows to handle the rejection of a woman with dignity. He is a desi wrestler who's Ko move is punctuated with an obeisance.Sultan manages the hitherto unmanageable feat of trespassing beyond the ""Salman"" persona to an unchartered territory called acting, that Bajrangi Bhaijaan almost managed to do.<br/><br/>The road to redemption is staged on screen in an invigorating fashion through the subtle deployment of a few processes as metaphorical devices . Insulted by the woman he loves for the dearth of purpose in his life, he embarks on a journey of self discovery .He starts off with a clear-face shakily,tilling a field singlehandedly to chasing beside a local train. The train zooms past him and there's a lot left to plow in the field. As he makes progress; he's grown a thick stubble now. He almost manages to match the train and the field has significantly been cleared; his limits stretched. By the end of his metamorphosis- the stubble has turned a marked moustache; he races past the train with the field burning ready for cultivation. A new man is born.<br/><br/>There is this point in the movie where a worn out Sultan, past his prime is trying to stage a comeback. He takes his shirt off before the mirror.What he sees is an image of a man who is not just out of shape, but buried beneath the debris of despair and defeat. He implodes with anguish as even his shirt wouldn't peacefully let him sneak in to it. It is one of the rare occasions where our hearts go out in unison for this man, overlooking the star portraying him. Sedentary at soul, he is this lackadaisical individual who wakes up to his potential after instigation. For success has often been his retaliation to instigation- a recurring motif in his life. If Aarfa instigated him with her insult to turn him into a world renown wrestler earlier, a coach now calls him a dead person from the ringside while he gets beaten to pulp, trying to resurrect his carrier in a new form after a sabbatical. Phat comes the killer move - as if in response - as he lays still his opponent.He springs out of the ring defiantly to tell this man, verbally now that he might have quit wrestling, but never stopped fighting.<br/><br/>The romance isn't a gratuitous embellishment to ratify song sequences. It constitutes the very heart and soul of the movie.It gives us his love interest Aarfa, an ambitious-strong woman, an Adrian to his Rocky(just that she's is a wrestler much before he wanted to be one.) She just isn't there as his prosaic arm candy, but insinuates the necessary friction in his life from time to time. There's a beautiful trait she exhibits every time when Sultan makes progress towards something great; she turns away from the happening solicitously. She doesn't want to spectate, but rather participate vicariously in his travails moment by moment. She does this when he enrols as a green horn wrestler to take part in a state level championship. She does this while coaching kids with her back facing the TV playing his MMA matches.<br/><br/>These finer aspects go on to enhance the relatability of the larger than life proceedings, the stuff that we seldom expect out of a Salman starrer. There is this scene where he watches his wedding night's video after dinner in isolation. As the shot segues from the video to his room, he's fallen asleep watching himself fall asleep in the video. We get to know that the nostalgia held in the video is his lullaby. For once the sight of Bhai is not just the excuse to wolf whistle alone, but a calming influence."

","Sultan movie is basically based on the story of a wrestler who fought in the Olympics and got medals for the India. It can be said as a good movie not the best movie. It can be seen only one time. There is a mixture of comedy and action and drama in this movie. But sometimes some scene are boring that make people to get sleep. It only has good songs that makes it best movie but the story is not too much interesting that will inspire you to watch movie. The title song is the best song the sound, composition, lyrics all these are best in this song. The whole movie is based on the wrestling. But the aim of Salman in this movie is the best that he is trying to open a blood bank in his village."

","Sultan is a good example of classical wrestling movie but if you are a person who regularly watches UFC.<br/><br/>The movie is not going to be comfortable to watch.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very bad and it feels like that other fighters wanted to get hit by sultan.<br/><br/>The movie is fun for people who do not know anything about fighting and if you happen to be person who can spot the difference between a real fight and a monkey then it is not going waste your precious time, it is going to destroy your precious time and also money.I am still waiting for the time when Bollywood will start making movies like creed or southpaw."
